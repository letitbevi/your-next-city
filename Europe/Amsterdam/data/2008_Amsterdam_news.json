While we all know that it would be better not to fly at all, the reality is that many people will continue to do so until we&apos;re prohibited by cost or legislation.  Part of the Tread lightly ethos is about being able to still live your life while being more aware of the consequences our actions have on the environment, so this pledge is about still being able to have a holiday but choosing not to fly as far for it.  Next week we&apos;ll be calculating how much carbon you could save if you did travel to short-haul destinations by train, but after this week&apos;s latest rail fiasco, taking the train instead is not always the best option ... In this week&apos;s pledge, the options are taking a flight to northern Europe or the Mediterranean instead of a long-haul destination like India, Sydney or the United States. We&apos;re also trying to listen to the feedback that we&apos;ve been getting from Tread lightly community users, so that those who feel strongly about this issue can opt to choose not to take a long-haul holiday flight at all. Our calculations are based on the emissions for various long and short-haul flights.  For northern Europe, we have calculated that instead of flying to Miami (the average amount of emissions for long-haul flights), which would generate 2.01 tonnes of carbon emissions, a flight to Amsterdam instead would generate 0.12 tonnes. Broken down into the weekly units that Tread lightly uses to calculate its graphs, this would mean that each person was saving 36kg. Likewise, a pledge to fly to Greece in the Mediterranean would generate 0.53 tonnes of carbon, compared to Miami&apos;s 2.01 tonnes, saving 28kg a week. Avoiding one long-haul flight altogether would save 2.5 tonnes, or 48kg a week for 2007.  So what do you think? Is agreeing to one less flight enough? Is it up to us to be more responsible, or should business and the government be regulating who flies and where?", "sentences": ["For northern Europe, we have calculated that instead of flying to Miami (the average amount of emissions for long-haul flights), which would generate 2.01 tonnes of carbon emissions, a flight to Amsterdam instead would generate 0.12 tonnes."], "title": "Tread lightly: If you must fly, make it less long-haul", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/jan/04/ifyoumustflymakeitlessl", "tags": ["Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Carbon footprints", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Greenhouse gas emissions"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-04T00:01:02Z", "article": "Happy new year, and thanks for your suggestions over the holiday, when I would have quite understood if you&apos;d had something else you&apos;d have rather been doing.

This is Wim Wenders&apos; black-and-white 1974 film, whose cerebral, confident strangeness looks even more distinctive than ever. R\u00fcdiger Vogler plays Philip, a writer and journalist driving across the United States, having evidently been commissioned to write a long piece of reportage, summoning up the soul of America from the standpoint of a sharp-eyed, sceptical European. But as Philip drifts around from motel to motel - and Wenders&apos; movie really does look as if it has been composed on the spot - he is blocked. Something in America has defeated him as a writer and all he can do is take numb, alienated photos with a prototype Polaroid camera. It is only on deciding to return to Europe that he finds he can write again, and he intends to return in the company of a young woman and her small daughter Alice who he&apos;s simply picked up at the airport. But enigmatically, the woman disappears just before departure and leaves Philip in charge of Alice on the plane, with a plea that the pair should meet up with her in Amsterdam. In 2007, when the danger to children is so paramount in culture, all this seems utterly astonishing, and yet Wenders&apos; film and his jaded protagonist simply go with the flow - and the flow is in a historically regressive direction, from America back to Old Europe. Philip and Alice drift through Germany on an unlikely quest to find Alice&apos;s grandmother. Philip doesn&apos;t obviously get into trouble; neither one learns life lessons in the modern Hollywood style; they don&apos;t appear to learn much about each other or themselves, and they don&apos;t go on much of a &quot;journey&quot; in the reality-TV-contestant style. All that happens is that the psychological weather progressively lightens; Philips finds himself writing again and the film concludes with a thrilling scene of elation: a feeling of exhilaration and freedom on board a train. It is an intriguing movie that lives in the mind for hours after the lights have come up.", "sentences": ["But enigmatically, the woman disappears just before departure and leaves Philip in charge of Alice on the plane, with a plea that the pair should meet up with her in Amsterdam."], "title": "Alice in the Cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/04/worldcinema.drama2", "tags": ["Film", "World cinema", "Drama", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-04T23:47:54Z", "article": "The claim by Privacy International (Britain rated worst in Europe for protecting privacy, December 31) that there are risks in storing information on big databases are nonsense. Having spent the last eight years implementing such systems for several Fortune 500 companies, storing information on big databases only becomes risky if those commissioning the systems do not have a complete understanding, authority and control as to how those systems will be designed and handled. Unfortunately, civil servants and members of quangos, who frequently manage and operate such projects, lack the experience necessary. This became painfully obvious when a single individual could actually download millions of records on to two CDs. In a decent commercial setting, this would have been impossible due to restrictions on the system and training in data security. At a minimum, civil servants now need the basic training in data handling and security that is provided in the corporate sector. An example could be taken from one of my clients, a major oil company, which insists that all internal and external staff take an exam on data security within four weeks of joining the company. The cost of not having these systems is a return to paper-based government. This would involve more civil servants on the pay roll - and of course that means higher taxes and a slower service.

IT, January 3). If your card details are skimmed at a petrol station and used fraudulently, you&apos;re faced with the difficult task of proving that you didn&apos;t enter your pin and never revealed it to anyone else. However, there is an alternative for credit card users - get a chip-and-signature card. All the banks can issue them to anyone, although they like to pretend they&apos;re limited to disabled customers. Every transaction is signed for, on paper, and there&apos;s no pin for fraudsters to steal. If a transaction is disputed, it&apos;s for the merchant to produce a signed slip showing that the customer did authorise the transaction, not for the customer to prove that he didn&apos;t.

Butler plays the perfect boyfriend here. Admittedly he dies, but before he does so, he leaves a trail of letters and instructions to help his grieving ex (Swank) start a new life. Thus, Swank goes through a series of chick-flick adventures instigated from beyond the grave - fishing in Ireland, karaoke, new men. This is clearly not comfortable territory for Swank, but then the light blend of slapstick and schmaltz is not all that comfortable for the viewer either.

As with Gobadi&apos;s previous films, it&apos;s an accomplished exercise in magic realism, obliquely political but with Emir Kusturica-like moments of fantasy and wonder - such as a village populated by 1,334 exiled female singers.

After Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, another courageous, unpredictable move from Ang Lee. This is a sensual spy thriller set in occupied 1930s/40s Shanghai, but one that doesn&apos;t shy away from the sex. Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s the type of sex critics complain you never see in movies: realistic, unsanitised and revealing about the characters, which makes this respectable viewing rather than seedy art porn. It&apos;s mostly a slow, stylised affair following an inexperienced resistance member (newcomer Tang Wei) on her mission to seduce a powerful Chinese collaborator (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). Inevitably, she develops feelings for him and compromises the plan. The pace is really too languorous to qualify this as a thriller, but there&apos;s plenty going on beneath the surface, or occasionally, in the bedroom scenes, right out in the open.

But I&apos;d say my eyes, I&apos;m very protective over them and I have a strange relationship with them. My eyelashes turn inwards against my eyes and I sometimes find it hard having eye contact with people. Do you remember the first time?  The first time I ever did comedy was almost like a dare. I was an actress and went up to do stand-up because someone thought I could do it. And then onstage I thought &quot;ooh, I like this&quot;. Another first is that I&apos;m apparently the first black female to get her own comedy show. In a way that&apos;s wonderful. But I don&apos;t know if it is an achievement, or who it&apos;s an achievement for. It&apos;s quite bad that someone&apos;s making history like that as late as 2006. And it&apos;s almost the last thing I think about when doing the show. It&apos;s just got to be funny. And airbrushed! When will I be famous?  I get recognised a bit in certain places, like Hackney or Soho. Sometimes people ask me to perform a character but a lot of the time I&apos;ll just do it anyway, even if they haven&apos;t asked.

The jobs I&apos;ve taken in the past I&apos;ve taken because it will feed me emotionally or spiritually, not for the money. I hate thinking &quot;why did you say yes to that job?&quot;. In theatre, I&apos;ve always taken the work I&apos;ve loved. But with stand-up I&apos;ve taken jobs where I&apos;d just tour but I didn&apos;t even know where I was touring. I wouldn&apos;t know if I was in South Africa or Amsterdam. I&apos;d meet people at the airport and think &quot;oh, that&apos;s where we are, I thought I was still in Europe!&quot; I&apos;d think I was going away for four days, and it&apos;d turn out to be three weeks. I just thought that&apos;s what you did as a comedian. So I did a world tour without actually signing up for it. Do you know the way to San Jose?  Oh god. No! No, I never went there. I don&apos;t know my way to many places. If someone looks lost and wants to ask me directions, I pick up my pace and pretend to speak to someone on my phone. Who do you think you are?  I&apos;m a cartoon character trapped in a human body. Who let the dogs out?

Having been rewritten for films, plays and TV dramas, the story of the Jewish girl hiding out with her family in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam has never before been made as a musical. The Anne Frank Foundation, which jealously guards the rights to the diary - it once turned down Steven Spielberg when he wanted to make a film - has given its support. Jan Erik Dubbelman said: &quot;This production respects the message of tolerance, within the tragedy, that we want to keep alive. Being in Spanish, it can also help to take the message of Anne Frank to Latin America.&quot; The Spanish theatre group behind the musical has visited the tiny flat where Frank hid from the Nazis, seeking inspiration for their characters and performing some of the songs for members of the foundation. Isabella Castillo, a 13-year-old born in Cuba who has been chosen for the lead role, said she had been moved by the visit: &quot;If you&apos;re doing a musical of the family and how they lived and the house and everything, I think it&apos;s very special, and a very important detail, to come to this house.&quot; Frank wrote the diary while she and her family hid in a secret annexe behind a bookcase in a canal-side warehouse. For 25 months, she wrote down her experiences as a teenager - her love-hate relationship with her parents, spats with schoolfriends, crushes on film stars - while in the background the war raged outside. The family was betrayed and arrested in August 1944 and Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945. Her father Otto was the only one to survive, and returned to Amsterdam after the war, where he discovered that her diary had been saved. First published in Dutch in 1947, it went on to be translated into 60 languages and has sold more than 25m copies worldwide. Rafael Alvero, who developed the musical project, said it was the culmination of a decade&apos;s efforts to gain the confidence of the foundation. He said the show would be inspirational, comparing Frank&apos;s life story to a tragic opera. &quot;When I first came here they [the foundation] had this doubt, about how somebody can do a musical of a story like this,&quot; said Alvero. &quot;The thing we want to do is ... through the music, to understand the story better,&quot; he said. Once the foundation had given its permission, the hunt for actors capable of mixing the sombre nature of the material with the high energy of a musical began. Castillo said she felt honoured to be playing such an important role, and that there were things the two had in common. The Franks moved from Germany to Holland in 1933, when Anne was four.

Sylvia de Esteban, Isabella Castillo, Alberto Vasquez and Rocio Leon perform at Anne Frank House in Amsterdam last week. Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP Is it just me? Or do you too find something a bit grisly about the idea of a musical based on the Diary of Anne Frank? Opening in Madrid next month, it will tell the familiar story of the Jewish girl hiding from the Nazis in an Amsterdam attic. The show has the backing of the Anne Frank Foundation. The 13-year-old lead, Isabella Castillo, also has personal experience of living in hiding as a Cuban refugee. But the musical, as a form, demands uplift. And, however moving the story of Anne Frank&apos;s inner life, it is one that ends tragically. You could, of course, see the show as part of theatre&apos;s attempt to come to terms with the Holocaust. In one way, given our society&apos;s tendency to historical amnesia, that is admirable. No one who saw Antony Sher&apos;s Primo, based on Primo Levi&apos;s classic If This is a Man, could fail to be moved by it. Plays such as Martin Sherman&apos;s Bent and Peter Flannery&apos;s Singer have also, with varying degrees of success, put the concentration camps on stage. But a musical about the Third Reich? Cabaret got away with it by focusing on the apolitical escapism of a heroine indifferent to Nazi brutality. Mel Brooks&apos; The Producers effectively satirised a bad-taste culture that delighted in Springtime for Hitler. But the Anne Frank story has a documentary truth that hardly cries out for the melodic embellishments of music. This surely is the point. Anne Frank&apos;s diary exists as a record of a young girl&apos;s thoughts and feelings. Even the play based upon it, according to Kenneth Tynan when he saw it in New York in the 1950s, &quot;smacked of exploitation&quot;. And a musical will surely take us even further from the world of raw truth. This is a vital aesthetic question raised by David Hare in Via Dolorosa. Visiting Yad Vashem, the museum of the Holocaust, Hare was struck by the thought that the paintings and sculptures on view seemed superfluous when one was confronted by the matchless horror of fact. When I later raised the issue with Harold Pinter of whether art could ever encompass the Holocaust, he cited the poetry of Paul Celan and Nelly Sachs. But again one comes back to the simple fact that music, with its strong sensory and emotional appeal, would seem to run counter to the reality of Anne Frank&apos;s plight. We may, of course, be confounded. The Spanish musical may have its own stark integrity. Isabella Castillo may have an inbuilt poignancy. But the dangers of tampering with Anne Frank&apos;s diary and transforming it into theatre are illustrated by a legendary Broadway story. When the play was revived in New York some years back its lead actress, Pia Zadora, was frankly not adequate in the title role. So poor was she that one exasperated theatregoer, when the Nazi troops finally invaded the Frank family&apos;s hiding place, allegedly cried out: &quot;She&apos;s in the attic!&quot; It may seem a frivolous story in the circumstances, but it illustrates all too clearly the dangers inherent in turning a young girl&apos;s diary into a stage entertainment.

It will allow the criminal prosecution of men who use prostitutes and give the power to communities affected by prostitution to declare themselves &quot;zones of safety&quot; where action against punters can be initiated. The bill will be debated on January 9. The way in which prostitution is tackled now and has been through most of history is by targeting the women selling sex. It doesn&apos;t work. Prostitution exists because of the demand from men. Making paying for sex illegal will begin to tackle the demand. The amendment will permit local authorities, or the police, to make areas of towns into zones of safety. All that would be needed would be demand from residents or evidence that prostitution has contributed to an increase in crime in the area. The people who live in areas which have become red light districts often find they cannot end the degradation of their environment which ensues, with women being harassed by men on the streets or in cars, people finding condoms or drug paraphernalia on the streets and alleys throughout the day, with the added dangers of theft and mugging. The local authority or the police, with the authority of the secretary of state for communities, can then designate that area as a zone of safety. When the area is made a zone of safety there will be notices making this clear. Then if a man is found paying for sex in that area, he can be arrested and the police or the local authority can apply to a magistrates&apos; court for an order against him. The order would bar him from doing so again. He would get an order, similar to an asbo, to forbid him from buying sex. If he did so again, anywhere in the country, and was traced, he would have committed a criminal offence and could be fined or given a community punishment. Thus a man found buying sex would not immediately be criminalised but would receive a stern warning and would know that he risked a conviction. In Sweden there is no penalty at all for the women and I think there is a strong case for moving to that approach. They recognise that prostitution is a product of sexual inequality. I agree but we have not had the decades of feminist-led debate in this country on this subject which Sweden had. I have not copied the Swedish approach exactly: any purchaser of sexual services can be prosecuted, of whatever gender. When a human being is bought it is the buyer who is doing the wrong thing and who needs to be stopped. In many societies there are people who will sell themselves or their organs because they are desperate, but it is generally the buyers who are prosecuted rather than the victims. The same should occur when the purchaser is buying the right to use them sexually. Just as residents often feel they have no choice or control over what is happening around them, most of the women who sell themselves have little or no choice. A shockingly large number have been trafficked for sexual exploitation and are effectively slaves, others have been groomed into the &quot;profession&quot; as teenagers by pimps who control their lives. Most are addicted to drugs. Policy should not target them for criminal action, but should help them rebuild their lives. The people who have the most choice are the men. And good quality international research shows that policies which seek to control the actions of men can work. Sweden reports a dramatic reduction in trafficking since it changed the law to make men who buy sex criminals. There is now a growing trend in Europe to impose bans as a way to combat sexual trafficking. Even states which have traditionally had a permissive approach to prostitution are reining back. The Amsterdam local authority is taking action to close a third of the windows where women sell themselves, and the street tolerance zone has been dropped. They have learnt that these policies increase sex tourism, people-trafficking and criminality. Opponents of this approach claim New Zealand&apos;s decision to legalise prostitution offers a better model. I do not accept it as a good comparison. New Zealand is too far away from the main markets for sex traffickers to generate profits in the way they can in Britain. As a small country, where people know each other well, there are strong social forces that protect prostituted women from the violence that is all too often their fate in Britain. Unfortunately, we are more like Holland where legalisation led to a massive growth in criminality, trafficking and violence associated with the sex trade.", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam local authority is taking action to close a third of the windows where women sell themselves, and the street tolerance zone has been dropped."], "title": "Buyers beware", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/08/buyersbeware", "tags": ["Society", "Human rights", "Prostitution"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-08T12:23:32Z", "article": "Football is full of forgotten men, but few are quite so forgotten as Stefan Kovacs, who came only fourth - behind Mircea Lucescu, Anghel Iordanescu and Laszlo Boloni - in a recent poll asking Romanians who they thought was their greatest manager of all time. Perhaps it is only natural that when people speak of total football they should remember its progenitors, Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff, but it was Kovacs who led Ajax to two of the hat-trick of European Cups they won between 1971 and 1973. When Michels left for Barcelona, Ajax drew up a list of 15 names to replace him. They ended up with the cheapest. Kovacs had led Steaua Bucharest to a league title and three Romanian Cups in the previous four years and as a player had had a brief spell with the Belgian side Charleroi, but he was far from well-known in the Netherlands and his arrival was greeted with a mixture of bewilderment and scepticism. Even he could not quite believe his luck and, it is said, bought a return ticket from Bucharest to Amsterdam because he didn&apos;t think his stay would be a long one. &quot;How do you like the length of our hair?&quot; one player is supposed to have asked at Kovacs&apos;s first training session, seeing a soft target after the stringent days of Michels. &quot;I&apos;ve been employed as a coach, not a hairdresser,&quot; Kovacs replied. A few minutes later, as he stood on the touchline, a ball fizzed towards him at knee-height. In one movement, he trapped and returned it. The technical test was passed, but the questions about his temperament would never go away. &quot;Kovacs was a good coach,&quot; the midfielder Gerrie M\u00fchren told David Winner in Brilliant Orange, &quot;but he was too nice. Michels was more professional. He was very strict, with everyone on the same level. In the first year with Kovacs we played even better because we were good players who had been given freedom. But after that the discipline went and it was all over. We didn&apos;t have the same spirit. We could have been champions of Europe for ever if we&apos;d stayed together.&quot; Well, perhaps. Or perhaps the side&apos;s eventual disintegration was simply built into its emotional make-up. It is easy to see familiarity breeding discontent, particularly given the unusually confrontational atmosphere of the Ajax dressing room. Others, anyway, believed the slackening of the reins was necessary after the rigours of Michels. &quot;The players were fed up with the hardness and discipline of Michels,&quot; the forward Jonny Rep insisted. The pattern is not uncommon. The England cricket team - at least initially - thrived under the more relaxed Michael Vaughan having been made hard to beat by the niggardly Nasser Hussain; Liverpool enjoyed their greatest period of success after the avuncular Bob Paisley had replaced the far harsher Bill Shankly. Ajax almost certainly produced their most eye-catching football under Kovacs, and yet he seems never quite to have convinced. In April 1972, shortly after a goalless draw away to Benfica had confirmed their progress to the European Cup final, Ajax&apos;s board members held an emergency meeting and decided to fire him. At the time, Ajax were five points clear in the league, had just hammered Feyenoord 5-1 in Rotterdam and had reached the Dutch Cup final. The sense, though, was that beating the Portuguese champions 1-0 over two legs was somehow not worthy of Ajax, and there were continual rumours of ill-discipline, with the assistant coach Han Grijzenhout and the club doctor John Rollink suggesting to the board that Kovacs had lost control. If he had, though, the players evidently enjoyed the freedom. They rebelled, and Kovacs stayed. &quot;The results show that Kovacs was not wrong,&quot; Cruyff said. &quot;Our team was ready to take part in making decisions.&quot; They may not have impressed in the semi-final against Benfica, but the 2-0 victory over Internazionale in the final, with Cruyff getting both goals, confirmed the superiority of their method, and hammered yet another nail into the coffin of old-school catenaccio. The following year, by winning the European Cup again, Ajax became the first side since Real Madrid to complete a hat-trick of titles. Appropriately, having hammered Bayern Munich 4-0 in the quarter-final, it was Real Madrid whom Ajax beat in the semi. The aggregate score of 3-1 barely does justice to their superiority, and the tie is better remembered for M\u00fchren&apos;s keepie-ups in the second leg at the Bernab\u00e9u, a moment of arrogance and joie de vivre that encapsulated the ethos of Kovacs&apos;s Ajax. &quot;It was the moment when Ajax and Real Madrid changed positions,&quot; said M\u00fchren. &quot;Before then it was always the big Real Madrid and the little Ajax. When they saw me doing that, the balance changed.&quot; He gave them freedom, but Kovacs certainly was not a patsy for player power. He was close to Cruyff, but he wasn&apos;t cowed by him. On one occasion, it is said, when Cruyff complained of pains in his knee before a game, Kovacs, knowing his captain&apos;s reputation for loving money, took a 1,000-guilder note and rubbed the afflicted area. With a smile Cruyff agreed he was feeling better, and played without any ill effect. He was not, though, tough enough. Where a ruthlessness lay beneath Paisley&apos;s shabby cardigan, it seems probable that Kovacs was too nice, lacking the steel to rein in Cruyff as he took on an increasing prominence in that second season. Rep accuses Kovacs of &quot;not having the guts&quot; to promote him in place of Sjaak Swart until Cruyff gave his approbation, and the players in time came to resent Cruyff&apos;s influence. Kovacs left after that second European Cup success to become manager of France, and when his replacement George Knobel held a vote on whom the club captain should be in the 1973-74 season, Cruyff was deposed in favour of Piet Keizer. Cruyff played only two more games for Ajax before joining Barcelona. The team rapidly disintegrated, and Knobel was sacked in 1974, shortly after a newspaper interview in which he accused his players of drinking and womanising - what many saw as the licence of the Kovacs days taken too far. His subsequent career never approached the same heights. He managed just one win in the qualifying competition for the 1976 European championship and was replaced by Michel Hidalgo, and although a subsequent spell with Romania saw him take them to the brink of qualification for the 1982 World Cup, it ended shamefully as the Communist authorities - ludicrously - accused him of throwing a game against Hungary. &quot;We must accept,&quot; the veteran Romanian coach Florin Halagian said, &quot;that Ajax was his opera. It was one of the greatest football has known.&quot; By giving that squad the freedom to reach its peak, though, Kovacs also paved the way for its destruction.", "sentences": ["Even he could not quite believe his luck and, it is said, bought a return ticket from Bucharest to Amsterdam because he didn&apos;t think his stay would be a long one."], "title": "Football: the man who took Ajax to new heights and the brink of destruction", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jan/08/europeanfootball.ajax", "tags": ["Football", "European club football", "Sport", "Ajax"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-08T23:54:27Z", "article": "World&apos;s tallest nation may have stopped growing The Dutch seem to have stopped growing, says a central bureau for statistics study published yesterday.

In a keynote speech to the London School of Economics, the minister will urge Eurosceptics to consider the EU &quot;as it actually is, rather than some fear it might be&quot;. Murphy&apos;s comments come as the government prepares for a bloody battle to get a new treaty - seen by some as a replica of the failed EU constitution - through parliament. The minister believes the Tory leader, David Cameron, is playing &quot;fast and loose&quot; with the national interest by suggesting a Conservative government might hold a referendum on the treaty after ratification. Murphy is expected to say tonight: &quot;As one of my predecessors put it, the UK would become a sort of &apos;Norway with nukes&apos;. &quot;There are many anti-Europeans - or Tories for short - who think this is a good option for the UK.

What might this entail? &quot;It would help if we considered the EU as it actually is, rather than some fear it might be. &quot;If its detractors desist from bestowing it with apparently satanical powers - a &apos;coup d&apos;\u00e9tat&apos; or a &apos;papist conspiracy&apos;, as one letter I received this week described the EU - or likening it to the threat from Nazi Germany.&quot; Focusing on what the EU has achieved over the past 50 years, Murphy will say: &quot;It has helped make our continent a more peaceful, more prosperous and better place. &quot;It requires each of us to admit what our ambitions for Europe are, and if for some people they include pulling Britain out of the EU, they should say so and say what the alternative is. &quot;And if we believe, as I do, that the UK&apos;s position must remain at the heart of Europe, then we must say so. &quot;It&apos;s not just about words either, it means not adopting policies which would inevitably mean, if put into practice, detaching Britain from the mainstream of Europe.&quot; Murphy will argue that, without the EU, Britain would be poorer as a trading nation, less influential in the world and less safe. &quot;We rely heavy on membership of the EU single market of 480 million consumers,&quot; he is expected to say. &quot;More than 3m British jobs ... and 60% of our trade would be directly affected. Foreign direct investment would also be hit. &quot;Nor would we get any regional funding from the EU (which totalled \u00a310bn between 2000 and 2006).&quot; Murphy will say that, as a medium-sized country with a successful economy and professional military forces, Britain without the EU would still have influence but it would be throwing away the added clout it gets from coordinating with European partners on international policy priorities such as international development, Kosovo and Burma.

Its foray into a new market is named after the treaty liberalising transatlantic air travel that comes into force in three months&apos; time. BA said today it will take advantage of the ensuing free-for-all in June by launching a subsidiary that will fly daily from New York to Paris and Brussels. However, the venture is not the all-business class carrier anticipated by many, and its single Boeing 757 aircraft will adhere to the convention of three separate cabins for passengers. The seating layout will favour premium passengers nonetheless, with 24 flat bed seats in business class, 28 premium economy seats and 30 economy seats. Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said the new venture would build on the ailrine&apos;s well-known brand in the US and Europe. He added: &quot;By naming the airline OpenSkies, we&apos;re celebrating the first major step in 60 years towards a liberalised US/EU aviation market which means we can fly between any US and EU destination. It also signals our determination to lobby for further liberalisation in this market when talks between the EU and US take place later this year.&quot; Virgin Atlantic, which has shelved plans to launch its own all-business class carrier, was quick to criticise the BA venture. Paul Charles, the airline&apos;s director of communications, said: &quot;It is clearly different from what they planned and it has no permission to fly into New York&apos;s JFK airport. BA will have to give up current services so it can fly into JFK.&quot; The US government is planning to restrict JFK flights following a year of delays and mounting criticism of the state of civil aviation infrastructure in the US. BA could consider New Jersey&apos;s Newark airport as an alternative hub for OpenSkies. Speaking this afternoon Walsh said BA had decided at an early stage that an all-business class carrier woud not be sustainable outside Heathrow. He added that OpenSkies would &quot;complement rather than compete&quot; with Heathrow&apos;s services. Walsh said he expected OpenSkies to operate from six more routes by 2009, including possible services from Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Milan. The pilots&apos; union, Balpa, reiterated concerns that the venture will emply crew on less lucrative financial terms than those offered to BA pilots. Jim McAuslan, general secretary of Balpa, said: &quot;Balpa welcomes BA&apos;s decision to innovate and establish a wholly owned subsidiary company to take advantage of the new open skies agreement between the USA and EU but we have issues with BA on how the new service should be structured. Having worked so hard to secure success for BA, Its pilots do not want to see its brand or its safety record put at risk.&quot; The new airline will open up a new competitive front in the transatlantic market, with US operators including Continental and Delta planning to operate UK-to-US flights from BA&apos;s Heathrow base.

The first Purple Hotel opened in Braintree, Essex, shortly before Christmas and another nine locations open their doors on 2 February.  &apos;The market is polarising - hotels are either destinations in their own right or they are going low-cost,&apos; said Michael Prager, chief executive of the Real Hotel Company, which owns Purple Hotels. &apos;The budget airlines have pioneered the way, and people like Travelodge and Premier Inn have done a good job of cutting costs, but we want to bring style, comfort and fun to the equation, too.&apos; The launch is just part of a wider trend. According to Mintel, the budget market is growing three times faster than the overall hotel market, and leading brands plan to build 75,000 new budget rooms by the end of the decade. &apos;Budget airlines have got people used to good value and multiple trips, so they don&apos;t want to waste money on hotels, particularly if they&apos;re on a city break, where they are rushing around and only going back to the hotel to sleep,&apos; said Richard Cope, Mintel&apos;s senior travel analyst. &apos;The tightening economy will make business travellers look for cheaper options, and so fuel growth still further.&apos; Purple Hotels will typically charge \u00a355-\u00a385 a room outside London, for which guests will get &apos;a really good room, a really good breakfast, and not much else&apos;.

The body hadn&apos;t yet been covered with a sheet. People were walking in her blood, leaving footprints everywhere. Saviano got talking to a boy in the crowd. Though not even Saviano&apos;s family knew it at the time, he was researching a book on the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia. The boy offered to take him to a pizzeria to meet some &quot;baby soldiers&quot; of the Di Lauro clan, then split by the war in the Secondigliano district that had just cost Attrice her life. &quot;They were awkward and ungainly, their sweaters puffed out from the bulletproof vests underneath,&quot; he writes in the book. &quot;Boyish faces, 13 to 16 years old, a few with the first hints of a beard.&quot; Earlier, Saviano had met another boy nicknamed &quot;Kit Kat&quot; (because of his appetite for the confectionery). &quot;Kit Kat assumed the attitude of a little boss, but I let him see I was sceptical. He got fed up answering my questions, so he lifted his sweater. His entire torso was speckled with round bruises: violet circles with yellow and greenish clots of crushed capillaries in the centres.&quot; They were the marks left by bullets that Kit Kat&apos;s bulletproof vest had stopped in a kind of training exercise. &quot;When you&apos;re hit, you fall to the ground, you can&apos;t breathe, you gasp for air, but you can&apos;t inhale,&quot; Kit Kat told him. &quot;You feel like you&apos;re dying ... but then you get back up. That&apos;s the important thing. After you&apos;ve been hit, you get back up.&quot; Every so often, when reading Saviano&apos;s book, Gomorrah: Italy&apos;s Other Mafia, published in Britain this Friday, you have to pause, and remember he is writing not about some war-torn African territory or former communist state, but about life in a big city in a rich nation in western Europe; a founder-member of the European Union; a favourite destination for low-cost flyers, and a country whose affairs are increasingly - and, Saviano suggests, dangerously - bound up with ours. As we sit in a Rome cafe, he describes his compulsion to get as near as possible to a phenomenon that conditions the lives of millions of people, like him, born in or around Naples. Saviano&apos;s raw, obsessive hatred of the Camorra&apos;s leaders is never far from the surface. The key, as he readily agrees, lies in his own family history. In a passage in the book that at first seems a digression, he recalls his father taking him to a deserted beach as a boy to teach him to shoot. &quot;If you don&apos;t scare anyone, if nobody feels uneasy looking at you, well then, in the end, you haven&apos;t really succeeded,&quot; he quotes his father as saying. It is a perfect summary of the values that underpin the grip of organised crime on macho southern Italian society. But then, as Saviano records, his father had been given a terrible lesson in what happens to those who defy its logic. As a young doctor, he was in charge of an ambulance crew that took an 18-year-old Camorra victim to hospital. That broke the rules. If the mob failed to kill someone, the accepted response was to wait for the arrival of the police, who could assume responsibility for sending him or her to hospital. Either that, or wait for the Camorra to come back and finish the job. &quot;That night the killers who hadn&apos;t hit their target dead on went to his house. My father, I believe, was beaten bloody and didn&apos;t show his face for at least two months.&quot; After studying philosophy at university Saviano worked as an assistant to a photographer specialising in mob weddings. He befriended a Camorra &quot;welfare officer&quot; and accompanied him as he doled out monthly cheques to the spouses of imprisoned mobsters. He let himself in to the pretentiously ornate villa of a jailed don. &quot;I just wanted to understand,&quot; he says repeatedly during our interview. The result is a memorable, in-your-face portrayal of organised crime that has earned the 28-year-old Saviano sales of almost a million books - and round-the-clock police protection. As we speak, plainclothes Carabinieri officers stand outside in the street in the line of fire to our table. &quot;If I had sold 10,000, they wouldn&apos;t have cared,&quot; says Saviano, whose plight has been compared with that of Salman Rushdie or the child actors in the movie version of Khaled Hosseini&apos;s book, the Kite Runner. &quot;But it&apos;s not like Iran or Afghanistan,&quot; he says. &quot;The Camorra doesn&apos;t try to stop you writing or speaking. But they do worry about large numbers of others hearing or reading you.&quot; The outstanding novelty of his book is its illustration of how the Camorra - unlike the more famous Sicilian mafia, which operates as a more insular network - has embraced globalisation. According to Saviano, the port of Naples is now the main route into the EU for dodgy goods from the far east. &quot;These days, the merchandise unloaded in Naples is almost exclusively Chinese - 1.6m tonnes annually. Registered merchandise, that is. At least another million tonnes pass through without leaving a trace. According to the Italian Customs Agency, 60% of the goods arriving in Naples escape official customs inspection, 20% of the bills of entry go unchecked and 50,000 shipments are contraband.&quot; He cites a 2004 inquiry into the overseas links of just one alliance of Camorra clans in the same Secondigliano district that was to be torn apart by gang warfare. Their speciality is counterfeit fashion. &quot;In Germany, they had stores and warehouses in Hamburg, Dortmund and Frankfurt, and in Berlin there were two shops. In Spain they were in Barcelona and Madrid, in Portugal in Oporto and Boavista. They had a jacket shop in London and stores in Dublin, Amsterdam, Finland, Denmark, Sarajevo and Belgrade. &quot;The Secondigliano clans also crossed the Atlantic, investing in Canada, the United States, even in South America ... millions of jeans were sold in shops in New York, Miami Beach, New Jersey and Chicago. &quot;A boutique in Five Dock, New South Wales, became one of Australia&apos;s hottest addresses for elegant clothing, and ... they&apos;d been investing in Saudi Arabia and North Africa for a while.&quot; To give readers a concrete example of the Camorra&apos;s penetration, he turned to somewhere less exotic - Aberdeen - and the investments of a clan from Mondragone, a coastal town north of Naples. The brother of its reputed &quot;godfather&quot;, who took British citizenship, was arrested in Aberdeen and, in 2006, extradited to Italy. &quot;Today, the mafia is more important in [the rest of] Europe than in Italy,&quot; says Saviano, who is appalled that countries such as Britain have yet to pass laws making mafia membership an offence. He is equally dismayed by British libel laws, which can prevent a mafia boss being identified as such. The Italian version of his book alleges that the Camorra has recruited a Scottish mobster, now jailed, whom he names. &quot;This British Camorrista receives a stipend from Mondragone every month, Christmas bonus included,&quot; he writes. But, because of the libel risk, the man&apos;s name has been removed from the British edition. Camorra bosses can be cosmopolitan, even cultured. Yet most remain profoundly traditional in their outlook. Saviano describes one who adored the works of Sir Walter Scott and named a son Ivanhoe; another who quoted Lacan. There are bosses who collect contemporary art and antique furniture. Saviano tells me of one who hired two Sorbonne-educated mathematicians to maximise his investment returns. &quot;Yet the same bosses that buy, say, Polish government bonds want their sons to marry virgins,&quot; he says. There is something of Solzhenitsyn in Saviano&apos;s reckless defiance of his oppressors. When he sidled into the absent godfather&apos;s villa, he not only urinated into the man&apos;s huge bath but described in his book how much better this made him feel. I ask Saviano if he ever regretted his choice of career, fully expecting a defiant &quot;no&quot;. Instead, he says: &quot;I admit that, at times, I do. Many a morning, I&apos;ve woken up regretting it.&quot; The effect on his family has been hard to cope with. His brother has left to live in another part of Italy. His mother, a teacher, has considered doing the same. Her son recounts with a bitter smile how her neighbours in Casal di Principe, where Saviano grew up, organised a petition to the council asking for her to be given &quot;safer accommodation&quot;. He, meanwhile, has been given added protection after an incident when he went to a trial as part of the research for his next book. One of the defendants said to him: &quot;Remember me to Father Peppino.&quot; Father Peppino Diana - as every Neapolitan well knows - was the anti-mafia parish priest of Casal di Principe, who was murdered in his own church in 1994.", "sentences": ["They had a jacket shop in London and stores in Dublin, Amsterdam, Finland, Denmark, Sarajevo and Belgrade."], "title": "John Hooper talks to Roberto Saviano about his reckless defiance of the mafia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/14/italy.crimebooks", "tags": ["Italy", "Crime fiction", "World news", "Books", "Mafia", "Culture", "Organised crime", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-17T09:07:55Z", "article": "Yesterday evening a nautical drama was being played out between seven ships deep in the heaving, wild and normally extremely lonely Southern Ocean on the edge of Antarctica. The Nisshin Maru, a large Japanese whaling factory ship, was steaming due south at 15 knots in heavy seas with a crew of 80 and with the carcasses of possibly 50 whales aboard.  Two miles behind it, in full sight but not in radio contact, was the Esperanza, a Greenpeace vessel converted from a Russian navy fire-fighting ship with a volunteer crew of 21 nationalities and a Dutch captain. The Esperanza is well equipped, as you would expect from a large and well-resourced operation with more than 200,000 members, but it looks tiny beside the vast whaling vessel. Steaming towards both ships, and due to meet them in possibly a day or two among the icebergs and the fogs, is the MV Steve Irwin, the black-painted flagship of Captain Paul Watson and the California-based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the world&apos;s most uncompromising environmental enforcement group. His crew is smaller, but - like that of the Esperanza - made up of brilliant and committed seamen. Discipline is everything at sea and both sets of volunteers, male and female and drawn from just about every country, respond magnificently to the challenge and the danger. Yesterday afternoon the MV Steve Irwin was 60S 78E, roughly 2,500 miles south-west of Fremantle in Australia, pursuing a group of four small whaling ships that the Japanese are this year using to kill nearly 1,000 whales in the Antarctic whale sanctuary. This little taskforce is thought to be heading towards an as yet unknown rendezvous with both the Nisshin Maru and a supply vessel to offload any whales they may have harpooned and pick up stores. But the chase is in particular earnest because one of these smaller whalers, the Yusshin Maru No 2, has already clashed with the Irwin and is now running from it with two of the Sea Shepherd boat&apos;s crew. In an act of extraordinary courage - or stupidity - Giles Lane from Brighton and Benjamin Potts from Australia leapt aboard the Yusshin Maru No 2 from the Irwin to deliver a letter to the Japanese captain requesting him to leave the whale sanctuary. The Japanese, not believing their luck, promptly held them captive and sped over the horizon. Now there is an international diplomatic incident, with the Japanese saying they will only hand them back if Sea Shepherd agrees to certain demands, and Watson saying this is &quot;an illegal act of hostage-taking&quot;. &quot;Using hostages to make demands is the hallmark of terrorism and Sea Shepherd has no interest in negotiating with terrorist groups,&quot; said the man who has himself been called a terrorist many times by the Japanese.  Either way, the drama is reaching its climax. It is likely that in the next 48 hours all seven ships will meet in icy seas and there will ensue a dangerous sea battle the like of which has not been seen since - well, the last time all these characters met in the Antarctic, almost a year ago.  Then, there was an international incident and very nearly several disasters. Over a period of more than a week, acid and mud, as well as water cannons and nail guns, were used. There were collisions, shouting matches and three distress flares had to be launched - first by Sea Shepherd when one of its dinghies got separated and its crew was stranded on an ice floe, then by one of the Japanese ships when it was rammed by the Sea Shepherd ship the Robert Hunter, and lastly by the Nisshin Maru again when it caught fire and one man died (it has since been completely refurbished). As is customary at sea, everyone left off fighting each other to help those in distress.  This time, the environmentalists are aware they could be sailing in to a carefully laid trap set by the Japanese fleet, which is clearly intending to regroup and draw in its hunters. Little else would explain the tactics of the mothership which, having sailed 800 miles north out of the whaling grounds, has now turned round and is steaming back at full speed, possibly to draw Greenpeace away from the whalers and to leave their ship dangerously low on fuel.  &quot;Anything could happen&quot;, said Greenpeace&apos;s Dave Walsh, on board the Esperanza last night. &quot;We do not know what we are going down to, or what will happen.&quot; In Watson&apos;s view the Japanese are now &quot;acting irrationally&quot; and potentially dangerously. &quot;Something&apos;s definitely going to happen,&quot; he said by satellite phone yesterday. &quot;Two years ago, we chased the whalers for 3,000km along this remote Antarctic coast. We will continue to pursue them for as long as it takes. The oceans are being pillaged and destroyed and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is the only organisation out on the high seas trying to do something about it.&quot; As Watson&apos;s remarks show, there is far more at stake than a chase. Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace might both be pursuing the same whaling ships, but at play in the southern ocean are large egos, corporate pride, old jealousies, intense rivalries, distrust and fundamental differences of opinion about the environment, protest and confrontation. While the crews undoubtedly have deep respect for each other in such dangerous conditions, they are in official or semi-official conflict.  I have sailed with both Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd, and the two organisations are as different as chalk and cheese. The tactics they use are different. Sea Shepherd thinks nothing of chucking acid, stink bombs, urine or even chocolate cake at its adversaries. It will try to foul ships by putting ropes round their propellers and, led by Watson, the crew has crept on to its enemies&apos; boats at night and opened the stopcocks to sink them. Greenpeace&apos;s main tactic is to put itself between the whales and the whalers, or in the paths of survey ships - not safe, but highly effective. Its rule is non-violent direct action.  The real difference, though, is in the captains. Greenpeace has used many, but Sea Shepherd is synonymous with Watson, a veritable force of nature. His seamanship is legendary and his commitment to the marine environment complete - to the point where he now holds the human world in contempt.  Recently he was described in the New Yorker as a Captain Nemo figure: &quot;Nemo understood that it did not matter what humans think because humanity was the problem. Nemo had no use for society&apos;s rules, morality and judgments. His duty was to save life in the sea from the greed of mankind. I understand that philosophy and I have lived it every day of my adult life,&quot; he said.  It sounds - and is - extreme, but in person Watson is one of the best companions imaginable, eager to talk about everything from religion to philosophy. He quotes films, reads widely, writes poetry and books, laughs a lot, and teaches ecology and ethics at Californian universities. He is what he would call a &quot;biocentrist&quot;, someone who believes that the life of a whale or any other wild animal is of equal value to that of a human. He describes himself as a &quot;humble fanatic&quot;, who deeply loves the freedom of the seas and the solitude, and whose greatest pleasure is to &quot;swim at night alone in the deep, living oceans&quot;. On board, though, he runs his ship like a dictator. When I sailed with him, the crew lived in awe of a man who accepted no &quot;consensus shit&quot;, abided no drugs or &quot;friggin&apos; in the riggin&apos;&quot;, took no advice, and gave no clues to his plans. He told me he acted by a martial code culled from the methods of ancient eastern and modern western warfare and expected to die for his cause.  Crucially, Watson co-founded both Greenpeace and Greenpeace International, but almost immediately he proved far too much for the organisation. Greenpeace now has a vast membership and a growing image of establishment semi-respectability; its leaders hobnob with prime ministers, oil magnates and Saudi princes. It is impossible to imagine Watson doing such a thing. Even in 1969, when the organisation was founded, Watson was recognised by everyone as a handful. &quot;He was a great warrior brother, yet in terms of the Greenpeace gestalt he seemed possessed by too powerful a drive, too unrelenting a desire to push himself front and centre, shouldering everyone else aside,&quot; said his great friend Robert Hunter. Watson sailed with Greenpeace many times, and skippered one of its boats in 1972. But he severed all links with the organisation in 1977, after being expelled from the Greenpeace board. He set up Sea Shepherd in 1981; today, it has 45,000 members, mostly in the US, and is supported by green stars such as Mick Jagger, Sean Penn, Orlando Bloom and Martin Sheen. Watson is proud of the written endorsement given to him by the Dalai Lama. Last year, he summed up his feelings about Greenpeace: &quot;There is lots of money in saving whales if you invest the money into direct mail campaigns, television and internet advertising. That is where Greenpeace funding primarily is directed - towards raising more funds in order to pay the wages and the operating expenses of what has become one of the largest feelgood organisations in the world.  &quot;Let&apos;s face it, Greenpeace has become the generic environmental organisation and people feel when they join Greenpeace that they are part of the solution and not part of the problem. This is somewhat similar to when Pope Rodrigo Borgia once promised heaven to large donors to the church. It&apos;s now special ecological dispensation.&quot; Watson calls himself an enforcer, and Greenpeace &quot;the Avon ladies of the environment&quot;, interested mostly in publicity and &quot;bearing witness&quot;.  Greenpeace refuses to be drawn. The organisation has consistently said it does not comment on Sea Shepherd&apos;s tactics or the often inflammatory and always colourful language that Watson uses about them. But this week the largest environment group in the world lost a lot of friends and some respect when, having skilfully found the Japanese fleet in more than 1m square miles of ocean, refused to share the information with Sea Shepherd. &quot;It&apos;s operational policy,&quot; Greenpeace explains. &quot;We just do not do it. There&apos;s no favouritism. They offered them to us last year and we declined.&quot; But the lack of help was leaped upon by Watson, who fired off an email to the Guardian. &quot;Peter Hammarstedt, the second officer of the Steve Irwin, called the Esperanza to speak with the captain but was informed that the captain was sleeping and was not to be disturbed. Mr Hammarstedt spoke with Karli Thomas, the Greenpeace expedition leader, and congratulated her on finding the Japanese fleet and said that, since Sea Shepherd gave Greenpeace the coordinates last year, would they repay the favour and provide Sea Shepherd with the coordinates this year? Ms Thomas replied that, as expedition leader, she did not have the authority to release that information, nor did the captain of the Esperanza.&quot; In the end, Greenpeace did come to the rescue, but not as expected. &quot;We have our sources in Greenpeace - there are quite a few disgruntled Greenpeacers who are opposed to the policy of non-cooperation. They are being very helpful,&quot; says Watson, who is thought to have been tipped off about his rival&apos;s position by someone in Greenpeace International&apos;s head office in Amsterdam.  Right now there is a paper-thin truce, with both organisations saying that they are working towards a common objective - the shutting down of illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean - but it is sure to be only temporary.  Yesterday, Greenpeace were coy, but keen not to be seen as wusses. &quot;We&apos;re not working together in any way. We have our interpretation [of direct action] and they have theirs, and we stick to ours,&quot;, said a spokesperson. &quot;We are a confrontational organisation. We will put ourselves at risk, but no one else. We would never place sailors on other ships in jeopardy. Our argument is not with the guys on the ships; our beef is with the [Japanese] ministries&quot;. Watson is far more personal. &quot;We are obsessed with stopping the cetacean Death Star, that vicious, cruel killing machine otherwise known as the Nisshin Maru, and her fleet of boats armed with explosive harpoons. We know that if we kill the whales, the sharks, the seals and the sea turtles, we will destroy the very foundation of life in the oceans,&quot; he says.  &quot;The Japanese whalers are a disgrace to civilised society and the government of Japan should be ashamed of its subsidies and support for these bloody-minded cetacean serial killers. The Japanese are targeting endangered whales in a whale sanctuary in blatant violation of a global moratorium.&quot;  But it is not long before he gets back to the other battle: &quot;We encourage Greenpeace to be aggressive and wish them well in this high-seas drama. Sea Shepherd is preparing for the grand finale. I&apos;m counting on Greenpeace - I&apos;m hoping they can block some harpoons and harass them enough until we can arrive to shut the criminals down.&quot; Quite what he means by &quot;shut them down&quot; is not clear. In the past he has scuttled several whaling ships and rammed others. &quot;We did not come to protest. This is an international policing act. We do not intend to hurt anyone,&quot; he says. But is he prepared to ram or even attempt to sink the Japanese? &quot;The circumstances will dictate. Our objective is to stop all whaling,&quot; he says.  Both Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace know they will inevitably meet in the Antarctic regularly, and fall out with each other constantly. But meanwhile, there have been no whales killed in the Southern Ocean in the past six days.  &quot;We are 30 miles south of the Yusshin Maru No 2, 700 miles from Greenpeace and the factory ship,&quot; said Watson from the bridge of the Irwin yesterday. &quot;We are chasing three boats. The skies are clear and the sea is calm. As Sherlock Holmes would have said to Dr Watson, the game is afoot.

The incident at Fifteen Cornwall - which usually buys only organic eggs - came to light after a party of farmers and battery egg producers asked to see what they were eating during a visit to the restaurant last Friday. They realised they had been served eggs from battery hens after a chef brought them a tray to inspect from the kitchen. Oliver, who is one of the most high-profile figures in the campaign to wean Britain off its taste for cheap, battery-reared chickens and eggs, was said to be &quot;clearly pissed off&quot; by the news. To compound the embarrassment, the mix-up occurred while Jamie&apos;s Fowl Dinners - Oliver&apos;s impassioned plea for the country to rethink its attitude to poultry - was aired on Channel 4. The chef is a trustee of the Fifteen Foundation charity, which runs four restaurants, including the Cornish restaurant in Watergate Bay, to train disadvantaged youngsters to become chefs. &quot;It was a cock-up; we pride ourselves on knowing where everything comes from,&quot; said Dave Meneer, the restaurant&apos;s chief executive. He said the restaurant had run out of eggs from its usual free range supplier, Clarence Court in Liskeard, over the new year. Someone had then ordered eggs from &quot;the wrong place&quot;. Meneer added: &quot;[The customers] saw two eggs in a tray, remarked they were battery eggs, and a young chef gave them one. We were pretty open about it; it was a mistake.&quot; Despite initial reports that &quot;heads would roll&quot; at the restaurant, Meneer said the episode was unlikely to result in any sackings. &quot;I&apos;ve read the riot act to a couple of people here,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;We are running a very successful restaurant - there are 100 people in for lunch today - which is run by a cracking team. I could go firing a couple of people, but would I finish up with a better restaurant? Would that guarantee that this never happens again? Not in my experience and I&apos;m not minded to do that.&quot; A spokeswoman for Clarence Court said the company had supplied Fifteen Cornwall since May 2006 and had never been late with a delivery. She added: &quot;If Fifteen Cornwall exceeded its Clarence Court order and needed to source free range eggs elsewhere our stockists include Sainsbury&apos;s Plymouth, Sainsbury&apos;s Bodmin, Sainsbury&apos;s Truro, Waitrose Saltash and Asda Bodmin, who are open 24 hours.&quot; Meneer said the restaurant&apos;s sister branches - in London, Amsterdam and Melbourne - were also &quot;very careful&quot; about their suppliers. A spokeswoman for Fifteen London confirmed that its eggs were also supplied by Clarence Court and said a close eye was kept on all ethical and organic produce. &quot;We were reviewed recently, saying that we were fanatical about sourcing and I think that&apos;s true,&quot; she said. &quot;On the food side, our standards are excellent.&quot; She added that the company was &quot;looking at&quot; its merchandise products, such as T-shirts and bags, to make sure that they came from fair trade suppliers and were made from sustainable materials.

The resulting catchment would equal London in population, providing the kind of scale in commercial and cultural terms that could compete with any major world city. The idea is to provide the basis for achieving this not by filling the space between the three cities with buildings, but to improve train and bus services: connectivity not merely propinquity is the key. All three city centres lie within 35 miles of each other (about the diameter of London) and yet, as Creative Sheffield&apos;s director Ian Bromley pointed out, it takes an hour to get from Manchester to Sheffield whereas it takes only 20 minutes to get from Reading to the centre of London, the same distance. It is an excellent idea, which by creating a second UK centre on an international scale - at present London and the south-east absorb far too much of the UK&apos;s economic and cultural oxygen - would be of overall benefit not just to the region but the entire country. Perhaps what should be further suggested is moving parliament and the major ministerial headquarters to the Sheffield-Manchester-Leeds area too. The idea of moving the capital has been debated before, most recently and notably in Prospect magazine, and the benefits are manifold: such a move would lessen the crushing burden London experiences by having absolutely everything in it (think property prices, congestion, schools, health services, transport), while serving as a major boost for the Sheffield-Manchester-Leeds hub and therefore the country generally. Successive governments have moved departments and parts of departments to the regions for commendable reasons; communications technology makes physical distance an irrelevance for many administrative purposes. But parliament and main ministries still need a habitation, and senior officials and ministers have to sit together to discuss. By doing this in London they drag in lobbyists, the press, embassies, and much else that would have to disperse at least part of their activities to a new capital, involving investment there while providing relief to the crumbling London infrastructure. Many stand to gain much by such a change. It is interesting to observe that whereas a single world city in a country has a distorting effect, as in the UK and France, in countries where there are two or more centres that can each claim international status for at least one of the three standard reasons (economic, political or cultural), many benefits flow. Think Washington, New York, Los Angeles; Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong; Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay; Moscow, St Petersburg; Berlin, Frankfurt; Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague; Glasgow, Edinburgh; Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne - other examples come readily to mind. They all follow the multi-centre model to their benefit. London and Paris, by contrast, are national obesities that make everything roll uncomfortably in upon them by virtue of the dent they make. If we were to consider getting behind Creative Sheffield&apos;s very good idea, the result might be an even more creative UK.", "sentences": ["Think Washington, New York, Los Angeles; Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong; Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay; Moscow, St Petersburg; Berlin, Frankfurt; Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague; Glasgow, Edinburgh; Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne - other examples come readily to mind."], "title": "Northern exposure", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/18/northernexposure", "tags": ["London", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-18T11:50:59Z", "article": "Liam Black, the charismatic social entrepreneur and director of TV chef Jamie Oliver&apos;s Fifteen Foundation, which is famous for training and employing socially excluded youths as chefs, has quit to develop a new business project. Black has run the foundation, a registered charity which oversees four restaurants bearing the Fifteen brand in London, Cornwall, Amsterdam and Melbourne, for three and a half years.

Now I&apos;m an independent contractor, it can be quite expensive to find good health insurance,&quot; Brooke Taylor explains, as she waits in her workplace lounge a few miles east of the Nevada state capital of Carson City for a new client to arrive. &quot;He&apos;s for bringing the troops home. Those are my peers. I want them home. These men and women are experiencing things nobody should have to. I like what he has to say about education.&quot; Brooke - along with the owner of the company she works for and several of her colleagues - has begun campaigning for Texas congressman Ron Paul, the maverick libertarian Republican presidential candidate. They have even been offering two-for-one specials to clients who go onto their computer, access Paul&apos;s website and donate money. And if Paul wasn&apos;t running? Well, then Taylor, who has a degree in music therapy and whose best friend is a political science graduate, would revert to her usual pattern - voting Democrat, hopefully, she says, for Obama. Brooke&apos;s colleague, Max, disagrees. She&apos;s a Hillary Clinton supporter, hoping that if she made it to the White House the Bill Clinton magic would return. Why doesn&apos;t she like Bush? I ask, on a day the stock market has fallen by 300 points. &quot;The economy. My income was drastically different seven or eight years ago. People are much more aware of what they&apos;re spending, and what they not going to spend now.&quot; Just your everyday political discussion in the run-up to the Nevada caucus this Saturday. Except for the fact that Brooke, Max, and the dozens of other young women milling around the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, at the end of a road with a historical marker for the old Pony Express and a ramshackle car repair shop, in various degrees of lingerie are prostitutes. They are working in an upscale brothel in the only state in the union with legalized prostitution. The Bunny Ranch&apos;s owner, Dennis Hof, has - to the embarrassment of Ron Paul - been touting his support for the congressman for a few months now. Above the lounge fireplace is a sign (photographed above): &quot;We pound for Paul&quot;. Just inside the entrance is another pithy banner: &quot;Pimpin&apos; for Paul&quot;. For decades, the Republicans have cobbled together a somewhat improbable national electoral majority, based in large part on a marriage of convenience between libertarian-minded, live-and-let-live westerners in states like Nevada, and Southern fundamentalists. Reagan worked the coalition to perfection; Bush used it to eke out two narrow election victories. In the current election cycle, however, with growing national unhappiness over Bush&apos;s tenure, that coalition seems to be breaking down. While Ron Paul isn&apos;t going to go anywhere, even in a quirky state like Nevada, for a Republican candidate to take the White House in November they are going to have to be able to woo voters in Nevada - who support legalized prostitution, forty-plus percent of whom voted to legalize marijuana in 2006, high numbers of whom identify themselves not as Republicans but as libertarians, and many of whom rely on the gambling industry for their livelihoods - as well as deeply conservative evangelical voters in states like South Carolina. With the stock market tanking, the housing market at a standstill - one in 60 home in Nevada is under foreclosure - inflation clawing away at Americans&apos; real income, tens of millions lacking health insurance and too many not being able to feed their families without the aid of food banks and churches, fewer voters are willing to give the fundamentalist-libertarian coalition the benefit of the doubt. From conservatives there&apos;s anger because all the scapegoating, all the deflected rage, hasn&apos;t actually worked. We&apos;ve gotten tough on addicts and terrorists and welfare cheats, we&apos;re getting tough on illegals, and yet we&apos;re still in a mess. The answers Kansans looked for, as written about in by Thomas Frank, in What&apos;s the Matter With Kansas? haven&apos;t panned out. A GOP administration that promised endless tax cuts and funded wars and pork barrel spending and kick-backs to favored companies based on the notion America could endlessly borrow and run trade deficits like no other country with no negative consequences, has run aground against basic economic realities. From progressives, there&apos;s some hope amid the rising gloom because, like in 1932, the economic hurt, the bursting of bubbles, is opening up room for new liberal voices to emerge; there&apos;s room for a radical reinvention of the social contract, the creation of a better, fairer system. Until recently, I feared the GOP just might be able to pull a rabbit out of a hat and eke out a presidential victory in November. With the current economic data, I&apos;m betting that&apos;s not going to happen. Like in 1992, &quot;it&apos;s the economy stupid.&quot; Except the economic legacy of this Bush is worse than that of his father. That new social compact will ultimately be a creature of the American West - not of Dennis Hof&apos;s weird vision, but of a West that has a live-and-let-live attitude on social issues combined with a progressive approach to the environment, to healthcare, to the minimum wage and other big-picture economic issues. It will give much power to the states and cities to create experimental policies around expanded health care, environmental clean-up, anti-global warming strategies, and ways of integrating millions of illegal immigrants into the broader society, but it will be backed up by a more regulation-minded federal system. Even if the Republicans, however implausibly, manage to reinvent themselves as economic saviors for the downtrodden, for the millions who have lost their homes and the tens of millions who can&apos;t access medical care and rely on charities to feed their families, they still won&apos;t be able to win much of the West. The glue binding religious conservatives has lost its force - the GOP caucus-goers in Iowa who handed Huckabee his victory, the Bible-thumpers of the South who have voted Republican since the Democrats embraced civil rights back in the 1960s - to the socially libertarian but economically conservative voters who have voted Republican in states like Nevada in almost every presidential election since the Goldwater campaign in 1964 has lost its stickiness. That&apos;s why there&apos;s no clear GOP frontrunner. The various parts of the alliance are vying for supremacy, and none of them are powerful enough to enforce allegiance from the others. On Saturday, South Carolina and Nevada both vote. They are as culturally distinct as, say, Amsterdam and rural Poland. Of course, Dennis Hof and his &quot;girls&quot; aren&apos;t representative of Nevada as a whole; but there is widespread tolerance for institutions such as Hof&apos;s, and there is widespread distaste for in-your-face morals politics of the sort that has come to define much of the Republican Party in recent years. South Carolina, by contrast, is solidly evangelical, the conservative edge of its politics laced with the legacy of segregation, the &quot;morals&quot; issues of abortion, pornography, gay marriage and so on always high up in voters&apos; concerns. Squaring this particular circle, winning Nevada as well as the South, might just prove one trick too hard for the Republican candidates to pull off.

Whether it was a question of thrift, or a natural reluctance on Mr Coaker&apos;s part to re-enact highlights from Lord Longford&apos;s Scandinavian excursion, the Swedish researches were completed in a day, which must barely have left time for the minister and his team, including Vera Baird and Barbara Follett, to &apos;cooee&apos; up a few brothel stairs and reach the conclusion that, although some Swedish people think the scheme has worked, other Swedish people think not. The next stop on the comparative prostitution tour will, I understand, be the Netherlands, where some people think it&apos;s enlightened to have women eye-catchingly displayed as wares in shop windows, but other people don&apos;t. After that, the itinerary is unclear, though it seems unlikely the ministers will get as far as New Zealand: a pity since the islands are currently advertised by pro-legalisers as sex-trade heaven, even better than Amsterdam, where accredited sex operatives now take genuine pride in their work and clients, too, are an example to all, their connoisseurship finally liberated from those doubts which, to judge by the statistics, still deter a number of British men from trying the wide range of reasonably priced goods on offer. So long as stocks last. Coaker is on the case, Harriet Harman wants to penalise &apos;the demand side&apos; and Denis MacShane has tabled a suitable amendment to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, with the result that websites usually preoccupied with punters&apos; boasts and hints, are now home to agonised speculation about the effects of this triple attack. Would respectable brothels be affected by criminalisation? they wonder. Lap dancing? Strippers? Even their little bit of porn? Many agree that they, personally, would not pay for sex with a person like Harriet &apos;Hormone&apos;, not if she begged them, a point they would make yet more devastatingly - and with their real names on! - were it not for the stifling conventions of their hobby. &apos;Due to its essentially clandestine nature, opposition from people who are prepared to stand up and be counted is going to be somewhat thin on the ground,&apos; writes one sex-trade martyr, adding primly: &apos;Paying for sexual services is not an admission you would want to make public to your family, friends or work colleagues, is it?&apos; No? What a mercy then, that the punters&apos; case has now been advanced by some prominent figures. In these pages, Henry Porter condemned the introduction of a law that would &apos;attack a choice made by two consenting adults&apos;, and in the Times, David Aaronovitch declared himself to be, after intense internal struggle, absolutely unable to see what was bad about prostitution. &apos;Search my conscience as hard as I can,&apos; he wrote, &apos;I cannot think of anything in principle wrong with a man or a woman choosing to pay for sexual contact or to charge for it.&apos; And if, in reality, men and women bought and sold sex in roughly equal numbers, with neither group economically superior to the other, and no question of one half of the bargain acting under duress or abject necessity, there may, indeed, be nothing obviously wrong with the transaction. If prostitution, or &apos;sex work&apos; as Aaronovitch calls it, could also be divorced from substance abuse and violence, from pimping and criminality, perhaps it could, eventually, cease looking like a widespread expression of contempt for women and become, as he suggests, a respectable alternative to cleaning for a living. If this argument prevails, and Coaker&apos;s team plump for the legalised New Zealand model, there is no reason why we should not, before long, see sex work hailed in schools as an attractive option for less academic, diploma-style pupils, subsequently blamed for the awful shortage of reliable domestics and, in the not so distant future (the regulatory bodies having sorted out health and safety, a sensible fee structure and an ombudsman for the queues of dissatisfied customers) see it regularly mentioned in Christmas round robins from the parents of suitably qualified daughters: &apos;Glad to say we&apos;ve finally regained the spare bedroom after Cordelia used it for sex work all through her gap year and - aside from the unsocial hours and a couple of broken bones - claims to have thoroughly enjoyed the experience!&apos;For prostitution enthusiasts invariably have a friend of a friend who can vouch for the fact that your truly professional working girls do differ from cleaners in one important respect: far from being reluctant, they just can&apos;t get enough of it. The rest of us have only to picture Billie Piper as Belle de Jour, Fanny Hill in her corset, cheeky streetwalkers with a joke for everyone and ask, as the Ukip Euro MP Godfrey Bloom did, if men aren&apos;t the real victims of insatiable, yet calculating, female appetite: &apos;Outside of sex trafficking, it seems to me that it&apos;s the women exploiting the men.&apos; Absolutely: outside sex trafficking. If the public needed educating about sex trafficking (let&apos;s hope they are better at spotting it than punters), it seems clear that emphasis on the especial vileness of this sector has helped convince regular sex-buyers and their sympathisers that, if this imported evil could be purged from sex commerce, we would be left with a domestic trade so wholesome as to be virtually organic. In a fascinating new study of men who buy sex, conducted for charity Toynbee Hall&apos;s Safe Exit initiative, one man described his habit as &apos;just like going to Tesco&apos;. That would be the Tesco where two-thirds of female workers have been subjected to violence, around 90 per cent are addicts and a distressing number regularly get themselves murdered. Researchers concluded that &apos;legality contributes to normalisation, which in turn increases the likelihood of paying for sex&apos;. Conversely, as the Swedes are reportedly discovering, illegality contributes to non-normalisation, which in turn decreases - though it will never eliminate - the likelihood of paying for sex. Wouldn&apos;t that be a good thing? At least 150 years after Victorian philanthropists began to accept that most prostitutes are victims of circumstance, as opposed to agents of raging lust, and four decades since feminists started talking about objectification, to have to explain why the sex trade is inconsistent with human dignity feels rather like pointing out that slavery is a bit unfair on the slave. Where to begin? In Ipswich Crown Court, perhaps, where Steve Wright is on trial for murdering five women who worked as prostitutes. Each woman met the definition of &apos;consenting adult&apos;, albeit a slightly built, drug-dependent consenting adult, with no means, drugged or not, of defending herself from an aggressor. And each woman appears to have concealed what she did from her family. Strange, considering the job&apos;s no more compromising, for women who like that kind of thing, than going out cleaning.", "sentences": ["The next stop on the comparative prostitution tour will, I understand, be the Netherlands, where some people think it&apos;s enlightened to have women eye-catchingly displayed as wares in shop windows, but other people don&apos;t.

Cabinet ministers and officials, fearing a repetition of the crisis sparked by the publication of cartoons of Muhammad in a Danish newspaper two years ago, have held a series of crisis meetings and ordered counter-terrorist services to draw up security plans. Dutch nationals overseas have been asked to register with their embassies and local mayors in the Netherlands have been put on standby. Geert Wilders, one of nine members of the extremist PVV (Freedom) party in the 150-seat Dutch lower house, has promised that his film will be broadcast - on television or on the internet - whatever the pressure may be. It will, he claims, reveal the Koran as &apos;source of inspiration for intolerance, murder and terror&apos;. Dutch diplomats are already trying to pre-empt international reaction. &apos;It is difficult to anticipate the content of the film, but freedom of expression doesn&apos;t mean the right to offend,&apos; said Maxime Verhagen, the Foreign Minister, who was in Madrid to attend the Alliance of Civilisations, an international forum aimed at reducing tensions between the Islamic world and the West. In Amsterdam, Rotterdam and other towns with large Muslim populations, imams say they have needed to &apos;calm down&apos; growing anger in their communities. Government officials hope that no mainstream media organisation will agree to show the film, although one publicly funded channel, Nova, initially agreed before pulling out. &apos;A broadcast on a public channel could imply that the government supported the project,&apos; said an Interior Ministry spokesman. Demonstrations are also expected from those opposed to Wilders beyond Holland&apos;s Muslim community - a number of left-wing activists have already been arrested - and from his supporters. Members of a group calling itself Stop Islamisation of Europe are planning to travel to Amsterdam. &apos;Geert Wilders is an elected politician who has made a film, and that he is under armed guard as a result is absolutely outrageous,&apos; said Stephen Gash, a UK-based member, yesterday. &apos;It is all about free speech.&apos; In November 2004, anger and violence followed the stabbing and shooting by a young Dutch man of Moroccan parentage of the controversial film-maker Theo Van Gogh, a distant relative of the artist. The attacker said the killing was in response to a film about Islam and domestic violence that Van Gogh had made with the Somalian-born activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, then an MP, which showed images of naked veiled women with lines from the Koran projected over them. From her self-imposed exile in Washington, Hirsi Ali last week criticised the new film as &apos;provocation&apos; and called on the major Dutch political parties to restart a debate on immigration that has split Dutch society in recent years, rather than leave the field to extremists. Wilders announced his plans last November, saying he was making a film to show the violent and fascist elements of the Muslim faith. The maverick politician&apos;s remarks about Islam have become increasingly radical. In February last year he said that if Muslims wanted to stay in the Netherlands, they should tear out half of the Koran and throw it away. In parliament he then called for the Koran and Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf to be banned, a proposal that was rejected. Job Cohen, the left-wing mayor of Amsterdam, echoed Hirsi Ali&apos;s words and called for a debate &apos;so that the moderates can make themselves heard&apos;. During a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg last week, Ahmad Badr al-Din Hassoun, the Grand Mufti of Syria, said that, were Wilders was seen to tear up or burn a Koran in his film, &apos;this will simply mean he is inciting wars and bloodshed ...

In an increasingly familiar scenario, the sandbags, mops, wellies and canoes have been out over the past week, as parts of Britain dealt with another spate of torrential rain, burst riverbanks and flash flooding. The outlook is for more of the same. Last month, a government panel ranked flooding alongside terrorism in terms of national threat, and advocated extreme measures. And it&apos;s not just a British problem. Last year saw catastrophic floods across the world: in Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Mexico - even Australia. So what are we doing about it? Thus far, Britain seems to be in denial. In the Thames Gateway alone, there are plans to build 250,000 new homes, 91% of which are within the floodplain. And despite their vulnerability, it looks as though they will be built just like ordinary houses. At a recent conference on the future of the Thames, Eric Sorensen, chief executive of the Thames Gateway London Partnership, had this cheering prophecy: &quot;There will be at some stage a massive catastrophic event that will finally goad us into doing something.&quot; His advice? &quot;Everybody should get a boat.&quot; Civilisation has always flourished near he water, and communities have found ways of overcoming fluctuations in water levels - but making architecture that is flood-proof is a different matter. If, as seems to be the case, we are facing a drastically more aquatic landscape, we should be looking for solutions, not boats - and the best place to start is the Netherlands. The Dutch are well acquainted with water and its problems: their country is two-thirds below sea level, protected by an ingenious system of &quot;polders&quot; (reclaimed land surrounded by dykes) and massive flood barriers. But even here, the traditional relationship between architecture and water is being renegotiated. &apos;What would happen,&quot; asks architect Koen Olthuis, &quot;if you could change the attitude - from being defensive against water to working with it?&quot; With his company, Waterstudio, based near The Hague, Olthuis has been working on this idea. At only 36, he has become something of a guru of floating architecture. &quot;In a country threatened by flooding,&quot; he says, &quot;the safest place to be is actually on the water. Then your house just goes up and down with the water level.&quot; Houseboats are nothing new in the canal-strewn Netherlands, but Olthuis is trying to take things a step - if not several steps - further. Waterstudio&apos;s designs are more house than boat, with large expanses of glass, modern materials and relatively spacious interiors. &quot;They&apos;re no more expensive than houses on land,&quot; says Olthuis, &quot;and the technology is very simple.&quot; The standard &quot;watervilla&quot; floats, thanks to a hollow concrete box underneath it. As well as providing the buoyancy, this doubles as a basement just like any other - one home even has a cinema on the lower floor. Typically, the house is moored to the shore on posts sunk into the ground, and is supplied with water and electricity through flexible pipes. As the water level rises, the house simply slides up the posts, and the pipes bend accordingly. Waterstudio has built 25 floating homes to date, but Olthuis has bigger ambitions. Work is in progress on a floating apartment complex in IJburg, near Amsterdam, with a group of three-storey units sitting on one giant platform, just as if it was built on solid ground. &quot;You can even drive your car on to it,&quot; he says. &quot;The bigger you build, the easier it gets, because it&apos;s more stable.&quot; Olthuis sees no limit to the potential of floating architecture, and not just in terms of flood relief. It is the ideal solution for land-starved cities needing to expand, he says - and it is amenable to fantastical ideas. He is also working beyond the Netherlands, especially in Dubai, where he is designing innovative buildings such as luxury floating beach houses, a giant floating terminal for ocean liners, a 100-metre-high rotating tower on the water, even a floating mosque. &quot;This could completely change the nature of cities,&quot; he says. One Netherlands site has already fulfilled the vision of a flood-proof village on the water: Maasbommel, 60 miles east of Amsterdam, a picturesque development of 46 lakeside houses. It looks like an attractive place to live. The two-storey houses are all brightly painted clapboard structures with distinctive curved roofs and views over the lake. Only 12 actually float on the water; the rest are examples of what might be called &quot;amphibious living&quot;. From the land, these look like ordinary waterfront houses, but they actually sit on the riverbed, centimetres from the water. Between the riverbed and the house is a hollow concrete box, about two metres high. If the river rises above its normal level, the concrete box floats up, and the house with it. Maasbommel was the first amphibious scheme in the Netherlands, says its designer, Ger Kengen of Factor Architects. It was created to make commercial use of otherwise useless, flood-prone land - although, since the first homes were finished in 2005, there have been no floods. Before Olthuis and Kengen&apos;s generation, an older Dutch architect, Herman Hertzberger, also became fascinated with the possibilities of floating architecture, with very different results. One of the heavyweights of Dutch modernism, 76-year-old Hertzberger designed his first floating house in 1986, using a foam-filled concrete base for buoyancy. He refined that design for a second attempt, completed in 2002 in the town of Middelburg. Borrowing technology from offshore oil rigs, the house - a rather desirable steel-and-glass villa, with full-height windows and terraces - sits on a hexagon of six interconnected steel tubes, each about the width of a bus. Hertzberger&apos;s design takes advantage of its floating conditions: using two steering wheels, the owners can rotate their entire house to face the sun. &quot;It&apos;s like a new species of animal,&quot; says project architect Patrick Fransen. &quot;It was a statement: to say that when you&apos;re building on the water, the result doesn&apos;t have to look like a houseboat.&quot; Unsurprisingly, Hertzberger&apos;s team is now returning to floating architecture, too. Construction of a group of 30 new amphibious homes, also in Middelburg, is due to begin soon. &quot;We&apos;ve learned how to make them more economical,&quot; says Fransen. &quot;So they will be smaller and more affordable - a proper community.&quot; The US, meanwhile, is taking another tack. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is looking not to the Dutch, but to Brad Pitt. The actor and part-time architecture enthusiast recently put $5m of his own money behind Make It Right, an initiative to rebuild a portion of New Orleans&apos; Lower Ninth ward, one of the worst hit areas. The media, corporate benefactors and even one or two &quot;starchitects&quot; have been drawn in by Pitt&apos;s celebrity aura, and proffer &quot;creative new architectural solutions&quot;, as the website puts it. The team includes cutting-edge international practices such as California&apos;s Morphosis, Japan&apos;s Shigeru Ban, Dutch stars MVRDV and Britain&apos;s David Adjaye. The first 13 designs, unveiled earlier this month, are a mixed bag. Some look worryingly flamboyant. MVRDV&apos;s is a spin on the traditional &quot;shotgun shack&quot; - the long, narrow, single-storey houses found across the southern US. Wildly impractical, it already looks flood-damaged. Curiously, the only stipulated precaution against flooding in the brief was that the houses be raised at least 5ft above sea level. In other words, the only flood-proofing precaution in Pitt&apos;s post-Katrina vision appears to be elevated porches. Only one firm, Morphosis, has taken things further and suggested a floating design, based on the same principles as those of the Dutch. Could any of these solutions help myopic, fingers-crossed, boats-at-the-ready Britain? Architect Robert Barker thinks so. His London-based company, Baca, is also concerned with water-related architecture. Their design for an artificial surfing pool on the Thames recently raised eyebrows, but more importantly, Baca is working on a \u20ac20m (\u00a315m) pilot scheme to demonstrate what a genuinely flood-proof landscape should look like. Baca&apos;s plan, which will be completed in 2009, brings together the full range of flood-proofing innovations. Floating units will be built on the water&apos;s edge; further inland are three-storey amphibious units in &quot;dry docks&quot; on the ground. And further above sea level are homes designed to cope with temporary flooding. Finally, the surrounding landscape will channel floodwaters into sacrificial areas, away from homes. It sounds perfect. The bad news? It&apos;s in the Netherlands. But with luck, the scheme will influence planners and architects in areas at risk of flooding over here, and beyond. Baca&apos;s scheme is as near as anyone has got to the solution we need: an integrated system of green space, flood-proof architecture and conventional buildings, ideally backed up in areas such as the Thames Gateway by barriers and dykes. No system is foolproof, but with these structures in place, we might be able to live near the water without having to dread what the weather might bring.", "sentences": ["Work is in progress on a floating apartment complex in IJburg, near Amsterdam, with a group of three-storey units sitting on one giant platform, just as if it was built on solid ground.", "One Netherlands site has already fulfilled the vision of a flood-proof village on the water: Maasbommel, 60 miles east of Amsterdam, a picturesque development of 46 lakeside houses."], "title": "Steve Rose meets Dutch architects who address the problems of flooding", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/21/weather.architecture", "tags": ["Architecture", "World news", "Art and design", "Culture", "Weather"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-24T15:46:09Z", "article": "     Onitsuka Tiger, the trendy shoe brand worn by Uma Thurman&apos;s yellow-clad assassin in Kill Bill, is to launch a global TV ad campaign featuring a miniature replica of Tokyo inside a futuristic shoe.

The move could also prompt a rethink at other high-profile fashion brands, such as Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo, which were planning to follow suit with listings in Milan. Hilfiger, viewed as an all-American lifestyle brand and famous for its &quot;preppy&quot; look, was acquired by private equity group Apax Partners \u2014 which also co-owns the UK&apos;s New Look fashion chain \u2014 for $1.6bn in 2006. At that time the company was under attack from trendier labels such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and sales and profits were sliding. Since Apax took over Hilfiger has shifted its headquarters to Amsterdam as part of a plan to revive the brand in Europe. It had planned to list on EuroNext in the coming weeks, hoping for a valuation of at least $3bn. Flotation would have generated a multimillion pound windfall for the management, led by chief executive Fred Gehring, and Apax, which failed to sell New Look last year. The fashion brand&apos;s founder, Tommy Hilfiger, is no longer involved in the business but retains a shareholding. A statement from Apax and the Tommy Hilfiger Group described Hilfiger as &quot;a very strong business that has been performing well in all geographical markets and product divisions over the past two years including during recent months of economic uncertainty.&quot;  It added that an IPO was &quot;a logical step in the development of the company&quot; and that investor feedback had been positive. &quot;However, considering recent volatile market conditions, management and shareholders decided to postpone an IPO process until such time that market conditions have stabilised.&quot; Several planned floats in Europe have been pulled in recent days, including the property business of French supermarket group Carrefour, Danish energy group DONG and Italian pharmaceuticals group Philogen. The planned Euronext listing would have been Hilfiger&apos;s second outing on the public markets. It first went public in 1992 but put itself up for sale after falling out of fashion. Hilfiger also owns the Karl Lagerfeld brand. There have been increasing signs that even designer label and luxury goods shoppers are reining back their spending.

It was the second time the Garuda pilot, Pollycarpus Priyanto, 45, was convicted of poisoning Munir Thalib with arsenic during a stopover on a flight to Amsterdam. The supreme court had quashed his first conviction on appeal. The celebrated case has become a test case for Indonesia&apos;s resolve to tackle the legacy of ailing former President Suharto&apos;s 32-year dictatorship, after allegations that the state&apos;s intelligence agency had plotted the murder. After the verdict was announced, Indonesian police said that secret service agents would also be investigated for the first time about their involvement in the murder of Munir. The 38-year-old activist was one of the Indonesian military&apos;s staunchest critics, exposing human rights abuses in Papua and Aceh, as well its involvement in drug trafficking and illegal logging. But in 2004 Munir decided to escape the repeated death threats to travel to the Netherlands to study for a year. On the Garuda flight to Amsterdam he was poisoned in a Coffee Bean outlet at Singapore&apos;s Changi airport and died in agony two hours before the flight reached its destination. Pollycarpus was convicted of the murder in December 2005 and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. The decision was overturned ten months later, even though Pollycarpus was convicted of forging a letter authorising him to travel on the flight as a security officer. The supreme court reopened the case after fresh evidence came to light last year during a judicial review which found that Munir had been seen drinking with Pollycarpus in Singapore airport. Agents of Indonesia&apos;s intelligence agency, BIN, also testified that they were ordered to assassinate Munir on several occasions, even with the use of magic spells. A former Garuda chief, Indra Setiawan, was also caught up in the web of intrigue after he admitted receiving a letter from BIN asking him to assign Pollycarpus as an on-board security officer two months before Munir was murdered. In a recorded telephone conversation, Pollycarpus was heard reassuring the airlines boss and telling him not to worry as Indonesia&apos;s attorney general and supreme court chief justice were &quot;our men&quot;. Munir&apos;s widow, Suciwati, said the verdict did not go far enough and demanded further investigation to expose those who ordered the killing. &quot;This is what [Pollycarpus] deserves, but I wish he got a longer punishment,&quot; she said. &quot;What&apos;s more important is to follow up on the intelligence people behind him.

The new version opens at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool on February 1. First produced 30 years ago, the play tells of a couple who, by coincidence, spend the night before their wedding in the same Liverpool venue. There were plenty of laughs then, but surely there are more jokes now? &quot;Oh no,&quot; says Russell, now 60 and a grandfather. The gag quotient hasn&apos;t risen: &quot;It&apos;s just that you didn&apos;t laugh at the 1978 jokes.&quot; You could write a decent dissertation on the differences between the two versions. Out go mentions of John Wayne, Britt Ekland, and Tonto (the Lone Ranger&apos;s horse); in come Bo Derek, Elvis Costello and Rolf Harris. Clearly, this is not an update. The happy couple can still be found partying in a dancehall with dodgy electrics in Liverpool in 1978. And the deep sadness remains. &quot;The play will not update,&quot; insists Russell. &quot;The tribal thing at the centre of it, the male-female thing, is not true today. The whole booze culture has been replaced by a drug culture. The very idea of this mainstream disco ballroom has gone. And for stag or hen nights now they are on planes going to Amsterdam or Malaga or Dublin.&quot; Kevin Fearon, now staging plays at Liverpool&apos;s Royal Court without subsidy, wanted to produce Stags and Hens. Russell agreed - &quot;subject to me taking a look at it. I think it was the prompt I needed. When I heard of other productions, I tended to wince. Not that the subject matter is wrong, but the way I told it in 1978 is not right for now. Under the influence of film, the speed with which we tell stories today is very different. In theatre then, a scene would still largely have to have a beginning, a middle and an end. It&apos;s not so today - you can use the cinema device of going straight to the moment.&quot; Russell went to work on the new version immediately. The play is now a good 20 minutes shorter, has far more &quot;fucks&quot; and has lost its only c-word. It&apos;s a tougher piece of work. It&apos;s still set in the dancehall&apos;s toilets, where the groom spends the entire play with his head stuck down a toilet.  The basic theme of staying or leaving remains and is just as relevant. &quot;Ringo Starr has just been given a kicking because he left Liverpool!&quot; adds Russell, recalling the Beatle&apos;s return to his home city for the opening of its year as European capital of culture. &quot;Of course he left Liverpool - he was in the Beatles!&quot; The next sentence is preceded by a small sigh of exasperation. &quot;The thing that I&apos;m endlessly praised for, and it&apos;s nothing to do with my work, is that I always stayed in Liverpool.&quot; In the play, the bride Linda meets Peter, an ex who has gone to London and found a bit of Top of the Pops glory as a singer. &quot;The debate between Peter and Linda in the remix is stronger than in the original and much more spelled out. While it wasn&apos;t consciously at the front of my brain, I must have had the idea in my head because we were just about to embark on this capital of culture thing. I knew this debate was in the air and it must have infused what has been written. &quot;This thing does not change in Liverpool. Just two weeks ago, [Liverpool lawyer and arts patron] Rex Makin gave Phil Redmond a good kicking because Redmond has moved out to Tarporley [a Cheshire village]. He&apos;s not got Liverpool credentials any more!&quot; That&apos;s exactly what Linda, a close relative of Russell&apos;s Shirley Valentine and Rita, says to Peter: &quot;I can say just what the fuck I like about living here because I do live here ... So when you come back here an&apos; you hear one of us slaggin&apos; off the place, don&apos;t think it gives you the right to join in. You left! Remember?&quot; Russell lives here too but scorns any idea that Liverpool is some kind of essential inspiration. &quot;I just take it completely for granted. I don&apos;t think of it in those terms. I wince when people say &apos;his beloved Liverpool&apos;. That kind of sentimentality deeply, deeply embarrasses me.&quot; So why didn&apos;t he leave, seek fame and fortune in London like Peter? It was, he says, a self-protective thing. By the time of his first success with John, Paul, George Ringo...and Bert, he had already knocked about in the folk world and seen people &quot;screw up badly, do the whole drugs thing, go down the booze path. &quot;I love living and love a jar. I know that&apos;s in me. I was aware of Brendan Behan and becoming the joke of London. I was aware of Robert Burns going to Edinburgh and being feted in the ploughman poet way. I always fought passionately to avoid that kind of thing.&quot; Stags and Hens opens just as Russell&apos;s musical Blood Brothers ends a three-week run at the Empire up the road. Russell has other projects on the go in the capital of culture year but none of them are happening under the banner of the Liverpool Capital of Culture Company. &quot;I&apos;m doing what I have always done. And if the perception out there is that it is part of capital of culture, that&apos;s something I&apos;m not going to do anything to dispel. I cannot not be part of Liverpool culture with that work going on.&quot; There is an obvious soreness that neither the Playhouse nor the Everyman, theatres with which he has been so closely associated, has commissioned a new play from him for 2008. But he holds back. &quot;Despite my misgivings and serious criticism of lots of the shenanigans, I hope by the end of the year I can look back and say some marvellous things have happened and that Liverpool comes away from it with an enhanced reputation. We all hope that.&quot; Meanwhile, he is keeping watch on the Royal Court&apos;s plans to build a permanent company from the wealth of acting talent based in Liverpool. There are also hopes for a television version of his novel The Wrong Boy, a film of Blood Brothers, a full musical version of Our Day Out.

Ashley Yarrow, 15, from Pontypridd has been named as one of Wales&apos;s first young ambassadors on climate, securing a prestigious Welsh assembly government role. Her appointment follows a search for young people passionate enough about the environment to become ambassadors on climate change. Here she shares her thoughts on her first day in office and her hopes for the year ahead.  My school, Bryn Celynnog in Beddau, is an eco school and is very proactive when it comes to the environment, which inspired me to enter the climate change champions competition. As young people, we need to encourage our generation to be environmentally aware. I feel lucky to be picked as one of six young ambassadors on climate change. It&apos;s a great idea for politicians to involve young people in raising awareness. After all, it is us and our children who will suffer in the future if we don&apos;t change our behaviour and our consumption of resources now. Politicians can talk about the issue and scientists can produce reports but only we really know how to reach out to our peers and get the message across. I am looking forward to my year as champion. My first job in my new role was to host a Carbon Watchers Wales class at the Senedd (parliament) building in Cardiff Bay, with a little help from our first minister, Rhodri Morgan, and the environment minister, Jane Davidson. I and the other five champions turned &quot;carbon slimming tutors&quot; for the day and helped visitors calculate their carbon footprints, giving them tips on how to make small changes to their lifestyles that collectively can make a big difference. Things like using energy-saving bulbs, turning off appliances at the mains, taking a shower instead of a bath; if we all did these things then that would have a big impact.  If we are to make progress on tackling climate change in the UK we need to learn from other countries. That&apos;s why I&apos;m looking forward to going to Amsterdam next month where we will visit an offshore wind farm, tour a carbon-free houseboat and take part in a climate change-themed treasure hunt.  When we come back we will be regularly attending events and speaking to different groups in our communities and across Wales, showing people how they can take simple steps to reduce their carbon footprints. It is going to be a busy year but the small changes we try to help people make over the next 12 months could make a huge difference for generations to come.

Hilfiger, which said it was postponing its initial public offering &quot;until such time that market conditions have stabilised&quot; is the latest in a number of planned flotations to have been pulled as a result of the unstable markets. The move could also prompt a rethink at other high-profile fashion brands, such as Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo, which were planning to follow suit with listings in Milan. Hilfiger, viewed as an all-American lifestyle brand and famous for its &quot;preppy&quot; look, was acquired by private equity group Apax Partners - which also co-owns the UK&apos;s New Look fashion chain - for $1.6bn in 2006. At that time the company was under attack from trendier labels such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and sales and profits were sliding. Since Apax took over Hilfiger has shifted its headquarters to Amsterdam as part of a plan to revive the brand in Europe. It had planned to list on EuroNext in the coming weeks, hoping for a valuation of at least $3bn. Flotation would have generated a multimillion pound windfall for the management, led by chief executive Fred Gehring, and Apax, which failed to sell New Look last year. The fashion brand&apos;s founder, Tommy Hilfiger, is no longer involved in the business but retains a shareholding. A statement from Apax and the Tommy Hilfiger Group described Hilfiger as &quot;a very strong business that has been performing well in all geographical markets and product divisions over the past two years including during recent months of economic uncertainty.&quot;  It added that an IPO was &quot;a logical step in the development of the company&quot; and that investor feedback had been positive. &quot;However, considering recent volatile market conditions, management and shareholders decided to postpone an IPO process until such time that market conditions have stabilised.&quot; Several planned floats in Europe have been pulled in recent days, including the property business of French supermarket group Carrefour, Danish energy group DONG and Italian pharmaceuticals group Philogen. The planned Euronext listing would have been Hilfiger&apos;s second outing on the public markets. It first went public in 1992 but put itself up for sale after falling out of fashion. Hilfiger also owns the Karl Lagerfeld brand. There have been increasing signs that even designer label and luxury goods shoppers are reining back their spending. In Britain Burberry reported lower than expected sales, while in the US jeweller Tiffany had issued a profits alert. US handbag label Coach has warned of fewer shoppers spending less while Richemont - which owns Cartier, Chlo\u00e9, Piaget and Montblanc - has said sales growth is slowing, especially in Japan and the US.

The case became a test of Indonesia&apos;s resolve to tackle the legacy of former president Suharto&apos;s 32-year dictatorship, with allegations that the state&apos;s intelligence agency plotted the murder. After the verdict, police said there would be an investigation into secret service involvement. The activist, 38, was critical of the military, exposing human rights abuses in Papua and Aceh, as well as involvement in drug trafficking and illegal logging. But in 2004, after repeated death threats Munir decided to study in the Netherlands for a year. On the Garuda flight to Amsterdam he was poisoned in a Coffee Bean outlet at Changi airport in Singapore and died two hours before reaching his destination. In 2005 Pollycarpus was convicted of murder and given a 14-year jail term.

It was not until January 9 that the Russian government gave its consent for the paintings to visit England. With the catalogue at the press and no substitute exhibition on the stocks, cancellation could have bankrupted the RA. What was the problem? The show explores the relationship between French and Russian art between 1870 and 1925, and includes the superb collections of the 19th-century Moscow merchants Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morosov, which were nationalised at the Russian revolution in 1917. Their paintings are now in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow, and the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg - the collections were divided after the second world war. From time to time their heirs have attempted to get them back, and have taken the opportunity of the paintings appearing abroad to claim them. The Russian government was afraid they would do it again. To some it may come as a surprise that an exhibition drawing on only Russian museums should include such magnificent French paintings. Shchukin and Morosov were, however, the first great collectors of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art - with the American Havermeyers one step behind them. As a result, the greatest early Cubist Picassos are to be found in St Petersburg together with a feast of Matisse, while some of the world&apos;s finest Impressionist works are in Moscow. Following the RA&apos;s announcement of the exhibition in October, British press coverage stressed that the Shchukins and Morosovs might once again seek to reclaim their assets. While there were already safeguards to prevent this, the reports worried the Russian government, which began to ask for extra guarantees. It has been widely assumed that the difficulties result from the deterioration in diplomatic relations following the Litvinenko murder, but I am assured this is not the case. As Secretary of the UK Friends of the Hermitage I have had a ringside seat. Only when Culture Secretary James Purnell responded to a cry for help from the RA and brought the enactment of new protection from seizure legislation (Part 6 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act) forward to December 31 was the crisis defused. Immunity from seizure has become a central concern of the world&apos;s great museums in recent years. Restitution is in the air: art that disappeared at the time of the Holocaust, treasures unearthed by tomb robbers and illegal excavators, as well as art removed from original owners by revolutions and wars, are being reclaimed on all sides. Museums fear that by loaning works for exhibition abroad they may lose them. Yet the sharing of art among different nations through travelling exhibitions has enormous cultural benefit. Great art belongs to the whole world, and culture should have no frontiers or exclusion zones. Battles over Shchukin and Morosov&apos;s pictures have helped embody these principles in law in country after country. In 1954, when 34 of Shchukin&apos;s Picassos were exhibited in Paris, his daughter Irina went to court to claim them. The paintings were rushed to the Russian embassy where they had diplomatic protection and came quietly home. In 1993, her son - Shchukin&apos;s grandson - went to court to claim Matisse paintings on loan to Paris&apos;s Pompidou Centre; the judge ruled that even in France, ownership was determined by Russian law since France had officially recognised the Soviet government. The Shchukin and Morosov exhibition in Essen, Germany in 1993, which included a reconstruction of Morosov&apos;s music room with its specially commissioned wall paintings, helped clarify German law on this issue. Then in June 2000 Irina Shchukin&apos;s son, Andr\u00e9-Marc Delocque-Fourcaud, filed suit in Rome to seize Matisse&apos;s La Danse, on exhibition in a sensational display of Shchukin and Morosov pictures from the Hermitage at the Quirinal Palace. He left his challenge until the last days of the exhibition and when the Hermitage heard of it from local newspapers the paintings were packed and shipped home with unprecedented speed. The real watershed came in November 2005, when trucks containing 55 Impressionist paintings from the Pushkin Museum were held at the Swiss border at the request of a trading company called Noga, which claimed that the Russian government owed it $25 million and much more in damages. The paintings - including Monets, Renoirs, Sisleys and Van Goghs - had an insurance valuation of around $1 billion but the Swiss Appeal Court ruled that Noga had no right to sieze them. However, Professor Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, threatened to recall all the art works the museum had on loan around the world and cancel exhibitions unless proper guarantees were available. The Dutch government moved swiftly to adjust its procedures since a new Hermitage museum was planned in Amsterdam, and for the first time Britain began to take the issue seriously. The director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, and the director of the Courtauld Institute, Deborah Swallow, gathered their museum colleagues to lobby the government. Piotrovsky was invited to a meeting by the then minister of culture, David Lammy, to explain his concerns. Everyone relaxed a little after the Treasury Solicitor&apos;s office discovered that there had been legislation on the books since 1978 that protected state-owned property from seizure in Britain: Russia&apos;s major museums are all state-owned. However, new legislation was considered necessary to protect private loans. This was on its way in October when the Royal Academy announced its exhibition. It is sure to be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, the heirs of Shchukin and Morosov have issued a statement calling for &quot;an agreement that reasonably compensates and pays a percentage of the material benefits that accrue from the exploitation of the works&quot;. They face a struggle. It has been shown over and again, and around the world, that people hold culture above private property in the scale of human rights.", "sentences": ["The Dutch government moved swiftly to adjust its procedures since a new Hermitage museum was planned in Amsterdam, and for the first time Britain began to take the issue seriously."], "title": "Commentary: Jan 26", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/26/art", "tags": ["Books", "Art", "Culture", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-27T15:16:37Z", "article": "The best thing about January is that there is absolutely no reason to have a party. Even if it&apos;s your birthday, your ruby wedding or the month you won the lottery, you can argue that people are &apos;partied out&apos; after December and it would be more generous to avoid bothering them with invitations. That opens the golden gates to the best-possible way of celebrating anything: alone with a pork pie and a giant sudoku. Perhaps this strikes you as a poignant image. But it is a vision of glee for those of us who are terrified by the idea of being a party host and pretty nerve-racked even being a guest. I don&apos;t need to see Sweeney Todd this weekend, because I am getting my dose of vicarious horror from a Tatler supplement called &apos;Parties: The Ultimate Guide&apos;. This is a booklet that comes free with the magazine or, if you find it on a bus, free without the magazine. Is anybody out there actually using it? I assume it&apos;s mainly a sort of party porn, to be salivated over by people who aren&apos;t getting any. Much like the travel supplements you see at this time of year. There must be a handful of people who actually do book their summer holidays in January, but I&apos;m sure most of us flick through those guides thinking: &apos;Hmm, this Kenyan safari looks magnificent ... and that appears to be a truly marvellous Swiss spa retreat ... and if I book now, I could get into this tropical Mauritian paradise for only four grand a week ... but I think it would be better to forget all about it until August, then rush nervously to the travel agent and spend \u00a3500 on whatever they&apos;ve got left, which will be a slightly disappointing fortnight in Ayia Napa.&apos; So, perhaps, it is with this Tatler party supplement. All we are supposed to do is flick through it and imagine a parallel universe in which we would book &apos;silhouettists, mind-readers and escapologists&apos; to entertain guests. (I socialise mainly with poker players, many of them crooks; mind-readers and escapologists are my guests.) Tatler cannot genuinely expect us to act on the advice: &apos;Tablecloths are so pass\u00e9; get a glass specialist to cut a mirror sheet to fit.&apos; Nobody is going to do that; nobody. Although I suppose Amy Winehouse could find a use for it. I won&apos;t bother pointing out that nobody is going to &apos;have an engraver or calligrapher on site for any last-minute placement changes&apos; because if that isn&apos;t a joke, then we might as well all just kill ourselves now. Hosting is grim enough when you have to worry about whether to give people food, how many drinks you&apos;ll need, where they&apos;re going to smoke, what happens if nobody comes, whether they can park, whether they&apos;ll be bored, how to handle the tricky problem of neither annoying the neighbours nor (worse) inviting them. We can do without lying awake all night fearing that our tablecloths are old hat and we don&apos;t have a calligrapher to whip out his pen every time somebody changes seat. I bet Kate Moss&apos;s housewarming party was tablecloth-free. In the one month of the year when it&apos;s utterly acceptable to hide from the world, our favourite supermodel has broken the rules twice: a raucous housewarming straight after her 34th birthday bash. Tabloids have slavered that the birthday drinks &apos;descended&apos; into an orgy, though Kate insists it was just a normal party. This is baffling. An orgy would be understandable; if your guests are going to get naked and hump on the floor, at least you don&apos;t have to worry about snacks. And you&apos;d certainly be getting value for money from the calligrapher. Blimey, that man would be rearranging the placement every eight seconds. I tried to have a decadent party once. My mate Charlie and I flew over eight international sex workers we had befriended in Amsterdam, thinking they would bring a zip to the atmosphere. They all ended up in a huddle with Charlie&apos;s father, asking advice about pension plans. Parties are wonderful for the first day you have the idea; every day after that is miserable, reaching a climax of angst on the night itself, followed by the long, embarrassed phase, settling down into &apos;mildly depressing&apos; two years later when you look back at the photographs of a hundred people you don&apos;t recognise. I remember my father&apos;s neat logic, when he and my mother were planning some sort of dinner dance to mark some sort of major anniversary. Hang on a minute, my father said, we are simply spending an enormous amount of money on the opportunity to worry and fret for months, so that our friends can be struggling to knot bow-ties all over town while wishing they could stay in and watch Midsomer Murders. (He had just turned down an invitation to the &apos;fancy dress party of the year&apos;, on Millennium Eve, because he was damned if he was going to wander round London at 3am, trying to hail a taxi while dressed as Henry VIII.) The plan was nixed. January is party amnesty month. Ignore that scab Kate Moss, not to mention Tatler (&apos;Add sparkle by commissioning an ice chandelier!&apos;), and stick to your guns.

While explaining the painting&apos;s provenance, he put his elbow through it, exclaiming: &apos;Oh no, oh shit!&apos; A conservator charged $90,500 for &apos;rissverklebung&apos; (thread reintegration) and then Wynn put in a claim to Lloyds for $54m, based on a post-restoration valuation of $85m. &apos;Picasso used the cheapest thin canvas - and it went &quot;Pop!&quot;, like shrink-wrap,&apos; noted Wynn. &apos;I almost made the biggest mistake of my life selling that painting, but I got lucky and poked a hole in it.&apos; 2 Diego Velazquez gets slashed After repeatedly slashing the naked back of the woman in the Rokeby Venus at London&apos;s National Gallery in 1914, suffragette Mary Richardson explained: &apos;I tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the government for destroying Mrs Pankhurst. Justice is as much an element of beauty as colour and outline.&apos; Thirty-eight years later she gave a different explanation for her actions: &apos;I didn&apos;t like the way men gaped at it all day long.&apos; In 1918 three suffragists attacked 13 paintings in Manchester City Art Gallery with hammers - three of the works were by Victorian painter George Frederic Watts, the worst damaged being his Prayer 3 Rodin is dynamited In 1970 one of Auguste Rodin&apos;s original casts of his world-famous sculpture The Thinker, situated outside the Cleveland Museum of Art in Ohio, was dynamited by members of the radical group The Weathermen, who later accidentally blew themselves up. The lower parts of the legs of The Thinker were annihilated, its base expanded, twisted and contorted. Since the decision was made to re-mount it in its damaged form, a generation has grown up in Cleveland believing that the sculpture was conceived that way by Rodin. At Tate Britain in 2003 Rodin&apos;s The Kiss was (with permission) wrapped in a mile of string by artist Cornelia Parker, prompting outraged artist Piers Butler to cut the string. 4 Mondrian is vomited on The head conservator at New York&apos;s Moma says that decisions to undertake restoration, such as &apos;pigment work-ups&apos;, are often based on whether &apos;the thrill has gone from a painting&apos;. Similar motivation was claimed by artist Jubal Brown, who ate blue cake icing and blue Jell-O before entering Moma in order to projectile vomit on to Piet Mondrian&apos;s Composition With Red and Blue - to &apos;liven it up... I found its lifelessness threatening&apos;. Brown had months earlier vomited red on to Raoul Dufy&apos;s Harbour at le Havre in the Art Gallery of Ontario, where the head conservator said: &apos;Fingerprints can be much more difficult. Touching - of abstracts especially - is chronic here.&apos; 5 Rembrandt is slashed, slashed again and then sprayed with acid The Nightwatch holds the dubious honour of being attacked three times in Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum. In 1911 an ex-navy chef, disgruntled by discharge and considering it the state&apos;s most valuable possession, attacked it with a knife &apos;to cool my anger&apos;. In 1975 an unemployed teacher, declaring &apos;Jesus sent me&apos;, slashed it repeatedly, later explaining: &apos;Rembrandt was the master of light, but when he painted The Nightwatch he was under the influence of the dark.&apos; In 1990 an escaped psychiatric patient sprayed sulphuric acid on it. Released nine years later, the same attacker cut a large circular hole in Picasso&apos;s painting Nude in Front of the Garden 6 Andres Serrano is given a good kicking and then gets hammered In 1997 the director of the National Gallery in Melbourne closed down an exhibition after two attacks in two days upon Serrano&apos;s Piss Christ. In the first attack, Christian John Allen Haywood wrenched the photograph - of Christ on the cross submerged in urine - from the wall and kicked it; in the second, a youth hammered the photograph eight times while another youth &apos;distracted guards&apos; by jump-kicking a juxtaposed Serrano portrait of a Ku Klux Klan member. Last year, hooded neo-Nazis broke into the Kulturen Gallery in Skane, Sweden, to attack photographs in Serrano&apos;s The History of Sex, then posted film of it on YouTube. 7 Marcus Harvey is splashed with ink In 1997, at the Sensation show at London&apos;s Royal Academy, artist Peter Fisher threw red and blue ink at Harvey&apos;s Myra, hours after another artist, Jacques Role, had thrown eggs at it. Sensation, which also included Tracey Emin&apos;s Everyone I Ever Slept With (later destroyed in a \u00a360m warehouse fire) subsequently moved to Brooklyn&apos;s Museum of Art. There, Chris Ofili&apos;s Holy Virgin Mary (portraying an African Virgin decorated with dung and pornography) was sprayed with white paint by retired teacher Dennis Heiner, whose blind wife found it blasphemous. When Mayor Guiliani withheld the museum&apos;s grant, 200 &apos;art lovers&apos; threw dung at a painting of Guiliani as the Virgin Mary. 8 Claude Monet is punched One midnight last year, five drunks somehow accessed the rear of the Musee d&apos;Orsay in Paris, wherein one of them punched a hole in Monet&apos;s prized painting of the Seine. Following the attack, the minister of culture promised to seek stronger sanctions against the painting&apos;s &apos;desecrators&apos;. A week later, having visited Avignon&apos;s Museum of Contemporary Art and kissed an all-white abstract painting by Cy Twombly, a woman appeared in court and heard the owner&apos;s lawyer declare her lipstick stain &apos;as aggressive as a punch&apos;. She insisted that she loved Twombly&apos;s work, had been &apos;overcome with passion&apos; in its presence and &apos;thought he would understand&apos;. 9 Leonardo Da Vinci is blasted with a shotgun In 1987, for reasons he couldn&apos;t explain, ex-soldier Robert Cambridge drew a 12-bore shotgun from under his coat and fired at the Virgin&apos;s breast in Da Vinci&apos;s Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist at London&apos;s National Gallery, resulting in &apos;cauliflower-like&apos; damage. In 1962 an artist had thrown an ink bottle at the same painting, asking afterwards: &apos;Would you be prepared to die to protect it?&apos; Also at the National, in 1990 Federico Barocci&apos;s Madonna and Child was slashed by Martin Came, an art lover experiencing &apos;subconscious distress&apos; in relation to the painting due to recent separation from his wife and child. 10 Pablo Picasso is graffitied During an anti-war protest at NY&apos;s Moma in 1974, &apos;KILL LIES ALL&apos; was sprayed on Guernica in red by Tony Shafrazi - then an artist, now a top art dealer. He explained: &apos;I wanted to retrieve Guernica from art history and give it life. I wanted to trespass beyond that invisible barrier that no one is allowed to cross; to dwell within the act of the painting&apos;s creation, put my hand within it.&apos; The following year Guernica was moved to Spain, where it was exhibited in a bullet-proof container with armed guards on either side. Picasso, noted Shafrazi, once painted over a Modigliani. 11 Damien Hirst is rubbished and inked Art not recognised as art has often fallen prey to cleaners. The most celebrated case is cleaner Emmanuel Asare&apos;s bin-bagging at London&apos;s Eyestorm Gallery in 2001 of Damien Hirst&apos;s installation Painting by Numbers, a representation of his studio and its detritus. &apos;I didn&apos;t think for a second it was art,&apos; explained Asare. Hirst found this &apos;hysterical&apos;. Less so the pouring of black ink into his sculpture Away From the Flock during an exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in 1994. The perpetrator, artist Mark Bridger, re-labelled the piece Black Sheep. &apos;I was providing an interesting addendum to his work,&apos; said Bridger in court. 12 Michelangelo takes a hammering In St Peter&apos;s in Rome in 1972, geologist Laszlo Toth attacked the Virgin cradling Jesus in Michelangelo&apos;s Pieta, removing her arm at the elbow and most of her nose, and chipping her eye. He explained: &apos;Today is my 33rd birthday, the age Christ died. I did it because the mother of God does not exist. I am Christ. I am Michelangelo. Now I can die.&apos; And in 1991, an unsuccessful artist hammered a toe off David, leading conservators to discover the origins of Michelangelo&apos;s marble. 13 Tracey Emins bed springs are tested In 1999, at Tate Britain, artists Yuan Cai and JJ Xi intervened in Tracey Emin&apos;s installation My Bed. &apos;Although they got on the bed for a few seconds, mostly they just threatened guards with kung-fu kicks,&apos; said witness Harry Pye. &apos;They realised we were serious artists - doing it purely from a creative point,&apos; said Xi. &apos;Don&apos;t take seriously Emin saying we were &quot;like failed artists threatening to jump off Waterloo Bridge unless given a gallery&quot; - probably she got drunk.&apos; In 2000, Cai and Xi urinated on Marcel Duchamp&apos;s La Fontaine to alleged cheers from Tate Modern visitors.", "sentences": ["Touching - of abstracts especially - is chronic here.&apos; 5 Rembrandt is slashed, slashed again and then sprayed with acid The Nightwatch holds the dubious honour of being attacked three times in Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum."], "title": "Art attack: 13 unlucky works of art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2008/jan/27/features.magazine77", "tags": ["Life and style", "Pablo Picasso", "Auguste Rodin"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-27T17:45:00Z", "article": "General Suharto, whose death has been announced today, was president and dictator of Indonesia for 32 years, before he was finally ousted by student-led demonstrations in 1998.

In the club of corrupt dictators, the ill-gotten gains of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines ($5-10bn), Mobutu Sese Seko, ex-president of Zaire ($5bn), and Sani Abacha of Nigeria ($2-5bn) and other grand looters of the national treasury, are no match for the Suharto&apos;s lifetime achievement in siphoning off a whopping $30bn, spread across banks and real estate in a dozen countries. But the insatiable greed, while so many of his compatriots people worked 16-hour days in sweatshops for multinational corporations for a miserable dollar or two a day, was not by any means the worst feature of Suharto&apos;s rule. Millions of Indonesians can still recall even darker forces unleashed in the name of the New Order and anti-communism. They remember how the New Order regime was also built on the blood-stained foundations of ruthless purges - mass graves as well as monumental corruption. Back to 1965: independence leader and charismatic President Sukarno led the nation along a path of non-alignment, with support from moderate Muslims and the world&apos;s third largest communist party, the PKI. Suharto and other generals backed by the CIA and Britain&apos;s MI6 were eager to put a stop to the expanding influence of the parliamentary PKI, and the growing strength of the trade union movement. Suharto was assured that if he and fellow officers staged a coup, they were guaranteed a warm reception in western capitals - especially Washington, London and Amsterdam. After a murky counter-coup attempt by officers loyal to the legitimate government that went badly wrong, General Suharto seized power in a coup d&apos;etat that left President Sukarno powerless as his allies and ministers were rounded up. Then the bloodbath began. Between 1965 and 1966, the 2 million-strong PKI was wiped out, as an estimated 700,000 (possibly as many as 1 million) were killed - not only communist supporters, but also intellectuals, trade unionists and local Chinese. A subsequent CIA study of the events concluded that: &quot;In terms of the numbers killed, the anti-PKI massacres in Indonesia rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century.&quot; All debate, research and documentation about the 1965-66 purges was forbidden by Suharto, with a Stalinistic determination to maintain official lies and a false history as the only record of a shameful and terrible past. However, the western media in general were softly indulgent towards the crimes of the Suharto years, and played down the numbers killed, the suffering caused and the degree of lasting national trauma. Instead, Suharto was widely applauded for &quot;rescuing the economy&quot;, attracting massive foreign investment, and following World Bank prescriptions. The coup against non-aligned President Sukarno, and the annihilation of the world&apos;s third largest communist party, had flung the doors of the Indonesian economy wide open. US and European corporations secured access to the country&apos;s vast mineral wealth, markets and cheap labour. Still, many would argue, Indonesians benefited from massive infrastructure development - roads, electricity, car-parks and shopping plazas. However, Indonesian specialist Professor Ben Anderson from Cornell University points out that, considering 30 years of massive infusions of donor aid (only Israel has received more), the amount of sustainable development has been paltry, compared with South Korea, that started on about the same level in the 60s. Most Indonesians today are still poor, with minimal education, and little access to healthcare. The Suharto legacy of torture and mass killing also extended beyond its own territories. In 1975, President Suharto met with US President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and received the tacit approval for the invasion, and subsequent brutal occupation of neighbouring East Timor, costing an estimated 200,000 Timorese lives. Jakarta expanded its rule by annexing the former Portuguese territory. But Suharto&apos;s generals, despite repeated massacres, failed to quell the fiercely independent Timorese spirit. The Indonesian high command&apos;s final solution was to implement authorised a scorched earth policy after East Timorese overwhelmingly voted for independence in the UN-organised referendum on East Timor&apos;s future in 1999. A UN team of inquiry recommended that the Indonesian generals should be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. True, Suharto was no longer in power by then, having been forced out by popular protest a year before. But it had always been Suharto&apos;s policy to cling ruthlessly onto Jakarta&apos;s annexation of East Timor, in defiance of UN resolutions in support of independence. Putting Serbian generals on trial at the Hague galvanises western governments to show great enthusiasm for international justice. But applying the same policy towards Indonesian generals culpable of much greater carnage is quite another story. Business deals with the generals and their Jakarta partners have long provided lucrative arms contracts. The UK has a history as a major arms exporter to Suharto&apos;s forces. Little support was leant to the efforts of the UN to convene a tribunal on atrocities in East Timor. A further legacy is that, even with the death of Suharto, the same military mafia and Suharto business crony network remains sadly intact, with only a superficial degree of democratisation. Judges are afraid to pursue cases against the Suharto clan. In 2001, the judge who sentenced Tommy Suharto to jail for corruption was, shortly afterwards, shot dead. Police accused General Suharto&apos;s son of being the mastermind behind the murder. Military reform in Indonesia never happened. Jakarta&apos;s elite has flocked to his deathbed as if he was a national hero, perhaps merely a flawed one, and not a mass murderer. Then there is the cultural lament of writers and dissidents. Many places where intellectuals of different races used to mingle during the time of President Sukarno were bulldozed to make way for shopping malls and parking lots. Books were burned, including those of Southeast Asia&apos;s greatest novelist, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, who became a long-term prisoner of conscience in Buru concentration camp. Pramoedya, until his death in 2006, never forgave Suharto. Not for his personal suffering, but for &quot;having no culture; for turning Indonesia into a market; for destroying Sukarno&apos;s spirit of enthusiasm&quot;. It is clear from all the historical evidence that General Suharto was more deserving of a seat in the dock at the International Court of Justice at the Hague, rather than paeans of praise from his apologists. However, given the criminal complicity of the CIA and MI6 in plotting against Sukarno, any scent of justice would not have been welcome either in Washington or in London.", "sentences": ["Suharto was assured that if he and fellow officers staged a coup, they were guaranteed a warm reception in western capitals - especially Washington, London and Amsterdam."], "title": "General havoc", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/27/generalhavoc", "tags": ["Indonesia", "World news", "US news", "Military", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-27T23:10:44Z", "article": "Mike Russell has lived close to Heathrow Airport for more than 25 years. Once he could sit in his Chiswick garden and never notice the planes. But not any more. Today there is hardly a moment when an aircraft is not roaring above his home. &apos;It&apos;s like a neighbour with builders who start up their circular saws every 90 seconds,&apos; he says. Such is life near the world&apos;s busiest international airport: air pollution, congested roads, constant noise. Neither are Mike and his wife, Tessa, alone. Thousands of other families in the area have to share these conditions. And if British airport chiefs have their way, many thousands more will be added to this list. They are pressing for approval for a \u00a312bn project that would see a 2,200-metre runway, Heathrow&apos;s third - as well as a sixth passenger terminal - being constructed on the airport&apos;s northern perimeter. In addition, use of existing runways would be expanded to allow increased numbers of flights to take off and land. Public consultation over the scheme opened last year and is scheduled to end next month. The government, which is known to support the project, has said it will announce this summer whether it approves or disapproves of the runway plan. Most observers expect it will be given the go-ahead. It will be a controversial decision nevertheless, and will make the airport the focus of a new type of eco-battle that will dominate British life over the next decade. Other major transport schemes, including the expansions of Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff and Belfast, are being considered as well the widening of the M6 and other motorway schemes. All concentrate green fears about raising carbon emissions in Britain. None will be as controversial as Heathrow&apos;s third runway, however. Its capacity would rise from 480,000 flights a year to 702,000 once the runway is completed, despite a government pledge in 2001 that flight numbers would be pegged. In addition, 4.5 million extra Tube journeys would be made to the expanded airport, trains would carry an extra four million passengers, and 25 million extra car trips to Heathrow would be taken. Heathrow&apos;s expansion would also lead to the demolition of 700 houses, including the whole of the village of Sipson, while the number of schools around the airport where children would experience noise about 63 decibels - designated as a nuisance - would rise from 14 to 20. Then there is the issue of climate change. Surprisingly, this has turned out to be the concern that local people say has most incensed them. Britain has committed itself to cutting its carbon emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. Yet here it is talking of massively expanding an industry that is blamed by many for the world&apos;s ecological woes. Hence the widespread hostility, as Mike Russell explains: &apos;The government says global warming is the greatest challenge we&apos;ll see, far-reaching in its consequences and irreversible in its destructive power, and then goes on and does all sorts of things that are radically making the system worse.&apos; For their part, aviation supporters say the climate change argument has been grossly exaggerated. Carbon emissions from planes account for less than 2 per cent of all the greenhouse gases across the planet (although for the UK alone, the figure is 5 per cent). Focusing so strongly on aviation distorts public debate, they say - taking pressure off major polluters such as road transport, which generates nearly a quarter of the UK&apos;s carbon emissions. This complaint was backed last week by a National Statistics survey which showed 40 per cent of the UK population believes air transport is the most environmentally damaging mode of transport while only 35 per cent blames cars and lorries. However, aviation&apos;s current modest impact is destined to change dramatically, campaigners retort. The UN&apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says air emissions will account for 12-15 per cent of global greenhouse gases by 2030 when Heathrow&apos;s third runway will just be reaching full use. In addition, aviation emissions have a disproportionate effect at high altitudes. Thanks to an effect known as &apos;radiative forcing&apos;, carbon in the upper atmosphere produces 2.7 times more warming than emissions near the ground. The crucial point, say climate campaigners, is that Britain cannot afford to have any increases in carbon emissions in any area if it is to meet the 60-80 per cent reduction in emissions that scientists say must be implemented to fend off the worst effects of climate change.  The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research calculates that Britain&apos;s entire carbon budget would be used up by 2037 by the UK&apos;s ever-expanding aviation industry (see &apos;The science&apos;, page 34). Hence local anger at the project. At a public meeting in Chiswick, more than 1,000 people turned up, overwhelming the church hall and spilling local folk on to the street. Similar meetings in Richmond and Putney have also attracted large audiences. In addition, all four main candidates in the forthcoming London mayoral elections are committed opponents of the runway. Nevertheless, the government is adamant that Heathrow&apos;s expansion is compatible with its climate change aspirations. No third runway will mean the airport will no longer be able to act as an international flight hub. Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport already has five runways and Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle airport has four. Both are poised to take up intercontinental flights that cannot find a home outside London. &apos;If Heathrow is allowed to become uncompetitive, the flights and routes it operates will simply move elsewhere,&apos; says Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly. &apos;All it will do is shift capacity over the Channel. It will make us feel pure, but with no benefit to the rest of the planet.&apos; The third runway&apos;s supporters also point out it will be bring a massive economic boost to the economy while ensuring that London retains its position as one of the world&apos;s business capitals. Without it, our economy would be in trouble. Indeed, Heathrow is already facing the strain because of its queues and delays, as Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce, recently discovered. At a recent commerce conference in India, where he was trying to sell the advantages of settling businesses in London, he was publicly berated about the city&apos;s air transport. An executive of an Indian company stood up and told him: &apos;Do something about Heathrow.&apos;  It is a sentiment shared by Ric Lewis, chief executive of the London investment company Curzon Global Partners. He spends much of his life flying in and out of cities to generate business for his firm. Lewis knows a thing or two about airports and his opinion about Heathrow is simple: it&apos;s a national embarrassment. &apos;Heathrow is the first experience many people have of the UK. That first impression should be saying, &quot;Welcome to one of the best cities in the world&quot;. Instead it says all too often, &quot;Caution: you&apos;re about to have a bad day&quot;.&apos;  That warning applies to any visitor heading into the airport, says Lewis, but particularly to business travellers. More of them use Heathrow than Gatwick, Luton, Stansted and London City combined. BAA, the former British Airports Authority, owner of Heathrow, says 35 per cent of its passengers are business travellers and this fraction is rising rapidly. By 2030 it could reach 50 per cent, according to research. Yet Heathrow remains a thoroughly miserable experience for all these business travellers - and it&apos;s getting worse. There are security queues that can take hours to clear, public transport that is unreliable, failures to get gates available for incoming flights, lengthy queues through passport control, and a host of other problems that have made the Heathrow experience an unpalatable one - and which have critical consequences. &apos;We can&apos;t rely on Heathrow,&apos; says Lewis. &apos;Now, if we absolutely have to be at a meeting overseas, we get there the night before, even on short-haul trips.&apos; In other words, being able to hop on to a plane for a business meeting in Frankfurt or Paris and be back at home the same night is becoming a luxury.  &apos;I&apos;ve got two young children,&apos; Lewis says. &apos;I&apos;m trying to plan my trips so I can get back in time to put them to bed in the evening, but I&apos;ve lost count of the number of times that a service problem at Heathrow has conspired against me.&apos;  John Cridland, the CBI&apos;s deputy director-general, says UK directors of international manufacturing companies need to visit their operations overseas. &apos;But if a managing director can&apos;t fly to China via London, he might go via Amsterdam for his connecting flight,&apos; he says.  If this happens repeatedly, global companies based in the UK may question why their UK head offices and research facilities should be based here if they are so badly connected. &apos;If you&apos;ve got UK-based managing directors flying to Amsterdam every night, in the end the company might think about basing everything there too.&apos; Of course it&apos;s not just business that would benefit from the new runway, say supporters. Future Heathrow, the industry lobby group, argues the airport is the largest employer on a single site in the UK, with 72,000 workers. It also supports 100,000 other jobs in the area, one of the more economically deprived in London. A third runway would be a great stimulus for the local economy. But business projections mean little to those who find the very air they breathe affected by Heathrow flights. In particular, nitrogen dioxide - which is produced by cars and aircraft - has been linked to breathing problems among local people. From 2010 strict limits on nitrogen dioxide will come into force across the European Union, but there are indications that these new limits have already been breached in the Heathrow area.  Ministers have promised the UK will improve its act, but campaigners claim the government may simply ask the EU for &apos;derogations&apos; from such commitments. Already it has asked for a postponement for introducing the EU&apos;s limits until 2015.  As with so much about the Heathrow controversy, the problem is exacerbated by a history of reneged promises: residents have been told there will be no more than four terminals, no more than two runways, no more than five terminals, no more than 480,000 flights a year; and now, before terminal five has even opened, consultation is proposing a sixth terminal, a third runway, and more than 700,000 flights a years. Stephen Nelson, chief executive of BAA, even suggested last week it may need to build a fourth runway and a seventh terminal. Public reaction was unsurprising. &apos;The time has come to say enough is enough and call a halt to any expansion of Heathrow,&apos; said John Stewart, chairman the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, a view shared by Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, part of the 2M group of councils claiming to represent two million people living under Heathrow&apos;s flight paths. &apos;When it turns out in 20 years that we can&apos;t do it [run new runways within promised pollution limits], we will not be able to put the cork back in the bottle,&apos; he said. The real driving force behind the 2M group is not local pollution, however, but the continual noise of incoming and departing airliners. It is an issue that has united councils stretching from Kensington and Chelsea to rural Buckinghamshire, and which is described by Mike Russell as &apos;like being in a small room with a vacuum cleaner&apos;.  Other parents say they cannot even hear their children chatter about their day at school as they walk them home and complain of mental and physical illness. &apos;Even if you&apos;re moderately angered, if you start to get stressed you are at risk of heart attacks. Certainly you get demotivated,&apos; said Stewart. Yet such problems are destined to increase if the government approves the third runway after consultations end. If so, Russell predicts a riot. Previous campaigns over Heathrow expansion have been hard-fought but have failed. This time things may be different.  &apos;There are enough people in West London - I&apos;m not talking about young firebrands, I&apos;m talking about retired people who don&apos;t worry about this any more - who are prepared to take direct action,&apos; he says. &apos;They&apos;ll go through the consultation, and if at the end the government announces it&apos;s going ahead you&apos;ll find there are masses of West London residents who&apos;ll take direct action. &apos;There&apos;s anger: everybody was told it was about choice, then they get no choice whatsoever. A democratic government is elected on behalf of its citizens, and if it always sides with the corporations it&apos;s a dereliction of its duties.&apos; \u00b7 Additional research by Will Walker", "sentences": ["Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport already has five runways and Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle airport has four.", "&apos;But if a managing director can&apos;t fly to China via London, he might go via Amsterdam for his connecting flight,&apos; he says.", "&apos;If you&apos;ve got UK-based managing directors flying to Amsterdam every night, in the end the company might think about basing everything there too.&apos; Of course it&apos;s not just business that would benefit from the new runway, say supporters."], "title": "Britain's new eco battle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/27/travelandtransport.carbonemissions", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Heathrow", "Transport", "UK news", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-01-28T10:37:56Z", "article": "Some ten years after their last formal release, trip-hop pioneers Portishead are releasing their fourth album, cleverly named Third, on April 14.

Maltman opened his programme with Rosemonde, which deals with the emotional fallout from casual sex in Amsterdam, and closed it with the Chansons Gaillardes, Poulenc&apos;s rather clever 1926 setting of extracts from a collection of 17th-century porn. Given the supposedly conservative nature of the Wigmore audience, one wondered how Maltman might tackle all this, and also just what the reaction might be. In fact, he delivered it all with the confidence of an accomplished raconteur who trades indiscretions with his listeners in order to shock and amuse. The audience giggled as he ruefully sighed his way through S\u00e9r\u00e9nade (about postcoital detumescence) and laughed along with him during L&apos;Offrande (about virgins and candles).

Where long haul traffic has been hit was post-9/11 and after the first Gulf war,&quot; he said. The BA boss added that business class bookings were not &quot;recession proof&quot; but support would also come from the growing Asian market, which economists are hoping will continue to grow despite the US downturn. BA&apos;s strength in the UK to US market is a significant factor in investors&apos; confidence in the business. Transatlantic travel accounts for about two-thirds of BA&apos;s earnings, according to analysts, with business cabins the most significant contributor to profits. BA said this morning that transatlantic premium traffic remained &quot;strong&quot;. Walsh added that economy class sales to European destinations such as Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam also fell in January, on top of weak premium bookings to those destinations, which emerged towards the end of last year. BA is blaming the fall on a combination of Eurostar&apos;s growing success and customer frustration over hand luggage restrictions, which were lifted at most major UK airports earlier this month. &quot;Where we have seen traffic reduce that&apos;s a clear indication that it is moving to the train on the back of hand baggage restrictions,&quot; Walsh said. Shares in BA fell 4.6% to 316.75p as analysts expressed fears that the group will fail to reach its 10% margin target in the next financial year due to rising fuel costs.  In a trading update today BA said that mitigating the high oil price - which will take its fuel bill to more than \u00a32bn in 2007 - will be &quot;challenging&quot; next year. The remark spooked analysts at Deutsche Bank, who said the warning was &quot;another way of saying that margins will fall next year&quot;.  Walsh refused to reassure investors about the chances of achieving the margin target, saying the company will release 2008 guidance next month. He added that BA was &quot;focused&quot; on reaching 10% by the end of its financial year in March, having made a margin of 11.1% in the nine months to December 2007. The BA boss also dismissed concerns that there is little room left for cost cuts at the carrier as rising fuel prices threaten profits. &quot;We still think that there are areas of our cost base that we can continue to improve on,&quot; he said, citing a 6.9% reduction in employee costs to \u00a31.6bn so far this year, largely due to a deal on closing BA&apos;s pensions deficit. He added: &quot;I would not say that we have come anywhere close to finishing on costs.&quot;", "sentences": ["Walsh added that economy class sales to European destinations such as Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam also fell in January, on top of weak premium bookings to those destinations, which emerged towards the end of last year."], "title": "Fuel bill takes shine off BA results", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/01/britishairwaysbusiness", "tags": ["British Airways", "Business", "Travel", "Travel & leisure"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-01T16:58:34Z", "article": "EVERY DOG &apos;AS ITS DAY As Benjani Mwaruwari celebrated after notching up his hat-trick against Ramsbottom County a few weeks ago, the Fiver noticed a visually impaired (or blind, as the condition was described in the days before the whole world went PC mad) Portsmouth fan sitting behind the goal, having his ear nuzzled by his guide dog&apos;s nose. At least that&apos;s what we thought, until closer inspection led us to the conclusion that this man&apos;s trusty Labrador was actually telling him who&apos;d scored. Of course we appreciate that sounds ridiculous - after all, the eagle-eyed pooch could have been saying anything: &quot;What happened there? I missed it because I was licking myself,&quot; for example. Or &quot;I still think we should sell him to Human Rights FC and get Jermain Defoe in from Spurs instead.&quot; Assuming it was the latter, then Pompey&apos;s second-wiliest old dog, bloodhound lookalike &apos;Arry Redknapp, set about wheeling &apos;n&apos; dealing &apos;is way into the Lab&apos;s good books yesterday, by bringing in Defoe for \u00a39m, while making some attempt to balance the books by shipping &apos;Benj&apos; up to Manchester for the equivalent of 1,300 imaginary shares in Liverpool FC. Sadly, it emerged today the Zimbabwean&apos;s transfer had collapsed due to his failure to make it to Manchester in time before the transfer deadline day clock struck 12 and his horse-drawn carriage turned into mice and a pumpkin.

Anyway, the point is that Holland or the Netherlands or whatever it is, is a laid-back place, so much so that the Eredivisie&apos;s defenders sat back and let Afonso Alves score 68 goals in just 0.4 appearances during his time at Heerenveeneneneenen. But a few people were anticipating Alves would be in for a tougher time after his arrival at Middlesbrough just before the transfer window slammed shut last night. Now he&apos;ll be playing against Premier League defenders such as Tyrone Mears and Martin Taylor. And, more importantly, playing alongside Mido. But now it looks like Alves might not get the chance to fail to latch on to Robert Huth&apos;s big punts up the pitch until the beginning of next Championship season. One of his former clubs, AZ Alkmaar, insist they still have a claim on Alves and they&apos;re not happy about it, readers. They&apos;re. Just. Not. Happy. &quot;He really has a chance of getting banned from playing for the rest of the season,&quot; said AZ chairman Dirk Scheringa. &quot;We have a watertight contract with him.&quot; Now, the Dutch FA says AZ don&apos;t have much of a case, but Alves could be prevented from playing against Newcastle in Sunday&apos;s Tyne-Tees derby. And that really would be a shame for him, because against Kelvin Koogan&apos;s defence the striker would have a decent chance of improving his strike-rate to 168 goals in 1.4 appearances. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL In the did-he/didn&apos;t-he mystery that has gripped the nation, Reading boss Steve Coppell now denies receiving a \u00a37m bid from Bolton for Bluetooth bongo star Leroy Lita.

For those whose teenage years were punctuated by 9/11, the Iraq war, and the Democrats&apos; near-miss in the 2004 elections, just the idea of Barack Obama is irresistible. On the sprawling campus of the University of Missouri, located in a key battleground state in Tuesday&apos;s national primary, there is an even more compelling reason to be for Obama. Supporting Hillary Clinton means social death. &quot;Having a hip candidate like him makes it difficult to support someone else,&quot; admits Mark Buhrmester, 21, who until recently headed the Democratic club on campus. &quot;Young people talk about politics a lot. Barack Obama is in style so if you don&apos;t support Barack Obama, it&apos;s like you are not in style.&quot; Such a strong, almost cult-like following could prove a crucial advantage for Obama heading into Tuesday&apos;s titanic contest in an election year which has seen more young people voting than ever before. A young generation of Democratic activists argues their concerns are different than those of their elders. They claim to have grown up in an age when race and gender no longer mattered, and they are unmoved by the great culture wars over abortion and gay marriage. Their issues are the war in Iraq, global warming, and the cost of health care. But their real concerns run even broader, towards a wholesale rejection of the coarsening of America&apos;s political climate. &quot;We&apos;ve grown up in a time where there has been extraordinary bitterness in Washington. We have a president who doesn&apos;t care about the problems that we face and a Congress that is in support of that uncompassionate agenda,&quot; said Buhrmester. &quot;When you come of age in the age of George W Bush, it makes it very easy to be cynical - and very easy to be a Democrat.&quot; Obama has been as much a beneficiary as a catalyst of that sentiment. He owes his first win over Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses to overwhelming support from young voters, as well as his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary a week ago. In the closing days before Super Tuesday, that support is percolating upwards through the generations - drawing parallels with the activist era of the sixties after years when commentators have been deploring the apathy of the young. When Caroline Kennedy endorsed Obama this week, she said the Democratic candidate reminded her of her father, the late John F Kennedy. But she was also strongly persuaded by her three teenage children who were all Obama supporters. &quot;They were the first people who made me realise that Barack Obama is the president we need,&quot; she told a rally in Washington DC. Not that the Clintons are giving up on the youth vote or Missouri. Chelsea Clinton visited the campus earlier this week; Bill Clinton is due in town tomorrow. Hillary Clinton will hold a rally in St Louis on Sunday, a day after an appearance by Obama. But Obama&apos;s appeal to young voters has reconfigured the political landscape for the Democrats. Although Democrats of all ages are energised this year, there is no keeping pace with the enthusiasm of young voters. Turnout among young voters in the Iowa caucuses rose by 135% over 2004, against 90% for the overall population. Overwhelmingly those young voters came out for Obama. He won the under-25 vote by a margin of 5 to 1. His popularity among young people stayed solid even in states he went on to lose. In New Hampshire, Obama carried the under-25s by a 3 to 1 margin over Clinton although, crucially, she won more voters than he did in the 25-29 age group. In Nevada, Obama still outpolled Clinton among the under-25s by 2 to 1. In South Carolina, where Obama got more than twice as many votes as Clinton, he won three to one in the youth vote. Other politicians in this election season have resonated with young voters, and on the internet. There was a time when you could not set foot on Mizzou - as locals call it - without seeing a chalk scrawl on the pavement reading: &quot;Google Ron Paul&quot;. Paul is a Texas congressman running for the Republican nomination. But Obama was able to translate his virtual appeal into votes, and into a campaign strategy that effectively uses new social networking tools - like Facebook - as well as old-fashioned organisation. The Obama camp was the first to found a local supporter chapter on campus in the spring of last year. By summer break, local organisers had a list of several hundred supporters, said Glenn Rehn, who heads Students for Obama on campus. Over the summer, Rehn, 25, a final year student who is a veteran of campaigns, spent a few days at Camp Obama in Chicago learning how to organise, &quot;how to create a buzz&quot;, as he says. When the new term began last August, he put his new skills to use and set up information tables once or twice a week. Yes, Obama had tens of thousands of supporters on Facebook, but Rehn and other organisers still resorted to phone lists to get people to events and repeated pleading with their fellow students. The early exposure was crucial, he believes, to attracting first year students who arrived on campus looking for belonging. &quot;A lot of new kids, freshmen starting in the fall, really didn&apos;t have anything to be involved in,&quot; he said. Clinton&apos;s supporters on campus trace a similar disaffection with the Bush era. Denise Gilmore, 22, the daughter of an African-American army officer and a German mother who was raised in Germany and Kansas, sees her coming of age as a process of disillusion. For her, the breaking point came in the spring of 2003 when Colin Powell, then the US secretary of state, stood before the United Nations to make the case for the war on Iraq. Powell had always been a &quot;trusted source&quot; for her, Gilmore says, but as it is now known he was using false information. Redemption came during a break from college in Amsterdam when she was struck by the goodwill Clinton had overseas. &quot;That made me think if she already has that trust abroad, she is what we need.&quot; But Gilmore admits she is a minority on campus. The Facebook group of Clinton supporters on this campus of 21,000 is barely 35 or 40 members. She insists she would be equally proud to have Clinton or Obama as president, and that the skills she is learning now will serve her for a lifetime in politics. Other campus activists offer a similar argument, that they are the first wave of a coming generation of politically engaged youth. The media may be obsessed by the greying of the baby boomers, with the first born of the post-war population bulge now picking up their pension cheques - but a new generation is just coming into its own. As proof of their growing influence over the electorate, they point to the efforts by all the campaign to get their attention: the Facebook groups, the YouTube videos, even the occasionally cringe-making pronouncements of candidates about what&apos;s on their iPod. (Obama claims to listen to Beyonce and Jay-Z). By 2015, voters under the age of 30 will make up one third of the US electorate. Their concerns may echo those of the sixties, but for this year at least they are in the age of Obama.", "sentences": ["Redemption came during a break from college in Amsterdam when she was struck by the goodwill Clinton had overseas."], "title": "Youth inspired by Obama's appeal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/01/usa.barackobama", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Barack Obama", "US elections 2008", "US politics", "Missouri"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-02T09:05:00Z", "article": "     If there had been a scam sub-plot in the movie House of Flying Daggers, it couldn&apos;t have been more exquisitely choreographed than the one we fell for. Here&apos;s how the swindle unfolded. Asking directions just off Tiananmen Square on our first evening in Beijing, my wife and I were approached by two Chinese &quot;students&quot; who offered to take us on a tour of the hutong, the labyrinth of medieval back streets that encircle the city.  Along the way, a dainty traditional teahouse materialised out of the darkness, complete with carved wooden booths and walls decked with scroll paintings of mountains and dragons. There was even a monk in the corner, intently practising his calligraphy.  On cue, a beautiful young waitress - whose name, we were told, was Fairy-Angel! - wafted in and announced that a tea ceremony was about to begin. She produced a tray of different teas and served up some delectable numerology: seven for friendship, eight for wealth and - my choice - nine for long life. She then brewed up each tea in a glass pot before serving them in thimble-sized cups. All had restorative properties and were accompanied by intricate tales involving the tea-loving Emperor Qianlong, who frequented Beijing&apos;s teahouses in disguise, causing his entourage to kowtow in code using their fingers on the table-top. But most captivating aspect was the teas themselves; the most delicious little cuppas I&apos;d ever tasted. One was brewed not from leaves but from what looked like fine aromatic gravel and tasted like sweet, sooty ginger. Another fluttered magically in the pot and was phenomenally bitter and bracing. Soon, our booth had descended into an orgy of titanic tea-tasting. And then it came, like a grenade lobbed into the festivities: the wallet-busting bill, the Yuan equivalent of an eye-popping \u00a3200. Even after an extended bout of haggling, the amount was still enough to cover a year&apos;s supply of tea anywhere in the world. But once the shock had subsided, we couldn&apos;t help feeling strangely elated. As our first big test, the tea ceremony couldn&apos;t have been a more a staggering illustration of the whole purpose of our mission in China. Our brief for the trip was disarmingly simple. Received wisdom dictates that China should only be tackled in the regimented ranks of a hermetically sealed, full-service tour. The Chinese Embassy reinforces this by tying up independent travellers in visa red tape. However, our long-held dream of travelling through this vast country didn&apos;t featured being bused around, plugged into each sanitised sight, shackled to a claustrophobic band of foreigners. We were determined to make our own sweet, unchaperoned way across the entire length of China, using only local transport, from Beijing to the Terracotta Army in Xian, from the inhospitable deserts of the northwest to the holy mountain of Emei Shan and along the Yangtze before crossing the finish line in Hong Kong. Everyone - particularly those who had found five-star tours gruelling - told us that the idea was sheer lunacy. Many hotels are still not authorised to accept foreigners. Train tickets are snapped up faster than a Led Zeppelin reunion concert. China veterans warned of everything from being gawked at like pop stars to spitting in public to partition-less toilets that allow users to &quot;squat and chat&quot;. After our tea ceremony misadventure, we wondered if the doom-mongers had a point. But, next morning, we dusted ourselves down and headed back out into the field. We kicked off with the exhilarating expanse of Tiananmen Square and marvelled at its inhuman scale, borne down on one side by the gargantuan, colonnaded Great Hall of the People and on the other by the embalmed spectacle of Mao in his glittering crystal coffin. We then plunged fearlessly into the Imperial splendour of the Forbidden City, the epitome of Ming dynasty China with its sweeping courtyards, blood-red walls and palaces, and clusters of yellow-tiled roofs, their curly upturned eaves breaking against the blue sky like golden waves. All around, sullen tour groups were herded along by Chinese guides yelling through miniature megaphones. By comparison, we spent hours ambling through the Imperial Gardens and dawdling by the Hall of Supreme Harmony, soaking up the peace and serenity. On our second day, we headed off with breathless anticipation for the most formidable obstacle on our Chinese assault course: the Great Wall. Once we&apos;d scrummed our way past the souvenir sellers, we were amazed to find the wall itself practically deserted. We spent a sublime afternoon, hiking along the ramparts and watchtowers, witnessing the world&apos;s greatest structure unfurl before us like a gigantic stone ribbon, fluttering all the way to the distant, hazy grey mountain tops. After another day spent scooting through Beijing on rented bikes, taking in every pagoda and bell tower, we reckoned we were doing relatively well. But we still had to face our first real test of independent locomotion: the night train to Datong, just over 300km west. In the station concourse, crowds of Chinese huddled round to watch us perform such astonishing feats as buying water for the journey and using a payphone. Our &quot;hard sleeper&quot; carriage turned out to be a dorm on rails. It wasn&apos;t the most comfortable ride, but it fizzed with bleak communist-era romanticism. Datong served up two of China&apos;s lesser-known treasures: the Yungang caves, where gigantic, 17m droopy-lobed Buddhas peer serenely through huge holes punched in the rock-face; and the Hanging Temple, a precarious wooden network of walkways and altars clinging lichen-like half way up a terrifying sheer cliff. That evening, we toasted our open-road brief with Chinese beer and a feast of spicy donkey, Datong&apos;s culinary speciality (think Spam, but more gristly). We ended Phase I of our trip with another of China&apos;s stellar attractions: the Terracotta Warriors in Xian. The radiance of the figures - created to guard the tomb of first emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century BC and only discovered in 1974 by peasants sinking a well - was among our main motivations for visiting China. Despite being incarcerated in a phenomenally ugly concrete hangar, they didn&apos;t disappoint - over 8,000 foot soldiers, cavalry and generals, all modelled on real members of Qin&apos;s army, marching sombrely out of the ferrous earth. By now, we&apos;d cut our teeth on China&apos;s major sights, and were beginning to enjoy the white-knuckle ride. Difficulties persisted: the Datong donkey triggered days of intestinal grief, complicated by the open-plan loos; and nothing could prepare for the symphonic levels of hawking and spitting. Also, none of the hotels I&apos;d reserved from the UK had actually recorded our booking when we arrived. But we&apos;d managed so far to avoid camping in a Chinese alleyway and were relishing the prospect of moving up a gear in Phase II, a detour that few organised tours would ever consider. We were heading out to China&apos;s arid extremity in the far northwest: the Uighur autonomous region of Xinjiang. As we flew into the regional capital of Urumqi, China seemed to undergo a jolting transformation; the terraced rice fields evaporated into a blinding infinity of flat, featureless desert. Swarthy Uighurs, a rebellious Turkic people, supplanted the Han Chinese. After catching our breath overnight in the oasis town of Turpan, we hired a car and weaved out along a lonely highway through the sands as far as the ancient ruins of Jiaohe, a thriving market city on the Silk Road until it was sacked by the Mongols in the 13th century. Today, it&apos;s an earthen skeleton half-submerged in the dunes.  We moved on, swerving through the fiery peaks of Flaming Mountain, mythical inferno-red ridges rising out of the blanched sand. Eventually, we reached the even more remote ghost city of Gaochang, and took a juddery ride by mule to its furthest point; here the fortifications are now just faint silty indentations. We might have left it at that, but we had heard that it was possible to continue beyond the sanctuary of the oasis belt and right out into the Taklamakan desert - a quarter of a million square kilometres of wasteland whose name translates as: &quot;enter and you will never leave!&quot;  We asked our driver to continue, arriving in pitch dark at our stopover, an Uighur guesthouse decked with sumptuous tapestries. With a band of Chinese adventurers also staying at the inn, we rose at 5am and tramped out over the dark freezing dunes. Each was taller than the last, and for a time, we feared that we were going to miss the moment of sunrise. We finally clawed to the top of a mountain of sand shortly before the sun peeked over the horizon and the entire expanse of Taklamakan was lit up in an intense burst of incandescent orange. We all sat transfixed. It was one of those transcendent moments that burns into the memory and lingers for a lifetime. We could have stayed weeks longer in Xinjiang and only reluctantly returned to central China, flying back to Chengdu in the Sichuan heartlands, before busing it south for the pilgrimage up the holy Buddhist peak of Emei Shan. Strewn with over 20 active Buddhist monasteries and furrowed by hundreds of kilometres of precipitous stone stairways, it&apos;s one of the China&apos;s great devotional wonders.     Sitting on the fence ... a resident of the holy mountain of Emei Shan    In preparation for the climb, we took a room in the magnificent 16th-century Baoguo monastery at the foot of the mountain, a complex of fluttering rooftops, shadowy courtyards and gleaming golden shrines, all lit by banks of prayer candles and shrouded in thick incense. We were woken at 4.30am by the gentle incantation of the monks, and after a breakfast of rice porridge, we set off. It was relatively gentle at first, but soon the pathways soared upwards. To make matters worse, we were periodically attacked by bands of aggressive monkeys snatching at our packs with teeth bared. Our reward came at the monastery pit-stops when the cedar forests drew aside to reveal the most ravishing mountain vista, peaks bucking and rearing into the distance.  Near the top, the oxygen thinned, making the last sections a breathless ordeal. A descending mist stole away the view but gave the Golden Summit a giddy sense of mystery. The giant 30 metre elephant that sits at the top seemed like a gilded spirit etched into the fog. The heady mix of oxygen deprivation and the immense sense of achievement brought tears to our eyes. By now, we had almost forgotten about the independent travel challenge. The tea ceremony was a distant memory, and the desert and Emei Shan had been triumphs. We were convinced that the notion that China couldn&apos;t be travelled independently was a myth.  But that was all about to change. To begin with, the bus to our next destination, to the Yangtze river port of Chongqing, was a shuddering boneshaker, hurling us around like a cruel fairground ride. A Chinese family boarded carrying sackfuls of live chickens, their scrawny necks protruding, and for the eight-hour journey, we endured clucking, dropping and malicious pecking. Our ferry - the Long Moon - turned out to be a rusty old junk with &quot;first class&quot; berths boasting only two bare beds and a pungent squat toilet. On the first night, I was awoken by a gangly silhouette creeping through the window. I sprung up and for a moment was staring into startled eyes just inches from my own. He instantly disappeared, cart-wheeling back out through the window, then acrobatically back-flipping up the side of the boat before vanishing through a window in the upper decks. I stood guard for the rest of the night, brandishing my camera tripod and watching the figure scuttle up and down the side of the boat, diving into other cabins before flitting away, a limber outline in the light of the moon. When the sun came up, we&apos;d finally hit the Three Gorges, slices of bare rock soaring up on each side of the river. They were astonishingly beautiful, but we were now unnerved and jittery. We tried to regain momentum at our final stopover, a nature reserve called Jiangjaijie, recommended ecstatically by every Chinese we&apos;d met, with shard-like karst rock formations soaring thousands of feet in the air. But it turned out to be as crowded as the Beijing metro, so we fled after just one day. As we finally crossed the frontier to Hong Kong, the yelling, tooting and mayhem all ebbed away, and we realised that we were experiencing something we&apos;d almost forgotten existed in the previous month: relaxation. So, for the final verdict: can China be successfully travelled outside the confines of a tour? Well, on a very basic level, we&apos;d proved that it can be done. But the journey was enormously taxing and, at times, downright dangerous. Sometimes we felt we were viewed merely as curiosities or prey. But even taking into account the hairiest moments, our experiences in the Taklamakan desert and on Emei Shan - and our encounters on ferries and in tea-houses - are likely to stay with us forever. Ultimately, if you&apos;re looking for a hassle-free, chill-out holiday, then China may not be the best choice - regardless of whether you take a tour or not. But if you&apos;re ready for a wild, stimulating adventure that will bring you into contact with the unreconstructed lawlessness of China, in all its horn-tooting, phlegm-hacking, scintillating reality, then taking on this unruly country independently is the only way to go.

With their teenage years punctuated by 9/11, the Iraq war, and the Democrats&apos; near-miss in the 2004 elections, just the idea of Barack Obama is irresistible. On the sprawling campus of the University of Missouri, in a key state in next Tuesday&apos;s national primary, the most compelling reason to be for Obama is simple: supporting him has become really cool. &quot;Having a hip candidate like him makes it difficult to support someone else,&quot; admits Mark Buhrmester, 21, who until recently headed the Democratic club on campus. &quot;Young people talk about politics a lot. Barack Obama is in style, so if you don&apos;t support Barack Obama, it&apos;s like you are not in style.&quot; Such a strong, almost cult-like, following could prove a crucial advantage heading into Tuesday&apos;s contest in an election year which has seen more young people voting than ever before. A young generation of Democratic activists say they have different concerns from their elders. They claim to have grown up in an age when race and gender no longer mattered, and to be unmoved by battles over abortion and gay marriage. Their issues are Iraq, global warming, and healthcare. But their real concerns run even broader, towards a rejection of the coarsening of America&apos;s political culture. &quot;We&apos;ve grown up in a time where there has been extraordinary bitterness in Washington,&quot; said Buhrmester. &quot;We have a president who doesn&apos;t care about the problems that we face and a Congress that is in support of that uncompassionate agenda. When you come of age in the age of George W Bush, it makes it very easy to be cynical, and very easy to be a Democrat.&quot; Obama has been as much a beneficiary as a catalyst of that sentiment. He owes his first win, in the Iowa caucuses, to overwhelming support from young voters - as well as his huge victory in the South Carolina primary a week ago. That support is now percolating upwards through the generations - drawing parallels with the 1960s - after years in which the apathy of the young has been deplored. When Caroline Kennedy endorsed Obama this week, she said he reminded her of her father, John F Kennedy. And her three teenage children were all Obama supporters. &quot;They were the first people who made me realise that Barack Obama is the president we need,&quot; she told a rally in Washington DC. Not that the Clintons are giving up on the youth vote, or Missouri. Chelsea visited the campus this week and Bill is due in town today. Hillary will hold a rally in St Louis tomorrow, a day after an appearance by Obama. But Obama&apos;s appeal to young voters has reconfigured the Democratic landscape. Turnout among young voters in the Iowa caucuses rose by 135% over 2004&apos;s figure, much more than in the overall population. Overwhelmingly those young voters came out for Obama. He won the under-25 vote by five to one. His popularity among young people stayed solid even in states he went on to lose. In New Hampshire, he carried the under-25s by three-to-one over Clinton although, crucially, she won more voters than him in the 25-29 group. In Nevada, Obama outpolled Clinton among the under-25s by two to one. In South Carolina, where Obama got more than twice as many votes as Clinton, he won three-to-one in the youth vote. Other politicians in this election season have resonated with young voters, and on the internet. There was a time when you could not set foot on campus without seeing a chalk scrawl on the pavement supporting a Republican nominee: &quot;Google Ron Paul&quot;. But Obama was able to translate his virtual appeal into votes, and a campaign strategy that uses new social networking tools. The Obama camp was the first to found a local group on campus in the spring of last year. By the summer break, there were several hundred supporters, said Glenn Rehn, who heads Students for Obama on campus. In the summer, Rehn, 25, went to Camp Obama in Chicago, learning &quot;how to create a buzz&quot;, he says. When term began last August, he put his new skills to use and set up information tables once or twice a week. Although Obama had tens of thousands of supporters on Facebook, Rehn and other organisers resorted to phone lists - and repeated pleading with their fellow students - to get people to events. He believes this early work was crucial in attracting first-year students as they arrived - &quot;a lot of new kids, freshmen starting in the fall, really didn&apos;t have anything to be involved in.&quot; Clinton&apos;s supporters on campus trace a similar disaffection with the Bush era. Denise Gilmore, 22, the daughter of an African-American army officer and a German mother, who was raised in Germany and Kansas, sees her coming of age as a process of disillusionment. For her, the breaking point came in spring 2003 when Colin Powell, then the secretary of state, stood before the UN to make the case for war on Iraq. Powell had always been a &quot;trusted source&quot; for her, Gilmore says, but as is now known he was using false information. Redemption came during a break from college in Amsterdam when she was struck by the goodwill Clinton had overseas. &quot;That made me think, if she already has that trust abroad, she is what we need.&quot; But Gilmore admits she is in a minority on campus. The Facebook group of Clinton supporters on this campus of 21,000 struggles to reach 40 members. She insists she would be equally proud to have Clinton or Obama as president, and that the skills she is learning now will serve her for a lifetime in politics. Other campus activists offer a similar argument - that they are the first wave of a coming generation of politically engaged youth. The media may be obsessed by the greying of the baby boomers, but a new generation is just coming into its own. As proof of their growing influence over the electorate, they point to the efforts by all the campaigns to get their attention: the Facebook groups, the YouTube videos, even the occasionally cringemaking pronouncements of candidates about what&apos;s on their iPod (Obama claims to listen to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z). By 2015, voters under the age of 30 will make up a third of the US electorate. Their concerns may echo those of the 60s, but for this year at least, they are in the age of Obama.", "sentences": ["Redemption came during a break from college in Amsterdam when she was struck by the goodwill Clinton had overseas."], "title": "After a lifetime with Bush, only the hippest candidate will do", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/02/usa.uselections2008", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "US elections 2008", "Barack Obama", "US politics", "Missouri"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-03T11:08:54Z", "article": "1. Jungle Bay, Dominica  Opened in 2005 and set in 55 acres of rainforest, Jungle Bay (junglebaydominica.com) was built on strong eco-principles - from preserving trees and wildlife to using local labour and materials - but it doesn&apos;t stint on visual impact. The 35 large stilted, luxurious rooms are all built from wood and have outdoor solar-powered showers to go with the spruced-up Swiss Family Robinson feel. Dominica isn&apos;t about great beaches (what sand there is is black and volcanic) but the hiking and other healthy activities on offer, including kayaking, mountain-biking and whalewatching, more than make up for it. Getting there: Q Holidays (0870 720 1127; qholidays.co.uk) can arrange stays at Jungle Bay from \u00a3110pp a night, including meals, hiking trips, yoga lessons and a half-hour spa treatment. Return flights from Gatwick to Antigua start at \u00a3583.50 with British Airways (ba.com). Onward return flights from Antigua to Dominica start at \u00a368 (liat.com).  2. Jade Mountain, St Lucia      This is not the sort of hotel that gets planned in a corporate boardroom. Perched on top of a hill, it has 24 open-sided rooms, all with views of St Lucia&apos;s iconic Piton mountains and their own infinity swimming pool - which allows you to stargaze, swim and commune with hummingbirds, all without leaving the privacy of your room. Opened last year, Jade Mountain ( jademountainstlucia.com) is the newest hotel from Nick Troubetzkoy, who also owns Anse Chastenet, an early pioneer in quirky Caribbean hotels. This place may be expensive, but it&apos;s also endearingly undeferential - and Anse Chastenet&apos;s bars and restaurants are just a stroll away. Getting there: ITC Classics (01244 355527; itcclassics.co.uk) offers seven nights at Jade Mountain from \u00a33,027pp including flights, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation. 3. Tiamo Lodge, Bahamas  On the outlying Bahamian island of South Andros, this hotel is entirely solar-powered. Designed both to be low-impact and provide local employment, Tiamo (tiamoresorts.com) is very popular with honeymooners and serious anglers (who come for the bone fishing). Wraparound porches compensate for the lack of air-conditioning. Getting there: Windows on the Wild (020 8742 1556; windowsonthewild.com) has a seven night trip, with six nights&apos; full board at Tiamo, including use of kayaks, guided snorkelling (with equipment) and hikes, and one night in Nassau, from \u00a31,975pp, including flights via Miami with American Airlines and the internal flights.  4. Plantation Beach Villas, Tobago This collection of six three-bedroom villas was designed by Swede Arne Hasselqvist, who was also responsible for many houses on the ritzier island of Mustique. Here, amid the gingerbread-style houses, verandas and gardens, the atmosphere is deliberately low-key. There&apos;s a small bar and restaurant, but all the villas have kitchens. The staff (each villa has an attendant) are flexible enough to take you shopping, cook dinner and babysit (or leave you alone), making this an almost perfect destination for families with small children. All the villas share a pool, while uncrowded Stonehaven beach can be reached through a small gate. The front desk can book scuba diving and boat trips (plantationbeachvillas.com).  Getting there: Real Holidays (020 7359 3938; realholidays.co.uk) has seven nights at Plantation Beach Villas from \u00a31,016pp, based on a family of four, including accommodation and flights.  5. Cocobay, Antigua All-inclusive hotels are usually the preserve of big hotel chains, but Cocobay bucks the trend (cocobayresort.com). Most of the 53 rooms are in simple but sweet tin-roofed cottages. They don&apos;t have televisions or phones but all the other facilities are in place. There&apos;s a swimming pool, a bar and two restaurants. The hotel aims to source both food and staff locally and it&apos;s within walking distance of three beaches. However, it&apos;s not an option for families with small children: the minimum age for guests is 14 (except at Christmas). The owners of Cocobay opened Hermitage Bay on Antigua&apos;s west coast last year, which works on the same principles - with a higher level of luxury, and a commensurately higher price. As one recently returned guest put it, &apos;it&apos;s the sort of place that gives all-inclusives a good name&apos;. Getting there: Caribtours (020 7751 0660; caribtours.co.uk) has seven nights at Cocobay, including flights, transfers and all-inclusive accommodation, for \u00a31,061pp. 6. Ku, Anguilla  Anguilla is known for its extraordinarily expensive hotels, but two years ago, Cap Juluca - one of the most exclusive - opened the 27-room Ku (ku-anguilla.com) where the minimalist decor (white walls, white floor, white furnishings) is well suited to the island&apos;s white sand beaches and general air of seclusion. But, like a diffusion range from a top fashion designer, Ku ticks the desirability boxes while remaining within the reach of ordinary mortals, so instead of Cap Juluca&apos;s privacy-minded luxury, Ku is located on a more public beach - with a good choice of local restaurants within walking distance. For pricey Anguilla, it&apos;s a bargain.  Getting there: Tropic Breeze (01548 831550; tropicbreeze.co.uk) has seven nights at Ku on a room-only basis for selected dates between 1 April and 19 December, including flights with BA from Gatwick to Antigua and onward to Anguilla with Liat, from \u00a3999pp. 7. Beau Rive, Dominica       More proof that Dominica has picked up the low-key tourism torch and is running with it, Beau Rive ( beaurive.com), owned by former musician Mark Steele since 2004, has just eight guest rooms, with balconies, within a plantation house, plus a swimming pool. A spice garden adjoins the hotel&apos;s restaurant, which serves whatever is fresh and available. John Faithfull of Trips Worldwide says: &apos;Visitors are made to feel like Mark&apos;s house guests, and we get great feedback from clients.&apos; Getting there: Trips Worldwide (0117 311 4418; tripsworldwide.com) offers holidays from \u00a31,149pp (based on two sharing), including flights to Antigua and on to Dominica with Liat, transfers and seven nights in a double room with breakfast. 8. Ginger Lily, St Lucia The Ginger Lily (gingerlilyhotel.com) may be a simple 11-room hotel but it is perfectly placed for the bars of Rodney Bay and party-minded Reduit beach. Just one block back from the beach, with its own pool, restaurant and bar, it has large rooms, all with balconies, and all of them surrounding a mellow pool area; and the rates are a bargain. It is plugged into the local community, which makes organising activities, including scuba diving and jet-skiing, a doddle.  Getting there: Caribbean Unpackaged (020 8446 8122; caribbean-unpackaged.com) has superior rooms at Ginger Lily from \u00a381 a night, not including flights. Virgin Atlantic (virgin-atlantic.com) flies direct to St Lucia three times a week from Gatwick and once a week from Manchester, return fares from \u00a3595. 9. Petit Bacaye, Grenada       In this collection of five palm-thatched houses, things are kept deliberately simple - there&apos;s no air-conditioning, no television and no swimming pool. However, the beach lies a few steps away, the hotel provides mosquito repellent and there are hammocks at every turn. You&apos;ll probably need a hire car to make the most of Grenada, but there&apos;s a bakery and a mini-market within a short walk, while a swim takes you to a nearby island which is a nature reserve for egrets. Even though all the houses have kitchens, Petit Bacaye ( petitbacaye.com) takes the Caribbean fantasy thing seriously - there are regular beach barbecues, and fishermen deliver their catch to the restaurant daily straight from the boat. It&apos;s owned by Peter Pilbrow and Julia Montgomery, who own the acclaimed Onion Store hotel in Romsey, Hampshire. Getting there: Just Grenada (01373 814214; justgrenada.co.uk) charges \u00a3695pp for a week in a one-bedroom cottage sleeping two, including flights from Gatwick, accommodation and transfers. 10.Hostal Del Tejadillo, Cuba  This is the sort of hotel that you&apos;d hope Havana would be overrun with. Unlike most of the city&apos;s unlovely Soviet-inspired hotels, the Tejadillo is a colonial palace, located on an atmospherically run-down street, near Plaza de la Catedral and five minutes&apos; walk from the Malecon waterfront. Yes, it&apos;s a bit musty and disorganised, and the facilities are a bit basic, but all 32 of the high-ceilinged bedrooms open on to a central courtyard with fountain, and all have a balcony or a patio. And there&apos;s a bar. Getting there: Journey Latin America (020 8747 8315; journeylatinamerica.co.uk) has three nights at the Hostal del Tejadillo, including flights on Virgin Atlantic, from \u00a3630pp.  11.Maca Bana, Grenada  Maca Bana (macabana.com) is a small collection of seven villas on a hillside which share an infinity swimming pool. Decorated by the artist owner Rebecca Thompson, the villas are very well equipped - with proper kitchens, outdoor hot tubs and staggering views. Painting and cookery classes can be arranged, although the improbably beautiful Magazine beach is likely to be the greatest temptation. In general, only children over 12 are welcomed, owing to the steep climb from beach back to the hotel, but the hotel is flexible and can advise families on which are the less precipitous villas. Thompson and her husband also own Aquarium on Magazine beach, considered to be one of Grenada&apos;s best restaurants. Getting there: Caribtours (020 7751 0660; caribtours.co.uk) has seven nights at Maca Bana, including flights, transfers and room-only accommodation, for \u00a31,445pp. 12. Lodge At Chaa Creek, Belize  Even before Francis Ford Coppola opened his eco-lodges in Belize, Chaa Creek (chaacreek.com) was taking the greener approach to tourism. With some road-building help from the British army, this organic farm opened its first rooms in 1981. It is run by an Anglo-American couple, Mick and Lucy Fleming. Lying beside the Macal River in 330 acres of rainforest, it has just 21 stone and palm-thatched cottages, and a restaurant that serves locally sourced food. The eco-principles are still strong - there&apos;s no air-conditioning anywhere on the resort, nor is there a swimming pool - instead, guests can take a dip in the river, and the hotel runs particularly good tours into the local area to visit Mayan ruins.  Getting there: Journey Latin America (020 8747 8315; journeylatinamerica.co.uk) has three nights at Chaa Creek for \u00a31,444pp full board, including British Airways flights (0870 850 9850; ba.com).  13. Gate House, Saba  You can walk from Saba&apos;s tiny airport to the Gate House (sabagatehouse.com). In fact you can walk pretty much anywhere on Saba; this Dutch Caribbean island is just five miles long and has only one road. Saba doesn&apos;t do vast golden-sand beaches but the hiking is as good as the snorkelling and the views across to St Barts come as a bonus. Owned by a French couple, the Gate House also has a notably good restaurant (with an excellent wine cellar) for an island with just 1,500 residents. There are seven guest rooms, which share a swimming pool but families might prefer the hotel&apos;s four-bedroom villa, which has its own private pool.  Getting there: Doubles start at $125 a night including breakfast. Get there by flying to St Maarten via Amsterdam with KLM (klm.com) and then to Saba with Winair (flywinair.com). Alternatively you can fly to Antigua with BA and connect to St Maarten with Winair. 14. Little Arches, Barbados A far cry from Barbados&apos;s torpid (and aptly named) Platinum coast, which is awash with stultifyingly luxurious hotels, the 10-room Little Arches (little-arches.com) is a short walk from the determinedly normal village of Ostins in the south of the island. All the beaches in Barbados are technically public, but Enterprise beach, just across the road from Little Arches, is genuinely so. Used by both locals and tourists, it has a handy stall selling drinks and snacks and a palpable sense of relaxation. Back at the hotel, there&apos;s a small rooftop pool - several of the rooms lead out on to it. Bicycles are also provided for guests (this part of Barbados is pleasingly flat) and the hotel has its own yacht for excursions. It also has a good restaurant, La Luna, which is run by one of the hotel&apos;s co-owners, Mark DeGruchy.  Getting there: Caribbean Expressions (020 7433 2610; expressionsholidays.co.uk) has seven nights at Little Arches from \u00a31,117pp, including flights, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation.  15. Jake&apos;s, Jamaica       Jamaica has some wonderful hotels, including the Rockhouse (where the Rolling Stones cavorted in the 1970s) and Mockingbird Hill, an eco-lodge which runs an adult literacy programme for its employees. However, Jake&apos;s ( islandoutpost.com) on Treasure Beach continues to stand out from the crowd. Part of the Island Outpost empire founded by Chris Blackwell of Island Records fame, but owned by theatrical designer Sally Henzell and her son Jason, this 26-room hotel continues to feel fantastically connected to the local environment. Guests are encouraged to visit local cafes and restaurants. While groovy, endearingly louche Jake&apos;s has traditionally spurned modern conveniences such as air-conditioning and televisions, the hotel&apos;s newly opened Treasure Beach House is a four-bedroom villa which comes with satellite TV, plunge pool and air-conditioning. Getting there: Trips Worldwide (0117 311 4418; tripsworldwide.com) has seven nights&apos; room only at Jake&apos;s from \u00a31,239pp including flights and transfers.", "sentences": ["Get there by flying to St Maarten via Amsterdam with KLM (klm.com) and then to Saba with Winair (flywinair.com)."], "title": "15 Caribbean  gems", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/feb/03/caribbean.stlucia", "tags": ["Caribbean holidays", "St Lucia holidays", "Bahamas holidays", "Antigua and Barbuda holidays", "Anguilla holidays", "Grenada holidays", "Cuba holidays", "Belize holidays", "Barbados holidays", "Jamaica holidays", "Beach holidays", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-04T23:22:02Z", "article": "Good evening: So far the African Cup of Nations has - on the pitch at least - been a breath of fresh air. Teams hurtling forward with limited thought for defence, goals more important than clean sheets and the added prospect that Berti Vogts might again lose his job. It doesn&apos;t get much better than this.  Cameroon are, in a sense, the Sven&apos;s England of the African Cup of Nations. In the past two competitions they&apos;ve been knocked out at the quarter final stage. Unlike Sven&apos;s England, though, they have a superstar striker in Samuel Eto&apos;o who has just set a new all-time African Cup of Nations scoring record, and have proven pedigree having won the whole caboodle four times, including consecutively in 2000 and 2002. Tunisia, according to Jose Mourinho - who has popped up on Eurosport to stick his neb in - are a well-organised team he likes the look of. Which means they have the sort of defensive qualities that have been lacking elsewhere. They won the competition in 2004 and have the better form going into tonight&apos;s game. But Otto Pfister, a man whose name wouldn&apos;t be out of place in the seedier districts of Amsterdam, believes his Cameroon side will prevail. &quot;The worst is over for Cameroon, we have made the necessary corrections and now we have to play to our maximum,&quot; he reckons.  &quot;I&apos;ve seen much worse email addresses in my time,&quot; reckons Philip McGavigan. &quot;Anyway how do you get a job where you can watch a game and jot down some funny remarks? I&apos;d do it for free!&quot; he adds, with uncanny knowledge of the GU remuneration system. Oh... he hasn&apos;t finished. &quot;Anyway it&apos;s \u00a340 on Cameroon and one girlfriend relegated to the bedroom with soap operas to entertain.&quot; Ah, the enlightenment. On the pitch, the Cameroon team are singing their National Anthem with admirable tunelessness. No team news yet, I&apos;m afraid. Ah, here you go: Tunisia: 1-Hamdi Kasraoui; 3-Karim Hagui, 5-Wissem Bekri, 6-Radhouane Felhi, 15-Radhi Jaidi; 8-Mehdi Nafti, 7-Chaouki Ben Saada, 12-Joahar Mnari, 21-Medji Traoui; 9-Yassine Chikhaoui, 11-Francileudo dos Santos  Cameroon: 1-Idriss Carlos Kameni; 8-Geremi, 23-Andre Bikey, 4-Rigobert Song, 5-Timothee Atouba; 10-Achille Emana, 11-Jean Makoun, 15-Alexandre Song, 19-Stephane Mbia; 17-Mohamadou Idrissou, 9-Samuel Eto&apos;o Referee: Koman Coulibaly (Mali) We&apos;re off: Cameroon kick off and immediately charge into the Tunisian area. An over-hit pass goes out for a corner. Good attacking intent, which they&apos;ll need as the Tunisian defence is strong. 3 min: Idrissou hits a high cross into the area, which is easily cleared. From it, Geremi takes a long throw, aimed at Eto&apos;o but there&apos;s a foul in the box. Neither team has settled here, unsurprisingly since we&apos;re only three minutes in. 5 min: Eto&apos;o runs into the box but his cutback goes to no-one. Cameroon are trying to play one-touch stuff, which will make the game thrilling if it continues. Tunisia, for their part, are playing no-touch football since they haven&apos;t really got near the ball yet. 7 min: Eto&apos;o chases down a lost cause, flicks it back to Geremi whose cross is met by the little man Makoun at the far post. He heads down into the ground and it bounces both over and wide. Tunisia take the ball into the Cameroon half then panic and hoof it aimlessly into the box. 9 min: Mbia goes in for a 50-50 ball with Chikhaoui - both go feet first and Mbia comes off worse. A minor bout of handbags ensues before Cameroon launch a free-kick Eto&apos;o-wards. Still Tunisia have been barely touched the ball. 11 min: Tunisia have their first attack of the game. Chikhaoui nicks the ball of Geremi - the second time that happened to the Newcastle defender. The Tunisian striker dribbles into the box then, after a quick step-over, fires a shot across the face of the goal. Could have easily been a goal. 13 min: Bit shaky at the back from Tunisia. A ball is put into the Tunisian box and Idrissou attempts to stick it in, keeper Kasraoui gets in the way and eventually it&apos;s scrambled clear. It leads to a Tunisia break which Geremi (I think) proceeds to clear - from the halfway line - into row Z. A double donkey clearance. 15 min: Bekri runs up the left flank and puts a cross in but the Cameroon box is bereft of Tunisians. They really aren&apos;t throwing anyone forward at all. Minutes later Nafti commits a lunging foul that could have earned him a red card. 17 min: &quot;Your email address sounds like the name of a current anime offering. By any chance do you have really large eyes?&quot; asks Bill Mendelsohn. Only for you Bill, only for you. Tunisia hit a good free-kick into the Cameroon area. Kameni punches clear to Eto&apos;o, who races up the other end and wins a corner. GOAL! Tunisia 0-1 Cameroon (Mbia 18): Mistake from keeper Kasraoui. He punched a corner out when he should have caught it. Cameroon swing a cross back in but Kasraoui again misses it, leaving Mbia at the far post to stuff it in the net. 21 min: Kasraoui really shouldn&apos;t have come for that, the goal goes down as a keeper error. Meanwhile Eto&apos;o catches Nafti on the back of the ankle. He rolls about on the floor for a while but, on seeing the medical team, stretcher and ref bearing down on him decides that, after all, he&apos;s probably alright. 24 min: Cameroon look very comfortable and are playing at a frantic pace. Eto&apos;o is very much the target man and Tunisia know it, which means a lot of the other Cameroonians are being unmarked. Emana makes the most of that space by lashing a shot wide from just outside the area. 26 min: Though the crowd are making all sorts of racket - there are horns, drums, singing and shouting - every time the camera pulls back it is to reveal an empty-looking stand. Odd. Tunisia attempt a ball over the top but dos Santos can&apos;t get onto it. Even if he had, there was no-one to pass it to. Tunisia are dead if they keep this defensive policy up. No wonder Mourinho likes them. WONDER-GOAL! Tunisia 0-2 Cameroon (Geremi, 27): Cameroon win a free-kick 30 yards out, in the middle of the pitch. They make it very clear what they have in mind when every single Cameroon player lines up behind it to take a pop. Geremi is the man who strikes it and it arcs over the wall and into the top corner. Goalie no chance - nor Tunisia at this rate. 30 min: A pre-emptive apology: the mice who run around in their wheels to power the mighty Guardian servers are looking a touch knackered, hence there may be one or two disruptions in service here. Meanwhile Cameroon are pressing home their advantage, giving the Tunisians no time on the ball whatsoever. 32 min: Tunisia get into the Cameroon half once more. Like a vertiginous man atop Everest, they panic though and the Cameroon defenders steal it from them with ease. &quot;Was tommyturbo10 taken?&quot; asks Gerry in Dublin. It was actually. GOAL! Tunisia 1-2 Cameroon (Ben Saada, 34) How did that happen? Tunisia win a free-kick on the edge of the area. Kameni was so concerned about Ben Saada putting a cross in, that he left his near post uncovered, so the Tunisian just slotted it over the wall and into the back of the net. Another great free-kick. 37 min: Cameroon were cruising, that was a shocker on their front. Keeper error again, really. That&apos;s actually possibly why this tournament has been so entertaining - because the keeping has been on the iffy side, leading to all sorts of goal fests. 39 min: &quot;Kudos to the Guardian staff for somehow managing to cut down on the &apos;witch doctor&apos; references when covering African soccer. I only saw one on the Guardian site today!,&quot; writes someone who calls himself Cool Rob, thus doubling the number of references to witch doctors. Kudos to you too. Corner to Cameroon, which they manage to hit several yards behind all their players. 42 min: My word! Dos Santos gets into the area and hammers a shot which slams back off the cross bar. It falls to Ben Saade who hits another fantastic shot from outside the area. It&apos;s a real scorcher, skimming the ground, which Kameni saves magnificently. I take that back about dodgy keeping. Brilliant stuff! 44 min: This game has really come alive now. Tunisia have worked out that the best way to win, is to have the odd pop at goal, while Cameroon&apos;s defence has started to look fragile. Kameni, meanwhile, follows up his great save by chipping a back pass straight to dos Santos in the area. Somehow the Tunisian man can&apos;t capitalise. Peep, peep: Good fight back from Tunisia. The goal really brought them back into it and this is now a game of frantic attacking football from both sides. Eto&apos;o has hardly had a sniff in the last 15 minutes of the first half, which means Tunisia will have to watch out for him in the second half. Half-time: in which your MBM correspondent charges down to the canteen to discover it packed up and with only a solitary sandwich left. Hmmm, could be a hungry night.  Instead, let&apos;s feast on what Robin Hazlehurst says: &quot;Maybe the thing with the keeping is that the saves are magnificent but sometimes the keepers&apos; positioning is a bit off, leading to the goals. How many African keepers play in really top-level clubs where this would be cured? Of course it makes it better for us watching, unlike a lot of Eurofooty where the defences are too clinically efficient to be exciting. Wasn&apos;t it the same at the Women&apos;s World Cup, where dodgy keeping made the tournament much more exciting to watch?&quot; We&apos;re off again: The Tunisian team turned out several hours before the Cameroon one. In fact, so sluggish were the Cameroon players that referee Coulibaly virtually blew for kick-off while they were still struggling on. 47 min: Tunisia throw another ball into the box but it&apos;s well over-hit. It&apos;s been a little scrappy at the beginning of this half. 49 min: Cameroon play the ball through the middle, looking for Eto&apos;o to run onto it. He doesn&apos;t read it and comes short. Meanwhile, I&apos;m eyeing this sandwich. Goat&apos;s Cheese and Asparagus. Not a combo I&apos;ve ever tried before ... or wanted to. 51 min: Bekri puts in a wonderful cross which just goes over dos Santos&apos; head on the penalty spot. He was completely unmarked and between the two Cameroon defenders. Atouba clears behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 53 min: Chikhaoui runs onto a brilliant through ball but Bikey just gets to it before the big Tunisian. He slides in as Chikhaoui was preparing to pull the trigger a couple of yards out. There&apos;s a half-hearted penalty appeal but it&apos;s laughed off. It&apos;s all been Tunisia so far. 55 min: This game is being played at 1000000mph. The Tunisia side on the pitch now appear to be the exact opposite of the one that started the game. Attacking and confident, they&apos;re making Cameroon - no slouches themselves on the attacking front - look positively defensive. 57 min: Mbia limps off, refusing to lower his dignity sufficiently to clamber into the golf cart that has accompanied him ever since he was chopped down. He&apos;s alright though, and runs back on. Binya is warming up in the touchline for Cameroon. 59 min: Cameroon have been forced deeper. It means that, when Eto&apos;o gets the ball three-quarters of the way up the pitch, he has to play a slightly desperate ball which is eventually chased out for a goal-kick. It&apos;s the Cameroon side that need to find their attacking flair again now.  60 min: Eto&apos;o gets a sniff at the Tunisian end but the defence holds strong. They play it through the middle to Ben Saada on the edge of the Cameroon box. He attempts to wrap his foot around the ball, aiming to bend it into the top corner. He makes a dog&apos;s dinner of it though and it&apos;s lucky to miss the corner flag. 63 min: Both Simon Garrett and Daniel Finucane have both emailed in, slightly suspiciously, at exactly the same time to ask exactly the same question: &quot;How&apos;s Song playing?&quot; Alright but nothing spectacular, is the answer, presuming you mean the Arsenal man. Epalle on for Emana. 66 min: Cameroon are in danger of sinking at the moment - their heads have gone down, despite their lead. There&apos;s definitely a Tunisian goal coming, so the Cameroonians would do better to try and score, rather than defend as it&apos;s not their strong point. Makoun off for Binya, the man who plays at Benfica and was banned for six games in the Champions League after that horror challenge. 68 min: The second half, in all honesty, hasn&apos;t quite matched the first so far. The pace has dropped, the balls are being hit long and the one-touch football has been replaced by a more contemplative game.  70 min: Song takes the ball in the D, he had two choices - to shoot or slip Eto&apos;o in. Instead, he passes it into touch. Sorry Simon Garrett and Daniel Finucane. Meanwhile, Mbia gets a face full of studs - accidentally. Tunisia have upped the attacking stakes, by the way, they&apos;ve replaced Nafti with striker Jemaa. 73 min: Eto&apos;o races into the box, having given Jaidi the slip. He&apos;s stopped by a good challenge and it falls to Idrissou who can&apos;t quite dig it out of his feet. The Tunisians then charge up the other end and it takes a magnificent Rigobert Song challenge to prevent a goal. They&apos;ve all woken up again. 75 man: Tunisia strike a free-kick into the box, which all the defenders miss. Fortunately the offside flag goes up as that could easily have been booted into the net. 77 min: Fradj puts in a cross from the halfway line. Kameni stands contemptuously laughing at it until Jemaa gets on the end of it. At which point he looks pleadingly at the linesman who obliges by flagging the striker offside. 79 min: Binya absolutely dumps Chikhaoui on his harris, quite a tasty tackle. Atouba, though, is given the yellow card. Perhaps for something else. Perhaps not. What do I know? GOAL! Tunisia 2-2 Cameroon (Chikhaoui, 80): Stupidity from Atouba, he allowed a tame corner. From it, Tunisia work the ball to Chikhaoui, who slams a great finish into the net from the edge of the box. 83 min: That goal has been coming. It&apos;s not good news for your MBM correspondent however. With extra-time looming, it makes my actual job of night editing the site all the more difficult, since I&apos;ll be chopping out these little vignettes.  85 min: Idrissou hits a screamer of a cross across the Tunisian box. The onrushing attacker just can&apos;t connect. Instead, he should have rolled it back to Eto&apos;o who was free, unmarked, and would have saved me the pain of extra-time. 87 min: Chermiti replaces dos Santos for Tunisia - a striker for a striker. His first touch is to launch an incredibly ambitious shot from about 40 yards, which Kameni just about deals with. The game has returned to its first half status of all-out attack. Good stuff. 89 min: Eto&apos;o strikes a corner into the penalty area which Bikey connects with. It was heading for the goal until it bounced off the back of one of his own players. This really is a thrillingly poised game now. 90min +1: There are two minutes of injury time to play and neither team look like scoring at the moment. They&apos;re saving themselves for extra-time here. Peep, peep: That&apos;s the end of the second half. Extra time beckons... Half an hour to go. This has been a great game. Admittedly it lulled in the middle of the second half but, if it had maintained its pace, all the players would have been finished by now. There&apos;s no silver or golden goal here, so it could be exciting. Tunisia are probably just shading it as the momentum is with them. Sandwich update: bleerruughh. Off we go again: Cameroon work it into the box, but it&apos;s hooked into precisely the spot where nobody is. If that makes any sense. GOAL! Tunisia 2-3 Cameroon (Mbia, 92): Mbia gets his second of the game. A long throw from Geremi is not dealt with in the box, so Mbia fires a snap shot into the bottom right hand corner. Two minutes too late for your MBM reporter but good stuff nonetheless. 95 min: That was against the run of play but very much with the unpredictable, yet exciting run of the game. This has been such a fantastic tournament. 97 min: Epalle runs past Mnari, who brings him down, but the ref lets it go for some reason. Meanwhile, in the crowd, there&apos;s a man painted head to toe in Cameroon colours, wearing a pair of sunglasses Elton John would be proud of, with a football on his head. He&apos;s been standing pointing in front of him for literally the whole game. On the pitch, Mbia is a foot wide of his hattrick. He gets on the end of a long free-kick and glances his header just wide. 90+9 min: Tunisia launch a series of corners at Cameroon, the first of which causes panic until it&apos;s put behind, the second of which was about to land on Chermiti&apos;s head - but gets fumbled out. Kameni claims the third. 90+11 min: &quot;Is it a Tun(isi)a sandwich Tom?&quot; emails Patrick Lehane, which is a joke so bad that it only merits inclusion on here because mine are no better and there&apos;s a brief lull on the pitch to deal with a clash of heads. 90+13 min: Those IT gremlins I was afraid of have struck us down. Things could get a bit Blue Peter from here on. Cameroon, meanwhile, bugger about with the ball outside the Tunisian box. Rather than take the simple option and strike it at goal from no more than 20 yards, they work it back and have a pop from 50, with predictable results. Peep, peep: Tunisia are now the side whose heads have gone down. Cameroon are shading this but, given the ebb and flow of this game, that means Tunisia will probably win the second half of extra time and score to force penalties and thus more stress for your over-worked correspondent.  And we&apos;re into the last 15 minutes: Rigobert Song gives away a dubious foul just outside the Cameroon box and Ben Saada stands over it. He scored from here in the first half but this time his shot hits the wall.  107 min: Jaidi earns himself a yellow card, and thus a suspension, for arguing with the ref after Atouba went down clutching his head. Jaidi seemed to think he was play-acting but the Cameroon man is replaced by Tchato to suggest he&apos;s not. 109 min: A Tunisian corner is whipped in and Chermiti miskicks, leaving the ball to dribble to a Cameroon defender. To make amends, Chermiti throws himself to the floor, rolls about a bit and, when he realises no-one is watching, dusts himself down and gets on with it. 112 min: Eto&apos;o hits a long free kick into the area but Epalle tries to power his header into the net, rather than glance it. The ball balloons well over the bar. At the other end Tunisia waste a corner with a dreadful delivery. Still, they must be knackered.  115 min: Eto&apos;o gets on the end of a long ball but the Tunisian defender steals it from him. Apparently irked by such footballing skill, Eto&apos;o marches up to him and gives him a light headbutt on the nose. There wasn&apos;t much in it but, were the referee not so laissez-faire, that could have been a red. As it is, he waves play on. 117 min: As is customary to say at this sort of stage: there are a lot of tired legs out there. Most of them, it&apos;s fair to say, are on the Tunisian side. Eto&apos;o still looks like a livewire but then he&apos;s done absolutely no tracking back and, instead, has spent the last ten minutes trying to annoy the Tunisian defenders. 119 min: Tunisia don&apos;t look much like scoring anymore, even though Jaidi is operating as an extra striker now. He gets on the end of a cross and is blissfully free in the box. The reason? He&apos;s about a mile offside. He looks absolutely defeated. Peep, peeeeeeeeepppp: That&apos;s it! Cameroon are through to face Gaha, Tunisia are out. A terrific game and probably Cameroon deserve it. But only just. I&apos;m off: Thanks for all your emails. I&apos;m now off to to stick a finger down my throat and get rid of the wretched sandwich I somehow managed to choke down.", "sentences": ["But Otto Pfister, a man whose name wouldn&apos;t be out of place in the seedier districts of Amsterdam, believes his Cameroon side will prevail."], "title": "Minute-by-minute: Tunisia v Cameroon - live!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/04/minutebyminute.africannationscup2008", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "African Nations Cup 2008"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-05T09:00:00Z", "article": "As ever-more EU countries express their deepening concern over recognising Kosovo&apos;s unilateral declaration of independence and deploying an EU mission to replace that of the UN mission in Kosovo (Unmik), both without UN security council authorisation, Europe must urgently re-evaluate how these decisions will impact the development of a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) to meet the challenges of the 21st century and an enlarged EU of 27. Supporting Kosovo&apos;s independence, contrary to both UN security council resolution 1244 (pdf) and Europe&apos;s own stated foreign policy objectives, will only serve to weaken the CFSP&apos;s foundations. It is essential, therefore, that a common EU foreign policy evolves not from its own internal political dynamics, but from a coherent vision founded in its defining principles and practices. As such, Europe must look inward and project outward the core of its political identity. By supporting independence for Kosovo, the EU is abandoning one of the fundamental objectives of its CFSP, as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty; namely, that of preserving peace and strengthening international security, &quot;in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the principle of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter (pdf), including those on external borders&quot;. Disregarding the fundamental principles and norms of international law subverts the very underpinnings of the EU&apos;s CFSP. By putting the interests of individual member states, or coalitions of member states, before its collective principles, the EU is harming the carefully constructed cohesiveness of its own CFSP, thereby diluting its capacity to make future foreign policy decisions. With respect to the second of the five fundamental CFSP objectives - &quot;to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways&quot; - the argument that delaying a status decision will breed further instability overlooks the repercussions of independence for Kosovo. Violating the twin notions of sovereignty and territorial integrity will only serve to erode Europe&apos;s ability to contend with issues of self-determination and re-integration elsewhere. Supporting a unilateral declaration of independence will freeze or exacerbate other conflicts within and beyond the EU&apos;s own expanding borders. The European perspective of the western Balkans will be complicated by the refusal of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and several EU member states to recognise Kosovo; Cyprus will struggle to contend with the implications of independence for its unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, while immediate ramifications will be felt in Europe&apos;s new neighbouring aspirants, Georgia and Moldova. Kosovo is not a unique case and its precedent will not be deterred by reiterations of this sort. Those EU member states who tentatively support independence for Kosovo do so on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan and its implementation. By prescribing independence as a solution, albeit &quot;supervised&quot;, the plan failed to conform to UN security council resolution 1244 and was withdrawn in the face of Russian opposition. In spite of this, the EU has continued to prepare the deployment of a mission to implement the Ahtisaari plan. In the absence of UN security council authorisation, however, any EU mission will be at the behest of the Kosovo government and therefore deprived of formal executive powers. Consequently, international supervision will be unable to provide adequate protection for minority rights. Despite Ahtisaari&apos;s proposal requiring increases in the budgets of Serb-majority municipalities, the Kosovo government continues to plan further cuts. Similar reductions have also been made in the annual budget for returnees, further weakening the position of non-Albanians in the province. The failure of Unmik&apos;s &quot;standards before status&quot; policy demonstrates that unauthorised supervision of Kosovo&apos;s independence will do little to &quot;develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law&quot;, nor to safeguard &quot;respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot; - a third fundamental CFSP objective. The EU&apos;s voice and effectiveness in international affairs derives from its pooled sovereignty, consensual decision-making and instruments of soft power. In relation to Kosovo, the unique position of the EU vis-a-vis both the US and Russia provides it with the leverage to achieve a negotiated resolution; the foundation for which lies in those integrative innovations in sovereignty and autonomy that have contributed to the EU&apos;s very own evolution. It is Europe&apos;s capacity for transforming and softening conflict dynamics through a combination of negotiation and partnership - including development cooperation, external assistance, trade relations and social policy instruments - that provides the basis for lasting peace and stability throughout the western Balkans. For Europe to &quot;make its voice heard in world affairs&quot; (pdf), it must remain committed to the UN system and the principles of international law. The EU will define itself as a global player not by acting decisively through &quot;constructive abstentions&quot; to support an act that violates international legal standards, but by articulating and projecting European principles and practices, including a commitment to complex, multiple layers of shared and limited sovereignty, so as to overcome fragmentation and division. The EU&apos;s stance over Kosovo fails in this regard. A common foreign and security policy for the EU should be just that; one founded upon shared objectives, pursued in accordance with the UN system and international law. As such, Europe must immediately re-affirm that solutions to Kosovo&apos;s status lie in constructive dialogue based upon the EU&apos;s own stated foreign policy objectives and UN security council resolution 1244.

The ad campaign, which breaks this week, features references to famous tie-ups or fans that Adidas has had down the years, including Liverpool football club, Liam and Noel Gallagher from Oasis, Bob Marley and Muhammad Ali. Adidas&apos; new campaign, created by ad agency 180 Amsterdam, depicts a painstakingly reconstructed miniature version of Dassler&apos;s original workshop shot using stop-frame animation. It tells the story of Dassler, whose name was shortened to create the Adidas brand name, creating his first sports shoe in 1925 and, through a tour of his workshop, how over the years the company has grown. The camera moves past objects including a 1980s ghetto blaster, a reference to Run DMC helping to make the brand cool with the rap My Adidas; a skateboard signed by Mark Gonzales; pictures of Bob Marley and Oasis; and a Liverpool flag. Some of the references to sports stars have been made obliquely as there are rights issues around using their actual names. A picture of some boxing boots is accompanied by the line &quot;He made boxing boots for the greatest of all time&quot;, a reference to Muhammad Ali, and mention is made to the creation of &quot;Signature shoes for some of the most colourful tennis players to grace the sport&quot;. There are also pictures and clips of the 1954 German World Cup football winning team, who were kitted out in Adidas boots, Jesse Owens, and Dick Fosbury, inventor of the modern technique for the high jump, the Fosbury flop. The creators of the ad also had to make sure the Liverpool flag did not appear next to the picture of the Gallagher brothers because of their fierce allegiance to Manchester City. Dassler&apos;s workshop was recreated by 30 people and took more than a month to build.  The ad features an original piece of music composed and performed by the Prague Symphony orchestra and is narrated by Das Boot actor Jurgen Prochnow. &quot;It could have been an impossible task given Adi&apos;s hallowed status at Adidas,&quot; said Richard Bullock, the executive creative director at 180 Amsterdam. &quot;Fortunately our client was particularly brave and understood the respect and charm the stop frame technique would lend to his story.&quot; \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

Deliberately disfiguring and damaging strong, healthy young bodies is a work of supererogation if ever there was one. Art used to be about enabling the immortal soul to emancipate itself from the dying animal, but, perhaps because the prospect of decay and death has become so remote for most of us, the non-corporeal has ceased to absorb our interest, leaving the stage free for ghouls and self-harmers. As long as they justify what they do as art, their ghastly and utterly predictable activities will not be interfered with. The mistake made by the sideshow impresarios who used to exhibit bearded ladies, tattooed men, eight-legged goats and dog-faced boys to a goggle-eyed public was that they never stooped to deploy the &quot;art&quot; word; they have disappeared from our civilisation and so we have Gunther von Hagens instead. The cultural heirs of sword-swallowers and fire-eaters are all at art school. When an artist decides that the work will be purely carnal, it is as if he makes an agreement with himself to be uninteresting. What did Chris Burden imagine would happen when he got his assistant to shoot him in the arm in 1971? Luckily for him, the wound was superficial; the bullet didn&apos;t bounce off a bone and kill a bystander, nor did it lodge in his brain. The artwork was probably not meant to include the sheer tedium of his ensuing psychological assessment, or the evaluation and treatment of the wantonly damaged arm (his arm, any human arm, is much more wonderful than anything Burden could have made with it). Ultimately, after a succession of tedious experiments in the 1970s, in which Burden crawled naked through broken glass and had himself nailed to a Volkswagen, he accepted an appointment at UCLA and became head of their (not very) New Genres speciality. He resigned in 2005, after an incident involving a graduate student entering a classroom, producing a gun or replica, spinning the barrel, raising it to his temple, pulling the trigger, then leaving the room. After a gunshot was heard, the student returned, apparently unharmed and unarmed. End of performance. Burden resigned not because the college authorities suspended the student, but because they didn&apos;t. Now in his 60s, he doesn&apos;t need a slug in the arm to enact for him the limits of embodiment. And after Columbine, we don&apos;t do guns in schools any more. Although Burden will enter history as one of the pioneers of body art, for years he has preferred to work with machines. The outer limits of body art were set in the 1960s by the Aktionismus Group: Hermann Nitsch, Rudolf Schwarzkogler, G\u00fcnter Brus and Otto M\u00fchl. By the time photographs of a performance in which Schwarzkogler apparently cut slices off his penis were shown at Documenta V in 1972, the artist had committed suicide. The most sinister aspect of the story is that the photographs were faked; the thing being sliced was not Schwarzkogler&apos;s penis but a replica made of clay. What the viewers of the work were excited by was their mistaken belief that they were witnessing a potentially fatal self-mutilation. Schwarzkogler&apos;s confederates at Aktionismus have taken care ever since not to dispel the illusion. Hermann Nitsch liked to stage blood sacrifices in which a living animal was slaughtered so that participants could wallow in its warm blood and entrails. When Otto M\u00fchl brought a similar act to London in the 1970s, in which a live sheep was to be killed on stage, he was prevented from performing. He was, however, invited to do his thing at the second Wet Dream film festival in Amsterdam. What I saw there was a naked M\u00fchl attempting sex acts - mostly from behind - with an assortment of younger and better-looking people, also naked. He often slapped them so hard that their buttocks bore the red imprint of his hand. The audience looked on, impassive. At one point M\u00fchl shrieked, &quot;Soll niemand mein Schwanz steif machen?&quot; (&quot;Is no one going to make my dick hard?&quot;) - but his organ remained flaccid. A live grey goose was brought into the auditorium; only now do I learn that the intention was to behead it, insert its neck into a condom and penetrate one of the young women with it. Alas, I am doomed to remain without this transcendental art experience. As the goose was being handed over, the poet Heathcote Williams grabbed it, turned and fled out through the crowd, almost lifted off his feet by the great grey goose-wings flapping above him. The tedious polemic goes on to this day. Some will go to their graves believing that Williams sinned against M\u00fchl by preventing him from making his art. I reckon Williams&apos; intervention was a different art, a better art than the brutishness M\u00fchl was foisting on us. Art is a part of life; the part cannot be greater, more valuable or more important than the whole. When there is a conflict between the claims of the two, life must win.", "sentences": ["He was, however, invited to do his thing at the second Wet Dream film festival in Amsterdam."], "title": "Artists' self-mutilation is dull", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/feb/11/artistsselfmutilationisdull", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-12T23:57:21Z", "article": "Andrew Flintoff admits he is fond of India&apos;s &quot;dirty great curries&quot; but he will be seeking a more profound sustenance there in the next few weeks as he looks to rediscover the strength and fitness that made him the finest all-rounder in the world. Flintoff, who joined the England Lions in Baroda on Sunday, has only fond memories of the country. The pictures of him waving his shirt over his head in 2001 are still paint-fresh in the memory after he had been plucked from the national academy to bowl heroically in Tests in Ahmedabad and Bangalore. Then, in 2006, he scored four successive half-centuries in a drawn Test series and proved an inspirational and tactically astute captain in the absence of the injured Michael Vaughan. Now the broken all-rounder is hoping to heal in this spiritual second home following a fourth ankle operation last October. Mike Watkinson, the cricket manager of Flintoff&apos;s county, Lancashire, revealed last night that the player will be given a walk-on part with the Lions. &quot;I understand that Freddie won&apos;t be bowling properly at this stage. But he will be walking through his action to get his arm working again. And he will get plenty of batting in the nets. He looks very fit. And he&apos;s been a good influence at Lancashire recently, where he&apos;s been really positive about his chances of coming back. We don&apos;t see much of Freddie at Old Trafford during the season but we&apos;re hoping he will be able to play at the start of the season. That, though, is very much up to the England camp.&quot; After life with the Lions Flintoff, who was 30 in December, will join the Lancashire Academy players in Mumbai. There he plans to brush up on his batting technique against spin. After returning to England he will join Lancashire on their 12-day pre-season trip to Dubai, which starts on March 10. It is in Dubai that he is expected to run in and bowl fast for the first time since his last round of surgery in Amsterdam. &quot;The only thing I&apos;m interested in is getting fit to play for England again,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to bowl at 90mph again and be a proper all-rounder.&quot; At the weekend England&apos;s Test captain, Vaughan, made it clear that Flintoff would not be considered by England until he could play a full part as an all-rounder, as he did so memorably in the 2005 Ashes series. Flintoff has not played a Test for England since the Ashes series last winter and was clearly unfit when he hobbled through last year&apos;s World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa. After the surgery, which was carried out by Niek van Dijk, one of the world&apos;s leading authorities on arthroscopic treatment, Flintoff spent six weeks in the United States with his family and the physio Dave Roberts. He then spent 10 days in South Africa with Roberts. Last month he had a number of batting sessions with Lancashire&apos;s bowling machine. Flintoff is taking his comeback very slowly and even Lancashire&apos;s chairman, Jack Simmons, the England and Wales Cricket Board&apos;s new chairman of cricket, believes his problems have been caused by not playing enough. He said: &quot;I honestly believe that Freddie&apos;s problems have come from him not having the experience of bowling and bowling until his body builds up to what it can take. We mustn&apos;t mollycoddle our players. That is one reason why they break down because they don&apos;t know what their bodies can take.&quot; Flintoff&apos;s brilliant career has been disrupted by injuries. In 2000 he missed part of the West Indies series because of a back stress fracture. There were more back problems in 2001, followed by a hernia operation, a right shoulder injury in 2003 and four ankle operations.

The study, which included 600 people under the Heathrow flight path, also found that noise from night flights causes immediate increases in blood pressure in sleeping people, even if they do not wake. Campaigners say the results argue strongly for a ban on night flights at UK airports and against the proposed expansion of Heathrow. There are restrictions on night flights from Heathrow. Between 11pm and 7am, the noisiest planes are not allowed to operate and there is a seasonal quota for other take-offs and landings. According to BAA, which runs Heathrow, there are 16 to 18 flights a night on average. Dr Lars Jarup and his team at the department of epidemiology and public health at Imperial College London studied 4,861 people aged between 45 and 70. All participants had lived near Heathrow, Berlin Tegel, Amsterdam Schiphol, Stockholm Arlanda, Milan Malpensa or Athens Elephterios Venizelos airports for at least five years. The team will report in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives that there was a 14% increase in the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) for each 10 decibel increase in night-time aircraft noise. There was no link between aircraft noise during the daytime and hypertension.

Now Peter Greenaway, the iconoclastic British film-maker, has been granted permission to wheel in projectors and bring to life the hidden stories he sees in the masterpiece. Greenaway, 65, announced yesterday that he is planning to use dramatic lighting, projections and recordings of actors&apos; voices to transform the depiction of the moment Christ announced that one apostle would betray him into something close to a film. Instead of capturing just one moment, as Da Vinci did, Greenaway will turn the Last Supper into a narrative that stretches from Christ&apos;s birth to his crucifixion with voice given to the thoughts of each disciple as they work out which of them will betray him. Unsurprisingly for a film director who served up a dead man at a different kind of dinner party in his 1989 film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, Greenaway is courting fresh controversy when his project goes on show in April and May. He plans to project on to the refectory walls &quot;raw and heavy&quot; images of Christ&apos;s genitalia and naked crucifixion, taken from Da Vinci&apos;s other works. It will be &quot;an act of some significance that some people might regard as blasphemous,&quot; he said at the launch in London yesterday. The project is part of an attempt by Greenaway to animate the world&apos;s greatest paintings. His targets include Picasso&apos;s Guernica, Monet&apos;s Waterlilies in Madrid and a Jackson Pollock in New York. He has even asked the Vatican if he can bring the series to a climax by projecting on to Michaelangelo&apos;s Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel. The project, which has returned Greenaway to his earlier career as a painter, started in his adopted home town of Amsterdam where in 2006 he animated Rembrandt&apos;s The Nightwatch. It opens with a cock crowing at dawn. Light plays across figures and the voices of men are heard. There are explosions, infernos and rain before night comes and the show ends with the midnight bell. &quot;We burned it, flooded it and covered it in blood,&quot; he recalled. &quot;But if you go there today you will find it completely untouched. &quot;I just want to get people to look again at art. Most people are visually under-educated and after the age of 11 schoolchildren are encouraged to concentrate on texts while visual arts are regarded as simply decorative and entertaining.&quot; He has permission to tackle Veronese&apos;s Marriage of Cana in the Louvre in Paris this autumn and Las Meninas by Vel\u00e1zquez at the Prado in Madrid in 2009. He is in talks over the rest of his series and wants to take Guernica from Madrid to the Guggenheim in Bilbao. &quot;I have to have a Cecil B deMille Cinerama canvas,&quot; he said. &quot;Otherwise it just doesn&apos;t work.&quot; His plans have divided the art world. &quot;Quite frankly, I don&apos;t see how these paintings, which have been good enough to move generations of people, are improved by the interventions of any film-maker,&quot; said the art critic Brian Sewell. &quot;The Central Restoration Institute in Rome [which is supervising the Last Supper project] is out of its mind to allow this. They can&apos;t predict the effect this will have on an extremely fragile painting.&quot; But Martin Kemp, professor of history of art at Oxford University and a Da Vinci expert, said the painter would have approved. &quot;Greenaway has a terrific understanding of how painters work which is not true of every film-maker. There&apos;s no need to be stuffy about these things. If Leonardo had been around he would have been into moving images. You get the sense that he wanted his paintings to move.&quot; Greenaway plans to make a sun rise behind Christ&apos;s head and light will fall and rise on the famous hand gestures &quot;to give the notion of a symphony of togetherness&quot;. The arrangement of the objects on the disciples&apos; table will be projected as a constellation on the ceiling and the seven-minute show will climax with the light fading over the group and the shadows of each disciple stretching across the floor. Because of the painting&apos;s fragility, only 25 people will be able to watch at a time, but it will be relayed to thousands more. &quot;The idea is to make connections between 8,000 years of art and 112 years of cinema,&quot; Greenaway said. &quot;We have a lot of detractors who have told us we shouldn&apos;t turn Leonardo Da Vinci into a film, but the sense of possible aesthetic combat is very exciting.&quot; Supper guests Many artists have reinterpreted Leonardo&apos;s masterpiece but none were allowed to use the real thing as a starting point. Sam Taylor-Wood&apos;s Wrecked had Christ replaced by a topless woman. Chris Offili&apos;s The Upper Room used 13 highly decorated pictures of monkeys made partly from elephant dung.

He just hates Islam. Or so he says. &apos;Islam is not a religion, it&apos;s an ideology,&apos; says Wilders, a lanky Roman Catholic right-winger, &apos;the ideology of a retarded culture.&apos; The Dutch politician, who sees himself as heir to a recent string of assassinated or hounded mavericks who have turned Holland upside down, has been doing a crash course in Koranic study. Likening the Islamic sacred text to Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf, he wants the &apos;fascist Koran&apos; outlawed in Holland, the constitution rewritten to make that possible, all immigration from Muslim countries halted, Muslim immigrants paid to leave and all Muslim &apos;criminals&apos; stripped of Dutch citizenship and deported &apos;back where they came from&apos;. But he has nothing against Muslims. &apos;I have a problem with Islamic tradition, culture, ideology. Not with Muslim people.&apos; Wilders has been immersing himself in the suras and verse of seventh-century Arabia. The outcome of his scholarship, a short film, has Holland in a panic. He is just putting the finishing touches to the 10-minute film, he says, and talking to four TV channels about screening it. &apos;It&apos;s like a walk through the Koran,&apos; he explains in a sterile conference room in the Dutch parliament in The Hague, security chaps hovering outside. &apos;My intention is to show the real face of Islam. I see it as a threat. I&apos;m trying to use images to show that what&apos;s written in the Koran is giving incentives to people all over the world. On a daily basis Moroccan youths are beating up homosexuals on the streets of Amsterdam.&apos; Wilders is lucid and shrewd and the provactive soundbites trip easily off his tongue. He was recently voted Holland&apos;s most effective politician. If 18 months ago he sat alone in the second chamber or lower house in The Hague, his People&apos;s Party now has nine of 150 seats and is running at about 15 per cent in the polls. His Islam-bashing seems to be paying off. And not only in Holland. All across Europe, the new breed of right-wing populists are trying to revive their political fortunes by appealing to anti-Muslim prejudice.  A few months ago the Swiss People&apos;s Party of the pugnacious billionaire Christoph Blocher won a general election while simultaneously running a campaign to change the Swiss constitution to ban the building of minarets on mosques. Last month in Antwerp, far-right leaders from 15 European cities and from political parties in Belgium, Germany and Austria got together to launch a charter &apos;against the Islamisation of western European cities&apos;, reiterating the call for a mosque-building moratorium. &apos;We already have more than 6,000 mosques in Europe, which are not only a place to worship but also a symbol of radicalisation, some financed by extreme groups in Saudi Arabia or Iran,&apos; argued Filip Dewinter, leader of Belgium&apos;s Flemish separatist party, the Vlaams Belang, who organised the Antwerp get-together. &apos;Its minarets are six floors high, higher than the floodlights of the Feyenoord soccer stadium,&apos; he said of a new mosque being built in Rotterdam. &apos;These kinds of symbols have to stop.&apos; Where a few years ago the far right in Europe concentrated its fire on immigration, these days Islam is fast becoming the most popular target. It is a campaign that is having mixed results. In Switzerland, the Blocher party has been highly successful. In Holland, Wilders is thriving by constantly poking sticks in the eyes of the politically correct Dutch establishment. But when Susanne Winter ran for a seat on the local council in the Austrian city of Graz last month by branding the Prophet Muhammad a child molester, she lost her far-right Freedom Party votes. For the mainstream centre-right in Europe, foreigner-bashing is also backfiring. Roland Koch, the German Christian Democrat once tipped as a future Chancellor, wrecked his chances a fortnight ago by forfeiting a 12-point lead in a state election after a campaign that denounced Muslim ritual slaughter practices and called for the deportation of young immigrant criminals. Wilders echoes some of the arguments against multiculturalism that have convulsed Germany in recent years. Like many on the traditional German right, he wants the European Judaeo-Christian tradition to be formally recognised as the dominating culture, or Leitkultur. &apos;There is no equality between our culture and the retarded Islamic culture. Look at their views on homosexuality or women,&apos; he says. But if Wilders shares positions and aims with others on the far right in Europe, he is also a very specific Dutch phenomenon, viewing himself as a libertarian provocateur like the late Pim Fortuyn or Theo van Gogh, railing against &apos;Islamisation&apos; as a threat to what used to be the easy-going Dutch model of tolerance. &apos;My allies are not Le Pen or Haider,&apos; he emphasises. &apos;We&apos;ll never join up with the fascists and Mussolinis of Italy. I&apos;m very afraid of being linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups.&apos; Dutch iconoclasm, Scandinavian insistence on free expression, the right to provoke are what drive him, he says. He shrugs off anxieties that his film will trigger a fresh bout of violence of the kind that left Van Gogh stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street and his estranged colleague Ayaan Hirsi Ali in hiding, or the murderous furore over the Danish cartoons in 2005. The Dutch government is planning emergency evacuation of its nationals and diplomats from the Middle East should the Wilders film be shown. It is alarmed about the impact on Dutch business. &apos;Our Prime Minister is a big coward. The government is weak,&apos; says Wilders. &apos;They hate my guts and I don&apos;t like them either.&apos; And if people are murdered as a result of his film? &apos;They say that if there&apos;s bloodshed it would be the responsibility of this strange politician. It&apos;s almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. They&apos;re creating an atmosphere. I&apos;m not responsible for using democratic means and acting within the law. I don&apos;t want Dutch people or Dutch interests to be hurt.&apos; But he does want to create a stir. &apos;Islam is something we can&apos;t afford any more in the Netherlands. I want the fascist Koran banned. We need to stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands. That means no more mosques, no more Islamic schools, no more imams... Not all Muslims are terrorists, but almost all terrorists are Muslims.&apos; Free speech or hate speech? &apos;I don&apos;t create hate. I want to be honest. I don&apos;t hate people. I don&apos;t hate Muslims. I hate their book and their ideology.&apos; For more than three years, Wilders has been paying for his &apos;honesty&apos; by living under permanent police guard as the internet bristles with threats on his life. He has lived in army barracks, in prisons, under guard at home. &apos;There&apos;s no freedom, no privacy. If I said I was not afraid, I would be lying.&apos; There is little doubt that if Wilders&apos;s film exists - and it&apos;s shrouded in secrecy - and is broadcast, it will be construed as blasphemy in large parts of the world and may spark a new bloody crisis in relations between the West and the Muslim world.  He does not seem to care. &apos;People ask why don&apos;t you moderate your voice and not make this movie.

As protesters protested and neo-Nazis scowled, Johannes Heesters performed in his home country for the first time in four decades. It&apos;s not the windmills or tulips that kept the 104-year-old away, but instead some of his countrymen&apos;s aversion to what Heesters was up to some seventy years ago: namely performing for Adolf Hitler and at the Dachau concentration camp. Heesters was one of the most popular stars in the German cabaret scene of the 1930s. Songs like Da geh&apos; ich ins Maxim, from The Merry Widow, brought him to the top stages in central Europe. Though Heesters was not a Nazi propagandist, he was willing to perform for German soldiers and indeed his theatre company performed for officers at Dachau in 1941. The visit was not disclosed until photos were uncovered in 1978. &quot;I was ashamed of myself and I still haven&apos;t stopped feeling this way,&quot; Heesters wrote in his autobiography after the war. &quot;I am angry with myself for being gullible, credulous and naive.&quot; In the Netherlands, they seem to be less willing to accept said gullibility, credulity or naivete. &quot;He kept singing for the Nazi regime, for the Wehrmacht, and he earned millions,&quot; said a spokesman for the committee formed to protest Saturday&apos;s performance in Amersfoort. Rarely have 104-year-olds aroused so much Sturm und Drang. As Heesters rehearsed - or perhaps napped - backstage, 50 demonstrators gathered outside the De Flint theatre. They were met by a handful of neo-Nazis, according to reports, who although uninvited showed their support for Heesters by tossing eggs at protestors. Concert-goers were forced to submit their passports and proceed through airport-style security. Eggs were also presumably forbidden inside the theatre.  The performance itself went off without disturbances. Heesters&apos;s &quot;voice was steady,&quot; according to Reuters, but his wife popped in now and then to remind him of lines. His last Dutch performance was in 1964, when Heesters was booed off an Amsterdam stage.

The well-known documentary series that recorded its creation, and its inspiring attempts to transform the lives of a motley cohort of socially-excluded youngsters, made marvellous viewing. Five years on, Fifteen is turning over \u00a34m a year and has successfully opened three other branches - in Cornwall, Melbourne and Amsterdam. The food business appears indisputably a success. But what about the training side?  A remarkable new report attempts to answer this. It has tried to get behind the glamorous public image of Fifteen, and the reputation of its high-profile founder, and by talking to Fifteen graduates and staff, work out exactly how well it has performed against its much-vaunted &quot;social bottom line&quot;: turning jobless, drifting working-class youngsters at risk of crime and drug addiction into proper, working chefs. If your last engagement with Fifteen was shedding a warm tear of happiness in front of the TV as you watched those once-feckless, insecure, spliff-smoking trainees blossom miraculously into resilient and resourceful young catering professionals, it may come as a surprise to learn that Oliver&apos;s outfit has struggled to meet its ambitious social objectives. As the report notes critically: &quot;The truth is that the start up of Fifteen was messy and the boat left port without all its sails and supplies ready.&quot; Distracted by the demands of TV cameras and keeping the (unexpectedly successful) restaurant going, Fifteen&apos;s support, training and counselling services for its vulnerable trainees were under-resourced, erratic, and powered by a misplaced belief in the power of righteous enthusiasm. &quot;It was assumed that everyone, inspired by Jamie&apos;s example, would just get it and the training would work,&quot; says the report. By 2007, just over half of the 106 trainees taken on since March 2002 had managed to graduate, a rate well below expectations. There is a rueful admission by Fifteen that &quot;we did let some of those people down at the time of start up and for some time after that&quot;. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the report is that it was commissioned and published by Fifteen itself. In the foreword, its (recently departed) director, Liam Black, writes: &quot;This is not a typical annual report or PR document, it is a warts-and-all look into the guts of Fifteen, celebrating what&apos;s great about this place but acknowledging too when and how we have missed the mark.&quot; There is, as the report makes clear, much to celebrate. But it is a rounded, self-critical assessment, done with the aim of improving Fifteen&apos;s performance. Consequently, Fifteen is in the process radically changing its training and support programmes, and raising its target graduation rate to 70%. It&apos;s hard to think of another organisation in the public, private or voluntary sector that has had the balls, or the honesty, to do this. With a generous and committed backer such as Oliver, perhaps Fifteen can afford to be virtuously candid about its shortcomings. But the report suggests that success for any social business involves being truthful about, and learning from, mistakes - and that listening to clients (in this case, the trainees) pays dividends. There is also a refreshing assumption that the public (and investors, donors and voters) will trust you more if you eschew glossy spin in favour of candour about your performance in running a complex and difficult business.  Above all, it recognises that without a thriving restaurant Fifteen is just another youth skills project unconnected to market realities, that without a properly functioning training element it is just a trendy eaterie with a slick line in corporate social responsibility. &quot;We haven&apos;t always got it right, says Oliver, &quot;but without taking risks we won&apos;t make progress.&quot; \u00b7 Patrick Butler is editor of Society Guardian.

A consortium of engineers and architects has submitted proposals for a network of 60-metre-deep (195ft) underground tunnels to provide up to 6m square metres of new space in the crowded historic centre. They want to use the tunnels to take the cars off Amsterdam&apos;s narrow canalside streets to reduce pollution and increase space for cafes, parks and shopping.  The &quot;city under the city&quot; proposal - dubbed Amfora - could cost \u00a36bn and has been given a cautious welcome by the Amsterdam authorities. It would be financed by private banks, but requires the permission of the city government. Backers have warned that Amsterdam&apos;s lack of space and high land prices could result in the city centre losing popularity to the suburbs over the next 20 years. The proposal has been submitted by engineers Strukton and the architect firm Zwarts &amp; Jansma and involves draining the biggest canals, digging down 60 metres to a layer of waterproof clay and dropping in concrete walls. A roof would then be built and the canal water poured back in. Underneath, up to six storeys of accommodation would be built using access from canalside shafts. Cinemas, for example, could have their entrance at ground level but the auditoria would be in the tunnel. Some tunnels would be used for a park and ride system to keep cars out of the city.  &quot;Canals that now feature only houses and lawyers&apos; offices will become real shopping streets full of activity again,&quot; said Moshe Zwarts, the architect behind the plan. &quot;Like Barcelona and London have world-famous shopping streets, such as the Ramblas and Regent Street, Amsterdam could develop a characterful shopping area along the canals.&quot; The designers believe they could make the underground spaces pleasant by projecting images of the sky on to the ceilings and by regulating the temperature at 18C (64F) using canal water as a coolant. &quot;Those spaces can not only be used to accommodate parking places, but also shops, sports halls, cinemas, storage of archives, room for cables and piping,&quot; said Bas Obladen, the project engineer. &quot;I can imagine more cars underneath the canals,&quot; said Alderman Tjeerd Herrema, responsible for city infrastructure. But he voiced concern that Amsterdammers would not want to live &quot;like moles&quot; in the tunnels. &quot;I doubt if we should build shops underground,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not a new idea. But we welcome every plan.&quot; Since the 1970s more than 20 miles of tunnels and shopping areas have been built beneath Toronto, Canada.", "sentences": ["Officials in Amsterdam are considering plans to build a vast underground city beneath the city&apos;s famous canals to house car parks, cinemas and sports halls.", "They want to use the tunnels to take the cars off Amsterdam&apos;s narrow canalside streets to reduce pollution and increase space for cafes, parks and shopping.", "The &quot;city under the city&quot; proposal - dubbed Amfora - could cost \u00a36bn and has been given a cautious welcome by the Amsterdam authorities.", "Backers have warned that Amsterdam&apos;s lack of space and high land prices could result in the city centre losing popularity to the suburbs over the next 20 years.", "&quot;Like Barcelona and London have world-famous shopping streets, such as the Ramblas and Regent Street, Amsterdam could develop a characterful shopping area along the canals.&quot; The designers believe they could make the underground spaces pleasant by projecting images of the sky on to the ceilings and by regulating the temperature at 18C (64F) using canal water as a coolant.", "But he voiced concern that Amsterdammers would not want to live &quot;like moles&quot; in the tunnels."], "title": "Amsterdam looks underground to ease congestion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/netherlands", "tags": ["Netherlands", "World news", "Travel", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-21T13:50:14Z", "article": "1967 Born in Gateshead on May 27. 1983 Joins Newcastle as an apprentice. 1985 Makes Football League debut for Newcastle as a substitute against QPR at St James&apos; Park. 1988 Joins Tottenham for \u00a32m and makes England debut as substitute against Denmark at Wembley in September. 1989 Scores first goal for England after coming on as substitute in 5-0 World Cup win over Albania at Wembley in April. 1990 Stars during England&apos;s World Cup campaign and bursts into tears during World Cup semi-final with West Germany after receiving a yellow card which would have ruled him out of the final.

His killer was a male prostitute Vivier had met in a bar earlier that evening. On the worktable was the manuscript of Vivier&apos;s final, uncompleted work, Glaubst du an die Unsterblichkeit der Seele? (Do You Believe in the Immortality of the Soul?), a dramatised monologue in which Vivier describes a journey on the metro during which he becomes attracted to a young man. The music breaks off abruptly following the line: &quot;Then he removed a dagger from his jacket and stabbed me through the heart.&quot; Twenty-five years after his death, Vivier remains an enigma: his small body of work is known only to a few aficionados, and performances in Britain are rare. Yet his work is about to become significantly more accessible due to a pioneering experiment in online concert-giving between the contemporary music ensemble Psappha, the BBC Singers and Lancaster University, who have combined to produce a programme of Vivier&apos;s music on the web. Psappha&apos;s artistic director, Tim Williams, conceived the project after hearing the piece Vivier was working on at the time of his death. &quot;It&apos;s extraordinarily beautiful, yet also one of the most terrifying pieces of music I&apos;d ever heard,&quot; Williams says. &quot;It completely chilled me even though I originally had no idea of the circumstances of its composition. It was only later I realised that it seems to be a premonition of his own death.&quot; Vivier lived a short, intense life marked by a thirst for new experience - cultural, musical and sensual - which he absorbed into a strange, incantatory sound world of startling originality. Born in Montreal in 1948, he spent his early years in a Catholic orphanage. Never having known his parents haunted Vivier throughout his life, yet it was also the source of imaginative liberation: &quot;Not knowing my parents enabled me to create a magnificent dream world,&quot; Vivier said in 1983. &quot;I shaped my origins exactly as I wished.&quot; Growing up among nuns also impressed him with a love of ritual. His inspiration to become a composer came in a moment of revelation at midnight mass, though his initial desire to take holy orders was thwarted when he was expelled from the seminary for &quot;inappropriate behaviour&quot;. Vivier never made any secret of his sexuality, living in a Montreal apartment between a public park and a swimming pool that were two of the city&apos;s most notorious cruising areas. In 1981, the pool became the setting for an avant-garde erotic film, L&apos;Homme de P\u00e9kin, in which Vivier is seen hurling himself into the water and performing strange, mystic chants in the showers. French-speaking Quebec was altogether too stifling and provincial for Vivier&apos;s spirit of adventure, however, as well as being too far from the musical centres of Europe. In 1972 Vivier secured a government grant to study abroad, first at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht, then with Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne. Stockhausen did not immediately warm to his strange new student - he disliked Vivier&apos;s impish, irreverent behaviour and objected to the ancient sheepskin jacket which he never took off and smelled rather pungent. After a brief flirtation with the tape loops and spectrum analysers of the European avant garde, Vivier began to travel further afield in his quest for new experience, studying the ritual music of Bali and Japan, and creating the solo piano masterpiece Shiraz, which depicts a day spent following two blind musicians through the streets of an ancient Iranian city. An incessant traveller, Vivier developed an image of himself as a musical Marco Polo - the explorer frequently appears in Vivier&apos;s work alongside other heroes including Mozart, Merlin and Lewis Carroll. The dramatic work Kopernikus, which the composer described as &quot;a ritual opera of death&quot;, bears a distinct Alice in Wonderland influence, as a young woman descends into a bewildering dream-world where the characters sing in a language of the composer&apos;s own invention. Vivier never saw his opera produced; Kopernikus was eventually staged by the director Pierre Audi at the Almeida festival in London in 1985. The production was subsequently revived in Amsterdam in 2006 as part of a dramatised retrospective of Vivier&apos;s work entitled R\u00eaves d&apos;un Marco Polo (Dreams of a Marco Polo). Yet Vivier&apos;s eccentrically constructed scores are rarely heard in the concert hall, as the attempt to interpret them requires digging through disparate, often contradictory sources. Psappha&apos;s Tim Williams says: &quot;Even though the scores are in the process of being republished and re-edited, there are many areas where it is by no means clear what effect Vivier had in mind. There&apos;s a huge range of ritual bells and esoteric percussion, for instance, some of which he specifies very precisely, but others which can only be identified through drawings in the score. And many of the analogue synthesisers Vivier used are no longer in production - we had to track them down on eBay.&quot; It seems certain that, were he still alive, Vivier would have embraced the potential of the internet: it is particularly fitting that this global composer should be selected for this experiment in free, online concert-giving. The conductor, Nicholas Kok, hopes that the performance in Lancaster, and subsequent webcast, will be a significant stage in the rehabilitation of Vivier&apos;s reputation. &quot;It&apos;s hard to say why he has been so neglected,&quot; Kok says. &quot;Is it because he was Canadian? Is it because he wrote sensual, intensely personal music which doesn&apos;t conveniently fit into any modernistic school? Is it because he was gay? It&apos;s unfortunate that the one thing people do know about Vivier is that he died a violent death, which gives his legacy an aura of sickly glamour. But it&apos;s time to reappraise his work as music, not just the soundtrack to a lurid, psycho-sexual biography.&quot; William says: &quot;Vivier did seem to set his course to self-destruct, which makes it very hard to separate the life from the art. The sonorities of the temple bell and the seediness of the pick-up joint are indivisible aspects of his sensibility. But I&apos;m convinced that if he had lived, he would have become an icon of contemporary music. He came from Canada, but it seems as if he belonged to a different planet.&quot; \u00b7 Psappha and the BBC Singers perform music by Claude Vivier at the Great Hall, Lancaster University, on February 28.

Although the chef&apos;s friends and girlfriends knew him as an ordinary man who drank and took drugs recreationally, the 37-year-old father-of-three, from south London, had a hidden life as a prolific sex attacker. Dixie has a string of convictions for sexually motivated crime dating back more than 20 years.  The Old Bailey heard that, when he was 17, he was convicted of indecent assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a Jehovah&apos;s Witness who called at his flat. In 1998, when he was living in Australia, he allegedly stabbed a 20-year-old student, raping her and leaving her for dead, the jury was told.  Dixie has never been charged with that crime, but DNA analysis after his arrest for Bowman&apos;s murder suggests he was responsible.  He denied it in court, saying he could not remember the woman - who had given evidence from behind a screen - and suggesting she was possibly a one-night stand or a prostitute he had met. Dixie&apos;s criminal record is far more lengthy than the jury was ever entitled to hear when considering the case. In May 1986, when he was 16, he was charged with robbery and indecent assault after he and an accomplice held a knife to a woman&apos;s throat and fondled her breasts.  He was eventually convicted of just robbery after the indecent assault charge was left on file. In 1988, he was found guilty of indecent assault and two counts of indecent exposure. In court on that occasion, he asked for five similar offences to be taken into consideration.  The following year, he was found guilty of indecent exposure after masturbating at a woman&apos;s car window. There were other, non-sexually motivated convictions in the UK in the late 80s and early 90s before Dixie moved to Australia in 1993. He did not stop offending when he moved. In 1999, he received an Australian conviction after pouncing on a lone woman jogger. He had taken his clothes off and waited for her in the bushes before jumping out at her and asking her to perform a sexual act.  It was after his conviction that the Australian police deported him back to the UK, ostensibly because he had overstayed illegally. When he returned to the UK, no information about his offending in Australia was passed to the UK authorities.  Although he had a criminal record in Britain, his convictions all took place before DNA analysis was routinely used in police investigations and prior to the introduction of the national DNA database. It was only when he was arrested for a minor assault after a bar brawl in June 2006 - around nine months after killing Bowman - that his DNA was put on the database. Despite his prolific offending, those who knew Dixie say they had no idea about his criminal record. They knew him under a variety of aliases - Mark Down, Mark James McDonald, Steven McDonald and Shane Turner. Stacey Nivet, Dixie&apos;s girlfriend at the time of Bowman&apos;s murder, and mother of his youngest son, told the court he was a regular drug user who, when high, was &quot;the life and soul of any party&quot; but had a tendency to get moody the following day.  She said she once spoke to Dixie about the murder and he &quot;appeared to be just as repulsed as I was&quot;. It was only after his arrest that his friends recalled his slightly strange behaviour following Bowman&apos;s murder.  Victoria Chandler, whose house Dixie was staying at on the night of the killing, only 400 yards from where Bowman&apos;s body was found, told the court he reacted angrily when a friend suggested he should be screened by police looking for the Bowman&apos;s killer.  &quot;Are you calling me a murderer?&quot; he said, leaving the country soon afterwards to live in Amsterdam for a few months. Dixie, who has never married, has three sons by two different women.  Giving evidence in witness box at the Old Bailey, he said he came from a broken home.  His father left when he was 18 months old and, at the age of nine, his mother began living with another man and he gained two stepbrothers. None of his family attended court during his trial. Throughout the trial, he denied killing Bowman, saying he had chanced upon her lifeless body while out to score drugs and had &quot;opportunistic&quot; sex with her. Detectives now suspect Dixie is responsible for a string of unsolved crimes in addition to his five convictions for sex attacks in south London between 1986 and 1990.  They also believe the Bowman killing was not his first murder. Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy, who led the investigation, said: &quot;I still remain convinced he has still done something somewhere.&quot; Although Dixie has been ruled out of any other UK murder, it is thought he may have got away with a series of sex attacks while living in Australia.  &quot;There is a lot we don&apos;t know about Mark Dixie,&quot; Cundy added. &quot;He has got away with stuff around the world and thought he was invincible.  &quot;In life he is a freeloader. He will just use people and move on. He showed no shame or humility at all.&quot; Cundy appealed for any other women who think they could have been a victim of Dixie to get in touch.", "sentences": ["&quot;Are you calling me a murderer?&quot; he said, leaving the country soon afterwards to live in Amsterdam for a few months."], "title": "A history of sexual violence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/22/ukcrime4", "tags": ["Crime", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-23T00:03:50Z", "article": "During the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Dubravka Ugresic was denounced, she says, as &quot;a whore, a witch and a traitor&quot;. A reluctant citizen of newly independent Croatia, she took a stand against nationalism &quot;and all its perversities&quot;, and like many people became a target. As the Balkan wars escalated, she found herself the victim of a &quot;collective paranoia: people rushed to be willing executioners. Nobody forced them to kill, spit on and humiliate others - but they did. It became acceptable. It was like being marked with a yellow star.&quot; In her astringent writing of the early 1990s, collected in The Culture of Lies: Antipolitical Essays (1995), Ugresic wrote of nationalism as the &quot;ideology of the stupid&quot;. Though she was just as scathing about Serbian chauvinism, she excoriated a self-justificatory victim mentality in the &quot;freshly baked European state of Croatia&quot;, whose ultra-nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman, had come to power in 1990, declaring Croatia paradise on earth. With a nod to Milan Kundera&apos;s The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, Ugresic wrote: &quot;What is being annihilated with guns, grenades, murders, rape, the displacement of peoples, &apos;ethnic cleansing&apos;, the new ideology supported by the media, is memory.&quot; The title essay was written shortly before Ugresic was driven out of Croatia in 1993: the book appeared first in Dutch translation. She wandered in Germany, the Netherlands and the US before settling in 1999 in Amsterdam, where she lives alone. A novelist, critic, screenwriter and children&apos;s author, she loathes being identified as a Croatian writer, the representative of a &quot;country from which I ran away into exile.&quot; For Marina Warner, Ugresic is a &quot;wise jester and aphorist with a madcap wit&quot;. Lisa Appignanesi relishes her &quot;acerbic sense of life, and Eeyore grumpiness&quot;. Ugresic, who likens AA Milne&apos;s Eeyore to the sceptical, melancholic figure of the central European intellectual, practises sardonic jesting with a serious intent. Her work ranges from Thank You For Not Reading (2001), a dissection of today&apos;s literary marketplace, to dark fiction exploring trauma, flight and the violence done to selfhood by political upheaval. Her most recent novel, The Ministry of Pain (2004), now out in translation, is named after an S&amp;M club in The Hague - also, of course, the setting of the war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia. In the book a lecturer in Serbo-Croat at Amsterdam university tries to keep alive &quot;Yugonostalgia&quot; in her students - who are all fellow emigr\u00e9s - as her own world disintegrates. The depiction of a sado-masochistic relationship underlines what Ugresic sees as the &quot;self-hatred, self-hurt part of post-traumatic conditions&quot;: it is a novel about &quot;the trauma of language and the language of trauma.&quot; Ugresic&apos;s newspaper columns, recently collected as Nobody&apos;s Home, reveal her to be a sharp observer of absurdities on both sides of the old Berlin wall. &quot;People in the east developed a bunch of stereotypes about the shiny, democratic west, while westerners had a sense of superiority,&quot; she says. &quot;A lot of lies were there on both sides from the beginning.&quot; She laments the passing of underground culture (&quot;One can buy Prada shoes, but the jokes are gone&quot;), while charting nostalgia, not for communism but for its mundane souvenirs, even the ugliest and most kitsch. Like Ostalgie - the post-1989 term coined in former East Germany - it is an &quot;archaeological drive&quot;, powered by the realisation that all this is about to vanish. Ugresic was born in 1949 in Kustina, a small industrial town near Zagreb. Her father, Nikola, was a Croat, and her mother, Elisaveta, Bulgarian. Her father, a teenage anti-Nazi partisan in the second world war, became the successful director of a factory processing petroleum products. But the freeze on Yugoslav-Soviet bloc relations after Tito&apos;s break with Stalin in 1948 meant the family was unable to visit her maternal grandparents in Varna, on Bulgaria&apos;s Black Sea coast, until the thaw of 1956. Ugresic thinks Yugoslavia&apos;s socialism was relatively benign, especially in its permissiveness about foreign travel and Hollywood movies. After studying comparative literature at Zagreb university, she spent a research year in Moscow in the mid-1970s, helping to unearth and translate Soviet avant-garde writers of the 1920s and 30s, whom she later anthologised. It was a &quot;totally romantic time&quot;, yet the encounter with Soviet communism also opened her eyes to abuses in Yugoslavia. From 1949 to 1956, hundreds of people suspected of pro-Stalinist loyalties were sent to Goli Otok, the &quot;Yugoslav gulag&quot;. &quot;It was a culture of lies,&quot; Ugresic says. &quot;Goli Otok was taboo; people refused to talk about it until the 1970s.&quot; In 1981, while working as an academic, Ugresic wrote a postmodern romantic parody that became a Yugoslav cult classic, Steffie Cvek in the Jaws of Life, for which she also co-wrote a screenplay in 1984. It was published in translation by Dalkey Archive, as Lend Me Your Character (2004). The typist Steffie searches for Mr Right amid a blizzard of advice from friends, an elderly aunt and women&apos;s magazines, in a sewing pattern of a novel that weaves threads of Madame Bovary into lessons in applying mascara. When a recent Polish translation came out, readers unaware of when it was written thought it a hilarious send-up of Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary. Ugresic was teaching at Zagreb university when war broke out in 1991. After an autumn spent in bomb shelters, she taught for a semester in Connecticut, and wrote Have a Nice Day: From the Balkan War to the American Dream (1993). Its vignettes skewer American consumerism through the eyes of a woman whose homeland is disintegrating. War, she writes, &quot;is radiation. And we are all contaminated.&quot; She was one of five women subjected to what she sees as a media witchhunt in Croatia: four of them still live abroad. &quot;It&apos;s a pattern in war,&quot; she says. &quot;The first enemy is a woman.&quot; Besides &quot;nasty&quot; attacks in parliament and the press, her mother received harassing phone calls (&quot;being Bulgarian was almost like being Serb&quot;). &quot;What saved me was that I was not anonymous,&quot; says Ugresic. &quot;Many who were less known were beaten or killed.&quot; She was also ostracised by academic colleagues: &quot;A funny human ballet was performed every day; they&apos;d not notice or greet me. They performed that for one year, then I left.&quot; Of Tudjman, who died in 1999, and his nationalists, she says &quot;probably they were right to hate me because I made them look funny and stupid; you can&apos;t forget people laughing at you. I didn&apos;t believe in their cause, or that, for the sake of the state, you have to kill so many people. I thought they were criminals out for money, who manipulated people with that ethno-nationalist stuff.&quot; For her, the so-called Yugoslav war was a fascist struggle for new borders, its winners powermongers, mafiosi, criminals, war profiteers. Tudjman, she adds, was a bad historian: &quot;He wanted to erase the past, to cut 50 years out of Yugoslav history, and glue 1991 &apos;the year of Croatian independence&apos; to 1941, when Croatia was a Nazi puppet state.&quot; Nazi collaborators were resurrected as Croatian heroes, she says, while kebabs were spurned as Serb cuisine, anti-fascist monuments pulled down and libraries ethnically cleansed. In Ugresic&apos;s view, the majority probably wanted to feel they were victims of communism. &quot;Victims don&apos;t have any responsibility. History is like the weather - it has nothing to do with you. But who were the local communists, or the local Nazis? My question is always, &apos;and what were you doing?&quot;&apos; She was struck by how quickly people did the job of censorship. &quot;There was such hysteria and lying, pushing people into hatred. My fellow writers spat on their own history. But why should you wipe out half your life because a bunch of criminals go to war to separate the country? When one guy comes to power, others are erased. This is anti-intellectual - to always destroy everything behind you.&quot; One casualty was language. Serbo-Croat was &quot;separated into Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian, which is tragic when you&apos;re the bearer of a language that&apos;s split, tortured.&quot; Her fragmentary novel The Museum of Unconditional Surrender (1996) is set mainly in Berlin, with a return to a haunted love affair in Lisbon, and flashbacks drawn from her mother&apos;s life in Bulgaria. Its title refers to a real monument to German capitulation in 1945. Everything she saw in Berlin - &quot;a traumatised city of debris, graves, bullet holes&quot; - matched her feelings about what had happened in Yugoslavia. When forced to apply for a Croatian passport, under &quot;ethnicity&quot; Ugresic wrote &quot;none&quot;. Because of the heritage of the second world war, when Croats and Serbs killed each other, she says &quot;people accepted Yugoslavdom as a kind of relief, especially in Bosnia. They didn&apos;t want to hear who was who.&quot; She partly blames EU policy for having to choose. &quot;When Yugoslavia fell apart, there were more declared Yugoslavs than Slovenes, but the EU wouldn&apos;t accept them.

Mark Dixie, 37, a father of three from south London, had insisted he was not the killer. Instead, he claimed to have chanced upon her lifeless body while high on cocaine and had sex, not realising she was dead.  But it took an Old Bailey jury just 3\u00bd hours yesterday to find him guilty of what the police officer in charge of the case said was the most horrific killing he had ever had to investigate - but one he feared was not Dixie&apos;s first. &quot;I can&apos;t believe Sally Anne&apos;s murder was Dixie&apos;s first because of the way in which it was carried out,&quot; said Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy. &quot;I never want to see anything like that ever again,&quot; he added. Dixie had forced the Bowman family to listen to some harrowing evidence for his own sexual gratification, said Cundy. He added that DNA evidence had been crucial in tracking down Dixie, and called for the introduction of a national DNA register which would hold a sample from everyone in Britain. &quot;If there was a DNA register, we would have known who killed Sally Anne [on the day her body was found],&quot; Cundy said. Dixie was a dangerous sexual predator with 16 previous convictions dating back 20 years, many of which were sexually motivated, said Cundy. He said he was sure Dixie was responsible for other, unsolved, crimes and made an appeal for women to study photographs of Dixie to see if he had ever attacked them. &quot;Mark Dixie posed a significant threat to women and I strongly believe that there may be other victims who have not come forward,&quot; said Cundy. Although Dixie has been ruled out of any murder in the UK, it is thought he may have got away with a series of sex attacks - or even killings - while living in Australia between 1993 and 1999. Cundy said: &quot;I am still convinced he has done something somewhere in Australia. If he has committed another shocking murder somewhere, it is in Australia.&quot; During the trial, the court heard that British police had linked Dixie with an unsolved rape and attempted murder in Perth, Australia, in 1998. A young Thai woman had been attacked by a knife-wielding man who climbed through her window wearing a stocking on his head. He stabbed her until she was unconscious and then raped her.  It was only when he was arrested for Bowman&apos;s murder that a DNA match was made, with forensic science experts saying there was a &quot;one in a billion&quot; chance the sperm found in the victim&apos;s body did not belong to Dixie. He has never been charged with this crime, and in court said that he could not remember the Thai woman - who gave evidence behind a screen - and she must have been either a one-night stand or a prostitute. The jury heard that the Australian crime bore an eerie resemblance to Bowman&apos;s murder: in both cases, Dixie attacked the women in or near their homes, stabbed them and raped them while they were unable to fight back. In both cases, the victim&apos;s handbag has never been found. The court heard that Dixie&apos;s first sexually motivated conviction was in 1986 when he was just 16. Then, he and a friend held a knife to a woman&apos;s throat and fondled her breasts. He was convicted on a count of robbery and the sexual assault offence was left to lie on file. The Bowman family cheered as the verdict was read out in court. There were tears from the victim&apos;s boyfriend, Lewis Sproston, who was initially the prime suspect in the case after he admitted rowing with Bowman minutes or even seconds before she was knifed to death in her own driveway in Croydon in September 2005.  When he was arrested the day after the killing, he said to police: &quot;Is this about the row with my girlfriend last night?&quot;  After four days of questioning in police custody, Sproston was released when DNA analysis found that sperm found on Bowman&apos;s body belonged to another man.  Police then launched the biggest voluntary DNA screening ever seen in the UK, with some 1,700 men giving samples. Dixie was not one of them, and in court one of his friends recalled that he reacted angrily when a friend suggested he should be screened by police, saying: &quot;Are you calling me a murderer?&quot; Shortly afterwards, he fled to Amsterdam for a few months. If Dixie had stayed under the police radar after the killing, they might never have caught him.  But on June 15 2006, he got into a bar brawl after an England football match and was arrested for a minor assault. Since 2004, the police have been given powers to take DNA swabs from anyone arrested and taken to a police station, so Dixie, like everyone else in his position, was made to give a saliva sample. At the time, the officers interviewing him thought it slightly odd that he cried under questioning - he was not facing a serious charge at that point.  The reason for his anguish became clear 12 days later, when Sussex police got a call from the forensics lab: Dixie&apos;s DNA was a near-perfect match for the semen discovered on Sally Anne Bowman&apos;s body.  &quot;There was a one in a billion chance it could have belonged to someone else,&quot; said Julie-Ann Cornelius, the senior forensic scientist who gave evidence in the case. Dixie has never shown any remorse for the murder. The only hint he ever gave of his involvement was when he was arrested in June 2006, some nine months after the killing, when police officers asked if he had a history of mental health problems. &quot;I must have been mental to do that, eh?&quot; he said. Passing sentence yesterday, the judge, Gerald Gordon QC, said the 34-year minimum term reflected Dixie&apos;s criminal record, his total lack of remorse over the killing and the way in which he had carried out the attack so near to Bowman&apos;s home. &quot;There is no mitigation,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["Dixie was not one of them, and in court one of his friends recalled that he reacted angrily when a friend suggested he should be screened by police, saying: &quot;Are you calling me a murderer?&quot; Shortly afterwards, he fled to Amsterdam for a few months."], "title": "Police: 'Sally Anne killer must have struck before'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/23/ukcrime4", "tags": ["Crime", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-23T01:36:14Z", "article": "Liverpool&apos;s manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, has revealed how a regular exchange of emails is helping mend his fractured relationship with the club&apos;s co-owner Tom Hicks.

But, if preview audiences are anything to go by, its producers - like the eponymous stars of Mel Brooks&apos;s comedy - look like they have an improbable hit on their hands about life under the Nazis. The Diary of Anne Frank: A Song to Life has caused upset from the outset, leading to a split between the two organisations responsible for protecting Frank&apos;s memory. The Anne Frank Foundation, which looks after the museum based in the house in which the Franks hid out in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, has given its support to the show, which will run at Madrid&apos;s Calder\u00f3n theatre. However, the Basel-based Anne Frank Fund, headed by her only surviving relative, cousin Buddy Elias, has refused to cede rights to the diary, and called for the musical to be halted. &quot;The Frank family was living in hiding for two years, which ended in tragedy - that&apos;s no theme for a happy evening of song and dance,&quot; said Elias. The musical has been playing to packed preview audiences, receiving standing ovations each night, with the warmest applause reserved for Anne, played by the 13-year-old Cuban-American Isabella Castillo. But her strong performance is let down by the weakness of the material as the show does not have the rights to use Frank&apos;s actual words. The writer and journalist Leopoldo Alas says the message is not very sophisticated: the Nazis were bad, and being Jewish under Nazi occupation was not very nice. But, he says, it goes no further than that: &quot;It&apos;s a superficial product, well made, but without much intelligence.&quot; But the Wednesday morning matinee performance for schoolchildren has already sold out until May, suggesting that it has a strong educational appeal in a country that did not take part in the second world war. Alas questioned the point of making the musical at all, although he felt that the backing of the Anne Frank Foundation gave it some credibility. &quot;I went along with a prejudice about the idea of making a musical about Anne Frank&apos;s diary. Is it really necessary to do this? I don&apos;t think so. What does it add to our understanding? &quot;In the end, the production is fine - neither too frivolous nor too dramatic, but essentially mediocre. It could well be successful because musicals are popular at the moment,&quot; he said, adding that many would support it because it is one of the first Spanish musicals in Madrid not to have been translated from English. Sara, 27, who had come with her mother to see one of the previews, said she thought the show deserved to be a big success. &quot;I really enjoyed it,&quot; she said, &quot;though it was very sad, and musicals are normally very happy. I thought it dealt with the Nazi theme very sensitively, but with an optimistic outlook.&quot; Others felt that Castillo was undoubtedly the star of the show. &quot;She was fantastic. What a star. Her voice is amazing,&quot; said one member of the audience. But some felt the songs themselves were not particularly memorable. Anita, who had read the diary when she was a teenager, said: &quot;It was faithful to her story, but the songs were a bit too much the same. There wasn&apos;t really one you would be able to sing afterwards.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Anne Frank Foundation, which looks after the museum based in the house in which the Franks hid out in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, has given its support to the show, which will run at Madrid&apos;s Calder\u00f3n theatre."], "title": "Controversial Anne Frank musical a hit with Spanish audiences", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/23/theatre.spain", "tags": ["Stage", "Culture", "Theatre", "Spain", "World news", "Europe", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-24T00:03:07Z", "article": "On Friday 7 January 1944, Anne Frank confessed her love for a boy she had been smitten with for years. She had first set eyes upon him in school in 1940, and they had been &apos;inseparable&apos; for a whole summer, walking hand in hand through their neighbourhood in Amsterdam, him in a white cotton suit, her in a short summer dress. He was &apos;tall, slim and good-looking, with a serious, quiet and intelligent face&apos;. He had dark hair, brown eyes, a slightly pointed nose. Anne was &apos;crazy about his smile&apos;, which gave him a mischievous air. At one point he gave her a pendant as a keepsake. This was the boy she hoped to marry. His name was Peter Schiff, he was almost three years her senior, and it is clear from her diary that he was seldom out of her thoughts throughout her two years in hiding in the secret annexe behind her father&apos;s office. On 6 January 1944 she wrote that her image of him was so vivid that she didn&apos;t need a photograph, but anyone who has read her diary may be curious to see what he looked like at the time she knew him. Until now, no portrait of Peter Schiff has come to light. But the picture you see opposite has ended this 60-year mystery and provided another glimpse into a devastated world. The photo does its trick - it shows an extremely handsome boy of 12 full of hope for the future; it is not difficult to see his appeal to any vivacious and eager girl of similar age - but the background to its recent discovery provides something more, another layer in one of the most iconic stories of our time. The story of Anne Frank is one of bravery and fortitude. Her journal, the Diary of a Young Girl, continues to be read anew by hundreds of thousands each year not just for the insights it brings us into occupied Europe, or the practical details we glean about hiding in cramped conditions with limited resources. It is also a story of a bright Jewish girl&apos;s transition to adulthood, a maturing of intellect and sexuality and all the possibilities and challenges this brings. At times her diary is a catalogue of frustration and insecurity, but it is all-involving, a saga of peril and yearning written with exceptional emotional insight and cadences that, judging by the teenage blogs of today, we may have lost for good. But the romantic longing and crushes she experienced are timeless and universal, and anyone who has ever lost in love will sense their eyes swell with tears as she writes of Peter Schiff. Anne Frank&apos;s life and writing is not emblematic of the 6 million who died; it is far more powerful as a single voice. Since its first Dutch publication under the title The Secret Annexe in 1947, total sales have been estimated at more than 35m. Anne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 in Frankfurt am Main. She moved to Amsterdam with her family following the Nazis&apos; rise to power in 1933, but became trapped by the German occupation of the Netherlands in 1940. She moved from a Montessori school to a Jewish one, and her life became a series of restrictions and limitations. In June 1942 she received a notebook for her 13th birthday, and her commonplace observations were usually accompanied by darker allusions. The preceding months had seen the Frank family dispose of much of their furniture and other possessions as her father planned the flight from their house to a number of rooms at the back of his office by a canal in the western quarter of the city. A move was set for 16 July, but circumstances forced a move 10 days earlier. Decoys were set: the house was made to look like it was vacated in an emergency; a note suggested their destination was Switzerland. Anne shared her back rooms with seven others: her mother Edith, father Otto and sister Margot, a family friend named Fritz Pfeffer and the van Daan family (real name: van Pels), and much of her writing describes the jostling for position within their confined environment. She disguised the identity of the family who concealed them and brought them food and news of the outside world, and she addressed most of her diary entries to &apos;Dearest Kitty&apos;, a technique that prompted both a confessional style and the prospect of response. Despite her desire to become a published author, she intended her diary to remain private. But as the war progressed she began to realise the potential educational value of her writing, and she edited entries she judged to be too exposing. At times her head is full of jealousy and self-doubt, but her mood is levelled by her memory of one boy. &apos;You mustn&apos;t think I am in love with Peter [van Daan], because I&apos;m not... This morning I woke up just before seven and immediately remembered what I&apos;d been dreaming about. I was sitting on a chair and across from me was Peter... Peter Schiff... the dream was so vivid... Peter&apos;s eyes suddenly met mine and I...#8239;stared for a long time into those velvety brown eyes. Then he said very softly: &quot;If only I&apos;d known I&apos;d have come to you long ago.&quot; I turned away abruptly, overcome by emotion. And then I felt a soft, oh-so-cool and gentle cheek against mine, and it felt so good, so good.&apos; When she woke up she could still feel his cheek against hers, and his eyes &apos;staring deep into my heart&apos;. She believed he knew how much she had loved him &apos;and how much I still do&apos;. She had a nickname for him, Petel. On 7 January 1944, she writes of being kissed by her father, and wishing it was Peter. &apos;All day long I&apos;ve been repeating to myself, &quot;Oh Petel, my darling, darling Petel ...&quot;&apos; Later in the entry she asks: &apos;Where can I find help? I simply have to go on living and praying to God that, if we ever get out of here, Peter&apos;s path will cross mine. Once, when Father and I were talking about sex, he said I was too young to understand that kind of desire. But I thought I did understand it, and now I&apos;m sure I do. Nothing is as dear to me now as my darling Petel!&apos; As the months progress she wonders if Peter van Daan will serve as a suitable replacement for Peter Schiff, and her suspicious attitude towards him softens towards affection. But at the end of the diary we learn that he has disappointed her. Her last mention of Peter Schiff occurs at the end of April 1944, six weeks before her 15th birthday and three months before her house was raided by the German Security Police. She recalls her dream and the brushing of his cheek, and the intensity it aroused: &apos;I love Peter as I&apos;ve never loved anyone.&apos; Before he moved to Amsterdam in 1939, Peter had another friend. Ernst &apos;Mic&apos; Michaelis went to school with him in Berlin, and they saw each other whenever they could. Michaelis is now 81, and is a director of Pearson Panke, automotive and aerospace machinery suppliers in Mill Hill in north London. His recollections of Peter Schiff are as vivid as if he had written them in a diary. &apos;I always had a feeling of elation being with him,&apos; he says. &apos;As a boy I liked making things, and I had simple woodworking tools and later a metal construction kit. We played with that together. I also had a very grand model railway layout, and we probably played with that as well. We were 11 or 12 years old. I was never bored in his company - I had always liked people who were full of odd ideas, and he was.&apos; Michaelis was born in Berlin in 1926, and he still speaks with a slight German accent. He remembers that Peter owned an expensive pen, perhaps the one in his pocket in the photograph, possibly bought for him by his mother&apos;s new partner (it is believed his father had separated from his mother before the war and moved to the United States). Michaelis also remembers the comfort he felt from being with his friend the day after Kristallnacht, the evening in November 1938 when Jewish homes, shops and synagogues were vandalised throughout Germany and thousands of Jews were escorted to the camps. &apos;I must have known him for at least a year and a half, possibly longer,&apos; Michaelis remembers. &apos;He was an intelligent boy, and I think this must have been why he liked Anne - she had a lively mind. You get the impression from her mentions of him that it was all to do with appearance, but I&apos;m sure she would have been bored with him if he&apos;d been stupid.&apos; Michaelis and Schiff last saw each other in the summer of 1939. Michaelis came to England on the Kindertransport, going to school first in Sussex and then attending Bryanston School in Dorset. Schiff, accompanied by his mother, went to Amsterdam. But before the boys parted they exchanged photographs. Michaelis&apos;s picture was taken by a friend of his mother at his home, while Schiff&apos;s may have been taken at a professional studio. &apos;We did not know how else to say goodbye to each other - 12-year-old boys do not promise each other to write letters. We were at my home, but to be together as long as possible I walked with him to his home, about 25 minutes&apos; walk.&apos; Schiff wrote a note using his full name: &apos;In friendly remembrance of your friend Lutz Peter Schiff&apos; and Michaelis pasted both note and photograph (which was standard passport-size) into an album. A few years later the photograph was transferred to a larger book, where it sat undisturbed alongside other photos and correspondence for several decades. When he first read Anne Frank&apos;s diary in the Fifties, Michaelis had suspected that the Peter Schiff in the book was the same boy he had once known. He imagined that Schiff had perished in a concentration camp, but he couldn&apos;t confirm this either. In the last few years, however, things have come into focus. In 2000 he received a copy of Aktuell, a publication sent to refugees from Berlin scattered throughout the world. It carried a class photograph from Holdheim School taken in the spring of 1938, and with it a request for information regarding any of the 25 people pictured in it with their thick winter coats and sunny dispositions. Michaelis recognised it as his class: there he was, number 18, leaning to his left so we could get a good look at him. To his right in the same row, at number 10, was Peter Schiff. But Michaelis had more important things on his mind at the time: his wife Ann had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. He put the magazine to one side, and forgot about it. In May 2005 his wife was told there was nothing more they could do for her. She said she would like to pay a final visit to Berlin, but this may have been as much for his benefit as for hers: she was born in London in 1939, and was not Jewish. They had visited the city not long after the wall came down, at a time when large parts of it still resembled a building site, and Ann said she wanted to see what had been built. They visited the Jewish Museum, and she bought a copy of Anne Frank&apos;s diary. &apos;At that time, because of her confused mind, she couldn&apos;t read novels, but she could still read biographies,&apos; her husband says. She died four months after their visit. Last summer, shortly before his two children had found him sheltered accommodation, Michaelis picked up Anne Frank&apos;s diary again and began to wonder. &apos;I realised that there were lots of pictures associated with her life, but no picture of Peter Schiff. That seemed very odd, as his [good] looks are at the heart of his story. I thought that people might be interested in my picture.&apos; He contacted the man who had placed the class photo in Aktuell, and began a correspondence with several of his old classmates. Two remembered Peter Schiff well: &apos;He was a very likeable and friendly boy,&apos; wrote Ursula Meyer (nee Totschek, number six in the photograph), who now lives in Maryland, &apos;and I think I had a bit of a crush on him.&apos; Helga Burch (nee Walnau, number two), now residing in California, remembered that he was a &apos;delightful, funny, alert class clown, the spirit of the class. He once made Dr Gottschalk [the rabbi to the right of the picture] so angry that he hit him.&apos; When Michaelis searched the internet he found conflicting information, but his research did at least confirm Schiff&apos;s date of birth, and that he and Anne Frank shared the same friend. Michaelis called the Anne Frank Trust in London: they said they didn&apos;t have a picture of Peter Schiff and knew very little about him. Then he wrote to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam (the preserved building where she and her family hid - an educational centre that attracted more than 1m visitors last year), and staff confirmed that they didn&apos;t have a picture. They encouraged Michaelis to visit, and earlier this year he made the trip with his children and his grandchildren, and his photograph. &apos;They were very excited,&apos; he says, and he agreed the photograph could be used for educational purposes and on the museum&apos;s busy website. They told him there are pictures of the school Peter attended in Amsterdam, and they might now be able to pick him out. The photo will soon be on display on the Anne Frank House website, and perhaps at the House itself, but the story is not quite complete. We know of Anne Frank&apos;s fate - arrest and then deportation to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen; she died of typhus in late February or early March 1945, only a few weeks before the camp was liberated. Of those in hiding with her only her father survived, and until his death in 1980 he dedicated his life to the protection and promotion of her diaries. But the fate of Peter Schiff is less certain. He too must have spent many months in hiding, and upon capture it is believed he disobeyed orders to join an enforced labour unit in Amsterdam (the fate of his mother is unclear). Classified as a criminal, he was transported to the Westerbork transit camp near the Netherlands&apos; northeastern border (the Frank family was also held there for a while), and from there to Bergen-Belsen and probably Auschwitz. The date of his death is unknown, although it is entered in the record books on 31 May 1945. In place of Peter Schiff&apos;s final details we have something quite as valuable. Not just a photograph but also a love story, between a famous girl and a handsome boy, and an elderly man and his memories of a fractured childhood. &apos;We tried to make some very silly jokes,&apos; Mic Michaelis says of the day he obtained his unique memento and said goodbye to a friend he would not see again. &apos;But instead of laughing, all we could do was to try not to cry.&apos;", "sentences": ["She had first set eyes upon him in school in 1940, and they had been &apos;inseparable&apos; for a whole summer, walking hand in hand through their neighbourhood in Amsterdam, him in a white cotton suit, her in a short summer dress.", "She moved to Amsterdam with her family following the Nazis&apos; rise to power in 1933, but became trapped by the German occupation of the Netherlands in 1940.", "She recalls her dream and the brushing of his cheek, and the intensity it aroused: &apos;I love Peter as I&apos;ve never loved anyone.&apos; Before he moved to Amsterdam in 1939, Peter had another friend.", "Schiff, accompanied by his mother, went to Amsterdam.", "Then he wrote to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam (the preserved building where she and her family hid - an educational centre that attracted more than 1m visitors last year), and staff confirmed that they didn&apos;t have a picture.", "They told him there are pictures of the school Peter attended in Amsterdam, and they might now be able to pick him out.", "He too must have spent many months in hiding, and upon capture it is believed he disobeyed orders to join an enforced labour unit in Amsterdam (the fate of his mother is unclear)."], "title": "Simon Garfield uncovers the story of Anne Frank's lost love, Peter Schiff", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/24/news.features", "tags": ["Books", "Life and style", "Culture", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-24T00:03:50Z", "article": "It was the dark hair, the &apos;velvety&apos; brown eyes and the ever so slightly pointed nose that she admired.

More than 60 years after he stole her heart, The Observer today publishes for the first time a photograph of Peter Schiff - the handsome schoolboy whom Anne Frank one day hoped to marry.  Frank, the bright Jewish schoolgirl immortalised in the famous diary she wrote while in hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam during the Second World War, was captivated by Schiff. Three years her senior, she met him at school in 1940, his family having fled from Berlin to Holland the previous year. Though only 11, she fell in love, and it was, in part, the passion she felt for him that sustained her throughout the two years that she and her family would spend confined in a secret annexe in the Dutch city. In her diary - which became a publishing sensation after her death and has sold more than 31 million copies worldwide - she wrote of their first summer together when they were &apos;inseparable&apos;, walking hand-in-hand through their neighbourhood. She also described the painful, palpable dream she had of him, and of times when she awoke believing she could feel his cheek against hers.  She described, too, the adolescent angst she felt over the possibility of losing him. Recalling how they grew apart, she wrote on 7 January, 1944: &apos;I&apos;d gone to the country during the summer holidays, and when I came back Peter was no longer at his old address; he&apos;d moved and was living with a much older boy, who apparently told him I was just a child, because Peter stopped seeing me. I loved him so much that I didn&apos;t want to face the truth. I kept clinging to him until the day I finally realised that if I continued to chase after him, people would say I was mad about boys.&apos; Her last mention of Schiff, whom she called Petel, was at the end of April 1944, six weeks before her 15th birthday and three months before their safe house was raided by the German security police. After another passionate and intense dream, she wrote: &apos;I love Peter as I have never loved anyone.&apos;  Upon capture, Frank would be taken to Auschwitz, then to Bergen-Belsen where, just weeks before liberation, she died of typhus.  Until now Schiff has been a faceless footnote at the bottom of this most emotional chapter of modern history. He might have remained forever unknown but for a series of extraordinary coincidences revealed by the writer Simon Garfield in today&apos;s Observer Magazine The compelling story of how this picture was finally unearthed spans 70 years. It is rooted in a schoolboy friendship back in Berlin in the summer of 1939, amid the horrifying fallout of the Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews and before Schiff&apos;s family fled to Amsterdam.  It concludes in north London, where an 81-year-old widower&apos;s fractured, yet still vivid, memories set him on an inexorable quest to prove his old schoolboy friend was the same boy who would later win Frank&apos;s youthful heart. Before Schiff left Berlin for the Netherlands, he said goodbye to his close schoolfriend Ernst &apos;Mic&apos; Michaelis, who was being sent to England on the Kindertransport. As awkward 12-year-olds not knowing what futures they faced, nor how to bid each other farewell, they exchanged photographs.  Schiff wrote a note: &apos;In friendly remembrance of your friend Lutz Peter Schiff&apos;, using his full name. Michaelis pasted both note and photograph - which is a standard passport size - into an album. A few years later he transferred it to a larger album, and there it remained - for decades. Today Michaelis, a director of Pearson Panke, an automotive and aerospace machinery supplier, recalls how on first reading Frank&apos;s diary in the Fifties he idly wondered whether his friend Schiff could be the Peter of whom she wrote. Fifty years later his wife, after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, bought a new copy of the journal. Last year he re-read it after her death and became convinced his Peter was indeed Frank&apos;s.  &apos;I realised there were a lot of pictures associated with her life, but no picture of Peter Schiff,&apos; he tells Garfield. &apos;That seemed very odd, as his looks are at the heart of his story.&apos; It has taken time, extraordinary effort, internet research and a series of happy coincidences for Michaelis to get authentication that his picture is that of the Schiff whom Frank so adored. It will now go on display on the Anne Frank House website. &apos;He is a beautiful boy,&apos; said Garfield. &apos;It&apos;s just a passport-type picture, but it has never been seen outside of &quot;Mic&apos;s&quot; album. You can see why any girl of any age would fall for someone like that.&apos; And what of Schiff&apos;s fate? Records show he, too, was captured and died, either in Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen. The date of his death remains unknown - as his smile would have done had it not been for &apos;Mic&apos; and the part he has  Anne Frank&apos;s life \u00b7 Annelies Marie &apos;Anne&apos; Frank was born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt in 1929.

Forty minutes later, the first commercial aircraft to be powered partly by biofuel touched down at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, paving the way for what some claim could be a revolution in environmentally responsible aviation. The experiment was the brainchild of the Virgin Atlantic boss, Sir Richard Branson, who hailed the flight as a &quot;historic occasion&quot; and the first step towards using biofuels on commercial flights. Three of the 747&apos;s four tanks were filled with normal jet fuel while its fourth carried a mixture that was 80% jet fuel and 20% coconut and babassu palm oil.  &quot;Today marks a biofuel breakthrough for the whole airline industry,&quot; Branson told a press conference held next to the aircraft in a Heathrow hangar. &quot;Virgin Atlantic, and its partners, are proving that you can find an alternative to traditional jet fuel and fly a plane on new technology, such as sustainable biofuel.&quot; Branson has pledged to invest profits from his transport empire in biofuel production, but serious doubts have already been raised. Critics argue that biofuels damage developing countries by driving up food prices and harm the environment by encouraging deforestation.  The Heathrow trial, in partnership with Boeing, engine maker General Electric, and Imperium Renewables, attempted to assuage those concerns by using biofuel made from coconut oil harvested from existing plantations in the Philippines and oil from babassu palms, which grow wild in Brazil.  However, Branson admitted that the biofuel mix that partially powered yesterday&apos;s flight would not be used commercially. Wild ideas Land given to coconut plantations would have to be vastly expanded to satisfy the demands of aviation, resulting in deforestation, while the babassu palms used in yesterday&apos;s experiment are not available in sufficient numbers. The airline industry, he added, would probably have to turn to algae in its search for viable biofuels. Algae are grown in ponds rather than on land, so they do not require deforestation or take space that could be used for food crops.  Branson said: &quot;This pioneering flight will enable those of us who are serious about reducing our carbon emissions to go on developing the fuels of the future, fuels which will power our aircraft in the years ahead through sustainable next-generation oils, such as algae.&quot;  Environmental groups have warned that processing algae may produce more carbon dioxide than is saved by using it as an alternative fuel. There are also concerns that algae will compete for fresh-water sources as the ponds evaporate and have to be topped up.  Tim Jones, a policy officer at the World Development Movement, said the minimal amount of biofuel used in the trial underlined the difficulty of reducing emissions within the aviation industry. &quot;It only reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 20% and there is no technology available that allows us to fly without making emissions.&quot;  Kenneth Richter, Friends of the Earth aviation campaigner, said: &quot;Biofuels are a major distraction in the fight against climate change. There is mounting evidence that the carbon savings from biofuels are negligible. If Virgin was really serious about reducing the aviation industry&apos;s impact on the environment it would support calls for aircraft emissions to be included in the climate change bill.&quot;  Aircraft account for 5.5% of UK carbon dioxide emissions and Virgin Atlantic is not the first aviation group to experiment with alternative fuels. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer Airbus flew an A380 superjumbo with a mix of gas-to-liquid fuel.  A much-trumpeted biofuels trial at Virgin Trains was abandoned last year after the group lost its CrossCountry franchise. A Virgin Trains spokesman said the company was &quot;considering&quot; whether to launch a new trial on the West Coast route.  Concerns about biofuels have spread to mainstream transport companies including National Express, which abandoned a biofuel trial for its buses amid fears that it was causing more harm than good to the environment. The government acknowledged those concerns last week when it ordered a review of the environmental and economic impact of biofuels.  The transport secretary, Ruth Kelly, said the government might not support an EU proposal to increase the proportion of biofuel in petrol and diesel to 10% by 2020 if the review raises serious doubts.", "sentences": ["Forty minutes later, the first commercial aircraft to be powered partly by biofuel touched down at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, paving the way for what some claim could be a revolution in environmentally responsible aviation."], "title": "Branson's coconut airways - but jet is on a flight to nowhere, say critics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/25/biofuels.theairlineindustry", "tags": ["Biofuels", "Airline industry", "Virgin Group", "Transport", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "UK news", "Media", "World news", "Business", "Travel", "Travel and transport", "Air transport", "Richard Branson"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-25T11:30:22Z", "article": "Richard Branson milks the opportunity to promote Virgin&apos;s coconut, babassu, and kerosene powered flight. Photo: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images I doubt many of us had probably heard of babassu oil before a Virgin airline test flight, partly powered by biofuels, made the short hop from London to Amsterdam yesterday.  The oil, which is produced from a palm native to the Maranh\u00e3o Baba\u00e7u forests in the eastern Amazon, is typically used as a cooking oil, but is also used to make medicines and soap. Well, if test partners Virgin, Boeing and General Electric get their way, this versatile oil will be able to add another string to its bow: propelling humans around the globe at 900km an hour.  Along with coconut oil, babassu oil was blended - 20/80 - with traditional aviation-grade kerosene and fed into just one of the Virgin test plane&apos;s engines. The other engines were powered normally and we can assume the test went well because there were no big splashes reported in the North Sea.  If this test flight had taken place about five years ago, I&apos;m sure it would have received near universal praise. Back then, biofuels were being touted as the great &quot;green&quot; alternative to fossil fuels. But in recent years, the more we have examined biofuels, the more problems have appeared - particularly in relation to their claim to being &quot;carbon neutral&quot;. Branson, a master of PR, doesn&apos;t seem to have timed this latest high-profile stunt very well. Just last week, the UK government was putting the brakes on biofuels by ordering a review of their environmental and economic damage. In recent weeks, Science has published several damning papers about the effectiveness of using biofuels to reduce emissions. And just hours after the test flight landed safely, the Financial Times was reporting that the UN&apos;s World Food Programme is considering rationing food aid to the world&apos;s most needy because of spiralling food costs which are, in no small part, being driven up by the demand for biofuels - which, at present, are largely made from food crops. Feeding a starving child, or powering a flight to New York? It should never be a contest, but, following Virgin&apos;s test flight, it now is. The very thing that the critics of biofuels feared is now becoming a reality. (I wonder if the crew of Virgin Galactic&apos;s sub-orbital spacecraft will be pointing out the biofuel plantations below to space tourists when the first flights take off in the next couple of years?) One of the reasons environmentalists and others are crying foul over this test flight is because Virgin originally stated that it wouldn&apos;t be using a &quot;first-generation feedstock&quot; (most of which are produced from food crops such as corn and palm oil) to produce its biofuel. In the build-up to the test flight, Virgin had been suggesting that the feedstock would be derived from algae instead. But as many biofuel producers know all too well, it&apos;s much cheaper and more convenient to produce biofuels from food crops.  Rather than wait until an algae-derived biofuel was ready - which would probably be something to herald - Virgin felt the need to jump the gun so it could still claim to be the first airline in the world to trial a biofuel. As a result, it will now justly get the flack for using a feedstock that should be feeding people instead. The hunt will go on, though, for a &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement for kerosene - one that doesn&apos;t require a huge and costly change in refuelling infrastructure. If the aviation industry is to keep growing at its current pace, and yet still manage to reduce its emissions burden, it is clearly going to need to keep trialling new fuels. And the key hurdle is finding one that can meet kerosene&apos;s &quot;high energy density&quot; - in other words, its oomph. A hard task, indeed. But even if someone did manage to produce, say, an algae-derived aviation fuel, we are still a long way from it ever being used to power commercial flights for the simple reason that the aviation industry, by necessity, is a highly risk-averse industry. No one wants to risk the lives of 300 people travelling at 30,000ft. Therefore, it would take at least a decade before any such fuel was passed as safe by regulators. It&apos;s for this reason that most industry commentators see kerosene remaining the dominant aviation fuel for at least the next two to three decades - a period for which a continued fast growth in aviation emissions is predicted. So will its arrival be too little, too late? Personally, I welcome research into new aviation fuels, but worry greatly that the current focus means that we&apos;ll end up with an alternative fuel that ultimately presents more problems than solutions. The one solution that just doesn&apos;t seem to be able to fly at present is simply reducing the number of planes we send up into the atmosphere. But that would require a political fuel no one has yet seen the likes of.", "sentences": ["Photo: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images I doubt many of us had probably heard of babassu oil before a Virgin airline test flight, partly powered by biofuels, made the short hop from London to Amsterdam yesterday."], "title": "Forests cleared for takeoff?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/feb/25/forestsclearedfortakeoff", "tags": ["Biofuels", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-02-26T00:50:37Z", "article": "Margery Hinton  Age 13 Event Swimming Games 1928 Amsterdam Remains the youngest British Olympian.

It is then that an area will have been set aside for Britain&apos;s diving sensation to sit down and chat with the friends he has not seen for more than a week. &quot;We ensure that Tom has catch-up time,&quot; said his head of year, Antony Piper, yesterday. &quot;But do not expect him to brag about what he has achieved. He is not a big-head, he is modest, he is grounded and he only talks about his diving when someone asks him about it. His success is fantastic but he misses school and it is important that he sees his friends.&quot; While Daley might be keen to know about the latest playground gossip, let alone some of the homework he missed while away, it is his own latest adventure which will probably take up much of the conversation. Even to the mates who follow his every dive, Daley&apos;s exploits have become quite a story. On Sunday in Beijing Daley, who will not turn 14 until May, earned himself a historic return trip to the city by qualifying to represent Britain at the Olympic Games. When he arrives back in China, he will become the youngest male to compete for Britain at the Games since Rome in 1960 when Kenneth Lester was the cox in the coxed pairs at the age of 13 years and 144 days. As Daley celebrated this achievement, he said from Beijing yesterday: &quot;Going to an Olympic Games is a dream come true. I didn&apos;t think I was going to make an Olympics this year - not a lot of 13-year-olds do that.&quot; Daley confirmed his place for Beijing when - needing to finish inside the top eight to ensure enough points to qualify - he came seventh in the men&apos;s 10m platform competition at the Diving World Cup. However, as he flew home last night, any concerns he or his parents may have about catching up on missed school work are not shared by his understanding head of year. &quot;We have a good arrangement with Tom,&quot; said Piper. &quot;He keeps in close contact with the school and he lets us know well in advance of where he is going to be so his teachers can set him work. He is very conscientious, he emails it back and the English Institute of Sport also arrange tutors for him when he is away. &quot;We have already spoken to his parents about [what subjects he takes in] his options, to fit in with what he is doing.&quot; It can become complicated, though. At 9am on Tuesday May 6, Daley is expected to sit maths exams but he is not due home from Montreal until the day before. However, that is the lifestyle which has become normal for a diver who was first taken to his local pool in Plymouth as an eight-year-old by his father Rob and was so nervous of the heights that he hid and cried. His first coach, Sam Grevett, recalls how Andy Banks - now Daley&apos;s coach and her fellow director on the Plymouth Diving Programme - could not endorse the star they had on their hands. &quot;He had had a couple of lessons and I remember thinking he had a real talent,&quot; said Grevett. &quot;I told Andy he needed to see this kid dive. Tom used to hide behind the pillars, because he was scared of the heights of 3m and the unknown. &quot;It is a good story because Andy saw him and said that, though he might have the physical talent, does he have the mental side? He did not think he would have what it takes. &quot;On his first trip away, to Southampton, it was all quite traumatic for Tom being away from home. We had to ring his parents, who had to come down. But now it is Tom who acts as a mentor to the younger kids.&quot; Nonetheless Grevett was convinced by what she saw. &quot;Even at eight he had all the hallmarks of a great diver,&quot; she added. &quot;He had acrobatics and, for a boy, he had pointed toes and straight knees.&quot; His progress has been remarkable. Even though was 10, he won the British national junior under-18 title to become the event&apos;s youngest winner, before last year becoming part of the senior grand prix and World Cup circuit. Last month his victory in the 10m platform made him the youngest winner of the British senior crown. It is a platform - literally - for this latest success, which has meant a summer holiday from school like no other with the Olympics in August. &quot;I have a great deal of support from my family,&quot; said Daley. &quot;I have also had to sacrifice a great deal of time with my friends. &quot;But I have stayed determined and work hard at my sport. It has all been worth it now. I know why I do it.&quot; Britain&apos;s youngest Olympians Margery Hinton  Age 13 Event Swimming Games 1928 Amsterdam Remains the youngest British Olympian.

Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Even the most enthusiastic supporters of Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum will be knocked sideways by the figures revealing just how popular this Glasgow institution has become. In its latest annual survey of gallery attendance figures, the Art Newspaper shows Kelvingrove is running neck and neck with the highest hitters in the world. Sure, it&apos;s not quite in the league of the Louvre, the Pompidou Centre or Tate Modern, but it&apos;s giving St Petersburg&apos;s State Hermitage Museum a run for its money and it is considerably ahead of Florence&apos;s Uffizi, London&apos;s National Portrait Gallery and Amsterdam&apos;s Van Gogh Museum. Kelvingrove&apos;s figures have long been close to a million a year, making it the most popular UK museum outside London, but since it re-opened in 2006 after a \u00a329m refurbishment, the attendance has more than doubled. With their favourite museum having been closed for three years, Glaswegians returned in droves - and then came back for more. The doors opened in July and by mid-morning on January 25, the two millionth visitor had crossed the threshold. The numbers have stayed steady ever since. The Art Newspaper reports that during 2007, Kelvingrove attracted 2,232,475 people, beating New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art by 13,000 in a city seven times smaller. It&apos;s tempting to attribute such popularity to the power of blockbuster shows such as Kylie: The Exhibition, which recently completed a four-month run, but that&apos;s not the case. The prospect of seeing the princess of pop&apos;s stage outfits - not to mention those gold lam\u00e9 hot pants - certainly lured people, but not in sufficient numbers (about 80,000 in the first month) to explain Kelvingrove&apos;s place in the gallery super league. For that you have to look at two things. One is the quality of the collection at what is the largest civic museum and art gallery in the UK. People just can&apos;t get enough of Sir Roger the Elephant, Rembrant&apos;s A Man in Armour and especially Salvador Dali&apos;s Christ of St John of the Cross.

Having to retrieve a 3-2 deficit from the home leg of the last-16 tie is formidable enough, but, before yesterday&apos;s visit to Hibernian, the Scottish champions&apos; domestic form since the visit from the Catalan side had been distinguished by a potentially harmful lack of conviction. There is nothing new about nervous victories over low-level opponents such as St Mirren and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, but the three matches before the encounter with Bar\u00e7a had been won by an aggregate of 13-2. The pattern seems to allow the inference that their bad experience against Frank Rijkaard&apos;s side may have left Gordon Strachan&apos;s players punch drunk. The Parkhead club&apos;s manager has been immersed in the business long enough to know better than to make optimistic pronouncements. Indeed, when asked about the chances of progress to the quarter-finals immediately after the first match, he replied: &apos;Let&apos;s put it this way, I wouldn&apos;t put my house on it.&apos; He is also aware, however, of the need to avoid travelling in despair and the starting point in his pre-match address to the troops is likely to be an assurance that they are unlikely to perform as poorly again as they did in Glasgow. Strachan would not go as far as admitting that the standard of Barcelona&apos;s performance 11 days ago had been exaggerated by the poverty of his own team&apos;s, but he did concede the need for significant improvement. &apos;There&apos;s absolutely no doubt about that, we will have to improve,&apos; he said. &apos;However brilliant Barcelona may have been, we thought we could have played better. I think we have to go there with the conviction that we simply have to score the first goal, and at any time.&apos; The return of Scott Brown, suspended for the first leg, brings the hope of an energetic, forceful presence in midfield that was missing from the first match. The former Hibernian player is renowned for his seemingly inexhaustible box-to-box capacity, although his work in this first season at Celtic Park has been marked by a frustrating inconsistency. Nor will Brown&apos;s commitment have much relevance if the team as a collective do not pass the ball more effectively than they managed in the home leg. This was such a weakness that Barcelona enjoyed 67 per cent of the possession, an extraordinary figure in a contest at that stage of Europe&apos;s most competitive tournament. &apos;At this level, keeping the ball is always the key,&apos; said Strachan. &apos;We gave it away so often and Bar\u00e7a had it so long in the game here that we got tired chasing around to try to get it back off them. That&apos;s when you make mistakes. It&apos;s why I try to make our players super-fit, so that they don&apos;t make mistakes through fatigue. Yes, Scott Brown could be an important player for us, but the really important ones will be those who are able to hold on to the ball.&apos; There may be some encouragement to be drawn, too, from historical evidence: teams who win away from home in Europe occasionally perform strangely in the return. Celtic themselves were victims in Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s first European campaign, when they returned from Amsterdam with a 3-1 victory over Ajax in the first leg of a Champions League qualifier and lost 1-0 at Parkhead. It is unlikely, though, that players as accomplished as those who wear the red and blue shirts will be overcome by uncertainty. Rijkaard is famously committed to winning, as opposed to the avoidance of defeat, and, at Camp Nou especially, nobody should rely on his abandoning his principles. The clear definition of Celtic&apos;s task at least precludes the possibility of Strachan&apos;s becoming mired in complicated strategy. The Scot&apos;s instructions to his players will stress the need to test the Bar\u00e7a defence as they did when scoring twice in the first match. &apos;Whatever the circumstances, I think you always feel better about yourself if you give it a go,&apos; he said. &apos;Of course, we can&apos;t be gung-ho about this, because they have forwards who will inflict severe punishment. But being ultra-defensive is as risky as total attack. Despite the position we find ourselves in, I&apos;m looking forward to it immensely. This is your reward for the hard work it takes to win leagues. You have to win championships to get to this level, to let your supporters see a team of that quality in the flesh.&apos; Far from investing their house, few if any punters would put foreign coins on Celtic&apos;s chances.

There have been suggestions that this is because he believes the great divide in politics is not between Labour and Tory, but between the political class and the voters outside (with whom he wants to align himself). So will he continue to project himself as an outsider? Or will he return to yah-boo politics as normal? Scroll down for latest Midday GMT We&apos;re off. Gordon Brown starts with condolences to a sergeant who died in Iraq on Friday. Poverty pay   Fabian Hamilton (Lab, Leeds North East) asks if the minimum wage will continue to rise in line with average earnings. Brown reveals it will rise to \u00a35.73 per hour in November. David Cameron The Tory leader also pays tribute to the fallen sergeant, whose family live in his constituency. He asks Brown if he thinks he would win a referendum on the Lisbon treaty if one was held. Brown says he would hold a referendum if it were a constitutional treaty. But the constitutional concept was abandoned. And what would the Tories do? Cameron points out that Brown did not answer the question. Brown says that the last time a referendum was held in Europe (in 1975) it was won by a &quot;massive majority&quot;.  He says that 60% of the UK&apos;s trade is with Europe, and that it would be put at risk by &quot;Conservative intransigence on Europe&quot;. 12.05pm Cameron points out, again, that Brown has not answered the &quot;would he win?&quot; question. &quot;If it looks like the constitution, and it sounds like the constitution, that&apos;s because it is the constitution,&quot; he says. Brown quotes the former chancellor - Ken Clarke? - saying the treaty is different from the constitution.  Cameron hits back with a quote from Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who helped to draw up the original constitution. Then he moves onto a wider point about the electorate being let down.  Brown says that Cameron has no support in the rest of Europe. He says if Cameron had changed his party, &quot;he would be leading his backbenchers, not following them&quot;.  Instead Cameron would take the UK &quot;to the margins of Europe&quot;. New universities  An MP asks if Swindon can bid for a new university (a reference to an announcement this week that the government is looking for 20 towns or cities that will house new universities). 12.10pm Nick Clegg The Lib Dem leader offers his condolences too.  He says that Brown once said he would build a wider pro-European movement in Britain.  How will Brown achieve that by colluding with the opposition to oppose an in/out referendum on Europe, he asks.  By not walking out, Brown hits back (a reference to the Lib Dem protest last week). Clegg, who is sounding quite impassioned, accuses Brown of &quot;bottling it&quot; and says that Cameron really believes in pulling out of Europe. Brown says that a referendum on the in/out issue would be &quot;reliving the 1970s&quot;. He rejects the approach. Bus travel for pensioners  Shona McIsaac (Lab, Cleethorpes) asks about pensioner travel in her constituency. Brown quotes the amount of money being invested in bus travel. David Cameron Cameron says there are six policy investigations into the conduct of government in London. He refers to the latest, relating to the London Development Agency. Brown says this is a matter for the police, not the Commons. Cameron says that while the investigations are going on Ken Livingstone said he trusted Lee Jasper &quot;with his life&quot;.  And he claims Livingstone is committed to reappointing Jasper. Brown says that Jasper has resigned. And he accuses the Tory candidate, Boris Johnson, of being in favour of cutting the police budget in London. 12.15pm Drugs  Eddie O&apos;Hara (Lab) asks Brown to condemn celebrities using drugs. Brown says it is very important for celebrities and role models to send out the right message on drugs. Education   John Hayes (Con) asks about the 1.25 million young people not in employment, education or training. Is is because of the numbers of immigrant workers, or the numbers of children leaving school without appropriate qualifications, he asks. Brown says there is an issue &quot;about young people who fall through the net&quot; but that the way to deal with it is to raise the school leaving age to 18, as the government is doing. Windfall levy on energy companies    David Marshall (Lab) asks Brown to consider a windfall levy on the energy companies.  Brown says there have been windfall profits made by the energy companies.  He says they have offered extra money to help poor customers pay their fuel bills. But it is not as generous as the government&apos;s winter fuel allowances. Foreign prisoners  Brown is asked why the &quot;bribes&quot; to foreign prisoners to go home have been increased. Brown defends the policy. Child health programmes    Chris McCafferty (Lab) asks about services for mothers in the developing world. Brown says half a million mothers die every year unnecessarily in childbirth.  He says the UK has formed an international health partnership to improve maternity services in the developing world. Ian Paisley   Gregory Campbell (DUP, Londonderry East) asks Brown to congratulate the outgoing Northern Irish first minister on his almost 40 years as an MP and his determination not to give in to terrorism. Brown says everyone wants to pay tribute to the work Paisley did in the final stages of the peace process, and his &quot;resolute determination to stand up to terrorism at every point&quot;.  He reveals he phoned Paisley last night to wish him well. Universities    Phyllis Starkey (Lab, Milton Keynes South West) says she would like her town to be home to one of the new universities.  Brown says he hopes many towns will submit bids. Milton Keynes is home to the Open University, &quot;known throughout the world&quot;. 12.20pm EU   Peter Bottomley (Con) asks what polling evidence Brown considered about the likely result of a referendum.  Brown says the most important figures were the results in the 1975 referendum.  And he points out that the Tories opposed a referendum on Maastricht. Voting at 16 Brown is asked if he favours lowering the voting age.  Brown says it should be part of a public debate, along with the question of a ceremony for people coming to the voting age. EU   Ann Winterton, a Tory Eurosceptic, says the Lisbon treaty is undemocratic. Brown says parliament is debating the issue.  He challenges the Tories to say what they really want. &quot;They are not simply anti-the amending treaty. They are anti-Europe.&quot; Polyclinics   David Taylor (Lab) suggests polyclinics - super-GP clinics, an idea being promoted by the government - may be &quot;a step too far&quot;.  Brown dodges that issue, but says the government is working to encourage more weekend opening of GPs&apos; surgeries. Hospices   Mark Hunter (Lib Dem) asks about hospice funding. Brown agrees to meet an all-party delegation, and says the government is spending more than ever on them. EU   Geraldine Smith (Lab) says a referendum would be tantamount to parliament abrogating its responsibilities.  But will Brown also agree that many people view the EU as a monstrosity?  Brown does not agree with her second point, but he supports her first point.  The treaties of Nice, Amsterdam and Maastricht were all decided by the Commons, not by a referendum, he points out. Open prisons   Steve Webb (Lib Dem, Northavon) asks about security vetting in open prisons. Brown says vetting does take place in these jails.  Prison numbers are going up because more offenders are being brought to justice. 12.30pm Cluster munitions Brown is asked to back demands to outlaw cluster munitions, in the way the UK campaigned to ban landmines.  Brown condemns weapons that cause &quot;unacceptable harm&quot; and says the issue is under discussion. Instant verdict   News story: Brown has had some of his best PMQs when he&apos;s had an announcement to make and today he revealed that the minimum wage is rising later in the year. But it did not seem to take anyone by surprise, or buy him much goodwill in the chamber. The new Cameron? For the second week in a row, he avoided aggressive soundbites. He split his questions - four on Europe, two on Ken Livingstone - but both involved issues of probity and trust. Attacking the Eurosceptics: Brown was trying hard to brand the Tories as rabid, anti-EU little Englanders - the image that damaged the party so much during William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith&apos;s leadership.  And Nick Clegg went even further, saying that Cameron was privately committed to pulling out of the EU. Cameron has done a good job in recent weeks in resisting this - focusing the debate on the issue of trust and the referendum, rather than on the rights and wrongs of Europe - although Ann Winterton gave MPs a reminder of what that the Tory Eurosceptic right has not gone away. A full transcript of PMQs is available here from Hansard from about 4pm.

CCC had said earlier it received margin calls totalling more than $37m on Wednesday and expected at least one more default notice. The Dutch market regulator (AFM) suspended trading in CCC after its shares closed on Thursday at $5, having lost more than half their value. Carlyle Group has a $150m exposure to CCC through a credit facility. CCC said on Friday some of its Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) had been liquidated by lenders and additional margin calls and increased collateral requirements &quot;would be significant and well in excess of the margin calls it received Wednesday&quot;. Even more securities could be liquidated by lenders, it said, adding the company was in discussion with its lenders regarding its financing and considering all available options for the company. Britain&apos;s The Times newspaper reported lenders included Bank of America, Bear Stearns, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and ING. &quot;Based on the weakened market, several of the company&apos;s lenders marked down the value of the company&apos;s RMBS securities and informed the company that they would soon materially increase their collateral requirements,&quot; CCC said. These additional margin calls and increased collateral requirements could quickly deplete its liquidity and impair its capital, CCC added. Listed on the Amsterdam exchange last July, CCC invests in products including investment grade mortgage-backed securities. As of last month, CCC had a $21.7bn investment portfolio of AAA-rated floating-rate capped U.S. mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It reported a 2007 net profit of $16.8m last month and Carlyle Group agreed to increase an unsecured revolving credit facility to $150m from $100m.CCC decided against a dividend for the fourth quarter after a $34m loss in the third. Washington DC based The Carlyle Group has more than $75bn under management and has attracted a string of high-profile advisers including US president George Bush in the early 1990s and former British prime minister John Major.

She looks past me, as if the scene were projected on the wall behind my head. &quot;I remember walking down through the back lot, where the big studio doors were. And suddenly, as I was walking past, one of these big doors lifted up ... and it just took my breath away.&quot; She seems genuinely moved. &quot;Inside they were doing a scene from Dickens, and it was winter, and there was snow on the floor, and little cottages, and people in costume. It was like a door opening on a fairy tale. It was just magical. And having grown up watching those old Ealing films, I just thought, God, I&apos;ve come home.&quot; When Hellings&apos; first chance to direct something finally arrived, the circumstances were rather different. She found herself on a beach in Hastings at 5am with a disgruntled Blue Peter cameraman and a shivering Lesley Judd, waiting for the wreck of the Amsterdam - or &quot;five very wet-looking timbers&quot; as she remembers it - to be revealed by the tide. Fortunately, the Amsterdam showed up. We both take a sip of red wine. The atmosphere is very civilised in the pleasant west London flat where Hellings stays during the weeks she is working. And at the moment, indeed, it seems as if she does little else. The only time she could spare to meet me was tonight, and even now her jilted laptop whirls impatiently for attention. Currently, Hellings is engaged in the &quot;prep&quot; (-aration) period for an episode of ITV&apos;s Midsomer Murders, on which she is a regular director. Not one inch of film has been shot, yet her array of duties is already bewildering. Today, she tells me, she has just emerged from a seven-hour meeting with the props and set design team, &quot;going through the script, line by line, talking about what props we&apos;d need, how sets should look, ironing out every single detail.&quot; But this, after all, is the film director&apos;s lot: to be beset by details. &quot;Thousands,&quot; Hellings agrees. Yesterday, for instance, she had to travel to a forest to look at possible sites where a well might be built. She also had to meet the makeup designer to agree on the planned appearance of a lightly putrefied corpse. &quot;We&apos;ll go through photographs and occasionally look at each other and think, what kind of job are we doing here?&quot; Certainly not one that made much sense to her as a girl. &quot;I was always completely glued to the television as a child,&quot; says Hellings. &quot;I think I wanted to be a film director before I even knew what they did.&quot; She began to find out at Oxford in the late 60s, where she studied English and joined the film society. With a friend, scrounging equipment wherever they could, she managed to make a film about a student and his hat. &quot;I remember thinking at the time what a difficult job it was,&quot; she recalls. &quot;My friends got bored pretty quickly.&quot; After this came her BBC traineeship, followed by Blue Peter, where Hellings was quickly spotted and offered a few episodes of the nursing soap Angels. Later on, because of her other commitments, she had to turn down the chance to direct another gritty new BBC series, called EastEnders. &quot;I&apos;m not sure I was the right choice,&quot; she says, &quot;but I was very flattered to be asked.&quot; Instead, Hellings directed some of the BBC&apos;s other institutions, such as Juliet Bravo and Doctor Who, before finally leaving to work for ITV as a freelancer. There, she has established herself in primetime dramas such as Taggart, Soldier, Soldier, and now Midsomer Murders. On each job, however, the exhausting schedule is the same. First, before Hellings even sees a script, comes an informal offer to direct an episode of a series. &quot;I won&apos;t be loved for saying this,&quot; she steels herself to announce, &quot;but I think most directors would say that it isn&apos;t very often that their agent gets them a job. It&apos;s usually through somebody you know. But what you do rely on the agent for is supporting you through the contract period.&quot; With contracts signed, and the script in hand, prep begins. For five weeks, Hellings rushes around gradually piecing together an overall vision for the film. During this period, she will also cast the actors, which is usually her best chance to work with them on the details of their performance. During the prep, the director is often in the odd position of choosing what to spend the programme&apos;s money on, without actually knowing how much they have to spend. &quot;I&apos;m expected to keep to the budget,&quot; Hellings explains, &quot;but I&apos;m not told what it is. You&apos;re constantly testing the associate producer, who holds the purse strings.&quot; If she wants to go to the expense of booking a crane, for instance, perhaps for one momentous overhead shot, then she must be utterly convinced the film demands it - and must be prepared to stake her reputation on that conviction. While the associate producer will often trust her judgment, she knows that this may not last much longer if she starts to get it wrong. With preparations completed, the shoot itself arrives. Lasting a further five weeks, it pushes the director&apos;s capacity for work and pressure to the limits. For Hellings, intense 15-hour days that start at 5am are standard, with the added responsibility of making certain the team get the shots they need. With actors, crew, locations and equipment only booked and budgeted for a specific period, the consequences of one day&apos;s overrun can be catastrophic. &quot;If you&apos;ve got to do the explosion scene,&quot; she says, the urgency rising in her voice even as she describes it, &quot;and the house has got to fall down, and you&apos;re moving on to the next location the next day, and the actors are out of contract - then there&apos;s no question that you don&apos;t finish. You have to finish. And the pressure is ...&quot; It seems there are no words that will adequately convey what the pressure is. In fact, the secret to delivering under these circumstances turns out to be quite simple. &quot;It&apos;s speed,&quot; says Hellings. &quot;You do it quickly. But part of my job is to let the actors think there&apos;s all the time in the world.&quot; In the same way, during a shoot, it makes sense for all unnecessary distractions to be stripped from the director&apos;s life, giving them the status on set of something approaching a medieval king. &quot;You can get quite spoilt,&quot; Hellings admits, &quot;because you&apos;ve only got to say, &apos;Is there any coffee?&apos; And you hear somebody on a walkie-talkie saying, &apos;Can we have a coffee for Sarah? Now!&apos; I suppose that is quite extraordinary.&quot; Conversely, she has learned to employ the director&apos;s privilege of being blunt when there is no time for politeness. &quot;If I&apos;m a tyrant, then it&apos;s not me, it&apos;s the director,&quot; she says. &quot;It is not an arena for having personal feelings. It really isn&apos;t.&quot; Finally comes the editing process, when Hellings gets to see much of what she suffered for go to waste (but not, under any circumstances, the crane shot). &quot;I try to look at it as though it was someone else&apos;s work,&quot; she says, before admitting this is not always possible. &quot;The classic thing,&quot; she says, &quot;is to have the director sitting in the cutting room saying, &apos;But that was such a difficult shot! We were so thrilled to achieve it!&apos; But if it ain&apos;t working, you don&apos;t keep it.&quot; With a workload like this, Hellings needs plenty of time off. Like all freelancers, she makes the most of the inactivity, and now, thanks to her own seniority and her husband&apos;s income, she is under less pressure to keep working. &quot;I&apos;m very fortunate,&quot; she says, apologetically. &quot;And when I think how lucky I am, I do temper it by thinking of all the times I&apos;ve got up at five in the morning in the freezing cold, perhaps not feeling terribly well.&quot; Her eyes open again. &quot;When my contemporaries have just turned over and snuggled deeper into the pillow.&quot; Curriculum Vitae Current position Freelance director Hours &quot;During prep, probably 8am-8pm five days a week. And when I&apos;m shooting, I&apos;ll leave the house at six, get back at eight, and probably have an hour&apos;s work to do in bed. But then there will be months without work.&quot; Pay &quot;For a senior director on an established series, an annual income of \u00a370,000 to \u00a3100,000 or more.&quot; Career high &quot;Working on a scene with the actors when it comes to life.&quot; Career low &quot;Knowing that you simply have to go in to work when you&apos;re shooting.&quot;", "sentences": ["She found herself on a beach in Hastings at 5am with a disgruntled Blue Peter cameraman and a shivering Lesley Judd, waiting for the wreck of the Amsterdam - or &quot;five very wet-looking timbers&quot; as she remembers it - to be revealed by the tide.", "Fortunately, the Amsterdam showed up."], "title": "Action stations", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/mar/08/workandcareers3", "tags": ["Work & careers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-08T00:09:48Z", "article": "Saturday March 8 And Then There Were None (Ren\u00e9 Clair, 1945) 2.20pm, BBC2 An enjoyable adaptation of Agatha Christie&apos;s thriller/stage play, in which a group of people receive mysterious invitations to an eery mansion on a remote Cornish island - and they accept! Soon they are being murdered, one by one, and it dawns on them that they are being punished for past misdeeds. Diamonds Are Forever (Guy Hamilton, 1971) 3.25pm, ITV1 Sean Connery&apos;s sixth outing as Bond, and he wasn&apos;t tempted back until 1983 in Never Say Never Again. He&apos;s taking on Charles Gray&apos;s sleek Blofeld, who is doing for diamonds what Goldfinger did for bullion, and triggers the now tiring formula: classy, cocktail lounge theme song (belted out by Shirley Bassey); large-scale action delivered with tongue-in-cheek wit, exotic locations, and the essential toughness Roger Moore lacked (a fight in an Amsterdam lift sets the tone). The babes are Jill St John as Tiffany Case and Lana Wood as Plenty O&apos;Toole. The Man Without A Face (Mel Gibson, 1993) 5.40pm, Five Earnest directorial debut by Gibson, which at least avoids the potential mawkishness of this rites-of-passage story. He also stars as a reclusive, badly disfigured former teacher approached by fatherless 12-year-old Nick Stahl to coach him into military school; heartwarming friendship ensues between surrogate son and dad, but dim locals suspect abuse... We Were Soldiers (Randall Wallace, 2002) 9pm, C4 The old Braveheart team of director Wallace and star Mel Gibson are reunited for another battle-primed piece of historical biography. This time the subject is Vietnam veteran Lt Col Harold G Moore, and although it&apos;s adapted from his own memoir, we learn little about him except that he loves his kids, he&apos;s a good Christian, and one bad-ass soldier. He leads a battalion of the Seventh Cavalry against thousands of Viet Cong; like Black Hawk Down, it&apos;s another tough-and-bloody action movie celebrating, post-9/11, American heroism. Parenthood (Ron Howard, 1989) 10.30pm, ITV1 Perceptive domestic comedy with Steve Martin as a dad up-to-here with family responsibilities. Mary Steenburgen plays his wife; Dianne Wiest is his divorced sister, and Tom Hulce, Keanu Reeves and Rick Moranis are relatives heaping worries on his shoulders while he tries to live up to his own father, Jason Robards. Cursed (Wes Craven, 2005) 11.30pm, BBC1 The Scream movies team of Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson are reunited for this modern-day werewolf tale:Christina Ricci and Jesse Eisenberg are the LA siblings who have to find and kill the dog that bit them to avoid being transformed into hairy monsters. It&apos;s more interested in wry humour and drawing parallels with Aids infection than out-and-out horror. Tin Men (Barry Levinson, 1987) 11.30pm, BBC2 Levinson returns to his beloved Baltimore with a richly comic tale of the titanic clash of two aluminium-siding salesmen. Danny De Vito and Richard Dreyfuss are the so-called tin men, fast guns in the sales world whose cars crunch heavily into each other&apos;s lives. Carrie (Brian De Palma, 1976) 12.40am, C4 Hysterical adaptation of a quivery Stephen King tale. Waif-like Sissy Spacek is the put-upon teenie unleashing telekinetic powers to avenge herself on catty schoolmates: cue at least one bucket of blood. Spacek and Piper Laurie, as her demented mum, are impressive, and there are early appearances by John Travolta and Nancy Allen. The Other Sister (Garry Marshall, 1999) 2.05am, ITV1 A manipulative and meandering account of a young, mentally challenged woman&apos;s struggle to cope with life. But the performances almost make it worthwhile: Juliette Lewis is Carla, who is trying to free herself from overprotective mother Diane Keaton; Tom Skerritt is the father and Giovanni Ribisi her boyfriend. Repo Man (Alex Cox, 1984) 2.25am, BBC2  Cult-film fan Alex Cox&apos;s first feature is a weird tale of LA kid Emilio Estevez who lands a job assisting car repossession ace Harry Dean Stanton. The two are swiftly embroiled in a race with police, CIA, scientists and heavies to locate a &apos;64 Chevy. The action accelerates furiously to a mind-battering punk soundtrack: a brilliantly funny thriller. Sunday March 9 Lonely Are The Brave (David Miller, 1962) 11.30am, Five A thoughtful, affecting contemporary western with Kirk Douglas as an old-fashioned outlaw: a lone horseman pursued by sympathetic sheriff Walter Matthau&apos;s helicopters and jeeps. The formerly blacklisted Dalton Trumbo&apos;s script is an elegy to a vanished time. The Taking Of Pelham 123 (Joseph Sargent, 1974) 6.10pm, Five Enough to keep you off the tube for life: four masked gunmen hijack a New York subway train and demand $1m, or the passengers start dying. Robert Shaw as the ruthless gang boss and the late, great Walter Matthau as the transport cop try to out-gruff each other in a grimy, gloomy thriller that&apos;s now being remade by Tony Scott with John Travolta and Denzel Washington. Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (Jonathan Mostow, 2003) 9pm, Five Mostow&apos;s efficient third chapter of the cyborg saga lacks the crunchy power and energy of James Cameron&apos;s first two, but is still very watchable. It has a similar blend of state-of-the-art special effects, anti-nuke sentiment and slushy man-and-machine friendship, between Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s soft-circuited T-101 and young rebel leader John Connor (Nick Stahl). Crash (Paul Haggis, 2004) 10pm, C4 Using the Short Cuts/Magnolia trick of intertwining separate lives via the vagaries of fate, debut director/writer Haggis (who more recently made In The Valley Of Elah) creates a dramatic portrait of an incorrigibly racist LA; Don Cheadle&apos;s decent black detective pulls it all together as these lives violently collide. Some of the plot coincidences feel too contrived, but it&apos;s powerful and gripping, if not the classic its best picture Oscar suggested. The Client (Joel Schumacher, 1994) 10.20pm, BBC1 Another so-so screen version of a John Grisham novel. This is the one about a youngster (the recently-departed Brad Renfro) told by a mob lawyer on the verge of death the whereabouts of a very important corpse. Tommy Lee Jones is the DA trying to prise the information out, while the hoods try to silence the boy for good, his only friend in all the world being boozy lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). Well acted, glossy, but slack on suspense. Monday March 10 Cruising (William Friedkin, 1980) 11pm, Five An ugly little thriller from the director of The Exorcist. Al Pacino is at his most histrionic as a cop going undercover to track down a sadistic serial killer of homosexuals in New York. Crudely scripted and nastily violent, the only plus-points are the authentic city locations. Angel Eyes (Luis Mandoki, 2001) 11.50pm, C4 Jennifer Lopez stars as a tough Chicago cop, and it has enough action and arrests to fulfil the basic requirements of the genre. But it&apos;s also deeper than that: Lopez&apos;s Sharon is a conflicted soul still dealing with the time she blew the whistle on her wife-beating father, and attracted to another haunted character, the enigmatic Catch (Jim Caviezel). With a complex and assured screenplay and all-round convincing performances, it&apos;s a compelling tale. Goodbye Lover (Roland Joffe, 1998) 11.55pm, BBC1 Little to be said for this lurid neo-noir comedy: the stodgy script barely registers on the suspense-ogram or the laughometer. Don Johnson and Dermot Mulroney are brothers struggling over femme fatale Patricia Arquette; but there is one winning performance - Ellen DeGeneres as a hardboiled cop. Tuesday March 11 Strictly Sinatra (Peter Capaldi, 2001) 11.45pm, BBC1 Toni Cocozza (Ian Hart) is a would-be Sinatra on the Scottish cabaret circuit; but it&apos;s a murky business behind the stage lights, and he&apos;s soon embroiled with scary Glaswegian gangsters. Writer-director Capaldi searches for a fresh take on the grim Brit crime thriller, but despite the weighty presence of Brian Cox, Tommy Flanagan and Ian Cuthbertson,it plays like an average TV drama. Great Sinatra songs, though. Wednesday March 12 Showgirls (Paul Verhoeven, 1996) 10pm, Five Verhoeven, better known for lavish sci-fi extravaganzas such as Total Recall and Starship Troopers, also had a penchant for titillating nudity on screen - see early films such as Turkish Delight and Flesh And Blood. Here he goes the whole hog, with a tacky tale of rampant ambition in the sleazy world of Las Vegas nightclub erotic dancing. Made (Jon Favreau, 2001) 11.30pm, BBC1 Jon Favreau, scriptwriter of the indie hit Swingers, makes an intriguing directorial debut here. He and Swingers co-star Vince Vaughn star as a pair of boxers turned errand boys for crime boss Peter &quot;Columbo&quot; Falk. There&apos;s lots of fun as Vaughn&apos;s big-mouthed, ambitious Ricky drops the friends into heaps of trouble, while Favreau&apos;s Bobby tries to dig them out and get back to his stripper girlfriend Famke Janssen. Thursday March 13 Get Carter (Stephen Kay, 2000) 10.10pm, Five A Hollywood remake of Mike Hodges&apos; British gangster classic always sounded like a dodgy enterprise, and so it proves. The action switches from an atmospheric, downbeat Newcastle to a glitzy Seattle, while a spectacularly wooden Sylvester Stallone replaces the implacable Michael Caine in the title role (Caine appears briefly here, too).

My cousin was sure I&apos;d crack, but Little Me was a fundamentalist: he didn&apos;t just dislike fags, he pitied the puffing masses who caved into peer pressure behind the sports hall. Aged nine, Little Me took to dragging on incense sticks, but didn&apos;t inhale. They were cheaper than cigarettes and freely on sale (100 for 35p) in a Norfolk hippy shop. When I was a teenager, several militant anti-smoking mates became seasoned smokers over the course of a weekend, a betrayal that felt a bit like adultery. When they started driving, they used their cars as giant bongs. If I was asked to partake, Little Me sternly challenged, &quot;Go on then, loser.&quot; Intimidated, Bigger-But-Scrawny-Me said no. By the time I was a student, it seemed too teenage to start, so I never smoked a cigarette - not one drag. I said no to illegal drugs as well. Not out of any ideology - I took up binge-drinking - but just to please Little Me. I never collected my bet so, aged 33, I volunteered to travel to Amsterdam to break my duck - to try a cigarette and to smoke drugs. I took a mentor friend with many years&apos; experience of smoking fags, ordinary and funny. Little Me was coming, too. One of many legal toking havens in the city, Coffeeshop De Dampkring, had all the tiresome ingredients of stonersville: a hideous bar in the style of Gaud\u00ed, ear-piercing acid jazz on the stereo and a punter who resembled Aragorn from The Lord Of The Rings. Barman Eddie sold AK-47 and other premium varieties of dope for up to \u20ac50 (\u00a338) a gram. &quot;More expensive than gold,&quot; he purred. Eddie recommended mellow organic Jamaican for my first spliff. &quot;Bush weed,&quot; snorted my mentor, coming over all Danny from Withnail &amp; I as he rolled me a Camberwell Carrot of a joint with tobacco and musty, green weed. &quot;The effect I&apos;d look for is a warmth in the head,&quot; he drawled. &quot;Howard Marks described it as mental masturbation. You are essentially overcome with a sense of genuine wellbeing.&quot; Tentatively holding the doobie between thumb and forefinger like a teenage smoker, I took a tiny, teeny drag. Bluuuuurgh! A bonfire in your chest! My lovely, pure lungs revolted, hurling smoke back into the room. Three joints in and I was not stoned. I just couldn&apos;t inhale. Little Me laughed at my hopelessness, although he had once lit a dried hogweed stem and inhaled that, so he couldn&apos;t talk. People come to Amsterdam for this? On to another cafe, where my mentor rolled a pure joint with NYC Diesel. Its &quot;taste&quot; was described as grapefruity, and I love grapefruit juice, so I spluttered down some evil vapours. &quot;That went in,&quot; my mentor nodded. We left at 1am. I was still not stoned. &quot;Where are we?&quot; my mentor asked. I reached for the street map. I looked at the map and looked at the map and looked at the map. I was stoned. At last. It was a little like being drunk, but I felt calmer and farther inside my body than normal. No munchies, no paranoia, just a loose spacesuit for a skin. Floppy. &quot;Floppy is a good start,&quot; my mentor droned. &quot;Mellow is just perfect.&quot; Hmmm. Mellow. Is. Just. Perfect. I pondered this beautifully rounded statement for a long period. Was I seeing clearly for the first time? Or just more inanely than ever? Time opened and contracted like an accordion. It didn&apos;t disappear as it does when you&apos;re drunk. A minute felt like 20. I savoured a thought. I thought back and examined this thought. My mind slowed, a steam train climbing a hill, and suddenly I could catch it, and pedal alongside it, like an excited schoolboy on a bicycle. &quot;I keep thinking about the dilemma!&quot; I giggled. &quot;I know the dilemma,&quot; my mentor replied kindly. Oh no, I was a stereotypical stoner. A walking-babbling-obsessed-with-his-own-mind clich\u00e9. What was the dilemma? This was the answer I scribbled in my notebook as I staggered past the tall houses of Amsterdam. &quot;It&apos;s the perennial problem. Is it the dark street that gives me dark thoughts or do my dark thoughts make the street darker? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a very sociable drug. You just want to wander with your own mind. Or is that just me? This experience makes me feel teenage. Or is it because I&apos;m 20 years too late? That&apos;s the dilemma. Me? Or everyone?&quot; I felt disappointed. Because I&apos;d never done drugs, I had feared and expected everything - a spinning head, a creative mind, a hideous paranoia, a craven addiction and a desire to dance all night while dragons crossed the diamond sky with Lucy. &quot;It doesn&apos;t widen the doors of perception, it just slows you down enough to let you look in,&quot; I wrote. &quot;This is what being stoned is about. I must get my bags from the hotel. Focus now. The end.&quot; Before I flew home, high, I tried writing this article but lacked the motivation to finish it.

They have not been repaired since they were torn up by the tracks of military vehicles during Guinea-Bissau&apos;s civil war of the late 1990s. But the cars that are parked outside - Porsche and Audi four-wheel drives - wouldn&apos;t look out of place in the wealthiest quarters of London. Inside, the music is thumping Europop, a beer costs more than twice the average daily income of a dollar a day. Many of the clubbers, though, are knocking back the imported whisky, which costs up to $80 a bottle. One of the regulars points out the people who represent the various stages of the cocaine supply chain from South America via Guinea-Bissau in West Africa to the UK and the rest of Europe. &apos;He&apos;s a pretty big dealer, and that&apos;s one of his security guys. That guy there thinks he&apos;s big news but he&apos;s just small-time. That woman is a mule. She&apos;s been to Europe a couple of times. Down a street of elaborate colonial-style buildings is Ana&apos;s restaurant. Beneath red-tiled roofs, giant candles flicker in the gentle, humid evening breeze - it could be mistaken for an exotic tourist destination. But &apos;the only visitors we get are the Colombians&apos;, sighs Ana, &apos;this country is being destroyed by drugs. They&apos;re everywhere. A few weeks ago, the man who used to be my gardener knocked at the door and offered to sell me 7kg of cocaine.&apos; Among the destitute locals are scores of wealthy, gaudy Colombian drug barons in their immodest cars, flaunting their hi-tech luxury lifestyle, with beautiful women on their arms. Outside Bissau city are exclusive Hispanic-style haciendas with wide verandahs, turquoise swimming pools and gates patrolled by armed guards. By day, Guinea-Bissau looks like the impoverished country it is. Most people cannot afford a bus fare, never mind a four-wheel drive. There is no mains electricity. Water supplies are restricted to the wealthy few, and landmark buildings such as the presidential palace remain wrecked nine years after the end of the war. But this wreck of a country is what the UN - which declared war last week on celebrity cocaine culture - calls the continent&apos;s &apos;first narco-state&apos;. West Africa has become the hub of a flow of cocaine from South America into Europe, now that other routes have become tough for the traffickers.  US drug enforcement agents report that the old cocaine channels through the Caribbean, markedly Jamaica and Panama, have become more intensively policed, forcing the Colombians to develop new routes to traffic cocaine. The increasing might of Mexico&apos;s powerful drug cartels has forced the South Americans to search for trafficking routes to Europe across the Atlantic rather than through Central America. Moreover, the West African coast can be reached across the shortest transatlantic crossing from South America: either by plane from Colombia, with a re-fuelling stop in Brazil; or by ship from Brazil or Venezuela. The boats leaving South America travel only by night, remaining motionless by day, covered in blue tarpaulins to avoid detection from the air. The journey can be completed in four to five nights travelling this way. Once ravaged by the transatlantic slave trade, the West African coast is again &apos;under attack&apos;, says the Executive Director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Antonio Maria Costa, who calls the impact on Africa of Europe&apos;s cocaine habit an echo of that of slavery. &apos;In the 19th century, Europe&apos;s hunger for slaves devastated West Africa. Two hundred years later, its growing appetite for cocaine could do the same.&apos; The seizure of West Africa by Colombian and other drug cartels has happened with lightning speed. Since 2003, 99 per cent of all drugs seized in Africa have been found in West Africa. Between 1998 and 2003, the total quantity of cocaine seized each year in Africa was around 600kg. But by 2006, the figure had risen five-fold and during the first nine months of last year had already reached 5.6 tonnes. The latest seizure, from a Liberian ship - Blue Atlantic - intercepted by the French navy last month, was 2.4 tonnes of pure cocaine.  But while seizure rates globally are estimated to be 46 per cent of total traffic, the amounts found in West Africa are &apos;the tip of the iceberg&apos;, says UNODC. Even though one recent raid in Guinea-Bissau netted 635kg of cocaine, the traffickers were thought to have still made off with a further two tonnes.  The street value of the drugs trafficked far exceeds gross national product. A quarter of all cocaine consumed in Western Europe is trafficked through West Africa, according to UNOCD, for a local wholesale value of $1.8bn and a retail value of 10 times that in Europe.  Nigerian drug gangs have always been an energetic presence on the global trafficking scene, but the target of the South American traffickers have been the &apos;failed states&apos; along the Gold Coast, where poverty is extreme, where society has been ravaged by war and the institutions of state can be easily bought off - so that instead of enforcement, there is collusion. And no more so than Guinea-Bissau, whose weakness makes it a trafficker&apos;s dream prey.  In Guinea-Bissau, says the UNODC, the value of the drugs trade is greater than the national income. &apos;The fact of the matter,&apos; says the Consultancy Africa Intelligence agency, is that without assistance, Guinea-Bissau is at the mercy of wealthy, well-armed and technologically advanced narcotics traffickers.&apos;  Guinea Bissau, with a population of 1.5 million, is ranked fifth from bottom in the UN&apos;s world development index. Even its recent history is one of torment: after 13 years of bloody guerrilla conflict, it won independence from Portugal, spent the first years under a Marxist Leninist dictatorship, then 18 under Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, until he was ousted by a military rebellion. Successive crises, two wars and economic collapse brought Vieira back in 2005, with a purge of the army and deceptive stability.  The White House has singled out Guinea-Bissau as &apos;a warehouse refuge and transit hub for cocaine traffickers from Latin America, transporting cocaine to Western Europe. Costa says: &apos;When I went to Guinea-Bissau, the drug wealth was everywhere. From the air, you can see the Spanish hacienda villas, and the obligatory black four-wheel-drives are everywhere, with the obligatory scantily-clad girl, James Bond style. There were certain hotels I was advised not to stay in.&apos;  A senior official at the US&apos;s Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) with a long record of fighting transatlantic drug trafficking, explained how and why the capture of Guinea-Bissau took place, and the trail to Europe. &apos;Geographically, West Africa makes sense. The logical things is for the cartels to take the shortest crossing over the ocean to West Africa, by plane - to one of the many airstrips left behind by decades of war, or by drop into the thousands of little bays - or by boat all the way. A ship can drop anchor in waters completely unmonitored, while fleets of smaller craft take the contraband ashore. &apos;A place like Guinea Bissau is a failed state anyway, so it&apos;s like moving into an empty house.&apos; There is no prison in Guinea-Bissau, he says. One rusty ship patrols a coastline of 350km, and an archipelago of 82 islands. The airspace is un-patrolled. The police have few cars, no petrol, no radios, handcuffs or phones.  &apos;You walk in, buy the services you need from the government, army and people, and take over. The cocaine can then be stored safely and shipped to Europe, either by ship to Spain or Portugal, across land via Morocco on the old cannabis trail, or directly by air using &quot;mules&quot;.&apos; One single flight into Amsterdam in December 2006 was carrying 32 mules carrying cocaine from Guinea-Bissau.  The official admitted &apos;this has happened quickly, and the response has been tardy. They&apos;re ahead of the game.&apos; And it didn&apos;t help that most Western diplomatic presence had left Bissau during the fighting, preferring to operate from neighbouring Senegal. The US and Britain shut up shop in Bissau in 1998, the Americans only last July reopening a diplomatic office in response to the cocaine raids.  Although much of the cocaine goes directly to Spain and Portugal, London is becoming an increasingly prominent final destination, says the official - because of the street prices the drug commands - yet Britain also has no permanent diplomatic presence in Bissau, and has not joined the Iberian countries and the EU in contributing to the latest UN plans to help the country. According to the UNODC, the UK and Spain have now overtaken America in the consumption of cocaine per head.  Guinea Bissau&apos;s cocaine Calvary began three years ago when fishermen on one island found packages of white powder washed up on the beach. They had no idea what the mysterious substance was. &apos;At first, they took the drug and they put it on their bodies during traditional ceremonies,&quot; recalls local journalist Alberto Dabo. &apos;Then they put it on their crops. All their crops died because of that drug. They even used it to mark out a football pitch&apos;. The real moment of truth came when two Latin Americans arrived by chartered plane, armed with $1 million in &apos;buyback&apos; cash, which the locals gleefully accepted. The two men were apprehended by police, but released. &apos;When people found that it was cocaine and they could sell it,&apos; says Dabo, &apos;some of those fishermen bought cars and built houses.&apos; As well as the favourable location, in Guinea Bissau the cocaine gangs have found a country where the rule of law barely exists. &apos;It&apos;s an easy country to be active if you&apos;re an organised crime lord,&apos; says the deputy regional head of UNODC, Amado Philip de Andres. &apos;Law enforcement has literally no control for two reasons: there is no capacity and there is no equipment&apos;.  A further development highlighted by the DEA and UNODC is that Guinea Bissau and other West African countries are being targeted by Asian and African cartels trafficking heroin across the Atlantic in the opposite direction, to the US. Last year, the DEA and police in Chicago tracked nine West Africans who had moved heroin originating in South-east Asia through various West African countries, markedly Guinea-Bissau, to the central US. Estimates vary as to the cogency of the Colombian presence, but one observer suggests there are as many as 60 Colombian drugs traffickers in Guinea-Bissau. Colombians have bought local businesses, including factories and warehouses, and built themselves large homes protected by armed guards. They and their local hired help flaunt their liberty to operate - and the money they make from doing so.  &apos;We can see these people walking in complete freedom. They are parading their wealth. They&apos;re showing it completely openly,&apos; says Jamel Handem, of a coalition of civic groups called Platform GB.  Guinea-Bissau&apos;s armed forces and some politicians are thought to be deeply involved in the drugs trade. Last year, two military personnel were detained along with a civilian in a vehicle carrying 635kg of cocaine. The army secured the soldiers&apos; release and so far there is no sign that they will face charges. In his large, carpeted, air-conditioned office, a refrigerator humming quietly in the corner, the army spokesman, Colonel Arsenio Balde, brushes aside suggestions the incident proves the army&apos;s complicity in the drugs trade. He says the soldiers were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time: &apos;They were on the road hitching a ride and they saw this car driving by. They asked for a ride and then this guy stopped, and later on this car was stopped and they were arrested. You don&apos;t have any evidence of high-level involvement. Just please, bring the evidence. That&apos;s what we&apos;re asking for.&apos;  Government spokesman Pedro da Costa gives a similar response when asked if the government is involved in the drugs trade. &apos;I don&apos;t have any information on that,&apos; he says, curtly. He insists the authorities are keen to tackle drugs traffickers, but don&apos;t have the resources. Like many others in Guinea-Bissau, though, he&apos;s worried that disputes over control of the trade could break out, pushing the country back to civil war. &apos;We&apos;re worried, of course. We&apos;re all concerned. If it&apos;s going to bring consequences to our people similar to the war of 1998-99, I think today the motivation would be different. But of course, there is a danger for the country.&apos; Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for this month, have been postponed until the end of the year. The campaign could lead to heightened tension between political groups, and provide more scope for corruption. &apos;One of the risks now is that they will have a deep penetration of dirty money into politics that will overturn everything in the country,&apos; says Fafali Kudawo, rector of the country&apos;s first university, &apos;because this country is very, very fragile, and he who has money can do whatever he wants. You do not know at any given moment what will change the situation or lead the country to war or to violence&apos;. The UNOCD Office has drawn up a detailed plan to help Guinea-Bissau. In 2006 it suggested a possible budget of several hundred million dollars to potential donors. They refused to pay. Last year the agency came up with a far more modest programme concentrating on reform of the security services, boosting the judicial police, and building a jail. The estimated cost was $19 million. In December a donor conference in Lisbon produced pledges of $6.5m.  As though the suffocation of society by the cartels were not enough, Guinea-Bissau inevitably suffers from a proliferation of addiction among its own people. &apos;Foot soldiers are paid in kind,&apos; says Antonio Maria Costa, &apos;and whatever is left behind is sold domestically.&apos; With addicts hidden away in villages, many still believe that their hallucinations are the result of evil spirits.  When United Nations workers went to the country&apos;s only excuse for a rehabilitation unit in a mangrove swamp 30km from the capital, they found a man called Bubacar Gano, who calls himself &apos;the first man to smoke pedra&apos; - as crack cocaine is known in the country. He recalls the fishing boat that lost its load in the sea in 2005, saying: &apos;Most of the locals who found the packages had no idea what it was or what to do with it. But I knew. After a while I became crazy and aggressive. But it is a difficult thing to stop smoking pedra.&apos;  \u00b7 Grant Ferrett is a BBC corrrespondent who has worked extensively in Africa. Guinea-Bissau factfile \u00b7 Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea-Conakry, Guinea-Bissau is a tiny wedge of land, largely composed of mangrove swamps and islets, and an archipelago of 90 islands.  \u00b7 Colonised in the 16th century, it broke away from Portuguese control in 1974 after a 12-year struggle for independence.

The common sense proposition is that we cannot go on consuming more resources than we produce or, sooner or later, energy will run out. It is as simple as that. Since 1997, this government has made greater progress than any in UK history towards meeting these challenges, but green thinking is still not at the core of Labour policies and politics. Symbolic stances in response to newspaper campaigns (plastic bags, bottled water, etc) are very far from enough. The overwhelming majority of people want to contribute to sustainability but are not sure that they know how - or that their actions would make any real difference. What&apos;s missing is a consistent policy framework from government and a signal that green issues have a high priority. It is perfectly legitimate, for example, to influence people&apos;s behaviour through taxation and this week&apos;s budget may well do that. There is already evidence that the public would support hypothecation of the revenue from green taxation (congestion charge, road pricing) by putting it to environmentally beneficial purposes (cheaper public transport, more buses). In 1988 Nigel Lawson introduced higher taxes on leaded petrol and as a result there was a widespread shift to unleaded fuel. But cynics are already writing that any green taxation proposal in Alistair Darling&apos;s first budget would amount to &quot;yet another stealth tax&quot;. I believe we can entrench green thinking if government focuses on two key policy fields: transport and energy. In local transport we should concentrate on journeys between home and school or between home and work. In Amsterdam and Zurich about 25% of people go by car; in Darlington and Peterborough it is 60%-65%. Our aim should be to increase the number who walk, cycle or use public transport to get to school or work. People are more likely to change their behaviour if the urban environment is attractive and safe, if public transport is cheap and reliable (including school buses) and if good information helps them make informed choices. We also need leadership to change long-distance travel from road/air to rail. The true long-term cost of using roads needs to be fairly charged to the main road users in order to improve the rail network and public transport. Last week&apos;s announcement on this was very disappointing. Turning to energy, our focus should be on two targets: (a) improving energy conservation and (b) increasing the proportion of energy from renewable sources. In the UK, despite having great natural advantages, our use of renewable sources is shamefully low compared to the rest of Europe. The government can encourage both the above with the traditional levers of regulation, tax and subsidy. There are plenty of examples: easier planning agreements for renewable power; differential tax rates for energy according to renewable content; and the &quot;Merton principle, where local authorities require housing developers to build sustainably. There is also a strong case for taxing the windfall profits of energy companies which derive from non-renewable sources. But probably the single most important thing would be to reform energy pricing in order to reward those who supply renewable energy to the national grid. Such a scheme works well in Germany. Sustainability is the only option for the future, and must be at the core not the margin of government policies. Labour should lead this country decisively to an environmentally sustainable future.

This season they have had crowds of fewer than 500 in a 52,000 capacity stadium, meaning over 51,500 empty seats. What is the record number of empty seats there have been at a major league or cup match?&quot; The Knowledge inbox has been bulging (if an inbox can bulge) with bids for this particular crown. Here&apos;s our top 10: 10. Yokohama Marinos - 51,207 &quot;The capacity of the Nissan Stadium (aka Yokohama International Stadium) is 72,372,&quot; writes Richard Finch, &quot;and has been used by Yokohama Marinos since 1998 when the average attendance was 19,165. A quick subtraction results in an average of 51,207 unused seats.&quot; Not a bad effort, but we can do better than that ... 9. FC Amsterdam - 64,500 Over to Nick den Uijl. &quot;In the 70s, FC Amsterdam played in the Eredivisie. Their home stadium was the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. They would play in front of only a handful of people. In September 1977, for instance, they lost 1-3 to FC Twente in front of 1,500 spectators. Earlier that year the Cup Winners&apos; Cup final was played between Hamburg and Anderlecht in the same stadium in front of 66,000 people.&quot; 8. Juventus - 68,763 &quot;Assuming we are discounting several games played behind closed doors,&quot; says Simon Halstead (and yes, we are), &quot;I would have to say Juventus&apos; Coppa Italia home match against Sampdoria in the 2001-02 season. Only 237 spectators showed up. With the Stadio Delle Alpi&apos;s capacity of 69,000 this leaves 68,763 empty seats.&quot; Thanks also to David Pasley, who suggested this fixture. 7. Hertha Berlin - c.73,000 &quot;Although I cannot provide any details,&quot; says Alex J\u00e4kel, who won&apos;t let that stop him, &quot;I would reckon that Hertha Berlin in the 1980s would be a prime example.&quot; Yes, Hertha&apos;s struggles in the 80s led to a few spare seats at the Olympic Stadium. When Hertha were relegated from 2.Bundesliga in 1986, attendances fell to as low as 1,800, leaving around 73,000 empty seats. 6. Borussia Dortmund reserves - 79,028 Let Martin Tobutt tell the story. &quot;This may be cheating a little but a match from last Saturday&apos;s German Third Division North featured Borussia Dortmund&apos;s reserves at home to Wuppertal. Normally, such teams play at the club&apos;s old ground or training ground - in Borussia&apos;s case Rote Erde, which has 3,000 seats and then a 22,000-capacity standing area which is open to the elements.&quot; Yes, yes, get on with it. &quot;Looking at the TV pictures, it appears that the gale force winds that day meant that the match was moved to the Westfalenstadion meaning that the 1680 paying customers were housed in a ground holding 80,708 fans. In terms of empty seats, I make that 79,028.&quot; 5. Torpedo Moscow - 80,000+ &quot;It pains me to no end - but my local club, Torpedo Moscow, I would think would have to claim this dubious honour,&quot; writes a bullish Leonid Mironov. &quot;They play at the Luzhniki Stadium which has a capacity of 84,000 and a bit. For the past couple of season the average attendance has been around 3,000-4,000. That leaves almost 80,000 empty seats on average. I am pretty sure that we win this little competition (although obviously I would love to be wrong on this one).&quot; Leonid, you are wrong. Not even close, in fact. Read on. 4. Istanbul B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir Belediyespor (Istanbul BBS) - c.81,000 Chris Wade has a higher offer from Ankara. &quot;They don&apos;t announce official figures for matches in the Turkish Super Lig for some reason,&quot; he writes, &quot;but on December 9 last year I listened to the radio broadcast of Istanbul BBS v Genclerbirligi which was being played at Istanbul&apos;s Ataturk Olympic Stadium. The radio announcer said he could see a total of six fans in the 81,283 stadium. There were a few more than that, as this picture shows but the entire crowd could not have numbered more than 50 souls for the exciting 0-0 draw.&quot; We reckon there&apos;s at least a couple of hundred in that picture, but it&apos;s one empty stadium nevertheless. 3. Leeds United v VfB Stuttgart - 90,000+ Joe Skinner, Doug Kirkpatrick and Andrew Limb have emailed in to nominate Leeds United&apos;s Champions League tie against VfB Stuttgart at the Camp Nou in 1992. With Stuttgart having fielded an ineligible player during the second leg of their 4-4 aggregate draw (Stuttgart would have gone through on aggregate), Uefa ordered the two teams to play a one-off decider at a neutral venue, and Barcelona&apos;s ground was chosen. No one can agree on the stadium&apos;s exact capacity in those days before it became an all-seater, but it was close to 100,000 meaning at least 90,000 spaces were left vacant as Carl Shutt tucked home the winner in front of 7,400 fans. 2. Necaxa - 118,000+ We&apos;re into six figures now. &quot;I lived in Mexico City from 1995 to 2002 and went to see all the local teams while there,&quot; says Iain Pearson. &quot;The most surreal was visiting Necaxa who were playing their home games in the Azteca Stadium (capacity: 120,000). If they were playing a team from out of town in midweek they would be lucky to host a &apos;crowd&apos; of 2,000 - leaving 118,000 empty seats.&quot; A worthy effort, but the crown goes to ... 1. Thames Association FC - 119,531 Neal Martin presents: West Ham Stadium. Thames Association FC still hold the record for the lowest attendance in Football League history when 469 went through the turnstiles, to watch Thames take on Luton in December 1930. It&apos;s claimed that the ground could hold 120,000 spectators (although estimates do vary), which leaves 119,531 tickets unsold. SUBS STUDS &quot;At a recent and dull St Mirren match, where proceedings were brightened even by substitutions, I noted the fourth official examining the on-coming substitute&apos;s studs especially fastidiously, so much so that I thought he would not be allowed on,&quot; said Alistair Meldrum. &quot;Has there ever been an example in top-flight football where the referee has stopped a substitution due to illegal boots, or is this just a ritual to brighten up uneventful matches?&quot; Apparently there has, Alistair. Hans van Schijndel emailed with a story from the oft-overlooked world of 1970s Albanian football. In the opening round of the 1970-71 European Cup, Ajax travelled to Albania for a first-leg clash with Nentori Tirana. As kick-off approached, the odds swung firmly in Ajax&apos;s favour when the Austrian referee, Paul Schiller, noticed that the studs of Tirana&apos;s Josif Kazanxhi had been filed. In the absence of suitable alternative footwear - Kaxanxhi had not brought a spare pair of boots, and neither were any of his team-mates able to help - Schiller prevented the influential forward from joining the fray until after the interval. Finally equipped with proper boots, Kazanxhi went on to score in a 2-2 draw. But Tirana were beaten 2-0 in Amsterdam and Ajax went on to win the tournament. George Town (a man, presumably, rather than a place), meanwhile, has a supplementary. &quot;Sorry, not an answer to Alastair Meldrum&apos;s question about subs&apos; studs being checked, but a rider: does the ref or any of his assistants check the studs of the starting 22? If so, when do they do it? And if not, what is the point of checking the studs on subs?&quot; Well, George, FA rules state that match officials are supposed to include a footwear inspection in the pre-match safety check of players&apos; equipment. The men in black are told to &quot;be alert to the possibility of the edge of the blades or studs developing rough areas on either the plastic or metal used in their construction. These burrs can become very sharp and have been the cause of lacerations on opponents. If match officials are concerned over the condition of the blades or studs, they should refuse to sanction their use until they have been made safe.&quot; And they&apos;re not taking any prisoners, either - if a footwear inspection delays kick-off, it has to be reported to the competition&apos;s governing body. THE END OF AN FA CUP TRIOPOLY When was the last time the FA Cup semi-finalists didn&apos;t include a team from the football cities of London, Liverpool and Manchester? asks Mark Wyatt Obviously this year&apos;s last four are from less traditional strongholds and we&apos;ve gotta go way back to find the last time it happened. The last time even the final was a non-London/Liverpool/Manchester affair was 1973, when Sunderland beat Leeds 1-0 at Wembley. The last time the semi-finalists didn&apos;t include a team from those cities was in March 1960. Blackburn Rovers, Sheffield Wednesday, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa contested the Cup semis, with Wolves and Blackburn making it through to Wembley, and Wanderers going on to lift the trophy. Interestingly enough, 1960 was the second consecutive year that the London/Liverpool/Manchester dominance was absent in the semi-finals. Luton Town, Norwich City, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest were the last four in 1959. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;While watching Wales take on Russia, I noticed that the score in the top left corner of the screen was WAL 0 1 RUS,&quot; wrote Peter Scarborough, back in December 2003. &quot;Remove the numbers and you&apos;ve got a WALRUS. Can any other teams (international or otherwise) make up the name of an aquatic mammal?&quot; Who would have thought that such a question would get the knowledge readers&apos; minds whirring so frenziedly - even if few of you managed to stick to the aquatic mammal specification? Elliot Jacobs did so with an imagined meeting of Belgium and Uganda, thus producing BELUGA - a species of white whale, and also a type of sturgeon. An impressive start, Mr Jacobs, but the rest of our respondents were forced to look on dry land for their tittersome combinations. Graeme Peden is obviously a man with a sharp focusing pair of binoculars and a green wax gilet, having come up with the distinctly ornithological example of Finland versus China (FINCH). Meanwhile Nick Parkhouse speculates that Martinique versus Monserrat might be a heavily-built burrowing rodent (MARMOT). Moving away from mammals, this question also prompted some timeless gags, not least from Luke Dempsey: &quot;When Real Madrid play Manchester United in the Champions League, ESPN2 in the United States puts the score in the top left hand corner as MAD MAN which is nice, don&apos;t you think? Finally, Wayne from Frankfurt rounds us off nicely with this tale: &quot;I recall with pleasure seeing a satellite transmission of a game between Arsenal de Sarandi and Newell&apos;s Old Boys a couple of months ago,&quot; he titters. &quot;The match status in the corner of the screen was amusingly rendered as ARS v NOB.&quot; Click here for thousands more Knowledge questions and answers.

And on that note, the ref blows for full-time. &quot;What&apos;s the difference between a sack of potatoes and Paul Robinson in a penalty shootout,&quot; gulps Tom in New York. &quot;A sack of potatoes doesn&apos;t dive the wrong way!&quot;  ET 28 min: Tottenham trot forward, but the jaded Berbatov is caught offside. &quot;Spurs doing well in cup competitions almost compensates for the loss of Henmania,&quot; sniggers Henry Mance.  ET 26 min : Spurs have offered little in extra-time and their lack of enterprise is surely a mistake, what with Gomes being a penalty-saving specialist and all ... ET 24 min: The home crowd perk up for the first time in the night, a reaction to some spirited pressure from PSV. But Woodgate and Zokora have been equal to everything the Dutch have hurled at them.  ET 22 min: PSV substitution : Mendez off, Bakkal on.  ET 21 min: Zokora, who has excelled since going back into defence, races forward to launch a counter-attack. He feeds Berbatov, who holds on to the ball for too long - Lennon was free and baying for a pass in the centre.  ET 17 min : Spurs have come to life, a little. After some diligent by Berbatov, Huddlestone won a corner. And then wasted it. And then got booked for attempting to retrieve the situation by booting Kromkamp. ET half-time &quot;I&apos;ve got a real dilemma here,&quot; reveals Tim Bray. &quot;Do I go pick up my car from the shop or continue to hit refresh?&quot; Surely you know the answer to that one, Tim? You know you&apos;ve got to stay to see whether much-maligned Robinson can become a penalty shoot-out hero ... ET 15 min : Spurs have lost their fizz and almost appear to be playing for penalties. PSV, for their part, enjoyed most of the possession in that period of extra-time but couldn&apos;t do much with it.  ET 13 min: Farfan attempts to lift the game out of the rut its sunk back into, but his 30-yard shot ricochets off a team-mate and trickles wide.  ET 10 min: O&apos;Hara dumps a free-kick into the PSV box and Berbatov, in ample space, executes another spectacular volley. But with a lot less class than the last time, hence it droops disappointingly over the bar.  ET 8 min: The small cluster of Spurs fans are outsinging their PSV counterparts but it&apos;s the Dutch who are gaining the upperhand on the pitch, albeit without creating much at the moment.  ET 5 min: Now it&apos;s Culina&apos;s turn to try an acrobatic volley - but his effort from 20 yards is bravely blocked by Jenas. And the subsequent corner is cleared.  ET 3 min: In an ambitious effort to recreate Berbatov&apos;s fantastic goal, Bent attempts a volley from the edge of the box. Wide it goes.  ET 1min: Here we go again, as Whitesnake once crooned. Mendez marks the resumption with a disgraceful foul on Chimbonda, which the ref ignores.  90+3 min: Full-time. Thirty more minutes to come. Bloody typical. &quot;I take it from the &apos;bah !&apos; comment that you&apos;re not paid by the hour?&quot; chortles Matthew Parson.  90+2 min: Gomes fluffs an attempted punch, and Jenas reciprocates by fluffing his attempted lob.  90 min : Bah! Extra-time looms. Unless someone scores in one of the three minutes of injury time ... 88 min: Lennon clips a cross towards the penalty spot, Bent connects with a looping header that Gomes tips over the bar.  87 min: Mendez picks the ball up 30 yards from goal and wallops a fine effort just over the bar. Then Spurs make their final change, withdrawing Keane for O&apos;Hara. &quot;Yeeeehhaaa!&quot; yahoos Mike Taylor in what is presumably a belated reaction to the goal. &quot;Sod the Camel, my nostrils are flaring!&quot;  84 min: With their team heavily frontloaded, Spurs are now going all-out for the win in normal time. PSV are rocking ... 81 min: Chimbonda trundled down the right and floated a cross towards the edge of the area, whereupon Berbatov met it with a ferocious volley that flew into the net! A simply outstanding strike. WHAT A GOAL! PSV 0-1 Spurs (Berbatov 81)  77 min: Jenas whips in a fine cross from the right. Marcellis clears as Keane wound up a volley.  75 min: This game is becoming more bitty and, accordingly, more spaces are beginning to appear. Now if only one of the teams could summon enough composure to take advantage. Meanwhile, irked by a perceived implication that he remained a stranger to womankind, James Funnel has retorted. &quot;I&apos;d send you a photo of my 22-year-old daughter who lives in London,&quot; he blurts. &quot;But I worry about your contributions to the Fiver.&quot; Well James, I&apos;d send you a reply insisting there would be no reason for you to be concerned, but I too worry about my contributions to the Fiver.  72 min: Now that was a chance. A cock-up in the PSV defence gave Bent the chance to fire past Gomes from close range ; but instead, as Gomes rushed out to narrow the angle, he elected to tap the ball sideways towards Keane - and a retreating defender got there first.  70 min : Spurs catch sight of the PSV goal for the first time in many minutes, but Huddlestone&apos;s long-range drive never looked like finding the net.  68 min: Farfan skips past Woodgate, who, like a stereotypically fair-minded Englishman, pushes him to the ground - free-kick to PSV at the edge of the box. Farfan takes it himself and curls a beautiful shot fractionally over the bar.  66 min: Zokora and Jenas run into each other just outside the Spurs box, gifting the ball to Culina, whose shot is parried by Robinson. Woodgate tidies up.  64 min: Oooof! Berbatov flicked a long ball on and Gomes hurtled from his goal to punch the ball off Keane&apos;s head. There follows an almighty collision with Keane, who is now prostrate on the ground. But after a little rest the striker clambers back to his feet and carries on, the little trooper. &quot;As a spotty teenager I had a t-shirt that had a packet of Camel cigarettes on it,&quot; boasts James Funnell. &quot;Underneath was the slogan: &apos;of 1000 men questioned, nine out of ten preferred women&apos;. Funnily enough, the t-shirt coincided with a rather barren patch in my search for romance.&quot; This barren patch, James, can you convince us that it&apos;s ended? 62 min: Spurs switch: King off, Lennon on. Ramos is going for it.  61 min: Jenas pounces on a loose clearance by Gomes and roars all the way into the PSV box ... before giving the ball away with a blind pass. &quot;Paul my man,&quot; begins Barry Praag, who seems to have mistaken me for his butler. &quot;Derby -Chelsea has got to be a better bet for the live commentary. Chelsea are going to score at least half a dozen in the second half which is far more than Spurs are going to get even if the game lasts six months.&quot; You&apos;re probably right, Barry, but I&apos;m starting to get the ghastly feeling that Spurs are going to score in the last minute to send this thing into extra-time.   58 min: Huddlestone curls a free-kick in from the right. Berbatov dives but fails to connect with it.  55 min: With PSV gaining in confidence, no doubt because of the recent display of dodgy Spurs defending, Mendez rockets a 25-yard free-kick just over the bar.  52 min: Woodgate attempts to nonchalantly chest a Culina cross back to Robinson but instead sends it towards Koevermans. Chimbonda reacts quickly to knock it behind for a corner. But PSV keep the pressure on and moments later Koevermans had the best chance of the match - again Culina was the provider, clipping the ball to the edge of the six-yard box. The entire Spurs defence hollers for offside, oblivious to the fact that Bent kept the striker on. But Koevermans spares the forward by effecting a laughable shot, prodding the ball so weekly that it wouldn&apos;t have reached the goal even if Robinson hadn&apos;t picked it up.  48 min: The arrival of Bent - up alongside Keane as Berbatov drops back into the hole - almost paid immediate dividends. Malbranque split the defence with a fine through-ball, Keane cut it back to Bent and, despite the attentions of two defenders, he got off a decent shot that was well saved by Gomes. &quot;I think all your readers need to see this,&quot; declares Alberto Arregui. And he&apos;s right.  46 min: We&apos;re back and desperately hoping for an improvement from either of these sides. Ramos shown his intention by hauling off Lee and replacing him with Darren Bent. Meanwhile, geographically-challenged Eindhoven resident Martin Scheffer is angry at my obviously preposterous suggestion that his hometown is near Amsterdam. &quot;It&apos;s about as far as you can get from Amsterdam,&quot; he insists. Have you ever heard of Peru, Martin? He&apos;s not listening, folks; instead he&apos;s demanding you all look at &quot;the most famous building in Eindhoven. You have to admit it&apos;s great.&quot;  I&apos;m going to the toilet now and there&apos;s nothing you can do about it. On the other hand, maybe you can help Mike Taylor. &quot;Can anyone verify whether camels are the only ruminating quadrupeds that can turn their nostrils inside out?&quot; wonders Mike.  Half-time: &quot;Allow me to answer James Blishen,&quot; demands Zaph Mann. &quot;The truth is is outed me: I am really George Graham and that idea - leaving out Berbatov and Keane as well - is genius. But in fairness, Lennon was shut down by PSV last week and I think Ramos is looking at a pacy late game sub strategy of Lennon and Taraabt or O&apos;Hara.&quot;  45 min: After sweet play from Spurs Huddlestone fired one from 20 yards. It took a deflection off Salcido and flew inches wide. The corner is squandered. PSV break quickly and King, like Jenas before him, cynically kills the counter and cops a yellow. And with that, the half ends. &quot;The guy smoking it up in your photo looks like he might be wearing a vintage Pony sweatshirt from the Lee Sharpe signature range (it was really clever cos&apos; they took the &quot;#&quot; sign, which means &apos;sharp&apos; in musical terms, and applied it to a Lee&apos;s surname),&quot; murmurs Ciaran Neeson from deep inside his anorak. &quot;Unfortunately, Google couldn&apos;t find any trace of this range of clothing during the 30-second search I conducted, so I&apos;m left without a visual aid for this message.&quot;  42 min: Dainty foot-work by Jenas down the left. After a canny pass to Berbatov, Alcides intervened smartly to snuff out the danger.  40 min: Huddlestone lets fly with a free-kick from 30 yards. It bounces off the top of the wall and behind for the corner. Alcides puts it behind for another one. Huddlestone hits it again and Chimbonda butts it to nowhere in particular.  38 min: Berbatov hopscotches his way into the PSV box before collapsing a little too easily. The ref waves play on and Keane does just that, cutting the ball back to where Berbatov would have been had he not been writhing pointlessly on the ground. PSV clear. And Jeans cops a booking for halting their break illegally. &quot;I know something very important about Camels,&quot; announces Tris Bray. &quot;Smoking causes sexual impotence. If that doesn&apos;t give you the hump, then nothing will.&quot; Unless one is already sexually impotent, of course.  34 min: A glimpse of excitement! Chimbonda hoofed a ball up from the back, Gomes came to gather but bumped into his team-mate Salcido and fumbled the ball out for a corner. Huddlestone delivered an out-swinger and King nodded it powerfully past the far post. Hope is not lost. &quot;How am I supposed to construct my yeast library bait in my dark lab corner in New England when Spurs are out there having another false dawning?&quot; demands-to-know John Willoughby. &quot;Actually, I wanted to ask Zeph mann what specifically was clever about leaving Lennon out of the team? I don&apos;t see the tactical advantage. If he&apos;d wanted to really throw them, Ramos should have left out Berbatov and Keane as well, and maybe have told the team not to push forward. That would really confuse them ...&quot; 31 min: &quot;This match has to get better&quot; insists Five&apos;s optimistic commentator. Meanwhile, David Studer, a &quot;proud&quot; Spurs fan in Toronto, wants us to hear this confession: &quot;Glenn Frey is to Don Henley as Spurs are to Arsenal: forever grouped together but sadly never nearly as good.&quot;  28 min: decent work on the right by Chimbonda, who feeds Berbatov. The Bulgarian bustles his way into the box before being expertly ushered out of play by Salcido.  26 min: Tottenham have most of the possession but can&apos;t do anything with it. The passing from both sides has been woeful so far. &quot;Oh god, Glenn Frey,&quot; laments Julian Menz. &quot;&apos;I know that name,&apos; I thought to myself before foolishly hitting the link and being plunged into a nightmare mid-80s flashback! Cheers. By the way, why no MBM of Avram Grant&apos;s historic last game as Chelsea boss then?&quot; Because it&apos;s not on TV and though I&apos;m sure that the roars of mortification will travel all the way from Stamford Bridge to Farringdon in the event if Derby scoring, that&apos;s not really enough to build a MBM around. Camels, on the other hand, ...  23 min: Truth be told, this is a low-quality match so far, folks. Very bitty. It is neatly (and therefore ironically) summed up by the discarded black bin bags that, for some reason, are strewn all over the pitch.  20 min: Lee went walkabout at the back and that was Australian international Culina&apos;s cue to race forward and send a meacing cross towards the back post. Woodgate turned the ball behind for a corner, which is obligingly wasted by the Dutch. &quot;Hillary Clinton is the Yoko Ono of the Democratic Party,&quot; insists Alix Sharkey \u00e0 propos of nothing. &quot;Marrying a Beatle doesn&apos;t make you a Beatle.&quot; Maybe, Alix, maybe. But what&apos;s your take on camels? 16 min: Bad miss by Malbranque! Salcido made a mess of an attempted clearance and Berbatov picked the ball up wide on the left and slipped a clever ball through the Mabranque. In lots of space just 14 yards from a goal the Frenchman slashed his shot high and wide.  14 min: &quot;It&apos;s interesting that they&apos;ve brought in Lee,&quot; intones Zeph Mann. &quot;He&apos;s not the best left-back but as a former PSV player has at least s there for years and can do a reasonable job. The Huddlestone instead of Lennon ploy is clever and has no doubt thrown out all PSV&apos;s pre-match plans of double teaming Lennon. I predict Jenas will score in the gap.&quot; Well, so far there isn&apos;t much of a gap in the massed PSV ranks; indeed Spurs are starting to bang the ball quite long. And the Dutch are dealing with that approach easily.  10 min: PSV have suddenly become more enterprising, apparently because Kromkamp has wisely realised that he&apos;s less of a threat to his own team if he gets forward from the back. King had to intervene in timely fashion just there to prevent Koevermans from meeting a decent cross from the full-back. &quot;The camel actually originated in North America,&quot; lectures James Blishen. &quot;It migrated North across Alaska to Siberia, then Mongolia and eventually on to Arabia. It also moved down into South America where it evolved into the Llama.&quot; With versatility like that, the camel must surely be the Paul Warhurst of the animal kingdom.  6 min: PSV are looking strangely jittery. The precise passing and adventurous running that characterised their game at White Hart Lane has been entirely absent so far, as they&apos;ve just sat back and challenged Spurs to try to find a way past them. &quot;In response to that Glenn Frey video, Paul, I&apos;d like to introduce another topical YouTube feature,&quot; hurrahs Julia Kite. &quot;Behold some Dutch child pop sensation named Zanger Bob. I bet all the cool kids in Eindhoven are listening to him:. Also, I can&apos;t help but think that Dirk Kuyt looked a lot like Zanger Bob as a child, because he certainly looks like him as an adult. 3 min: Spurs have settled the quicker and are already zipping the ball around nicely. Kromkamp shows he hasn&apos;t lost his Liverpool form by clattering into Keane to concede a free-kick that Jenas will curl towards the penalty spot. But Salcido heads it well clear.  1 min: It&apos;s off. Nothing of note happens in the first 60 seconds, but let&apos;s not give up on this just yet, eh. &quot;Shame on you for not taking this chance to put Eindhoven on the map,&quot; hollers Ian Copestake. &quot;Think Eindhoven, think DAF trucks - the car makers who gave the world this beauty. 7.39pm: Six minutes to kick-off. &quot;Camels in British Columbia?&quot; snorts Mark O&apos;Connor. &quot;We must have lost them all down the mine because I only ever see bears.&quot;  7.34pm: Ramos vowed in the build-up to this game to attack, but what&apos;s this, Lennon on the bench? Hmmn. Sticking Huddlestone in instead suggests the manager reckons his raking passing is the quicker way to turn defence to attack. Here&apos;s how Gus Poyet has just explained that choice. &quot;It&apos;s just a change, just a tactical thing.&quot; So now you know.  Preamble: Spurs are always good to watch to this should be good fun even for those of you who aren&apos;t watching it but are instead reduced to following this here commentary. Come to think of it, that probably depends on how well I do my job. Right, guess that means that for me, like Tottenham and Glenn Frey, the heat is on. &quot;Do you know if Juande Ramos ever trailed from the first leg during any of his two successful Uefa Cup runs with Sevilla,&quot; interrogates George Templeton. &quot;Personally I seriously doubt it.&quot; Then dispel that doubt, George, for only last year they lost the first leg of the semi-final to Osasuna by the same 1-0 scoreline Spurs lost to PSV last week; Sevilla won the second-leg 2-0. Curiously, Sevilla also lost at home to Dutch opposition (AZ) on their triumphant run last year so to the extent that that means anything at all for Spurs, that&apos;s a good sign.  And here&apos;s something else that will have no bearing on Spurs&apos; performance tonight but in which you might be interested: Leverkusen have eliminated fellow Germans Hamburg by scoring twice in a 3-2 away defeat that means they progress on away goals, having won the home leg 1-0. And Marseille have paid for conceding a late goal while dancing all over Zenit St Petersbrug last week - they&apos;ve just lost 2-0 in Russia, meaning the aggregate score is 3-3 and they too go out on away goals, the fools. If you don&apos;t think that&apos;s interesting, then consider this fact, which has just been relayed to me by ace Googler Clive Stone: &quot;Between 1860 and 1862, Otto Esche, a German merchant, brought forty-five camels from Siberia to San Francisco for use on eastbound express routes, although he sold most of them to a mining company in British Columbia. Years later, wild camels still roamed the Northwest, Nevada, and especially Arizona. Wild American camels are now extinct.&quot; Now, don&apos;t say tuning in to this minute-by-minute lark was a waste of time.  Teams: PSV: Gomes, Mendez, Kromkamp, Marcellis, Salcido, Simons, Afellay, Alcides, Culina, Koevermans, Farfan.  2008 Carling Cup Champions: Robinson, Chimbonda, Woodgate, King, Lee, Jenas, Zokora, Huddlestone, Malbranque, Berbatov, Keane.

Early on in his tenure as president of the Indian Hockey Federation, Kanwar Pal Singh Gill said: &quot;The real bane of our sports organisation is that the people who come into power do not want to leave the seats of power. The government guideline says that the person should remain in charge of a federation for not more than eight years. I think these are very sensible guidelines because everyone runs out of ideas after a period of time, no matter how brilliant he is. And I would be happy if there was a law to ensure the eight-year term in this country.&quot; Gill&apos;s stewardship of the troubled ship is now into its 15th year, and the jagged rocks on which it will run aground are on the horizon. Failure to qualify for the Olympic Games in Beijing - defeat to Great Britain last Sunday ensured no Indian team at the event for the first time since they won the first of eight golds at Amsterdam in 1928 - could be the body blow that kills off what was once the national sport. Not that Gill seems particularly bothered, promising to stick on until at least 2010. Those that saw the seeds of tyranny sown in 1994 aren&apos;t too surprised. Back then, two journalists from Kolkata&apos;s Statesman newspaper were beaten up by Gill&apos;s goons after they raised some impertinent questions about his election. A police officer with a reputation, he remains one of the most hated men in the Punjab. In his book, The Sikhs in History, Sangat Singh writes: &quot;Gill&apos;s appointment [in 1988] was considered a masterstroke by the anti-Sikh lobby in Delhi as the Centre now had a native to implement its policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sikhs. Gill, a Jat (traditionally a farming community) Sikh from Punjab, was an IPS (Indian Police Service) officer of the Assam Cadre. &quot;Gill&apos;s temperament as a cold-blooded and a heartless fellow was steeled during his service tenure in Assam where he, at the instance of the Union Government, trampled underfoot the human rights and civil liberties of the people of the north-eastern states, in the process reducing them to third-rate citizens. Gill was known to have a single-track mind and was deaf to the political goings-on. To him any problem, be it in Assam or Punjab, could only be a law and order problem.&quot; He took that attitude into hockey administration as well. In the words of Dhanraj Pillay, India&apos;s finest player of the past 15 years, &quot;Gill appointed coaches and wanted them to report to him directly, the coaches were his stooges and didn&apos;t bother to take the players into confidence ... Today, because of Gill and his style of autocratic functioning, we have lost many generations of players.&quot; One of those he referred to was Viren Rasquinha, a talented midfielder who quit the game in favour of pursuing a management degree earlier this year. He was 27 at the time, an age when many come into their prime. Pargat Singh, another great from the past who played in three Olympics, was equally critical of those that run the game. &quot;Cutting and chopping has been our officials&apos; policy,&quot; he said in a recent interview. &quot;They hold all the power and the players dare not stand up to them even to demand what is rightfully theirs.&quot; The decline is all the more deplorable because India were junior World Cup champions in 2001. But with the likes of Sandeep Singh, Len Aiyappa, Arjun Halappa, Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur consigned to the fringes, India were miserable in Santiago, losing twice to a British side that isn&apos;t a patch on the one that Sean Kerly inspired to victory 20 years ago. The real scandal though was off the field. When Australian legend, Ric Charlesworth, was appointed as technical director, those that prayed for Indian hockey were convinced that deliverance was at hand. Instead, Gill insists that he&apos;ll continue to work with the junior sides, and that he &quot;won&apos;t be ready&quot; to coach the seniors for at least five years. While India fell flat in Santiago, Charlesworth was in Australia. Denying him a ticket denied India access to his nous, and continued a short-sighted xenophobic approach that has dragged the game from castle to gutter. When a colleague and I interviewed him a couple of years ago, Charlesworth mentioned that insularity. &quot;The mistake that India has made is that it has been too isolated, too unwilling to look outside,&quot; he said. &quot;India has huge numbers, huge resources, and gifted players. But they don&apos;t have the organisation, the discipline, the tactics - things that are important for the team to be successful.&quot; Since winning gold at a Moscow games boycotted by the world&apos;s top sides, India haven&apos;t come close to glory on the highest stage. And if the decline of the Roman Empire was supposedly the result of lead poisoning, India&apos;s tumble down the hockey hill can also be traced to an elemental change. &quot;The turning point was the 1976 Montreal Olympics where we beat India and they couldn&apos;t make the semi-finals,&quot; said Charlesworth, harking back to the switch from natural grass to Astroturf. &quot;The previous year, they were the world champions. That was the start of it. For the first five or six years of my career, we could never beat India, and then suddenly after that we could beat them with ease.&quot; These days, even the Chinese, who would probably have mistaken a hockey stick for a walking aid two decades ago, manage to do that, and the future is bleak. Two days ago, I watched cricketers being hawked around at the IPL auction for six-figure sums and counted two dozen TV cameras zooming in on the absurdly trivial. Hockey&apos;s travails attract rants and invective for a couple of days and are then conveniently forgotten. Spare a thought for the much-maligned players, who watch cricketers take home Porsches, and even hijack a song, Chak De, from a movie on Indian hockey. As Pillay wrote, &quot;Staying in mosquito-infested rooms in downtown hotels in Paharganj, Karol Bagh [suburbs of Delhi] and sometimes shabby stadiums, certainly affects the morale of the players. You don&apos;t expect them to walk taller on the field when they take on their counterparts from Australia, Holland, Germany - who are well-looked after with scientific support and basic facilities. When I demanded match fees for hockey players they accused me of being greedy.&quot; No prizes for guessing where the accusation came from. The Great Helmsman continues to lead the long march into mediocrity, leaving Indian hockey clutching at sepia-tinted memories.", "sentences": ["Failure to qualify for the Olympic Games in Beijing - defeat to Great Britain last Sunday ensured no Indian team at the event for the first time since they won the first of eight golds at Amsterdam in 1928 - could be the body blow that kills off what was once the national sport."], "title": "Dileep Premachandran: Kanwar Pal Singh Gill's tyrannical reign as president of the Indian Hockey Federation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/13/1", "tags": ["Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-14T00:19:15Z", "article": "Carlyle Group, one of the world&apos;s largest private equity firms, was forced to admit yesterday that its \u00a311bn Guernsey-based offshoot had gone bust after banks including Merrill Lynch refused to support a refinancing package. Carlyle Capital, a hedge fund that invested primarily in two US mortgage lenders, was in effect shut down only two weeks after issuing its annual report for 2007 with a clean bill of health from the auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers. Carlyle said from its New York offices that the Channel Islands fund had &quot;not been able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement to stabilise its financing&quot;. Its shares were almost worthless after they fell more than 70% on top of the 90% drop since the company&apos;s problems became public last week. A spokeswoman said the fund would be wound up and assets returned to its main lending banks. She said market volatility had wrecked any chances of survival and jeopardised other leveraged funds. Fears that rivals would face the same hard line from banks gained ground as the credit crunch appeared to worsen.  Analysts argued that a jump in short-term interbank loan rates - making it more costly for banks to borrow from each other - put pressure on lenders to claw back cash from hedge funds and private equity groups. An offer by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to swap ailing mortgage-backed bonds for guaranteed treasury bills may also have encouraged banks to pull the plug on Carlyle. Fed chiefs said on Monday they had put aside $200bn (\u00a3100bn) of treasury bills to underpin the mortgage-backed bond market. Analysts said banks keen to reduce the riskiness of their loans could withdraw from firms such as Carlyle and swap them for more secure government debt. However, the continued decline of the US housing market appeared last night to be the crucial trigger. Carlyle Capital invested in AAA-rated mortgage debt issued by government-backed lenders known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Like other investment vehicles, it used high levels of borrowing to generate higher returns. According to the company&apos;s figures, it borrowed about \u00a332 for every pound it raised from investors. A decline in house prices in the US amid a wave of repossessions has cut the value of derivatives linked to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages. The two lenders are considered the most secure in the US, but have suffered along with others since the global credit crunch hit last year. The Carlyle fund borrowed money from at least a dozen banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Carlyle&apos;s New York office kept a tight grip on the management of the fund and offered a line of credit during negotiations with the banks. Talks collapsed when a fire sale of \u00a32.5bn in securities led to a fall in the value of the remaining \u00a38bn worth of holdings, leaving the banks poised to force a liquidation and to seek to recover the assets.  Carlyle first came to prominence in the UK following a \u00a3140m investment in the government-owned defence contractor, QinetiQ. The private equity firm was accused of profiteering at the taxpayer&apos;s expense after it made more than \u00a3250m profit when the contractor was privatised in 2006, only three years after the initial investment.  Carlyle Capital was the first of the firm&apos;s 60 funds to be floated on the stockmarket. It was listed on the Amsterdam exchange at almost \u00a310 a share and registered in Guernsey to benefit from its low-tax regime.

Others caught the bus from Belgrade or Sarajevo, or rented cars in Slovenia or Croatia and road-tripped it. But, amazingly, over 10,000 Brits made the journey. Perhaps it&apos;s the mass media coverage and commercial interest squeezing the counterculture out of British festivals. Perhaps it&apos;s because a foreign festival is a festival and a holiday squeezed into one glorious weekend package.

It&apos;s a shambles.&apos; But it wasn&apos;t that foggy. The trouble is that Heathrow often works at 100 per cent capacity. If one plane is delayed for as little as 15 minutes, the whole system is thrown out of kilter. Will Bradstock&apos;s experience change once Terminal 5 is up and running at the end of the month? He hopes so, but isn&apos;t banking on it: &apos;I always tell my secretary to try to get me a flight that leaves from Gatwick or City Airport.&apos; Terminal 5, which was officially opened by the Queen last week, is the showpiece investment of BAA, the company that runs seven airports in Britain, including Gatwick and Stansted. Designed by Richard Rogers at a cost of \u00a34bn, it offers a stunning new gateway into the UK, and is one of Europe&apos;s biggest infrastructure projects. It will handle 30 million passengers a year, roughly the same as Gatwick. Inside the building is a shopping mall and an array of restaurants and cafes. Big brands with a presence include Harrods, Prada, Bulgari and Gordon Ramsay.  In theory, Terminal 5 should take the heat off BAA: the old Heathrow was built to cope with about 45 million passengers, but the number passing through today is closer to 70 million. The new terminal should allow BAA to ease customer congestion, but without an additional runway it will probably do little to improve airline punctuality. There is an even harsher truth; the opening of Terminal 5 comes at a time of unprecedented turmoil within the civil aviation industry. BAA and the airlines are at each other&apos;s throats in a row over landing charges; green campaigners are marshalling their forces in a bid to stop a third runway at Heathrow and a second one at Stansted; BAA&apos;s owner, Spanish construction company Ferrovial, is creaking under \u00a39bn of debt; and some airlines are staring at the possibility of bankruptcy as they are caught by the double whammy of soaring fuel charges and a global economic slowdown. To cap it all, while Terminal 5 is opening on time and on budget, other parts of the airport will resemble a building site because there are ambitious plans to replace Terminals 1 and 2 with Heathrow East, a project that BAA was forced to admit last week would not be completed in time for the 2012 Olympics. For airline executives, the heart of the industry&apos;s problem is a dysfunctional system of economic regulation, one that makes for inefficiency and &apos;rip-off&apos; landing charges that encourage future profligacy on the part of BAA.  On Wednesday, the airlines displayed rare unity when they lambasted the regulatory body, the Civil Aviation Authority, for allegedly caving in to BAA demands to hike landing charges by 86 per cent over five years at Heathrow and 49 per cent at Gatwick. They were equally critical of the \u00a32.5bn cost of a second runway at Stansted, which green campaigners say went &apos;beyond economic vandalism&apos;. Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA, says the CAA&apos;s new pricing regime is &apos;completely unacceptable. We&apos;ve already been paying over the odds for standards of service that have been glaringly lacking. Now it appears failure is to be rewarded by the regulator.&apos;  CAA director Harry Bush responds by saying that if airlines want improved facilities, especially at airports in the south east, they will have to help pay for them. He says that increased investment by BAA, \u00a35bn over the next five years (excluding the estimated \u00a38bn cost of an extra Heathrow runway) should enable the public to enjoy &apos;decently modern airports and consistently high services, as well as halving security queuing times&apos;. But the row between the regulator and the airlines goes much deeper. Airlines believe that BAA gets an easy ride from the authorities because the operator is guaranteed a fixed return on its capital; BAA, it is alleged, has an incentive to overspend because the bigger the project, the bigger the profit. Andy Harrison, head of EasyJet, says: &apos;The system doesn&apos;t encourage capital and operating efficiency. The regulatory structure, established 20 years ago, is out of date and in need of reform.&apos; He believes that the government should break BAA&apos;s monopolistic grip on the three main London airports and that, as a minimum, the company should be forced to sell Stansted. &apos;What we need is a much more competitive environment,&apos; he says. &apos;At Heathrow, for instance, there is no reason why one company should own both the terminals and the airport. Why not separate the two? Then different companies could own different terminals. That side of the business [the terminals] could be deregulated, while the operating company would still be regulated and subject to a price cap.&apos; Walsh, on the other hand, believes that the system could be improved by imposing harsher penalties on BAA if it fails to meet service standards: &apos;Up to now, there have been a lot of carrots, but not enough stick. We need fewer carrots, and a lot more stick.&apos; Andrew Fitchie, airlines analyst at Collins Stewart, says: &apos;The airlines would not mind paying higher charges if they got a gilt-edged service, but they don&apos;t.&apos; Poor standards are wreaking havoc at BA, which finds itself at the bottom of European league tables for both flight delays and misplaced baggage. Observers have cautioned that Heathrow could get even busier with the introduction of an &apos;open skies&apos; policy between the EU and US. The number of aircraft taking off and landing at Heathrow will not change but there could be a bigger mixture of planes and destinations, with more passengers heading for already overcrowded boarding gates. But if BAA is ruthlessly self-interested, couldn&apos;t the same charge be levelled at the airlines? Analysts say it goes without saying that airline companies will scream from the rooftops whenever they are asked to stump up more cash.  City sources say that, despite the noise about increased landing charges, the big airlines have not signalled to brokers that they should amend their 2008 profit forecasts. That suggests steeper landing charges will be passed on to passengers. More worrying for the industry is oil at more than $110 a barrel and the possibility of a fall-off in passenger volumes as families cut back on holidays because of worsening economic conditions. Meanwhile, in Madrid, Rafael del Pino, the boss of BAA&apos;s parent Ferrovial, must cope with a different set of problems. In the summer of 2006, when the global economy was firing on all cylinders and credit was cheap, he masterminded the acquisition of BAA, which was chaired at the time by veteran City dealmaker Marcus Agius, a former Lazard banker. It is quite possible that del Pino was as much attracted by light-touch regulation of London&apos;s airports by the CAA as by easy money, although we shall never know for sure. But his plans for BAA have gone seriously awry. While the canny Agius extracted \u00a310bn from the Spanish for BAA&apos;s equity, the deal also involved taking on \u00a34.6bn of company debt. The highly leveraged nature of the transaction left the del Pino acquisition vehicle, Airport Development and Investment (ADI), with borrowings of \u00a39.6bn. Future success depended on ADI being able to swiftly refinance on more favourable terms. Then the credit crunch came along, leaving del Pino, Ferrovial and BAA in the lurch. Regulatory uncertainty in the form of a Competition Commission inquiry into whether the London airports&apos; monopoly should be broken up added to the tale of woes. The credit rating agencies were soon on BAA&apos;s case, slashing its rating to junk status. Ferrovial&apos;s shares plummeted on the Madrid market, while in London brokers such as JP Morgan and Collins Stewart warned that BAA could eventually run out of cash.  Del Pino, unsettled by poor publicity following upheaval at Heathrow during a terrorist alert 21 months ago, has intervened in BAA&apos;s affairs to orchestrate managerial changes, installing Sir Nigel Rudd as chairman and encouraging him to oust chief executive Stephen Nelson, who is being replaced by Colin Matthews in the summer. But so precarious have BAA&apos;s finances become that they have attracted the attention of UK regulators. Last autumn, the Competition Commission said it would investigate if the company&apos;s indebtedness posed a threat to passengers and airport investment. So when the CAA allowed BAA to impose higher-than-expected landing charges last week, airline bosses went on the record to assert that the upswing in tariffs was in part designed to relieve financial pressure on the Spanish parent company.  Harrison said the CAA had acted &apos;because BAA has enormous debt obligations. This has all the makings of the next Northern Rock. How indebted is this company?&apos; All this is happening as a lengthy battle looms over aviation policy, with the government pushing for a third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow, as well as another runway at Stansted. The proposed additional investment has drawn the wrath of environmentalists, who have opened a new front against BAA, claiming that expansion plans fly in the face of government commitments to cut greenhouse gases. But BAA must push ahead with the government&apos;s agenda, with insiders claiming that Heathrow&apos;s two runways compare badly with Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle, which has four, Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol&apos;s five and Frankfurt&apos;s three. But the backlash against airport expansion - which is viewed by green lobby groups as pandering to the needs of big business, though it also offers the scope to boost employment - is reaching parts of the City. Last month, it emerged that ethical funds run by Standard Life and Scottish Widows had stopped investing in airline company shares in response to pressure from investors. Airlines account for less than 5 per cent of all carbon emissions, but this is an industry with a huge public profile and one that is strategically important for the wider economy. Little wonder, then, that there appear to be more vested interests than landing slots at Heathrow. BA ready for take-off BA has most to gain when Terminal 5 opens later this month, as almost all its business will be shifted there from other terminals. The centralisation of its operations to a single building means that more than 80 per cent of its transfer passengers will be connecting to flights in the same terminal, making life easier for the travelling public and reducing the danger that their baggage will fail to follow them on to their next flight. The airline plans for most of its passengers to use online or self-service check-in facilities at Terminal 5, with baggage for the hold simply taken to high-speed drop desks. BA hopes that the average check-in and security vetting processes will take no longer than 10 minutes. Any technical glitches or teething problems at the new terminal will fall disproportionately on the airline, but boss Willie Walsh believes that Terminal 5 will &apos;transform the customer experience&apos;. Elsewhere, BA is battling against a sky-high oil price that has forced it to warn that profits could fall by more than a quarter in the next financial year. But Walsh insists that the company would still be profitable even if the price of oil reached $120 a barrel. However there are bound to be casualties elsewhere in the sector, say analysts, which means that BA could pick off weaker competitors. Walsh has expressed an interest in BMI (British Midland) and has previously considered a bid for Iberia. It is also seeking a wider alliance with American Airlines.", "sentences": ["But BAA must push ahead with the government&apos;s agenda, with insiders claiming that Heathrow&apos;s two runways compare badly with Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle, which has four, Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol&apos;s five and Frankfurt&apos;s three."], "title": "Heathrow shambles will not end at Terminal 5", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/16/britishairwaysbusiness.theairlineindustry", "tags": ["British Airways", "Airline industry", "Business", "Heathrow", "Heathrow Airports Authority"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-16T00:11:58Z", "article": "The impetus for Radio Caroline came when the founder, Ronan O&apos;Rahilly, discovered Georgie Fame.

The BBC wouldn&apos;t play him because he was an unknown artist, so Ronan decided to launch his own station. Unlicensed, Radio Caroline began broadcasting on Easter Sunday 1964 from a ship off the coast of Felixstowe. It quickly gained an audience of millions because no other station played pop music all day. I was in Birmingham at the time, working as a motor mechanic during the day and DJing in clubs at night. I&apos;d heard about the station so I hung a long wire out of my bedroom window and could just about pick it up. It was unbelievable, to be able to hear all these new records all day long, and these new DJs and the way they were introducing them was just so unlike anything I&apos;d heard before. I soon managed to get a job as a DJ on Swinging Radio London, but it was badly organised and so I went to Caroline and asked for a job. Ronan just said, &apos;If you can get to the ship tomorrow, you&apos;re on.&apos; I spent two years there and it was just fantastic. We were stuck on there for a fortnight at a time, so it was like a weird commune. It was an amazing time, until the government passed the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act in August 1967 to try to close us down. I thought it was so unjust, and there was fantastic support from the public, so Ronan said we&apos;ll just keep going and we agreed to defy the law. We struggled on, but advertising dried up so there was no money to pay the bills and in March 1968, the Dutch company that owned the ship towed us back to Amsterdam. It changed the face of radio forever and people remember it very fondly. Richard Curtis is even working on a film about a pirate radio station on a boat called The Boat That Rocked. In other news ...

But not United mascot Darren Fletcher. &quot;We know it&apos;s going to be difficult against Bolton,&quot; he boomed today. &quot;They are physical and pose a particular threat from set-pieces,&quot; he added, keeping an admirably straight face. In fairness to Fletcher, that statement may just be proof that he still hasn&apos;t recovered from recently playing the starring role in the hilarious smash hit Attack of the Toilet Door. On the other hand, his hilarious opinion could also be proof that he, like most people, hasn&apos;t bothered watching the Trots this season and is unaware that their victory over United in Megson&apos;s first match in charge didn&apos;t trigger an upswing but in fact detonated an implosion. The Trots are now about as physical as a bad smell - this season they have scored less from set-pieces than, among others, Reading, Birmingham, Wigan, Newcastle and Fulham - which is why they&apos;re going to be flushed out of the Premier League.

Tonight isn&apos;t about relegation - with United beating Bolton and Chelsea summoning a Spurs XI back from their summer holidays to fulfil their fixture obligations at White Hart Lane, it&apos;s all about the title race. &quot;We believe we are the best blah drone,&quot; bellowed Michael Carrick. &quot;You can always pull on experience to drone blah.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s Claude Makelele, who&apos;s won club titles in three countries, retorted by insisting that experience is in fact on his team&apos;s side. &quot;We have top players with a lot of ambition and we have experience of the fight,&quot; declared the midfielder, as aesthetes all over England admired giant fruity photos of his wife sporting M&amp;S grundies. &quot;This is what makes you champions, you are not losing, you are win, win, win, win to get the championship,&quot; he rat-a-tat-tatted as, nearby, William Gallas strove to rally his Arsenal troops by sobbing into a hankie. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Thaksin Shinawatra plans to bring Sven-Goran Eriksson a Giovanni Dos Santos back from his next trip abroad.

The sports psychologist, who knows Keane from when he had a part-time role with Manchester United and the Sunderland manager was captain at Old Trafford, is best known for his work alongside Steve McClaren with Middlesbrough and, most recently, England. Boro and England players hold mixed views about Beswick - a man described as McClaren&apos;s &quot;guru&quot; - but Keane remains a fan and yesterday explained: &quot;I enjoyed chatting to Bill very much when I was a player and he has been in once or twice to talk to the players. &quot;We try different things on different occasions and the high jumper Steve Smith has also been in a couple of times and given talks about the mental side of the game. You&apos;ve sometimes got to get out of the box and think a bit differently to other people. I&apos;m very open-minded.&quot; At first glance, Sunderland&apos;s manager and Beswick may appear unlikely soulmates but Keane insisted: &quot;You&apos;ve got to try things and you just hope the players plug into it. Some people might want to see Bill one to one, others don&apos;t and they won&apos;t see him again. I generally think the players enjoy it, though. We don&apos;t tie them into a seat and make them listen for 90 minutes; it&apos;s all very casual.&quot; This echoes Beswick&apos;s previous arrangement with Manchester United. &quot;The position at United was also very casual,&quot; said Keane. &quot;If you wanted to go to see Bill you went to see him. Some players never saw him, I saw him once or twice but I often couldn&apos;t get in because Gary Neville was always in there with him.&quot; Wigan Athletic&apos;s manager, Steve Bruce, has decided not to appeal against the red card shown to Jason Koumas on Sunday. The Wales midfielder Koumas was sent off after only four minutes of the 1-0 win over Bolton Wanderers at the JJB Stadium following a challenge on Gary Cahill. Koumas was adamant the referee Steve Tanner acted too hastily as his tackle was not two-footed, and he was genuinely going for the ball. Bruce indicated after the match the Latics would appeal, but yesterday said: &quot;We&apos;ve looked at it and we&apos;re not appealing. We decided against it on the grounds of what happened to J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re when he was sent off at Liverpool and then had his ban extended. It was a harsh decision. I don&apos;t think Jason has a bad tackle in him, and I feel for the lad because he&apos;s been terrific.

MPs had decided to beat the transport hell by sloping off early. The government frontbench was empty, so Andrew Mackinlay, one of the best-loved members of the Awkward Squad, took the prime minister&apos;s place in front of the dispatch box, where he put his feet up on the table, like a chav on a train. He was warmly welcomed by the Tories. Every month there is a question time devoted to odds and sods, matters which don&apos;t rate a whole session on their own. Yesterday they discussed, among other topics, tap water, bat poo and why women can&apos;t be bishops. Questions to the Church Commissioners brought the discussion of bats, which cause havoc in churches by plopping on to pews, lecterns, altars, pulpits etc. But bats are legally protected. Andrew Robathan, a Tory, wanted Defra to cut through the red tape and end this scourge of incontinent flying mammals. Fat chance. Bureaucrats hate to reduce bureaucracy; where would that all end? The only hope is for the health department to develop a pill to make bats constipated, so they will just sit around on the rafters, groaning softly. Graham Brady wanted women appointed as bishops, on the grounds that the first two people Jesus met after his resurrection were women, Mary and Martha. There are good reasons for having female bishops, but that doesn&apos;t strike me as one. Suppose the first two people he&apos;d met had been strippers? Or estate agents? Soon afterwards the solicitor general, Vera Baird, arrived. Mr Mackinlay, like a cheeky schoolboy who&apos;s been in the teacher&apos;s chair, sidled off back. Ms Baird was assailed by Tories who affected to be worried about the government&apos;s record on protecting data. What had happened to the disk that held DNA records requested by the Dutch police?  Ms Baird was triumphant. It had, she said with relish, been personally taken to Amsterdam by a police official, who had the disk handcuffed to him, and was, furthermore, escorted by another official!  They moved on to tap water. Forget terrorism, climate change and the credit crisis. John Spellar has made it his mission to abolish bottled water from Commons committee rooms and replace it with jugs filled from a tap. These days nothing is decided quickly. Nick Harvey, the MP who answers on these topics, said that the Department of Facilities was examining the issue &quot;with the intention of providing further advice&quot; - in other words, doing nothing. Mr Spellar was outraged. &quot;I urge more urgency!&quot; he declared. But Sandra Gidley pointed out that the bottled water came from her constituency, Romsey. &quot;So I hope instead of stringent clinging to political correctness, we are permitted a choice.&quot;", "sentences": ["It had, she said with relish, been personally taken to Amsterdam by a police official, who had the disk handcuffed to him, and was, furthermore, escorted by another official!"], "title": "Simon Hoggart's sketch: Bat poo and tap water among odds and sods", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/21/houseofcommons", "tags": ["House of Commons", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-21T00:15:27Z", "article": "&apos;A man in whom flinty autocracy gave way to tragic vulnerability&apos; ... Paul Scofield in the filmed version of Peter Brook&apos;s Lear (1971). Photograph: Ronald Grant archive &quot;Acting,&quot; David Hare once said to me, &quot;is a judgment of character.&quot; That was amply borne out by Paul Scofield, who has just died at the age of 86. Scofield had a moral integrity and quiet authority that shone through everything he did. Even his choice of roles was exemplary: many actors trade fame for money, but I can&apos;t think of a single meretricious piece of work Scofield ever did. But, like all great actors, he also had a rich sense of comedy that would often emerge unexpectedly. A few years back I had the pleasure of presenting Scofield with a lifetime achievement award on behalf of the Critics&apos; Circle; and I remember saying at the time that I felt I&apos;d measured out my life in Scofield performances. As an eight-year-old, I&apos;d been taken on my first visit to Stratford to see him play Shakespeare&apos;s Troilus. As a 20-year-old student, I&apos;d been present at the first performance, at the Oxford New, of A Man For All Seasons: I still recall his modesty when pushed into taking a solo curtain-call by his fellow actors. And, while working inconspicuously in a regional rep, I&apos;d made the pilgrimage to London to see his famous Lear. It was astonishing to think that Scofield was only 40 when he took the role, revealing a man in whom flinty autocracy gave way to tragic vulnerability. Over the years everything Scofield did was touched by distinction. But, although he conquered the classic peaks of Hamlet, Lear and Othello, he also illuminated a whole range of modern plays. He was extraordinary as a camp, silvery hairdresser in Charles Dyer&apos;s Staircase at the Aldwych. As the self-hating writer-hero of John Osborne&apos;s The Hotel In Amsterdam at the Royal Court he exuded a waspish melancholy. And he was the original Salieri in Peter Shaffer&apos;s Amadeus at the National: a flickering romantic presence savouring the acclaim of the court while being corroded by envy of Mozart&apos;s genius. I never saw Scofield gave a flashy, showy, unfelt performance; and his mixture of gravity and mischief transferred easily from stage to screen, as shown in his Oscar-winning performance as Sir Thomas More. But Scofield was more than a great actor. In his rigorous focus on the work in hand, his determination to protect his privacy and his mixture of classic and contemporary work, he was a reminder of an all-but-vanished age when actors preserved their sense of mystery. If Scofield revealed himself, it was through his work; and what we saw was a figure of rich humanity, wide-ranging compassion and unflinching integrity.", "sentences": ["As the self-hating writer-hero of John Osborne&apos;s The Hotel In Amsterdam at the Royal Court he exuded a waspish melancholy."], "title": "Paul Scofield: 1922-2008", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/mar/20/paulscofield19222008", "tags": ["Stage", "Culture", "Theatre", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-21T02:33:55Z", "article": "Anyone who enjoys playing games with their musical friends, asking them to identify and date unfamiliar works, could have great fun with this disc. Born in Utrecht, Holland, Julius R\u00f6ntgen (1855-1932) was the cousin of the discoverer of x-rays, a composer, teacher and pianist who was a friend of Brahms and Grieg and one of the founders of the conservatory in Amsterdam. As a composer, R\u00f6ntgen was hugely prolific, producing more than 650 works, of which more than 100 came from the last decade of his life. With the exception of a Trio for Clarinet, Viola and Piano, from 1921, the music here all dates from that final period. R\u00f6ntgen&apos;s style seems to have remained oblivious to the various developments that overtook music in the first quarter of the 20th century; nearly all of these pieces could have been written in the 1880s or 1890s, with Brahms as the major influence, and just a suggestion of the world of C\u00e9sar Franck as well. Yet there is something persistently personal about much of the music, especially in the concise A minor Piano Quintet, which lasts just 16 minutes yet seems to pack much more in, and the relaxed String Sextet, composed a year before his death.

Sir Richard Eyre said it was like &quot;walking through a wood&quot;. Both were paying tribute to Paul Scofield, one of Britain&apos;s greatest actors, who has died in hospital aged 86. Though his career brought him great accolades - his 1962 Lear was once voted the best ever Shakespearean performance and he won an Oscar for his role as Sir Thomas More in A Man For All Seasons - Scofield did not seek publicity, and could quietly return by train to his home in West Sussex unrecognised. The playwright Sir David Hare said yesterday: &quot;I know at least three playwrights who will tell you they realised they wanted to make their lives in theatre when they saw Paul Scofield play King Lear. It was ... the greatest classical performance of my lifetime: radical, humane and incredibly moving.&quot; Felicity Kendal appeared alongside Scofield on stage three times, including as Desdemona to his Othello at the National. &quot;I think he was the last greatest of the greats. Acting with him, you learned something every day,&quot; she said. &quot;It was like being in an acting class, you just absorbed his skill. I&apos;ve never heard a story about Paul that isn&apos;t moving or funny or generous.&quot; Scofield was a private man and, according to those who knew him, would rather talk about his garden roses than the meaning of acting. He twice rejected a knighthood after accepting a CBE in 1956 and was made a Companion of Honour in 2001. When he appeared in films he was memorable: in Robert Redford&apos;s Quiz Show, for example, and in A Man For All Seasons, in 1966. But Scofield was more a man of the stage, particularly in his work with Peter Brook, who directed him in King Lear, and never took the money route to Hollywood. Hall directed Scofield in many plays and remembers watching him on stage as a young man in the late 1940s. &quot;There&apos;s no question of how good he was. But Paul was always a curiously modern actor, he had a great and penetrating sense of humour and he had an extraordinary voice,&quot; Hall said. &quot;I can&apos;t think of a great stage actor that didn&apos;t have a remarkable voice and his was: it was like a magical oboe.&quot; Eyre directed Scofield in Ibsen&apos;s John Gabriel Borkman at the National in 1996. &quot;He was technically amazingly powerful, he had the voice and presence ... You kind of fell in love with him,&quot; Eyre said. Sir Kenneth Branagh, who directed Scofield in Henry V, said he was a &quot;master&quot; who was his own man. Sir Antony Sher recalled arriving from South Africa in 1968 and seeing Scofield in Osborne&apos;s play The Hotel in Amsterdam, at the Royal Court. &quot;It wasn&apos;t Osborne at his best but it was a tremendously exciting thing for me to see Scofield as soon as I arrived. I think he was one of the greatest actors this country has produced in the last century.&quot; Hare recalled watching Scofield&apos;s last stage performance, reading Chekhov&apos;s letters with Irene Worth. &quot;Paul came on as a man of 80, and left looking about 30. You could see the years drop away as his pleasure in acting reasserted itself,&quot; Hare said. &quot;These two great actors - she&apos;d been Goneril to his Lear - were performing ... and as they left the stage he put his hand on her back to guide her off.

You&apos;ll barely have time to sleep or eat, but if you do, head to April, a restaurant with a play area; for a coffee break, Double Eye in the Schoneberg district serves free kids&apos; cappuccinos when you order coffee.  \u00b7 The Ellington Hotel (N\u00fcrnberger Strasse 50-55, 0049 (0)30 6831-50, ellington-hotel.com) has family rooms from \u20ac185 B&amp;B inc entrance to Berlin Zoo or Sea Life Center. New York Children are rarely impressed by shops (with the possible exception of FAO Schwarz) so intersperse your spending spree with some of these child-centred attractions: the New Victory Theater (newvictory.org, 229 West 42nd Street; tickets $12.50-$35) stages plays and musicals exclusively for family audiences. An elevator ride to the 80th floor of the Empire State Building is a sure-fire hit, but try the flight simulator on the second floor too (the Observatory and Skyride package costs $41.61 for adults and $28.07 for kids). For a new twist on the usual Statue of Liberty cruise, hop on The Beast, a 30-minute speedboat ride through New York Harbour. Reopening in May, it departs from Pier 83 (circleline42.com, adults $18, under 12s $12, minimum height 40&quot;). Dinosaur fanatics should head for the American Museum of Natural History, while aspiring Spielbergs can make movies at the Museum of the Moving Image.  \u00b7 Manhattan apartments from \u00a393 per day from apartmentservice.com. Stockholm Of Stockholm&apos;s 14 islands, Djurg\u00e5rden has the most family attractions, ranging from the &quot;time capsule&quot; of Skansen (skansen.se), where historic buildings and costumed staff recreate traditional life, to Junibacken (junibacken.se) where kids can explore the world of storybook heroine Pippi Longstocking. The city&apos;s biggest drawcard for families, however, is the Stockholm archipelago (an easy ferry ride away) with its beaches, watersports and holiday houses. \u00b7 Family hotels from Dkr695 (\u00a357) per room at hotels-stockholm.com.  Paris Paris may be the city for lovers - ignore them (they&apos;re probably having a miserable time anyhow) and adjust your sights. An eight-year-old won&apos;t think the Eiffel Tower is too touristy - they&apos;ll think it&apos;s a brilliant way to spend an hour or two. Other child-friendly highlights include sailing boats and the Ferris Wheel in the Tuileries gardens, pulling faces at Notre dame&apos;s gargoyles and tinkering with the interactive exhibits at Parc de la Villette. \u00b7 Hotel Therese is a 5-minute walk from the Louvre and welcomes children. Cots and babysitting available on request and deluxe rooms can accommodate extra beds. From \u20ac150, i-escape.com.  Amsterdam Another city where coverage tends to focus on the obvious adult attractions when there are numerous child-friendly ones. Canals, locks, bridges, teeny houses (the smallest is as wide as the doorway) can all be explored by bike. The Science Museum Nemo (e-nemo.nl) is good for a rainy day; in summer make use of its roof-top chill-out area with palm trees, a sandpit and a waterfall or head to one of the beaches, such as Bloemendaal, an easy train ride away.  \u00b7 For older children a house boat is a fun alternative to a hotel - houseboathotel.nl has a selection. If the prospect of keeping a watchful eye on them 24/7 gives you the jitters, the Stayokay hostel in the Vondelpark caters to families on a budget. Liverpool Liverpool is this year&apos;s City of (whisper it) Culture - and there&apos;s plenty for kids. The Walker Art Gallery&apos;s Big Art for Little Artists is a children&apos;s gallery with jigsaws, spot the cartoon character and computer games (liverpoolmuseums.org.uk). Underwater Street (underwaterstreet.com) is a hands-on discovery centre for two to 10-year-olds, with themed zones, including an art area and Physical Zone. If the sun shines, there&apos;s always the ferry across the Mersey where you can embarrass your children mercilessly by singing the song loudly. For lunch try the Olive Press on Castle St or Ego on Hope Street - both have high-chairs and kids&apos; menus.  \u00b7 Visitliverpool.com has lists of serviced apartments from \u00a365 per night, the best-value option for families. Cairo, Aswan and Luxor School-age children who have covered Ancient Egypt in the classroom will be captivated by this trio of Nile Valley cities - just make sure you avoid the summer meltdown by visiting during spring or autumn. In Cairo, divide your time between the Pyramids and the Egyptian Museum, where the Royal Mummy Room contains the grizzly remains of ancient queens and pharaohs. Next, take the overnight sleeper train to Aswan, where you can ride camels in the desert before hopping on a Nile cruiser or felucca for the voyage north to Luxor. Infant Indianas and Little Lara Crofts can decipher the hieroglyphics in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings, while the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak is crying out for a game of hide and seek. \u00b7 Families Worldwide (0845 051 4567, familiesworldwide.co.uk) offers a 9-day tour from \u00a3899 per adult and \u00a3849 per child (minimum age five) including flights, accommodation and some meals. Brussels and Bruges Easy to get to, easy to navigate once you&apos;re there and chock-full of cartoon characters and chocolate, boring old Brussels is actually a child&apos;s paradise. Visit the Smurf exhibition at the Comic Strip Museum (opening on June 10), then stroll around Paris, London and Venice at Mini Europe and watch a delicious demonstration at the Museum of Chocolate. The less-sweet-toothed can hop on the train to Bruges for the Museum of the Chip (yes, a whole museum dedicated to the art of the Belgium fr\u00eete), opening in May. By which point they should be thoroughly exhausted and fit to burst.  \u00b7 Stay at Hotel NH Arenberg (nh-hoetls.com). Rooms from \u20ac72.50 (\u00a359). Your Eurostar ticket allows onward travel from Brussels to any destination in Belgium (under 4s travel free, under 12s \u00a350, youth fare, 12-26 starts at \u00a349, adult from \u00a359).  Valencia Valencia is the sort of place you pick for yourselves hoping you&apos;ll happen upon a few child-friendly attractions when you get there. The reality is they soon get bored of looking at fish stalls and the boats keep them interested for 10 minutes max. Now there&apos;s a bona fide children&apos;s attraction, the Bioparc Valencia (bioparcvalencia.es), a conservation project, with more than 4,000 animals from 250 species.  \u00b7 Open daily 10am-6pm midweek and to 7pm weekends (up to 9pm in the summer months). Tickets cost \u20ac20 for adults and \u20ac15 for children. Stay at three-star Petit Palace Germanias (petitepalacehotelgermanias.com) in the city centre, family rooms for up to four from \u20ac96 per night.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam Another city where coverage tends to focus on the obvious adult attractions when there are numerous child-friendly ones."], "title": "When children meet city breaks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/mar/22/rome.berlin", "tags": ["Rome holidays", "Berlin holidays", "New York holidays", "Stockholm holidays", "Paris holidays", "Amsterdam holidays", "Liverpool holidays", "Cairo holidays", "Brussels holidays", "Bruges holidays", "Valencia holidays", "Top 100 family breaks", "Family holidays", "European Union holidays", "Short breaks", "Travel", "Italy holidays", "Germany holidays", "United States holidays", "Sweden holidays", "France holidays", "Netherlands holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Egypt holidays", "Belgium holidays", "Spain holidays", "Cultural trips", "City breaks"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-22T00:10:38Z", "article": "Ian Kiaer And Sara MacKillop, Birmingham Sara MacKillop&apos;s artworks have been described as anti-heroic, but the term could just as easily be applied to the sculptural installations of Ian Kiaer. Both artists create art out of objects often considered to be worthless or outdated. In Kiaer&apos;s case this invariably takes the form of everyday scrap - plastic buckets, empty yoghurt cartons and polystyrene - which he transforms into miniature architectural marvels. Drained of colour, these sculptures become blueprints for magical possibilities. Depicting the torn pages of a paperback book faded to the edges or the grooves of a record, MacKillop&apos;s compositions have a similar kind of appeal and reveal a poignancy and beauty in even the most dispensable items. Jessica Lack \u00b7 International Project Space, Bournville, to Apr 19 Based on paper, Middlesbrough Through the counter-cultural years of the 1960s and early-70s, artists increasingly reacted against the stuffiness of high-art traditions. The assumption that painting and sculpture were innately more worthy than drawing or photography was questioned. Ironically, in an age of increasing mass-media sophistication, many innovative artists - here including Jannis Kounellis, Bruce Nauman, Robert Smithson and Blinky Palermo (work pictured) - turned to doodling on paper. This show documents a tendency to reclaim drawing as a form of creative thinking, whether as a means of developing ideas to be fulfilled in other media, or as a self-sufficient medium in its own right. Robert Clark \u00b7 MIMA, to May 11 Supernatural presents digital dreams, London Where does the distinction between art and visual effects lie? To explore this question, Tate Modern are having a weekend of talks and events hosted by the creative studio Supernatural. This year they are branching out from the confines of special effects and inviting members of the gaming industry and product design to discuss how our virtual dreams can be realised in software as well as on celluloid. On hand is Oscar winner Scott Farrar, whose work was recently seen in Transformers (pictured), plus Mike Milne, who created the spellbinding sequences for the BBC&apos;s outstanding Walking With Dinosaurs. JL \u00b7 Tate Modern, SE1, Tue 25, Wed 26 Alberto Giacometti/James Coleman, Compton Verney How testing and uplifting to see Alberto Giacometti back in the UK, an artist by which other artists measure the integrity of their struggle and by which non-artist viewers measure their psychological vulnerability. Through the existentialist years of post-second world war Paris, Giacometti worked tirelessly to fix fleeting images of human presence. Here are sculptures and paintings of his long-suffering sitters, his wife Annette and brother Diego, as well as a stunning image of petrified intensity in the form of a portrait of the great rebel writer Jean Genet. Alongside Giacometti&apos;s works is a parallel exhibition of installations by James Coleman, which might be far less frenetic in approach, yet, through a series of enigmatic sound-and-image tableau vivants, perhaps evoke comparable dilemmas. RC \u00b7 Compton Verney, to Jun 1 Lucy Skaer, London A solo show for the Beck&apos;s Futures-nominated artist known for her restrained acts of defiance. Her understated drawings and subtle interventions on the urban landscape may appear slight, but pack a sizeable political punch. In the past Lucy Skaer has secretly bred butterflies in The Old Bailey as an exotic subversion of the legal process. She also placed a diamond next to a live scorpion on an Amsterdam pavement as a comment on the corrupt diamond trade. Her drawings have a similar appeal. Using photographs taken from press reports, she has deconstructed images of dead bodies, reworking them into fragmented patterns or mirror images that look like Rorschach inkblot tests. JL \u00b7 Chisenhale Gallery, E3, Wed 26 to May 4 Samantha Clark/Nick Cobb, Llandudno &quot;I&apos;ve lived in and strolled down or traipsed the streets of Peckham for the past 20 years,&quot; states Nick Cobb. Here he presents his reflections on a south London street, appropriately bookended by Mothercare at one end and Funeral Care at the other. Rummaging in the skips and bins of Peckham and Camberwell, Cobb reclaims the raw materials for his street-scene recreations. These are then photographed to imbue their model scrappiness with a convincing air of film-still theatricality. In contrast are film fragments by Samantha Clark, mapping what she refers to as the &quot;subtle ether&quot;, the in-between somewhere that might escape the precise circumscriptions of scientific and workaday communications. RC \u00b7 Oriel Mostyn Gallery, Sat 22 to Apr 12 S Mark Gubb, Leicester Fast becoming recognised as one of the foremost mischief-makers of the British contemporary art scene, S Mark Gubb presents Here Today, Gone Tomorrow, a playfully deadpan installation referencing, as he puts it, &quot;the history of walls that have dominated the 20th century, from Berlin to Belfast, Palestine and Nicosia&quot;. Gubb comes on half childishly irreverent and half deadly serious, mixing up hints of political disillusionment and calls for nonconformist subversion in forms borrowed from heavy metal memorabilia, horror film melodrama and the apocalyptic pronouncements of backwater religious cults. The gallery is subdivided by a 5&apos;7&quot; wall, featuring on one side a pile of blank placards, and on the other a garish poster (pictured). Elsewhere there&apos;s a light installation, apparently based on a drawing by the artist&apos;s niece, plaintively titled Somewhere Over the Rainbow. RC \u00b7 The City Gallery, to Apr 26 Set In Stone, London Etchings of imaginary prisons by the 18th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi have a spectral influence on modern culture. They resonate in HG Wells&apos;s War Of The Worlds in the new world visions of the subterranean dreamer and raise their murky head in the gothic nightmare of HR Giger. Emily Allchurch reconstructs Piranesi&apos;s dungeons but updates them for the modern world with requisite CCTV cameras, razor wire and warning signs. The collages feature in Set In Stone, a group show inspired by buildings that have a utopian sensibility. From Piranesi&apos;s cavernous hell to Michael Durning&apos;s portraits of neglected monuments in Scotland, the exhibition captures man&apos;s idealism in architecture. All things considered, Pitzhanger Manor-House - Sir John Soane&apos;s Grade I listed &quot;dream house&quot; in Ealing - really couldn&apos;t be more appropriate a setting in the circumstances. JL \u00b7 PM Gallery And House, W5, Fri 28 to Apr 26", "sentences": ["She also placed a diamond next to a live scorpion on an Amsterdam pavement as a comment on the corrupt diamond trade."], "title": "Exhibitions preview", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/22/exhibition.art3", "tags": ["Exhibitions", "Art", "Culture", "Art and design", "Alberto Giacometti"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-22T01:43:02Z", "article": "Nick Clegg&apos;s family history was &quot;torn and reshaped by the great wars and upheavals of the 20th century,&quot; he recently told the Liberal Democrats&apos; spring conference. His paternal grandmother was a Russian exile, driven out of her homeland by the Bolshevik revolution; his Dutch mother spent part of her childhood in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Indonesia. With the kind of gently patriotic flourish that is currently all the political rage, he said that they both found a home in the UK &quot;because ours is a nation of tolerance, freedom and compassion.&quot; On the face of it, the new(ish) leader of the Lib Dems is steeped in the ways of the modern political class: educated - as was his recent leadership adversary Chris Huhne - at Westminster School, propelled from there to Cambridge, and gifted with an urbane political style of the Tony Blair/David Cameron school. But his backstory is full of more exotic details: not just his ancestry, but the undergraduate years in which he specialised in social anthropology, his Spanish wife and bilingual children, and the fact that he himself speaks five languages. In his grimly chintzy Westminster office, staffed by his young and mostly female aides, he still doesn&apos;t quite fit: it&apos;s the second time I&apos;ve spoken to him in situ, and he still has something of the air of an enthusiastic interloper. At least some of this incongruity seems to be down to Clegg&apos;s Dutch roots. Throughout his childhood, his family would spend &quot;every single holiday&quot; in Huizen, a modestly sized town half an hour from Amsterdam. When he&apos;s with his mother, they converse in her native language (he can also manage Spanish, &quot;rusty&quot; German and French). He is, he tells me, &quot;quite Dutch, culturally speaking.&quot; Which means what?  &quot;Low church,&quot; he says. &quot;Quite Calvinistic, in some respects. It&apos;s akin to Presbyterianism north of the border. Not keen on ostentatiousness. Quite blunt. Perhaps not always very diplomatic.&quot; And very liberal with it, one assumes. &quot;Yes, but Dutch liberalism is actually very interesting. Dutch society is very liberal in one sense, but it&apos;s actually quite moralistic and austere in another. There&apos;s this very literal view of what liberalism should be about. It&apos;s very in your face: sex should be in your face, drugs should be in your face, and the Dutch are very keen on this idea that you should say anything you want. But at the same time, you&apos;ve got this side of Dutch society which is quite suburban, neat, and very consensual.&quot; At the risk of sounding a little pat, one can make out similar tensions in the Clegg leadership project. By way of avenging the inertia of the Ming Campbell period, he has vowed to stick to a &quot;high-risk strategy&quot; of pushing the Lib Dems into confrontational positions, as seen in his pledge to face prosecution rather than sign up for an ID card, and the much-mocked Commons walk-out after the Speaker refused to allow a debate on Lib Dem proposals for a watershed in-or-out referendum on the EU. When one in five of his MPs rebelled against their new leader&apos;s instruction to abstain from the referendum vote, and three of his frontbench team resigned, there was talk of an early crisis in his leadership. How did that feel? &quot;Fine,&quot; he says. &quot;It genuinely did. I&apos;m very pragmatic about these things. I had three simple objectives. Firstly, to minimise the degree of dissent within my parliamentary party, which is the responsibility of leaders. Secondly, to make it absolutely clear that we disagree strongly with the Conservative view that a very modest, and frankly rather obscure treaty merited a referendum - and thirdly, to highlight our alternative proposal for an in-or-out referendum. I haven&apos;t had a second thought that the best option of several unappetising ones was the one that I took.&quot;  At the same time, however, as showing an unwillingness to take easy, compromise options, Clegg has been pulling against some of his party&apos;s more left-leaning instincts, claiming they are now &quot;equidistant&quot; from Labour and the Tories, and embracing policy ideas - particularly on health and education - that superficially place him close to that bland right-of-centre consensus whereby all three parties talk about choice and aspiration, but the dull reality is large swathes of the public realm being handed over to private interests. In an attention-grabbing speech this year, for example, Clegg proposed a generation of &quot;free schools&quot;, to be liberated from interference by local authorities, and run by &quot;suitable sponsors&quot;. When it comes to the health service, he has suggested operations should be subject to a guaranteed waiting time - which, if exceeded, would result in the NHS paying for a patient to go private. The political editor of the Spectator has been heard enthusing about how Clegg &quot;continues to say the right things&quot;, and seems to be on the side of &quot;small government&quot; and &quot;classic liberalism&quot;. If today&apos;s conversation is anything to go by, things are actually a little more complicated. His &quot;free schools&quot; sound like a turbocharged version of the current government&apos;s academies, but he insists he&apos;s in favour of &quot;quite heavy-handed state intervention in the basic architecture of the education system&quot;, excluding Whitehall from decisions about sponsors, and proposals - cribbed from Holland - for children from deprived backgrounds to receive greater funding than the more well-off.  Still, I wonder whether he might be on a sticky wicket. As much as he talks about his ideas with reference to the more social-democratic countries of Europe, his rhetoric easily blurs into the same kind of marketisation and commercialising of schools and hospitals you hear advocated by ultra-Blairites (and, these days, allies of Gordon Brown), and the Cameroons, doesn&apos;t it? At this point, he sounds annoyed. &quot;What&apos;s marketising about it? What&apos;s commercialising about it? Shouldn&apos;t we be learning directly from the most socially progressive societies on the planet? I just don&apos;t get it. I just don&apos;t understand the kind of neurosis among some parts of the progressive wing of British politics who are not prepared to learn. This isn&apos;t theoretical. It&apos;s not from a book. This is taken from societies that are delivering greater equality, greater social mobility, greater life chances for children who need it most.&quot;  But there are contradictions. Clegg shares a very British tendency to want to ape the outcomes of Denmark, Sweden, Holland et al while somehow avoiding their rates of taxation. In his spring conference speech, he said his party should &quot;never stop thinking about how we make taxes fairer, greener and - if possible - lower.&quot; But for as long as the UK clings to the idea that taxation is usually a burden we&apos;re not going to make much progress, are we? &quot;Hang on a minute,&quot; he says. &quot;Lower taxes, particularly for people on low incomes, is a socially progressive thing to do. I&apos;m proud of the fact that we&apos;re the only party in British politics that&apos;s advocating a 4p cut in the basic rate of income tax. And we&apos;ve been very outspoken as a party about wanting aggressively to close loopholes for the super-rich. On the non-dom debate, we&apos;ve said that rather than a fleabite of \u00a330,000, after seven years here, you should pay taxes like any British citizen. On capital gains tax, we&apos;re the only party in British politics saying that there&apos;s a simple principle at stake: that capital and income should be taxed at the same rate.&quot; On this score, I try one last argument. Holland has a top tax rate of 52%; Denmark, 62.3%. Yet under Ming Campbell&apos;s leadership, the Lib Dems binned their policy of a 50% band for people earning over \u00a3100,000, a move Clegg enthusiastically supported. Advocates of the policy claim it would bring in at least \u00a34.5bn a year, but he&apos;s having none of it. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t produce the money that we initially thought,&quot; he claims. &quot;And it would lead to behavioural change - in effect, tax evasion - which would lower the tax take altogether. We concluded, quite rightly, that we are not in the business of using the tax system for gesture politics if it doesn&apos;t actually do the business.&quot; Just about everything Clegg says comes with a firm thump of conviction. When I ask why he didn&apos;t just go for a free vote on Europe he offers two reasons. &quot;Out of principle, I passionately disagree with the idea that Europe, which is one of the core issues of identity for the Liberal Democrats, should suddenly mutate into something like abortion, and become a matter of individual conscience. And it would have created - and how can I put this politely? - a dispersal of Lib Dem votes that would have made the division of the vote on the abstention look like a model of unity.&quot; But as I leave his office, I can&apos;t quite shake off an uneasy feeling. He&apos;s centrist yet confrontational; praised by neo-Thatcherites, yet awed by Scandinavian social democracy; a new kind of Lib Dem, but a leader still in thrall to their old habit of taking contributions from both sides of the argument. You might like to think of it as the political equivalent of going Dutch.", "sentences": ["Throughout his childhood, his family would spend &quot;every single holiday&quot; in Huizen, a modestly sized town half an hour from Amsterdam."], "title": "Interview: John Harris meets Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/22/nickclegg.liberaldemocrats", "tags": ["Nick Clegg", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-22T10:40:31Z", "article": "\u00b7 I am acquainted with very few bankers, though it&apos;s clear that many of them combine so much greed and stupidity that if they were doctors, we&apos;d all be dead. But the banker I know best is neither greedy nor stupid, so I asked him for his take on the crisis.  He said it resembled the great savings and loan scandal in the US &quot;when Reagan made it child&apos;s play for the most slow-witted conman to open a savings bank, rake in government-insured deposits, then lend the money to cronies - and to themselves. When the banks went bust, the government repaid the depositors, and the bankers (only a few went to jail) made regretful Rotary Club speeches about &apos;market forces&apos;. &quot;Looting the equity out of American homes was a way for the Bush administration to stimulate the economy without increasing inflation. After 9/11, government spending went into the Middle East sinkhole, which meant the only way the US could support the domestic economy was to turn the average American home into a sort of printing press, spewing out consumer dollars. The US economy marked its declining output and industrial base by selling increasingly worthless bonds to the Asian markets, in exchange for all the junk that was shipped direct from Shanghai to Wal-Mart.  &quot;It was a &apos;win-win&apos; situation for everyone except the home owner, who failed to understand the small print, which made him the chattel of companies like Bear Stearns - for whom homes were just safes to be cracked.&quot; And it wasn&apos;t much better here. Goodness knows what price we will all have to pay. \u00b7 I read the Daily Telegraph on how to manage in a downturn, and though the advice is meant for business people, I thought it might be useful for the rest of us. It suggests seven steps to survival. &quot;Offer vision,&quot; it says. &quot;Communicate the realities of the situation; provide stepping stones for changes ... keep the ship pointing in the direction you want to go. Cut supplier costs and prepare for different scenarios.&quot;  It sounds like inspiring stuff. But for the average family, I suspect it translates as: &quot;Here&apos;s my vision. We&apos;re screwed. The mortgage has doubled. This year&apos;s holiday will be a weekend in Skegness, from now on breakfast is own-brand Tesco cornflakes and supper is baked beans. You, young lady, will buy your clothes at Primark, and I don&apos;t care what your friends say.&quot;  \u00b7 The other day I found myself locked in a Swiss bank vault, which I vaguely felt was one of those experiences that everyone should try at least once in their life. I was staying with American friends in Geneva. The husband had been invited by a friend of his - who just happens to be a millionaire banker - to view his extraordinary collection of first editions of great works in science and philosophy.  We were ushered into the basement of his bank, through clanging steel grilles, and into the rows of deposit boxes, looking like the left luggage office in a very modern but deserted railway station. We were then locked in, which was slightly scary, though since these places are designed to survive a direct nuclear hit, perhaps not all that frightening. The books were astounding. The first edition of The Origin Of Species, unread and so perfect that our host wouldn&apos;t open it for fear of cracking the spine. First editions of essays by Montaigne and Montesquieu, plus Pascal&apos;s Pense\u00e9s and works by Descartes. Hobbes&apos;s Leviathan and Smith&apos;s The Wealth of Nations. Several books, including Plutarch&apos;s Lives, first printed by the Venetian printer Aldus, who toured Europe seeking manuscripts which he could produce in editions so beautiful and so well-made that they are in better condition than many books published last year.  The owner had had gorgeous and appropriately decorated boxes made for each book in Amsterdam. The collection was worth several million dollars, but it&apos;s impossible to say exactly how much. The world&apos;s best preserved copy of The Origin Of Species is worth what someone is prepared to pay, which might be \u00a3500,000, or more. We wondered, politely, if he didn&apos;t miss the fact that he can&apos;t actually read the books. But he can - he keeps reading copies at home, doubling his pleasure as he reflects that the real thing, the echt edition, is his possession and locked in a vault. I had a fantasy of an Ocean&apos;s 11-style raid, with guys swinging through the vault on carbon filaments, dodging the laser security beams, and stealing the first, vellum-bound edition of Bacon&apos;s essays. Try flogging that in the pub. \u00b7 Last week I mentioned the relish with which a French restaurant owner told us that at 1.35pm he had closed for lunch. Two days later, at 7.30am, I was at Gatwick. It was a vision of Gehenna. The big intercontinental flights had just landed so the place was heaving.  Extra security checks, which have ended the normal wave-through for British travellers, meant that we had to wait 20 minutes or so in the queue.  For the non-EU passengers, it was much more horrible and I could hear that same smug pleasure in the official&apos;s voice as he told them that they would probably have to wait an hour to get through. What a grisly welcome to our country. \u00b7 It is hard to remember, but a few years ago Heather Mills wasn&apos;t so unpopular. You could always tell what Middle England thought by the reaction to jokes on The News Quiz. One time, someone said, &quot;Paul McCartney is so upset by the terrible press his wife is getting, that he&apos;s bought her a plane for her birthday. But she insists she&apos;ll still use Immac on her other leg.&quot;  Utterly tasteless of course, but I bet the gag wouldn&apos;t be met with the same sharp, disapproving intake of breath that it got then. \u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday March 27 2008. The Venetian printer who toured Europe looking for manuscripts was Aldus (Manutius) and not, as we had it, Aldine. His printing house, established near the end of the 15th century, was called the Aldine Press.

Welcome to Everytown, by Julian Baggini (Granta \u00a38.99) The mission of philosophy writer and occasional Guardian columnist Julian Baggini to &apos;understand the English mind&apos; by living for six months in Rotherham, S66 (the postcode area that &apos;has the closest match of household types to the country as a whole&apos;) might seem to be as gimmicky as Wife Swap. But Baggini&apos;s skill lies in unpacking the &apos;belief systems&apos; of the English working classes and in analysing why &apos;they&apos; like what they do - Pizza Hut, the Daily Mail, Mallorca, Radio 2 and (plead guilty, but with irony, warns Baggini) Dan Brown - without bitchiness and without turning the popular into the quirky. Baggini&apos;s analysis has potentially far-reaching implications for everyone; like sheep which have learnt to keep themselves within an unfenced area, he says, &apos;we all have our hefts&apos;. The Hottentot Venus, by Rachel Holmes (Bloomsbury \u00a38.99) Charles Williams&apos;s 1811 illustration of Saartjie Baartman shows a naked woman dressed only in tribal jewellery, smoking a pipe, a small white infant perching on her exaggeratedly large behind. This was one of many adverts plastered about Piccadilly Circus for the Hottentot Venus, a specimen &apos;just arrived from the Interior of Africa&apos;. But the picture also inadvertently reveals Baartman&apos;s past in Cape Colony as a wet nurse for an English child, after the death of her own baby. In this sensitive and powerful biography, Holmes exposes the ways in which Baartman and her image have been manipulated to suit various ends over the years, from the 19th-century obsession with &apos;ethnology&apos; to Nelson Mandela&apos;s attempts in 1994 to bring home her skeleton from the Museum of Mankind in Paris. Other People&apos;s Money, by Neil Forsyth with Elliot Castro (Pan Macmillan \u00a37.99) &apos;Wrestling it down to 3,000 words had been a depressing task,&apos; writes journalist Neil Forsyth of the interview he had written on 21-year-old credit-card fraudster Elliot Castro for Maxim magazine. So, because Forsyth hates a word count, he wrote an entire book. The preposition &apos;with&apos; is used to show that this is Castro&apos;s tale, but Forsyth clearly enjoyed shaping the trickster&apos;s confident monologue with an array of less than subtle literary devices (ellipses for suspense) and unnecessary asides to the reader. Castro&apos;s childhood is described with the tedious detail of a patient&apos;s self-analysis, but things liven up a little when he gets really swipe-happy, a relief for readers, only countered by a feeling of paranoia. But you can&apos;t help but feel that this young boy&apos;s tall tale needs some cutting down to size.", "sentences": ["His patient, labyrinthine journey, via trains, taxis and meandering walks that weave from his hometown Amsterdam to Sarajevo, often constitutes the most revealing excavation, &apos;like peeling off layers of old paint&apos;."], "title": "Non-fiction: Mar 23", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/23/features.review3", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-24T00:04:36Z", "article": "The website where Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders was promoting his not-yet-released anti-Qur&apos;an film has been suspended by its US hosting service.

In Coventry, the Swallow Sidecar and Coach building company, which in 1935 had produced the SS Jaguar, decided, not surprisingly, that Jaguar was probably a better badge for its vehicles than SS Cars. One of the world&apos;s greatest names in upmarket cars was born. As Jaguar was changing its spots, two Rover executives were roaring round a farm in Anglesey in an American Jeep. The Wilks brothers are said to have drawn a series of lines in the sand, presumably with the odd curve and circle, and Land Rover was born. It was not until the 1948 Amsterdam motor show, however, that the marque was unveiled. Jaguar and Land Rover provided a sharp contrast in postwar Britain. Land Rover was a pioneer in the use of aluminium, a metal now favoured by Jaguar as it seeks to reduce weight and fuel consumption. In Land Rover&apos;s case, it was simply the shortage of steel. It has been a work-a-day, adaptable vehicle; a workhorse rather than a Chelsea tractor. Since the launch in 1948, Land Rovers have served as fire engines, ambulances, and hydraulic platforms, and have helped in maintenance of the London Underground. Land Rover provided John Paul II with a popemobile during his 1982 UK visit. Nor should its military service be overlooked. In 1959, the 250,000th Land Rover rolled off the Solihull production lines and, by 1966, the year England won the World Cup, Land Rover was celebrating its own triumph - its 500,000 vehicle. That same year, Jaguar, always the playboy to Land Rover&apos;s farm hand, gave up its independence to merge with the British Motor Corporation to form British Motor Holdings. Jaguar had developed a reputation for style, embodied in perhaps its most famous model, the E-type. It was launched in 1961 and was surely one of the enduring symbols of the swinging sixties. The merger with the British Motor Corporation, which included Austin and Morris, was followed by a marriage which first brought Land Rover and Jaguar under the same corporate roof. In 1968, BMC joined Britain&apos;s other automotive heavyweight, Leyland, the owner of Rover and Triumph, to form British Leyland. It was, according to critics, part of a trend to merge the good and the bad of Britain&apos;s motor industry to produce an industry champion which was more than the sum of its parts. By 1975 it was clear the good and the bad had merely created the ugly: an industry riven by poor industrial relations, ineffectual management and heavy losses. Chuck in the odd oil crisis, inflation and the three-day week and British Leyland was heading for the financial scrap heap. At this stage, Margaret Thatcher, worship of the market and monetarism were four years away. Back then, matters were arranged differently, and the government simply took the whole shooting match into public ownership. It hadn&apos;t been all bad news. Land Rover may never have had Jaguar&apos;s glamour, but it has always had its glamorous fans, including film stars such as Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas, as well as Fidel Castro. In 1970 it decided to put the glamour on a more commercial footing, introducing the upmarket Range Rover, a vehicle capable of travelling off road and hitting a top speed of almost 100mph on it. In 1978, Michael Edwardes, the sometimes abrasive industrialist brought in to sort out British Leyland, gave Land Rover an independent operating company, though it remained under the British Leyland umbrella. Further change was on the way. Thatcher&apos;s sale of the &quot;family silver&quot;, as Harold Macmillan dubbed her privatisation programme, included Jaguar. Life on the stock market proved short-lived, with Ford buying the business for \u00a31.6bn in 1990. Land Rover was also under new ownership, the government having passed the buck to British Aerospace, now known as BAE Systems, by selling it what had become the Rover Group. The game of corporate pass the parcel continued when, in 1994, BAe flogged Rover to BMW, where the UK car group&apos;s subsequent performance earned it the soubriquet of &quot;the English patient&quot;. Six years later, Jaguar and Land Rover were reunited when BMW decided it had had enough of Rover and its executives and sold Land Rover to Ford. Jaguar and Land Rover were put together under Ford&apos;s Premier Automotive Group (PAG), which included Sweden&apos;s Volvo and Aston Martin. Since then, Jaguar and Land Rover have become ever more closely linked, including sharing production at the Halewood plant on Merseyside. Even under the umbrella of one of the world&apos;s leading car makers, life has been hard. In 2004, Jaguar halted production at its Browns Lane plant in Coventry as part of a programme under which 1,100 jobs were cut. Cost cutting and new investment may have helped turn PAG round but it looks as if it has come too late. Ford, engaged in pushing through a huge restructuring programme in the US, sold Aston Martin to a Middle East-backed consortium last year. Now Jaguar and Land Rover are heading for new ownership, too. The buyer Tata, the company poised to buy Land Rover and Jaguar for some $2bn, is one of the largest companies in India. It has a market capitalisation of $56bn and employs nearly 300,000 people in more than 80 countries. It owns 98 companies operating in a range of sectors from informations systems and communications, to engineering and chemicals. Although it bought the well-known Tetley Tea brand in 2000, Tata has extensive interests in heavy industry and won what became a very expensive race last year to buy the British steelmaker Corus for \u00a36.7bn. That deal made Tata the fifth-biggest steel producer in the world and was hailed as a milestone marking the arrival of Indian business on the world stage, but caused a slump in shares after investors thought it had overpaid. It is also a significant car manufacturer and has produced what it claims is the world&apos;s cheapest production vehicle, the ultra-compact Nano, which retails for \u00a31,250.", "sentences": ["It was not until the 1948 Amsterdam motor show, however, that the marque was unveiled."], "title": "On the road: the playboy and the farmhand", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/26/automotive", "tags": ["Jaguar Land Rover", "Automotive industry", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-26T16:04:43Z", "article": "Jamie Hince is getting married!

Apart from sit here and wait for the inevitable story about the pair breaking up after a late-night serenade performed by Pete Doherty in pantaloons. Speaking of Pete, he&apos;s back in the papers today, stumbling out of Amy Winehouse&apos;s front door. Amy, you&apos;ll recall, moved house from Bow back to north London recently, apparently to distance herself from any narcotic temptation. And yet there he is, in person. This fact, alongside pretty nasty close-up photos of Amy&apos;s face covered in scabs (on page 7 of the Sun), appears to suggest that things are not all hunky dory in Winehouse World (or indeed on Planet Doherty). The Sun reports that Amy&apos;s people believe the scabs to be the result of a dose of impetigo. Sun doctor Carol Cooper, however, believes that &quot;the damage ... is not unusual with crack cocaine abuse. She&apos;s got a number of sores, some of which look infected and others that have formed ulcers.&quot; As for Doherty, 3am are concerned over his &quot;minging mitts&quot; (dirty hands to you and me).

The airport&apos;s operator, BAA, and airline British Airways, for whom the showcase terminal has been built after years of planning, had hoped the new facility would mean a fresh start for Heathrow. But baggage problems forced BA to cancel 34 flights into and out of the terminal and passengers suffered waits of up to two hours for their luggage. The arrivals lounge was also brought to a standstill as a flash-mob of 250 environmental campaigners descended on the terminal, with eco-warriors doing the conga in front of police, passengers and airport staff. Hundreds of BA customers were forced to wait for more than an hour for their bags, with flights from Basel, Amsterdam, Stuttgart, Munich and Hamburg among those affected.  Airport sources said the BA delays were caused by a &quot;resource issue&quot;, meaning that, in effect, baggage handling teams were not in the right place to collect bags from recently arrived planes.  There were also &quot;teething problems&quot; with car parking provision, delays in staff security screening and &quot;staff familiarisation with the terminal,&quot; BA admitted, although it said the situation was improving into the afternoon. It refused to say how many passengers were affected by the baggage delays, although is likely to run into thousands. The 34 cancelled flights represent almost 10% of the total in and out of the new terminal today. BAA apologised to passengers after a technical error saw three flights to Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Brussels take off without their passengers&apos; bags. Jason Chiswell, a passenger on the first inbound Stuttgart flight of the day, had to wait nearly two hours for his luggage. &quot;The whole area in there is full of people waiting for bags,&quot; he said. German-based Briton Kate Adamson, 39, travelling from Frankfurt with her daughter Olivia, five, gave up on her luggage after waiting more than an hour-and-a-half.  Visiting her parents in Maidenhead, Berkshire, Adamson said: &quot;I am furious. We had a 50-minute flight from Frankfurt and then we had a 90-minute wait.  &quot;The luggage system seemed to have packed up completely. Staff have been really surly and there has been no announcement. One BA woman in there was saying there was a technical problem. I&apos;ve given up. They can send my bags on.&quot;  Henrik Moeller, a Danish passenger on a flight from Hamburg said: &quot;It took in excess of one hour from landing, no explanation.&quot; He said during the flight he had read BA&apos;s in-flight magazine, which promised T5 would rehabilitate the airline&apos;s tarnished reputation for baggage handling. &apos;Baggage performance issues&apos; BAA said the baggage system itself was working perfectly and referred enquiries to BA, which runs the baggage system computer and oversees all baggage handling. BA had promised the new system would halve the number of bag delays and losses at the airline, which are the worst of any major European carrier. The airline said there had been &quot;a few minor problems&quot; including &quot;baggage performance issues&quot;.  &quot;This is not unexpected following one of the most complex and largest airport moves in history,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;These teething problems have included car parking provision, delays in staff security screening and staff familiarisation with the terminal.&quot;  The problems were being resolved, BA said. &quot;Overall, customers have given us a very positive reaction to Terminal 5, which we know will be a resounding success.&quot; The flash-mob protest, which started at 11am, passed off peacefully as passengers waited for their luggage. Hundreds of members of the public milled in front of a Costa Coffee stand and peeled off their tops to reveal red &quot;stop airport expansion&quot; T-shirts. The protest was led by three-year-old Esme Needham, from Hastings, who danced in front of dozens of photographers and TV crews. To loud cheers, other flash-mobbers then performed a conga around the arrivals lounge on T5&apos;s ground floor before lying on the ground to create a human &quot;stop number three&quot; sign, referring to plans for a third runway at the airport. One of the protesters, Richard George, was taking part after his recent headline-grabbing protest on top of the Houses of Parliament. George, 27, said: &quot;We are here to say this is the last expansion, the last new terminal we want to see at Heathrow or in the UK.&quot; Martin MacDonald, 77, a freelance business consultant and local resident attending with his 74-year-old wife Monique, said: &quot;My wife and I have 11 grandchildren and we want them to grow up with a good future.&quot; The protest passed without serious incident, barring a number of stop-and-searches by Metropolitan police officers.  Heathrow has become a focal point for British climate-change activists after Greenpeace protesters climbed on to a BA jet last month, followed days later by members of the anarchist group Plane Stupid climbing on top of the House of Commons. &quot;There will be all sorts of actions from now on,&quot; said George, a founding member of Plane Stupid.", "sentences": ["Hundreds of BA customers were forced to wait for more than an hour for their bags, with flights from Basel, Amsterdam, Stuttgart, Munich and Hamburg among those affected.", "BAA apologised to passengers after a technical error saw three flights to Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Brussels take off without their passengers&apos; bags."], "title": "T5 launch marred by delays and cancellations", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/27/theairlineindustry.britishairwaysbusiness1", "tags": ["Airline industry", "British Airways", "UK news", "Business", "Travel", "Environment", "Travel & leisure", "Travel and transport", "Environmental activism", "Heathrow", "Transport", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-28T00:50:11Z", "article": "Dutch MP Geert Wilders released a film critical of Islam yesterday, setting verses of the Qur&apos;an against images of terror attacks. The 15-minute film, entitled Fitna - strife or division - was posted on the internet, and shortly afterwards segments were rebroadcast by TV channels.  The government had warned Wilders, leader of the righwing Party for Freedom, the film could cause violent protests in Islamic countries, as did cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad two years ago.  &quot;The film equates Islam with violence. We reject this,&quot; the prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, told TV. &quot;We ... regret that Mr Wilders has released this film. We believe it serves no other purpose than to cause offence.&quot; Initially, Dutch TV refused to broadcast the film, and Wilders had difficulty finding an internet platform. It shows statements from radical clerics and cites Qur&apos;anic verses interspersed with images from attacks including the 9/11 attack in 2001, the 2004 attack in Spain, and the murder later in 2004 of Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh.  It begins and ends with one of the cartoons portraying Muhammad. Then there comes the sound of a page being torn; subtitles told the viewer it was from a phone book, because &quot;it&apos;s not up to me, but the Muslims to tear the hate-sowing pages out of the Qur&apos;an&quot;. Wilders told reporters that he had made the film because &quot;Islam and the Qur&apos;an are dangers to the preservation of freedom in the Netherlands in the long term, and I have to warn people of that. It&apos;s five minutes before midnight and this is the last warning as far as I&apos;m concerned.&quot; Early reactions were muted. Yusuf Altuntas, of the Contact Group Muslims and Government, said he believed that Wilders &quot;is seeking the limits, but not crossing the line. For Mr Wilders, this is quite subtle.&quot; The film was not as jarring as had been anticipated, said Maurits Berger, professor of Islam in the West at Leiden University. &quot;It&apos;s images and photos, headlines from recent years we already know about.&quot;  In fact, the film told more about Wilders than it did about the Qur&apos;an, Berger argued. &quot;It represents his fear of Islam.&quot;  It was released the evening before a judge was due to hear a Muslim group seeking an independent review to decide whether the film violates hate speech laws. The Dutch Islamic Federation was asking the court to impose a fine of \u20ac50,000 (\u00a339,000) every day the film continues to be available for public view. Mohamed Rabbae, of the moderate National Moroccan Council, had appealed for calm in January when the film was discussed before release. Yesterday he had yet to see the film, but felt &quot;this is less bad than we thought he was going to do&quot;, but nevertheless it gave the impression the Qur&apos;an justifies violence, &quot;and that is really wrong&quot;.

Photograph: Marcel Hemelrijk/EPA &quot;Magic,&quot; so the saying goes, &quot;is a disappearing art.&quot; It is certainly the case that magicians are becoming an increasingly rare sight in public. Derren Brown&apos;s upcoming appearance at the Garrick theatre only highlights how unusual it normally is to see a professional prestidigitator plying their trade outside of children&apos;s birthday parties or corporate functions. The days when Paul Daniels, Wayne Dobson, and Geoffrey Durham were regular faces on our TV sets are long gone. But while the form certainly seems to be disappearing, can it really be said to be an art? Adam Gopnik&apos;s recent article in the New Yorker seeks to argue that it can be. (It&apos;s not yet online, but you can listen to his podcast about magic.) Luxurious in its length and quite beautifully written, it is a paean to the strange and, by its nature, secretive world of the contemporary conjuror. It cogitates upon our need for mystery and explores the nature of why we can find being fooled by a man whom we know to be deliberately deceiving us so entertaining. A significant part of Gopnik&apos;s argument is that magic is unique among the arts for the fact that a truly great performer seeks to conceal their skill when doing a trick, rather than explicitly demonstrating it as a great actor or painter might. There is some truth in this. Yet it should go without saying that there is a good deal more than mere technical skill to great art. In many ways, a magician is essentially a novelty performer as he is rarely capable of ever doing more than simply outfoxing his audience for a brief moment. I spent all of my teenage years (and quite a few before that) as a magician, but it now seems to me that the essential triviality of this kind of entertainment can be directly linked to the suffocatingly insular world of those who practice it. Just look at the Magic Circle. It was only as recently as 1991 that it chose to admit women. Before then, it was argued that women could not keep secrets. Even now, only around 70 of its 1500 members are female. Magicians are so obsessively secretive about how they do their tricks that they end up spending virtually their whole time simply speaking to and imitating each other. And those new to the craft have little choice but to imbibe what their elders tell them. You only have to drop in on the biennial Young Magician of the Year competition to see this. Many of the contestants are identikit versions of each other, performing extremely similar routines sometimes with great skill, but rarely with any particular originality or flair. The few magicians who do break out of this hermetic bubble and whose work might be considered to have some artistic merit often end up being more famous for not doing magic. Penn and Teller are notorious for apparently revealing how their tricks are done. David Blaine, for all his furrowed-brow egocentrism, is much better known, now, for his experiments in physical endurance than his card tricks. Great art should, surely, aim to reach into our emotional core. It should challenge or transform our view of the world. Yet magicians are so often focused on the question of how something is done, that they rarely ever look up from their deck of cards to ask why they are doing it in the first place.", "sentences": ["Dutch magician Hans Klok presents his show The Beauty of Magic in Amsterdam."], "title": "That's magic!

Warning there would be further disruption this afternoon and into the weekend, Walsh said: &quot;I am accepting responsibility that the buck stops with me.&quot; But, asked if he was considering his own position, he said: &quot;No, I am not. I am going to make this work.&quot; He added: &quot;It was definitely not our finest hour. Maybe we set our expectations too high. We clearly made mistakes but I am absolutely determined to make this work.&quot; Walsh also admitted today that the flag-carrier&apos;s full move to T5 could be pushed back beyond its April 30 deadline because of the disastrous opening. In an interview with theguardian.com, he said: &quot;We are going to review the T4 move [but] at this point I am still working on the basis that the move will go ahead. We have got to look and satisfy ourselves that any of the problems that we have encountered get resolved.&quot;  If the full move were to be delayed, it could put BA on a collision course with other airlines, which want to expand their operations into the space vacated at T4. BA cancelled 78 flights today after an conducting an emergency MOT of its baggage handling operations last night, in a bid to avoid a repeat of yesterday&apos;s disastrous opening. It said tonight a further 54 flights would be cancelled tomorrow. Airline sources said staff had gone through the luggage system with a &quot;fine toothcomb&quot; overnight to find out what caused the collapse of the operation, disrupting travel plans for thousands of passengers and tarnishing the reputation of Britain&apos;s flag carrier. Staff also cleared 6,000 bags from T5&apos;s overloaded baggage system last night, allowing BA to lift a blanket restriction on check-in luggage. However, long queues formed in the T5 departure lounge this morning after check-in desks opened 45 minutes late due to the baggage clearing. A line of several hundred passengers formed at BA&apos;s rebooking desk this morning as the first wave of cancellations hit customers.  Duncan Harvey, 38, an IT professional whose flight to Amsterdam was scrapped, said: &quot;It&apos;s extremely inconvenient because it&apos;s a business trip and I am imagining, looking at the queue, that I will not be able to get on the next flight. The size of the queue does not bode well.&quot;  Passengers arriving to get flights with images of yesterday&apos;s chaos in their minds warned that an ongoing baggage crisis was unacceptable. &quot;Perhaps they have mended the elastic band by now,&quot; said Alan Bowman, 71, who was travelling to Bucharest. &quot;I hope that people were beavering overnight. They have had an opportunity to at least get it up and running and not have to cancel too many flights.&quot; It is understood that BA operations managers, who oversee the baggage operation, have scrutinised the mechanics and software of the state-of-the-art system and how staff use it. BA admitted that &quot;familiarity&quot; with the new terminal, or actually getting bags and baggage handlers from A to B, had played a role in yesterday&apos;s problems. The overnight inquest also looked closely at how luggage was loaded on and off the airplanes - one of the biggest failures in yesterday&apos;s fiasco. A BA spokesman added that extra staff had been brought in to T5 this morning from across the business. &quot;We have worked tirelessly through the night and we have got volunteers from across the business today to help customers and assist behind the scenes.&quot; BA confirmed that at least 78 out of today&apos;s 380 flights operating in and out of T5 will be cancelled, giving BA more time to restore the baggage operation and giving it room to deal with further problems.

Airways", "Business", "Transport", "Travel & leisure", "Travel", "Heathrow"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-03-28T15:30:00Z", "article": "London&apos;s Heathrow airport accounts for nearly half of the passenger traffic between North America and Europe. It is the hub that connects London with the rest of the world. Yet Heathrow is also hated by travellers. On almost every measure of service quality, London&apos;s main airport is the pits. It suffers the worst flight delays, loses the most bags and generally subjects passengers to the greatest stress and hassle with its endless security queues, rude staff and shoddy facilities. It has become a national embarrassment and its owner (BAA, the dominant British airport operator that also runs the two other main London airports, Gatwick and Stansted) an object of loathing. Despite the &quot;teething troubles&quot; of this week&apos;s opening, the \u00a34.3bn Terminal 5 may eventually improve conditions for British Airways&apos; customers, who represent about 40% of the airport&apos;s passengers. But neither T5 nor the plans to rebuild most of the other terminals over the next five years are the answer to Heathrow&apos;s biggest problem: a chronic lack of runway space. While other hub airports in western Europe have the luxury of four runways or more, Heathrow has only two, which operate within a whisker of full capacity. Heathrow can neither grow to meet demand nor deal with minor problems without them turning into very big ones. The solution favoured by the British government and the aviation industry is to build a third runway. Only by allowing Heathrow to expand, they say, can Britain have the globally competitive hub airport that the economy requires. A final decision has been promised before the summer. It looks like being the wrong one. The worst reason for not expanding Heathrow is concern about climate change. The inconvenient truth is that if Heathrow were to disappear, most of the airline traffic would just go elsewhere - there would be little or no global environmental benefit. But there are two overwhelming reasons for not going ahead with a bigger Heathrow, both of which stem from the airport&apos;s location, hemmed in, as it is, by housing and major roads. The first is that since the closure of Hong Kong&apos;s notorious Kai Tak airport a decade ago, it is doubtful whether any major world airport dumps its negative externalities on more people. Thanks to prevailing westerly winds and the east/west axis of its two runways, about 2 million people in west London and neighbouring satellite towns endure noise, local air pollution and the small, but ever-present risk of a catastrophic accident. By relaxing operating restrictions on Heathrow&apos;s existing runways, and by adding a third, BAA calculates that it can raise the number of flights from today&apos;s limit of 480,000 a year to 720,000. With the help of forecasts provided by BAA about the rate at which the noisiest, most polluting aircraft will be replaced by the airlines and measures to restrict road traffic near the airport, the government seems to have convinced itself that a 50% increase in flights is environmentally acceptable. That is a conclusion disputed by 15 councils in the areas affected, all four serious mayoral candidates and the government&apos;s own watchdog, the Environment Agency. The second reason the envisaged expansion of Heathrow is misguided is that it can never be what its promoters say Britain needs: a globally competitive hub airport. Passenger traffic forecasts suggest that within a very few years of a third runway opening in 2020, Heathrow will be full again. BAA has talked ominously about there being a need for a fourth runway in due course, but not even the most ardent Heathrow expanders can say where it would go, let alone the infrastructure to provide efficient ground access. In capacity terms, Heathrow will continue to be hopelessly out-gunned by the likes of Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt, all of which already have (or soon will have) twice the runway space, greater potential for expansion and far better surface transport links. Is there a better alternative? Almost certainly. Nearly every other developed country faced with a Heathrow-type problem has known that when you are in a hole it is better to stop digging. Time after time in country after country, hub airports have been rebuilt further away from city centres where they can grow while doing least environmental damage. Briefly, in the 1970s, before being overtaken by economic crisis, it was British government policy to build a big new airport in the Thames estuary to the east of London. A few years ago, a similar, but updated, proposal was rejected by the government - strongly influenced by BAA and BA, whose agenda it did not suit - as being too costly. There was no serious examination of the potential benefits of the proposal, which many experts still believe would be considerable. A more modest, market-led solution to Heathrow&apos;s overcrowding would be to allow the price for using the airport to reflect the value and scarcity of its capacity, while, at the same time, promoting competition with London&apos;s other airports. At present, the landing charges paid by the airlines using Heathrow and Gatwick (Britain&apos;s second-biggest airport) are fixed by the Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA acts like a utility regulator. It tries to strike a balance between customers who want the lowest possible prices and the need to allow the monopoly supplier a reasonable return after investing in the business. The CAA has just granted BAA the right to raise prices by inflation plus 7.5% each year for the next five years to help fund new terminals. Predictably, the same airlines that complain about the run-down facilities at the airport are furious. They would be even crosser if Heathrow were allowed to charge market-clearing prices. However, if such a change were to happen over time and was accompanied by a break up of BAA&apos;s monopoly, something another regulator, the Competition Commission, is actively considering, the need to expand Heathrow would be much less pressing. The new owner of Gatwick, which is much better placed to grow than Heathrow, would be strongly incentivised to build a second runway after 2019 (when an old planning agreement expires) and to develop the airport as an alternative hub by offering airlines keener prices and better service. It would be in a strong position to persuade one of the big airline alliances, which act as hubs within hubs, to escape from the long shadow that BA casts at Heathrow. Gatwick already has good surface transport links to London and can expand with far less environmental damage that Heathrow because planes are brought in over the channel and relatively sparsely populated farmland. Higher charges at Heathrow would tend to push the most price-sensitive transit and holiday passengers to other airports, the former to hubs elsewhere in Europe, the latter to other UK airports, especially Stansted, which should soon have a second runway. Transit passengers have grown from 9% of the total at Heathrow in 1992 to around 35% today, because it suits the business models of the airlines (especially BA) that want to feed passengers on to their lucrative long-haul routes. It also suits BAA because it is encouraged by the current regulatory framework to stuff as many passengers into the airport as possible rather than to care about service quality. The aviation industry claims that the loss of some of these passengers would mean a contraction of Heathrow&apos;s route network with a consequent reduction of &quot;connectivity&quot; to the economy. But in reality, transfer passengers bring very little in the way of wider economic benefit. Heathrow would still offer a wide number of routes, while catching a plane to Frankfurt or Paris would not significantly inconvenience those who wanted to travel to less frequented destinations. Crucially, for the business users who generate most economic value, Heathrow would become a more pleasant, less congested airport with fewer delays. The eventual need for a brand new airport, perhaps in the second half of the century, would not have gone away. But at least the government would have escaped from the hole it seems so intent on digging for itself.

The airline drafted in hundreds of extra staff and an emergency MOT of the luggage system yesterday, but it was unable to prevent one in five T5 flights from being scrapped, forcing Willie Walsh, BA&apos;s chief executive, to accept full responsibility for the debacle. In a personal apology to customers Walsh described the \u00a34.3bn building&apos;s botched debut as &quot;definitely not our finest hour&quot;.  But asked if he was considering his own position, he said: &quot;No, I am not. I am going to make this work.&quot;  Last night Walsh said there were &quot;still some problems to overcome&quot; but BA hoped to operate with fewer cancellations tomorrow. Politicians joined the criticism with David Cameron, the Tory leader, calling for an inquiry and warning that the &quot;humiliating&quot; events at T5 could hamper the argument for a third runway at Heathrow. Airline sources said staff had gone through the luggage system with a &quot;fine-tooth comb&quot; in an effort to find out what caused the collapse of the baggage handling operation and prevent a repeat of Thursday&apos;s scenes. Despite the cancellation of 78 flights in and out of T5 yesterday, airport sources said the luggage system was working &quot;a lot better&quot; yesterday as handlers benefited from fewer bags being checked in. &quot;They are starting to get to grips with the handling system,&quot; said one source. The scale of Thursday&apos;s baggage crisis, which brought the terminal to a near-standstill, became clear yesterday as it emerged that staff had cleared 6,000 bags from the overloaded system overnight, allowing BA to lift a blanket restriction on check-in luggage yesterday morning. But long queues formed in the T5 departure lounge immediately yesterday morning after check-in desks opened 45 minutes late due to the emergency overhaul of the baggage system. A queue of several hundred passengers formed at BA&apos;s rebooking desk by 7am as the first wave of cancellations hit customers. Duncan Harvey, 38, an IT professional whose flight to Amsterdam was scrapped, said: &quot;It&apos;s extremely inconvenient because it&apos;s a business trip and I am imagining, looking at the queue, that I will not be able to get on the next flight. The size of the queue does not bode well.&quot; Other passengers warned that a second day of baggage chaos would be unacceptable. &quot;Perhaps they have mended the elastic band by now,&quot; said Alan Bowman, 71, who was travelling to Bucharest. &quot;I hope that people were beavering overnight. They have had an opportunity to at least get it up and running and not have to cancel too many flights.&quot; The overnight BA inquest looked at how luggage was loaded on and off the airplanes - one of the biggest failures in Thursday&apos;s fiasco.  According to airport sources, the baggage hold-ups were caused by handling teams being in the wrong place to pick up checked-in bags, which had been delivered down chutes from the main conveyor belts.  If those bags are not picked up and loaded on to planes, the sources added, the chutes become full and the conveyor belt overloads.  A BA spokesman added that extra staff, including hundreds of volunteers, had been brought in to T5 to prevent the situation from worsening.  &quot;We have worked tirelessly through the night and we have got volunteers from across the business today to help customers and assist behind the scenes,&quot; the spokesman said. Passengers in the arrivals lounge were also complaining of baggage delays of more than an hour, with the baggage arrival system barely into its second day.  Anna Williams, from Pretoria, said: &quot;It&apos;s good to realise that this sort of thing doesn&apos;t only happen in Africa.&quot; David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: &quot;The shambles ... is yet another depressing chapter for the UK&apos;s crumbling transport system and sends a depressing message to businesses around the world.&quot;  The GMB union, which represents BA workers, asked the public not to take out their frustrations on BA staff who were &quot;doing their best to cope with what looks like technical difficulties&quot;. Seven steps to meltdown 1 It began almost immediately. The first baggage shift, starting at 4.30am, was delayed by a lack of staff spaces in a specially designated car park. Baggage handlers arrived late at the terminal&apos;s staff security checkpoint after being forced to park elsewhere. By this point, the first flight from Hong Kong was landing, and BA was already playing catch-up. 2 According to staff who arrived late at T5 after the car park saga, only one of the airport&apos;s employee security checkpoints was operating, and at one point 60 people were queuing to get through. The bottleneck, BAA&apos;s responsibility, was exacerbated by staff who arrived early to look around the terminal. 3 Once into the baggage sorting area, some staff were unable to log onto the computer system, which caused three flights to &quot;cut and run&quot; and fly off without bags - creating the first backlog of the day.  4 Simultaneously, BA baggage teams struggled with an automated system that, via handheld devices, told them which flight to unload and which flight to put bags onto. According to staff, the devices told handlers to sort bags for flights that were cancelled. This meant they turned up to load flights that were not there while, in other parts of the sorting area, bags piled up unattended.  5 Without managers on the ground to allocate work, there appeared to be a communication breakdown between handlers and their supervisors in the BA control centre. By midday 20 flights were cancelled as handlers tried to reduce T5&apos;s inaugural baggage mountain. 6 Throughout early morning and afternoon, two main factors contributed to the delays. According to industry sources, some baggage teams were disorientated despite months of training, and were late turning up at loading areas, which are spaced around the cavernous baggage area. Plus, there was a shortage of special storage bins that all bags must be put in before going onto planes - a new requirement for T5.  7 By 4pm, with too many bags, too few storage bins, an already clogged conveyor belt system and handling staff under severe pressure, all it took was a wave of new luggage to choke the system to a standstill. At 4pm a wave of passengers came to Terminal 5&apos;s departure hall and checked-in bags that were delivered by a lift system to the main conveyor belt area on the ground floor. The conveyor belt could not physically function within one hour, and ground to a halt as bags jammed the entire handling network. Minutes later, BA suspended all baggage check-in. It was, according to one observer, &quot;a case of the baggage computers saying &apos;No&apos;&quot;. Terminal decline T5 is not the first new international terminal to have suffered teething problems after opening with great fanfare. Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport opened its \u00a34.2bn T4, also designed by British architect Lord Rogers, two years ago. In the first two weeks there were delays in baggage handling and flights. The metro link to the terminal did not open for months. And when residents of neighbouring Las Castellenas complained that noise levels made their lives hell, authorities paid \u20ac6.6m (\u00a35.2m) to move 200 of them. Madrid airport is now the world&apos;s fastest-growing major aviation hub, handling 52 million passengers last year. But the size of the place has also gained the airport a bad reputation. Last year a British couple lost their dog and it was not found for weeks.  Graham Keeley \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday April 9 2008. It&apos;s fine-tooth comb, not fine toothcomb.

Drawing together the strands is Gopal Pandey, an illiterate, bespectacled chai seller innocently bobbing along on the tide of India&apos;s history. Through Pandey, Saraf skewers India&apos;s political upheavals, from Indira Gandhi&apos;s assassination in 1984 to the fateful, abortive general elections of 1996 and 1998. After fate hands him a fortune on the day of the killing, Pandey runs for political office, as the pimps, prostitutes and political puppet masters of Chandni Chowk swarm around him. Saraf&apos;s bumper novel can sometimes feel as crammed and chaotic as its bustling setting, and is occasionally monotonous, but the ambitious scope of his epic is remarkable. A Model World, by Michael Chabon (Harper Perennial \u00a37.99) Following his first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Michael Chabon produced this slender, charming collection of short stories, reissued now with his novels. It&apos;s tempting to imagine that Chabon was unknowingly warming up in these tales for the themes of his later books: university professors in sticky spots, adolescents in love, men in midlife crisis. Here, two competitive college buddies fall out over a girl neither of them cares about. A Jewish radio DJ sighs his way through an unhappy marriage. An academic pilfers someone else&apos;s material for his dissertation on the movement of clouds. By the end of the collection, the novelist in Chabon is already breaking out. He braids his final stories to form the picture of a single boy&apos;s childhood and his evocation of simple, adolescent longing is the most moving thing here. The Amnesiac, by Sam Taylor (Faber \u00a37.99) Thirty-year-old James Purdew is laid up in Amsterdam with a broken ankle. With time on his hands, he realises he can&apos;t remember his university days. (Is that something that just casually creeps up on you?) Perhaps, as this frustratingly inconclusive thriller reveals, there wasn&apos;t much to remember in the first place. Purdew travels back to his university town to find out the truth. Is he in a dream? Can he trust reality? Is it going to take us long to find out? Taylor tries to thicken the plot with irksome references to the nature of perception (Thomas de Quincey, Descartes and Borges are quoted insistently), but it&apos;s a little like trying to inject excitement into a film by having the protagonist watch a DVD of Spellbound. For a book about amnesia, Taylor evidently forgot to put in the plot. Too Close to Call, by Graeme Roe (Robinson \u00a36.99) The fourth instalment in Roe&apos;s series of &apos;paddock thrillers&apos; has star horse trainer Jay Jessop shunting up against a pleasingly nasty cast of underworld characters.

Icarus Mauros and Manfred Rozenberg are a pair of Las Vegas casino owners, trying to muscle in on Jessop&apos;s racecourse with the help of their pal Joey Costello. East End fixer Kipper Fish is keeping his ear to the ground in the shady world of insider betting. All this while the decent, champagne-loving National Hunt folk try to fend off the villains.

It is also used by healers and in ceremonial offerings to the gods. Pope John Paul II even drank coca tea on a visit to Bolivia in 1988. Now a UN body wants to ban it. The INCB (International Narcotics Control Board) has decided to crack down on the culture of coca among the Indian population of the Andes as part of the increasingly futile efforts to stem the flow of cocaine to western countries. According to the INCB report, &quot;Consuming the raw, unprocessed leaf abets the progression of drug dependence.&quot; No credible scientific evidence has been advanced to support this hotly-contested claim. The INCB recommendation that the UN should outlaw the plant has angered the indigenous peoples of the Andes and their governments. Bolivia and Peru view this decision taken in faraway Vienna by UN-appointed drug enforcement bureaucrats as totally out of touch with their culture and in conflict with the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The coca plant - which in the wrong hands can be turned into cocaine - also produces coca-tea, a mild stimulant rich in minerals and vitamins including calcium, phosphorus, iron as well as the vitamins A, E, B2 and other B complex vitamins Among its many therapeutic benefits, it is effective for altitude sickness in the Andean mountains and is an energy booster for fatigue. Native tribes in Peru and Bolivia traditionally used the leaves of the coca plant to treat all kinds of ailments and conditions ranging from dietary inadequacies to gastrointestinal disorders, patients affected by spells of nausea and chronic headaches. Coca tea is as much as part of the tribal life in the Andean regions as coffee is for Brazilians and Italians, and as other kinds of tea are for the English. Earlier this month, the judgement of INCB officials responsible for interpreting international drug conventions, was fiercely challenged for the first time in its history. Bolivian deputy foreign minister Hugo Fernandez delivered a feisty speech to the INCB assembly in Vienna attacking the cultural arrogance and insensitivity of the 13-member Vienna Narcotics Board, stressing that the coca leaf is not cocaine. The first-ever elected president from the indigenous peoples of the world, Bolivia&apos;s Evo Morales, blasted the INCB report as colonialist. Fernandez ended his speech to the assembled delegates by proclaiming in his native Quechua tongue: &quot;Long live the coca leaf!&quot; - and later in Spanish and English. The decision of the UN drug czars at INCB has huge implications. To outlaw the coca leaf is to criminalise millions of people in Bolivia and Peru, to overrule national laws in pursuit of US-driven &quot;war on drugs&quot;, and all of this without any justifiable scientific evidence. The Transnational Institute in Amsterdam which conducts research on drug policies and development has lambasted the INCB position. Martin Jelsma, TNI programme coordinator, declared that &quot;the inclusion of the coca leaf in schedule 1 of narcotic drugs of the 1961 convention was based on a study done back in 1950, inspired by colonialist and racist sentiments rather than science.: So why has the INCB called for all cultivation, consumption and trade in the coca plant and coca tea to be outlawed? The controversial decision is driven by ideology and politics, not by health issues or protection of the public. The first factor relates to the failure to stem the flow of cocaine in western capitals, despite the billions of dollars that various US governments have spent with Plan Colombia and Latin American drug wars. Most of the cocaine still flows from Colombia, not Bolivia and Peru. International studies, including one from Harvard University, say that raw coca is loaded with protein, calcium, iron and a range of vitamins. Bolivian President Evo Morales has recently announced plans to develop legal coca as a national resource, and using it to make everything from flour to toothpaste, shampoo and curative lotions and to export to the world. (Morales sent Fidel Castro a coca cake for his 80th birthday last year.) This is a vision that has alarmed the US government and its INCB allies. The narrow-minded obsession with drug enforcement leads to an inability to clearly distinguish between the coca plant and a derivative called cocaine. Sadly, UN drug agencies have become far too closely associated with the so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot;, ending up at odds with other UN agencies promoting human rights, health and development policies. HIV/Aids prevention and programmes of harm reduction are a classic example of the INCB being in conflict with other UN bodies. INCB president Philip Emafo has argued that needle exchange is contrary to international narcotics conventions and has openly condemned the harm reduction policy. Yet the needle exchange policies in that have proven to be effective to reducing the spread of HIV among heroin users, have been officially endorsed by UNAids and WHO. While the INCB&apos;s zero-tolerance ideology drives drug users underground, the main body of UN agencies argues for exactly the opposite. This head-on clash between Indigenous peoples and UN drug control officials reflects a crisis of legitimacy for INCB officials and their hardline drugs agenda which is often incompatible with the UN &apos;s promotion of human rights, justice and development. The international standing of the coca leaf now depends on UN member states. Will they rise to the challenge of mitigating the negative health impact of global drug control treaties, or will fear and timidity prevail in the face of ideological bullying?", "sentences": ["The Transnational Institute in Amsterdam which conducts research on drug policies and development has lambasted the INCB position."], "title": "Coca crackdown", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/30/cocacrackdown", "tags": ["World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-01T07:30:20Z", "article": "     \u00b7 At last, the UK has its own annoying dance craze! &quot;They got cabs but most of the people ova here ride bikes.

He leaves behind a legacy of provocative work whose inspiration can be traced through the conceptual art of the 1960s and 1970s, back to Duchamp, Dada and beyond. For Fairhurst, inspiration came in many forms, from maverick German artist Martin Kippenberger to the musical experiments of John Cage. He had an incredible ability to discuss Monty Python, James Joyce, Bertolt Brecht and the anthropomorphic cartoons of Gary Larson all in the same breath. His interests would eventually lead him to an appreciation of joke-telling, almost as a form of conceptual sculpture. No surprise, then, that several of his artworks would feature the artist dressed as a gorilla, allowing him to carve a niche for himself as both the great un-doer of art world pomp while at the same time reflecting on human experience through an appreciation of comic timing. Many will remember Fairhurst as an artist whose approach to making art often surpassed painting and sculpture into the realm of performance, which included the setting up of a band under the working title Abandon-Abandon, featuring an ever-changing line-up of artists and musicians who, at one time, included Joe Strummer of the Clash. Whether photographing himself jumping up and down naked in the middle of the City like a frustrated businessman, or throwing himself into the party atmosphere dressed as a clown, Fairhurst had a knack of constantly delighting his audience. He was to be applauded for his ability to bring people together and feed into the fast-growing scene of artists and ideas that gripped the capital in the wake of the success of the Goldsmiths generation. Born in Pembury, Kent, Fairhurst attended Canterbury College of Art before moving to Goldsmiths College, London (1986-89), where he first encountered such contemporaries as Damien Hirst, Gary Hume and Sarah Lucas. Fairhurst would later go on to participate in the now infamous group show Freeze, which took place in 1988 in London&apos;s Docklands - an exhibition which helped launch a generation of artists who became known as the Young British Artists, or YBAs. While Fairhurst is widely acknowledged as playing a key role in the development of YBAs, he also maintained an international reputation with long-standing gallery representatives in Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Berlin, Geneva, London, S\u00e3o Paulo, Vienna and New York. Recent shows included his third solo exhibition at Sadie Coles HQ in February and March this year, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (with Lucas and Hirst) at Tate Britain in 2004, and Apocalypse at the Royal Academy in 2000. Before being represented by Coles, Fairhurst also showed at Jay Jopling&apos;s White Cube gallery in 1996. One of his more iconic art works can be experienced at Tate Britain as part of a display of works from the collection. Produced between 1991 and 1996, Gallery Connections - a work that initially came to light as a transcript in an early edition of the contemporary arts magazine, frieze - embodies many of the key facets of Fairhurst&apos;s work, mixing humour, highbrow conceptualism and Sisyphean-styled burnout. Having rewired two telephones, Fairhurst was able to dial the numbers of unsuspecting galleries so they would answer the phone at exactly the same time. What takes place thereafter is characteristically humorous and revealing of the otherwise closed and potentially snooty world of art galleries as both parties answer with the names of their respective galleries. After a moment of bewilderment - where competing galleries suddenly find themselves connected - the conversation eventually breaks down as one repeatedly asks the other, &quot;But why did you call me?&quot; &quot;No, hang on a minute, you called me!&quot; Thanks to his characteristic warmth and wit, as well as his reassuring modesty in the face of an otherwise ego-driven and excessive period in the history of recent British art, Fairhurst became a much-loved character who befriended many in the creative sector, including musicians such as Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, the dancer Michael Clark, and chef Fergus Henderson. His death will come as a terrible blow to fellow artists such as Hirst, with whom he maintained a strong friendship, and Lucas, his partner of several years during the 1990s. Fairhurst was also linked to the likes of Mat Collishaw, Tracey Emin and Cerith Wyn Evans, indeed many of the artists who are now credited as being at the pinnacle of contemporary British art. His death will be all the more hard to fathom given his popularity. He was, at the very least, a wonderful man. He is survived by his mother Sally, and brother Charles. \u00b7 Angus Fairhurst, artist, born October 4 1966; found dead March 29 2008", "sentences": ["While Fairhurst is widely acknowledged as playing a key role in the development of YBAs, he also maintained an international reputation with long-standing gallery representatives in Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Berlin, Geneva, London, S\u00e3o Paulo, Vienna and New York."], "title": "Obituary: Angus Fairhurst", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/apr/02/2", "tags": ["Culture", "Art and design", "Damien Hirst"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-02T23:06:00Z", "article": " Preamble: Crash, bang, wallop! Forget the tedium of Big Cup, this is what you&apos;ve all been waiting for. Behold the sound of Thursday night Euro Vase hurtling through the ether. Sporting&apos;s president, Felipe Soares Franco, values the Uefa Cup so much he&apos;s even gone a bit Dante about tonight&apos;s first leg at Ibrox. &quot;The fans are very noisy and always push for Rangers, so we expect hell, which will be heaven for Rangers,&quot; he recited in Italian from a big dusty book held at arms&apos; length. &quot;We want a good result, with fair play, and to find the solution in Lisbon.&quot; Which basically means &apos;we&apos;re gonna get kicked in the air and battered 3-0.&apos; He needn&apos;t be so downbeat though, as Sporting may be languishing in fifth place in the Portuguese top-tier, but they&apos;ve scored eight goals in their last two league fixtures. They won&apos;t find goals so easy to come-by tonight mind, as Rangers have yet to concede a goal at fortress Ibrox in the Uefa Cup. Expect Jean-Claude Darcheville to be the Gers&apos; chief threat in &apos;hell&apos;. Teams: Rangers: McGregor, Broadfoot, Cuellar, Weir, Papac, Hemdani, Thomson, Davis, Ferguson, McCulloch, Darcheville. Subs: Alexander, Boyd, Novo, Burke, Whittaker, Dailly, Naismith. Sporting: Rui Patricio, Abel, Tonel, Anderson Polga, Grimi, Joao Moutinho, Veloso, Izmailov, Romagnoli, Liedson, Vukcevic. Subs: Tiago, Silva, Adrien Silva, Djalo, Farnerud, Bruno Pereirinha, Gladstone. Referee: Yuri Baskakov (Russia) Pre-match emails: &quot;It&apos;s great to see Kevin Thomson is fit enough to start tonight after that really nasty Samaras &apos;tackle&apos; he was on the end of against Celtic on Saturday. I thought his career could be over! In case you didn&apos;t notice my tongue was firmly in my cheek as I typed that message,&quot; chuckles Tam McCluskey. Do I sense a little bitterness Tam? Wouldn&apos;t have anything to do with his winning goal against Celtic would it? &quot;Are Sporting wearing their green and white hoops?&quot; asks Dan Barron, presumably in the hope that it&apos;ll incense the Ibrox faithful and Rangers players so much that they&apos;ll frighten two goals out of Sporting. I don&apos;t see why they won&apos;t be wearing them Dan. The Sporting players had fetching green tracksuit tops on before so I couldn&apos;t tell, but I expect them to look like sun-tanned Celtic players when they line-up. My prediction in case you&apos;re interested is Rangers 2-1 Sporting, with Brazilian Leidson the most likely to score for Sporting. Pre-match build-up: The sound of bagpipes quivers across the Glasgow air as the teams prepare to enter the fray. I can confirm that Sporting are wearing green and white hoops so I expect them to get a frosty reception. We&apos;re off: Darcheville appears to be starting up front on his own with Thomson just behind him. 2 min: My prediction appears to be dead in the water, as David Weir lands on Leidson&apos;s achilles tendon. The Brazilian gets carted off on a stretcher. &apos;Welcome to hell&apos; eh? 4 min: Surprisingly, Leidson makes it back onto the field after a bit of treatment. My prediction&apos;s back on! Darcheville bursts through the middle and the ball breaks to McCulloch. He tees a left foot shot up from 35 yards, but drives it wide. A decent effort though. 7 min: Moutinho whips a great ball in to Leidson but it is taken off his head by Weir. Sporting have held possession confidently for the past few minutes. 10 min: Vukcevic and Izmailov combine brilliantly to open up the Gers defence but Izmailov is flagged offside. Sporting look extremely comfortable on the ball. 12 min: Ferguson is booked for a cynical scraping of the studs down Moutinho&apos;s achilles heel. Rangers are certainly living up to the physical tag with which Sporting president Felipe Soares Franco labelled them. 16 min: Papac loses possession as he marauds forward from the left-back position but a promising Sporting break is halted by the linesman&apos;s flag. &quot;You&apos;ve noted Sporting&apos;s name incorrectly,&quot; harrumphs Luis A Portista. &quot;The Portuguese club&apos;s name is Sporting CP (which is short for Sporting Clube de Portugal) not Sporting Lisbon. The media confuses the name with their arch rivals Sport Lisboa e Benfica. It would be like referring to Celtic as Celtic Rangers. Not likely and never acceptable!&quot; Blimey Luis - great bit of pedantry. Sorry about that cock-up. I will try to amend as soon as possible. Darcheville bursts into the box from the right but doesn&apos;t deliver a telling cross. Corner... 18 min: The corner is cleared and Vukcevic rampades forwards but stumbles over his own feet as he tries to play-in Izmailov. The Rangers fans are making a right old racket everytime a Sporting player falls down, whether they&apos;ve been fouled or not.  21 min: Broadfoot hoists a cross from the right to Lee McCulloch at the far post, who uses his avuncular frame to bounce goalkeeper Rui Patricio behind the by-line. That was a great example of 1950s centre-forward play, sadly made illegal these days. 24 min: These green and white hoops have really got the Gers fans in a devilish funk. If Sporting CP so much as pass the ball they are booed mercilessly as if it&apos;s some form of foreign foul-play. Rangers haven&apos;t got started and can&apos;t keep hold of possession. I expect that&apos;s the real cause of their ire. 27 min: Izmailov goes in with feet about 7ft in the air and catches Thomson on the head. He&apos;s already been booked so he ought to watch himself. Particularly with the Rangers crowd screaming blue murder everytime they make a challenge. McCulloch scuffs a cross towards the box and Rangers win a corner. 30 min: Thomson knocks in an out-swinger but Sporting CP clear the danger. It&apos;s been a bad-tempered match low on quality so far. But strangely, it&apos;s been good pantomime fun. 40 min: a riposte to Luis A Portista&apos;s pedantry. &quot;Sporting Lisbon is fine. Everybody in Portugal refers to Sporting Clube de Portugal simply as &apos;Sporting&apos;, or sometimes in print as SCP. Likewise for Sport Lisboa e Benfica: simply &apos;Benfica&apos;, occasionally SLB, never, ever &apos;Sport Lisboa&apos;... For non-Portuguese media, &apos;Sporting Lisbon&apos; is fine and informative: everyone knows them as &apos;Sporting&apos;, and they are a Lisbon team,&quot; says Miguel Lobo. Right, well if one more person can email me their opinion I will side with the 2-1 majority and either leave it as Sporting CP or change back to Sporting Lisbon. Meanwhile, Izmailov is dispossessed by Papac, but Sporting regain possession and seem happy to knock it around midfield without threatening. 36 min: &quot;As I am without television, please surmise whether Mr. Broadfoot&apos;s foot is in fact broad,&quot; enquires Patrick Sullivan somewhere in the US of A. From the poxy little telly on which I&apos;m watching this I&apos;d say it&apos;s rather narrow Patrick, which is an example of irony, I believe. Vukcinic has a pretty pathetic dig at goal from 25 yards. But Rangers give the ball away as they attempt to play the ball out of defence. Scrappy! 34 min: Cuellar is winning the ball back with ease for Rangers who are starting to play. Thomson picks up a short corner and drives a cross into the Sporting CP box. Rui Patricio comes to claim it but makes a complete blurt of himself by kicking the ball out of his hands in a Coco-the-Clown display of comedy. He spares his blushes at the second attempt though. 43 min: McCulloch hits a humdinger of a shot from 35 yards and forces a great save from Rui Patricio. Rangers haven&apos;t been able to pass their way through Sporting so it makes sense to have a long range dip. 45 min: Darcheville gets booted in the head as he woefully mis-controls on the edge of the box. He takes it like the man he is though. McCulloch almost scores again with a header that comes off the back of Abel&apos;s head and goes out for a corner - whipped in to Darcheville who heads powerfully but wide from 15 yards. A good end to the half for Rangers. They&apos;ll need to attack with such menace in the second-half if they expect to take an advantage to Portugal. The final point to note is that someone in the crowd howls in his best Glaswegian &quot;YOU&apos;RE A VIRUS!!!&quot; That&apos;s an original and rather nasty insult. Half-time emails &quot;I say just use Sporting - you\u00b4re only using Rangers so why not balance it out?&quot; suggests Dave in Norway. Good point Dave, but that splits the debate three ways which just further muddles my addled mind. &quot;Sporting, Sporting, Sporting&quot; chants Trevor Holden. &quot;I should know as I go to their ground often enough.&quot; That still doesn&apos;t explain whether it&apos;s Sporting Lisbon or Sporting CP though - NEXT! &quot;For foreigners calling a club Sporting Lisbon is not too bad, I think pretty acceptable,&quot; reasons Tiago &apos;Not a Portista&apos;. &quot;BUT please just never call it just &apos;Lisbon&apos; because they are not and that does seem to get on everybody\u00b4s nerves. Celtic are called Celtic of Glasgow in Portugal. And there is Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, Inter Milan, Ajax of Amsterdam so it does not sound too bad. Calling it just by the city name just grates everybody. But in Portuguese the exception seems to be Manchester United is usually called just &quot;Manchester&quot;, so call Sporting just &apos;Lisbon&apos;, but only if you are a City fan wanting revenge or something.&quot; Right well I&apos;m going to stick to Sporting CP because we call Internazionale just that and not Inter Milan, according to the style gurus at GU Towers. Also, given the tone of some of the emails I&apos;m rather scared... 45 min: Rangers win a corner thanks to the industry of Darcheville, but it is cleared easily. The Rangers players look like they&apos;ve been given a rollicking at half-time. 48 min: Barry Ferguson has started the second-half with a bit more verve. He plays Darcheville in on the left and legs it into the box for the return but can&apos;t quite get himself there in time. The Gers fans will be happier to see him pushing forward though. 50 min: &quot;I think you are doing a lovely job on commentary sir,&quot; says the rather cordial Patrick Sullivan. &quot;But is this Uefa Cup coverage not a bit overdone? It&apos;s a lot like covering the undercard of a hot dog eating contest.&quot; What! This is Big Night Euro Vase action at its best Patrick - how dare you! As if to prove my point, Thomson lashes a shot from 25 yards just five yards over the bar. That kind of quality can only be found on a Thursday night. 54 min: Grimi drives forward after Broadfoot loses possession on the right. The midfielder stings the palms of McGregor with a sweet left foot drive and the ball goes out for a corner. Broadfoot self flagellates himself in the box after his mistake. You can&apos;t tell me he doesn&apos;t care about the Euro Vase PATRICK SULLIVAN! 57 min: Darcheville plays a nifty reverse pass with McCulloch, who blasts the ball off the rotund backside of a Sporting defender for a corner. Thomson swings it in but it&apos;s cleared effectively on the back post. 59 min: Leidson is booked for dissent along with another Sporting player whose name I missed I&apos;m afraid. Rangers force another corner but it is punched clear spectacularly by Rui Patricio. Adrian Mutu has scored for Fiorentina against PSV. To check any of the other scores click here. 62 min: I believe it was Grimi who was booked previously. Meanwhile Papac makes a vital interception as Leidson strides through the middle. Rangers break and Broadfoot attempts to cross but kicks Grimi in the air as well as the ball. He escapes a booking though. 66 min: McCulloch is caught in possession by Abel. He&apos;s had a decent game tonight, but it&apos;s just struck me that he doesn&apos;t half look like a chunkier Frank Lampard, if that&apos;s humanly possible? Cuellar steals possession in midfield for the umpteenth time. Papac races past the right-back and flings a cross over to the back stick, which is cleared for a corner. Davis swings in the corner but Fat Fra.. sorry McCulloch heads well wide. 69 min: Sporting&apos;s Izmailov is replaced by Bruno Pereirinha (a nightmare of a name to type - try it). It&apos;s a wise decision as Izmailov faded after a spicy first 15 minutes. Darcheville is replaced by Nacho Novo, much to the collective glee of the Gers faithful. 72 min: There&apos;s a slight lull in play after the substitutions, but Ferguson attempts to get things moving forward again with a clever ball into the box just in front of Novo, who can&apos;t quite reach it. Sporting break and Cuellar concedes a corner. 74 min: The corner is whipped into the front post and little Grimi leaps pretty damn high to head just wide. Vukcevic is replaced by Djalo, so Sporting have two fresh attacking players on the pitch now. I doubt they&apos;ll sit back. 78 min: Veloso plays a delightful backheel to Pereiriinha and dances his way to the touchline where he wins a corner. But he makes a mess of that and Rangers break. 80 min: &quot;Would you have time during your thoughtful commentary to opine on Naomi Campbell&apos;s recent incarceration for alleged airport police spitting?&quot; asks Patrick Sullivan, who just isn&apos;t taking this Big Thursday Night Euro Vase commentary seriously. I don&apos;t condone it Patrick but perhaps she had a coughing fit and had to bring up a bit of mucus. Anyway, back to the final 10 minutes of this important tie. Davis wins the ball on the right and whips in a cracking ball to the near post but Polga heads over his own bar brilliantly. 82 min: Grimi rolls around in the Sporting box theatrically and almost sends the &quot;VIRUS&quot; shouting Gers fan near the microphone into paralytic anger. He&apos;s dragged off the pitch by a physio eventually. The corner is finally whipped in by Thomson but punched clear by the impressive Rui Patricio. 85 min: Leidson catches old-man Weir in possession and Djalo races away with the ball before playing in Leidson who scuffs his shot under pressure from Davis. 87 min: Creaky old Weir&apos;s having a shocking end to the match. He&apos;s caught again and concedes a free-kick for which he is booked. Veloso curls the free-kick towards goal from a central position 20 yards out, but it skims the wall and lands safely in the hands of Rui Patricio. Weir will miss the second leg now. 90 min: Sporting are ending the game the livelier of the two sides. They win another corner which Tonel attacks at the near post, but his header hits the side-netting. Full-time: Sporting will be happy to take a draw back to Portugal. They were more resolute than their own doom-monger of a president thought they would be. Rangers didn&apos;t hold onto possession well enough to create any clear-cut chances and may find the going tough when they visit Lisbon for the second leg. I&apos;ll sign off with a message to Patrick Sullivan: good luck with your new job - now go and make Megan a coffee! Thanks to anybody who sponsored me.

The reason for his cautious optimism is contained in a jar at the office of Dave &quot;Rooster&quot; Roberts, the physiotherapist with whom he has been through so much over the last decade, including the failure of comeback attempts following three previous ankle operations since January 2005. Flintoff travelled to Amsterdam last October for a fourth operation inside three years after limping through England&apos;s miserable efforts in the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Professor Niek Van Dijk, the ankle specialist who had been identified by Roberts and the England medical team as Freddie&apos;s last hope, employed new techniques which, according to Flintoff, &quot;removed some bone fragments that were deeply embedded and also did some work on the tendon&quot;. Those bone fragments are now in Roberts&apos; office at Old Trafford, where Flintoff yesterday provided an upbeat progress report. &quot;So far, so good,&quot; he said after a peripatetic winter in which he spent six weeks in Florida and 10 days in Cape Town before easing back into action with the England Lions in India and on Lancashire&apos;s pre-season trip to Dubai, where he bowled nine overs. &quot;The operation was that long ago it&apos;s almost out of my mind. I&apos;d be lying if I said there wasn&apos;t a small niggle at the back of my mind after four operations, but that&apos;s inevitable. Having seen what the surgeon took out of it I&apos;m confident it&apos;s going to be fine.&quot; In rejecting the need to make further amendments to his much-discussed bowling action, he referred to something having been &quot;clinically wrong with the ankle&quot;, that has &quot;hopefully been eradicated&quot;. The other reason for his optimism is the longer time scale for this recovery, compared to his return within two months of his third ankle operation last summer. &quot;We&apos;ve made a concerted effort this time not to rush the rehab,&quot; he explained. &quot;There&apos;s been nothing like in the past when there has been an Ashes or a World Cup to get back for. This time we have taken our time and got it right. I&apos;m pretty much where I would like to be, not just with the ball but the batting as well.&quot; Flintoff is expected to continue his comeback in Lancashire&apos;s last two pre-season games against Yorkshire at Old Trafford next week before they return to the Oval - where they came agonisingly close to snatching the championship title in the last game of 2007 - to face Surrey. &quot;I&apos;m aiming to start the season bowling at full pelt whenever the captain asks me,&quot; he continued. &quot;Everyone has been talking about working at 70 to 80% but I reckon I&apos;m not far off - if not bowling flat-out, then not too far from it.&quot; Lancashire team-mates report that he is already hitting the gloves of wicket keeper Luke Sutton with real pace and lift. He bridled at the suggestion that he would be better off writing off the first half of the international summer to give him more time to consolidate his recovery. &quot;No, there&apos;s a Test match on May 15th at Lord&apos;s that I&apos;d love to be involved in,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve missed a lot of international cricket through injury and I don&apos;t want to miss any more, or as little as I have to. But I&apos;m under no illusions. To get back into the side I&apos;m going to have to be fit and playing well. That starts against Yorkshire and then the first championship game. I&apos;d love to put my name in the hat. But even if I am playing well they [England] have just come off two Test wins [in New Zealand], so it&apos;s not assured. I&apos;d just like to be in the mix-up.&quot; Lancashire also have home championship games against Somerset and a Durham team likely to include Flintoff&apos;s close friend Steve Harmison, who will also have much to prove to the England selectors, before the first Test squad is picked. Flintoff was non-committal about the dangers presented to English cricket by the money on offer to leading players from the two new Twenty20 competitions in India. &quot;It has been mentioned,&quot; he confirmed. &quot;But I&apos;ve got a lot on my plate at the minute. I want to get on the field for Lancashire and I want to play for England so at this moment it is not really an option. Further down the line, who knows?&quot; Lancashire&apos;s chief executive Jim Cumbes suggested that the counties could be ready to respond to the Indian threat by voting at a meeting next week to expand next year&apos;s Twenty20 Cup at the expense of the 40-over league, and to allow at least three overseas players per team in this year&apos;s competition. &quot;There needs to be a reaction pretty quickly,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["Flintoff travelled to Amsterdam last October for a fourth operation inside three years after limping through England&apos;s miserable efforts in the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa."], "title": "Cricket: Flintoff back near full speed and awaiting call for first Test", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/04/cricket.sport", "tags": ["Cricket", "Sport", "Andrew Flintoff"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-04T10:14:57Z", "article": "The bar on the 40th floor of the Cerulean Tower hotel buzzes with the discreet hum of money. Wealthy Japanese lean into their tables, talking in hushed tones to ladies who twirl their hair around their fingers, distracted by the Tokyo neon glimmering through the huge panoramic windows. So far, so Lost in Translation. Except one of these tables houses the Kooks, a young British band who are currently discussing the ideal interval between hair washes in order to maintain optimal greasiness. A fortnight? Three weeks, tops? They move on to how David Cameron could love the Jam so much (they were aghast to read about it in this newspaper), and whether Katie Holmes was actually impregnated by L Ron Hubbard&apos;s supersperm to create Scientology&apos;s new messiah. &quot;I&apos;ve got friends in LA who know about it,&quot; says 23-year-old lead singer Luke Pritchard excitedly, if not entirely convincingly. The Kooks are in Japan to promote their second album, Konk, which they recorded in London at Ray Davies&apos;s studio of the same name. But where Davies&apos; band, the Kinks, sang about simple lads who could not &quot;tell water from champagne&quot;, the Kooks have now had a couple of years of the high life and can tell champagne from prosecco - Pritchard is trying to explain to a bemused Japanese waiter that he would like his bellini made with the latter. Accuse them of being posh, though, and you get the slightest hint of irritation: on all other matters they take the line of least resistance by deciding that what ever people say they are, that&apos;s what they, er, are. Ask if they&apos;re a pop band, on the basis that guitar types tend to shun such categorisation, and Pritchard replies: &quot;Of course we&apos;re pop! My whole thing, when we started the band, was that I wanted to bring back great pop music. Soulful pop.&quot; Ask if they&apos;re a boyband and they can live with the idea - though having come of age in this group, they are &quot;Boyz II Men maybe&quot;. Ask about stage school (Pritchard went to the Brit School, where he dated Katie Melua, about whom he wrote most of the band&apos;s first album) and it was apparently a great place to meet other musicians and some inspiring teachers. Ask if they are prepared to do anything to break America and you are told: &quot;But that makes it sound like a bad thing to drive around playing shows in all these crazy little towns you&apos;d never get to see otherwise - how could that be bad?&quot; But suggest they are posh, and there is a murmur of dissent - their frontman may have boarded at Bedales, the liberal school in Hampshire, but, he says, he felt out of place there among the offspring of millionaires. And they didn&apos;t all go to private schools, they protest - new bass player Dan Logan was home-schooled - and what does class matter anyway? And as for making music for girls, an accusation levelled at them by Kasabian: &quot;It&apos;s true though, we do make music for girls. We love girls! Why wouldn&apos;t we want to make music for them?&quot; The Kooks, plainly, are not on a mission to develop an inflated sense of self-importance, despite the pressures that must be attendant after their first album, Inside In/Inside Out, went multi-platinum. &quot;We&apos;re the sort of band who&apos;d trash a hotel room - and then tidy it up afterwards,&quot; they explain. And the girls do love them back here in Japan - they line the front rows of the Tokyo gig. &quot;It started like that in England, but then the girls brought their boyfriends and now it&apos;s half and half. We played the Astoria the other night and the first two rows were boys and we were so pissed off - we&apos;d just come back from America where it was all chicks and here we were playing London to a bunch of sweaty old men. We were like, &apos;What&apos;s happened to us?&apos;&quot; says Pritchard. Then, at an in-store signing the next day, girls queue up to shake their hands, give them presents. Some more daring ones reach over for a hug, amid fits of giggles. One says, with scary devotion, that she even went to see them play their charity gig at the Oxfam shop gig in east London. The band remain good-natured throughout; they know exactly what they are here to do. Yes, they tell their admirers, they adore Tokyo, yes they have feasted on sushi every night, they do have a thing for Japanese girls. In fact, says drummer Paul Garred, flashing a Colgate grin like an EastEnders market trader, &quot;We just love the beautiful people of your fine country.&quot; &quot;Honest Paul, I call him,&quot; chuckles their tour manager, as the fans swoon. It&apos;s not that they lie - in fact it&apos;s a pleasant surprise how much they will tell a journalist, even when a dictaphone is waggled in front of their faces. They reveal that their song Jackie Big Tits is actually a riposte to Mike Batt, Melua&apos;s mentor, with whom Pritchard had an angry confrontation one night in Amsterdam. Pritchard tells of reports that he dated the TV presenter Fearne Cotton, &quot;and in the newspaper it said that apparently - APPARENTLY - she dumped me. Nothing could be further from the truth. I didn&apos;t go out with her at all. I mean, a few nights - she&apos;s a nice girl - I suppose I had a fling.&quot; He reveals that he finds American groupies different from British ones, in that they&apos;ll &quot;just come up to you and say: &apos;Hi, do you want a threesome?&apos;&quot; Is that unappealing? &quot;No! Sorry to ruin your myth there, but it&apos;s very appealing actually!&quot; The Kooks are just exceptionally good at playing the game. The game is, ultimately, to sell vast numbers of albums. It&apos;s not that they have much hope of truly making it big in Japan - a country so enamoured of its own artists that a Japanese star can sell millions of records while Arctic Monkeys, the most successful band in the &quot;UK rock&quot; section of record stores, have only shifted 100,000 copies, with the Kooks lagging behind on 30,000 - but they do hope to consolidate their position as one of the biggest groups in the UK. The opportunity the Kooks took with Inside In/Inside Out was created by the collapse of the boy-band market. While Girls Aloud and Sugababes have thrived, their shiny male equivalents have been replaced by indie males in skinny jeans. The success of this new breed of commercial indie - see also Razorlight, or the View, or dozens of others - is because these bands understand that having a catchy chorus is more important than keeping your indie credibility. And the Kooks are masters of pop hooks - seven of Inside In/Inside Out&apos;s 14 tracks reached the top 40, with Naive and She Moves in Her Own Way both making the top 10. The album sold 1.5m copies in the UK and a further million overseas. Their record label, Virgin, has classed them as a &quot;priority act&quot; for 2008 - as long as they keep churning out the hits. So how is that whole &quot;difficult second album&quot; thing working out for them? &quot;The thing is,&quot; says Pritchard, &quot;talking to other friends in bands, whether they&apos;re signed to indies or majors, they seem to have a lot more meddling from their label. But because we deliver pop songs - in their terms, songs they can work with - they always leave us to it. Our A&amp;R guy only came to the studio once while we were recording the album.&quot; He thinks a bit. &quot;I mean, I&apos;d be lying if I said I didn&apos;t have a few moments where I ... where you worry about it, but they feel it much more outside than us. When you&apos;re in the studio you&apos;re just four mates playing guitars.&quot; Oh come on, you know you&apos;re expected to write catchy hooks on demand. &quot;But I don&apos;t do it for that, never, never, never ... All I can remember is from an early age, just sitting in my bedroom with a guitar finding just total solace in it. And then later on realising that my friends were humming my songs back to me. You know when people start bands and say, &apos;Yeah, let&apos;s play Led Zeppelin songs&apos;? I hated playing other people&apos;s songs. I only ever wanted to play my own songs.&quot; He must feel like a hit machine, though. &quot;I am a hit machine!&quot; he replies in a fake American accent. &quot;I just roll &apos;em out! I&apos;m a one-man hit factory! Shit, I can just see the headline now.&quot; Pritchard&apos;s artlessness about why he makes music is rather contradicted when I speak to an old schoolfriend of his, who would jam with Pritchard in the music room at break time. Pritchard was always the one talking about what a hit song needed, about the structure. Music seems to have stopped being merely solace for Pritchard at quite a tender age. That said, he - and his bandmates - gush with enthusiasm for what they do, despite the rigours of their promotional schedule. And there is something in the idea that they make music for girls. They say they were mainly raised by women - Pritchard&apos;s dad died when he was three, and Garred wrote the song Gap about the death of his own father. There&apos;s something in the way the choruses always linger on words such as &quot;sweetheart&quot; or &quot;angel&quot;, and the way they worship women in the songs (loving a girl because She Moves in Her Own Way, or on the new song Shine On, wishing a girlrfriend would stop looking at celebrity magazines and realise how naturally beautiful she is; taking good advice from a supportive woman on Love It All. It&apos;s not exactly Oasis, though they have had the nod from Noel Gallagher. &quot;When Ooh La came out, that&apos;s when it all changed for us, because we were massive and all of a sudden we had respect from Noel Gallagher and all these people - Paul Weller, who&apos;s been really amazing. Noel said to our manager, &apos;I really like that Ooh La tune.&apos; And he invited us to a party after the Brits. I was off my face, dancing with my girlfriend at the time, we were just going crazy. Oh no hang on, that was a different Noel Gallagher party. &quot; Still, they don&apos;t always gel with all other bands. &quot;I like the idea of musicians playing together and sharing songs but it isn&apos;t like that now - or maybe it still is like that and we are just outside of it,&quot; says Pritchard. &quot;But I just find, sometimes people look at me like I&apos;m fucking crazy when I say, do you want to go and have a jam? I asked Caleb from Kings of Leon - we were in this horrible club, shitty boom-boom-boom music, table full of vodka, and I just said to him, &apos;Look, I know this really great blues bar round the corner, it&apos;s open mic night. Do you want to go and sing a song? It&apos;ll be really funny!&apos; And he just looked at me like I was from another planet. Surely you&apos;d rather be there than surrounded by ugly girls who think they&apos;re models, listening to shitty hip-hop? It&apos;s boring. I just think it&apos;s us - it&apos;s whatever they think of the Kooks. But I can&apos;t worry about it - life is too short to be sat round looking moody in a club.

The answer is that they all came to us from Holland in the 17th century. At a time when it was easier for a Londoner to travel to Amsterdam than to Lincolnshire, the Narrow Seas were a highway rather than a barrier; and the Dutch impact on English life was enormous. Successive waves of religious and political exiles - Puritans, royalists, republicans and Whigs - took refuge in the ever-tolerant United Provinces, while Dutch craftsmen, scholars, merchants and artists poured into Britain. Dutch engineers drained the East Anglian fens, Dutch thinkers fuelled contemporary theological debate, and Dutch investors helped to finance the Bank of England and the national debt. The early fellows of the Royal Society included Dutch scientists such as the physicist Christiaan Huygens, the microscopist Anton van Leeuwenhoek and the physician Hermann Boerhaave. Such conspicuous English figures as the portrait-painter Peter Lely, the philosopher Bernard Mandeville and the noble earls of Albemarle, Athlone and Portland were all Dutch. So, of course, was William of Orange, who invaded England in 1688 and dislodged the Catholic James II from the English throne. Today relatively few reminders survive of this once very close relationship, though some English houses still have Dutch gables and Delft tiles; and Dutch influence has left its mark on our vocabulary, particularly on seafaring terms (yacht, deck, cruise, landlubber) and on the language of art (easel, sketch, landscape). Seventeenth-century Holland has also attracted some of the best British historians, from GN Clark to Simon Schama. At the end of the second world war, the young Cambridge academic Charles Wilson argued in his book Holland and Britain that William&apos;s military invasion in 1688 was so successful because it had been preceded by decades of economic, artistic and intellectual penetration of England by its North Sea neighbours. Now, 60 years later, Lisa Jardine resurrects Wilson&apos;s theme (though she makes no mention of his book). Her sumptuously illustrated volume is a study of cultural exchange between England and the Dutch republic in the 17th century and is intended to be accessible to non-academic readers. It begins with a graphic account of William&apos;s invasion, which Jardine describes as &quot;the slickest feat of naval planning and execution ever to have been witnessed in Europe&quot;. William came in an armada of 500 ships, carrying an army of 20,000 soldiers, plus a similar number of sailors and associated personnel. They landed at Torbay and marched to London, which was put under Dutch military occupation until the spring of 1690, by which time William had been fully acknowledged as England&apos;s new ruler. It was, says Jardine, &quot;a brilliantly stage-managed sequence of events&quot;. William&apos;s primary appeal was that he was a Protestant. But like Wilson before her, Jardine also argues that what might have been a brutal foreign invasion was easily assimilated by the English (though, one might add, not by the Scots or the Irish) because England and Holland were already closely interwined, dynastically, culturally and intellectually. She reminds her readers of the links between the English royal family and the Orange dynasty which gave William a double claim to the English throne: a weak one through his mother, Mary, daughter of Charles I, and a strong one through his wife, Mary, daughter of James II. Both claims were dashed in 1688, when James II&apos;s queen, Mary of Modena, gave birth to a son and heir, the future Old Pretender, whom William&apos;s supporters tried to discredit as a supposititious child, smuggled in via a warming-pan. The Orange family were not royalty, of course, but they had royal pretensions. Jardine vividly describes the way in which those pretensions were buttressed by the efforts of a remarkably versatile and cultivated figure, Constantijn Huygens (pronounced &quot;Huggins&quot; by the English). Poet, musician, connoisseur, diplomat and intimate adviser to the house of Orange for nearly 50 years, Sir Constantijn (he was knighted by James I) provided the Orange family with the cultural capital they needed if they were to move on equal terms with the crowned heads of Europe. He built their houses, planted their gardens, built up their art collections and superintended their theatrical and musical entertainments. Fluent in English, with many English friends and correspondents, he translated the poems of John Donne, assisted English art-collectors, entertained the exiled royalists in the 1650s, chose the pictures to be presented by the States of Holland to Charles II after the Restoration and subsequently brokered the marriage of William and Mary. More than anyone else, he was responsible for the convergence of Dutch and English taste in art, music, architecture and garden design. His work was continued by his son, Constantijn, Jr, who became secretary to William III and oversaw royal art patronage in England. Unfortunately, William decided to ship back to Holland the magnificent Dutch pictures in the royal collection, to the ultimate benefit of the Rijksmuseum and the Mauritshuis, but with the unintended effect of concealing from posterity the central place that Dutch art had once occupied in English taste. Another of Sir Constantijn&apos;s sons was the eminent scientist Christiaan Huygens. Jardine uses his career to illustrate the close convergence of Dutch and English science in the later 17th century. Even the Anglo-Dutch wars provoked by commercial rivalry failed to interrupt this intellectual exchange, though there were some disagreeable quarrels over priority of discovery, such as Christiaan Huygens&apos;s argument with the English scientist Robert Hooke over precision time-keepers. Jardine, who has previously written a biography of Hooke, devotes much space to these rather tedious disputes. Lively and informative on painting and gardens, as well as on science, she is silent about many of the other essential aspects of Anglo-Dutch cultural exchange sketched out years ago by Wilson. At the end of the book she confesses to having &quot;barely scratched the surface&quot; of her subject. Rather than purporting to cover the vast topic of Anglo-Dutch cultural relations, she might have done better to admit that the real subject of Going Dutch is the Huygens family and their cultural and intellectual achievements, a topic which will be new to most English readers. But one can imagine what her publishers would have said about that. In the preface, she thanks her friends for assisting her with what she calls &quot;the continuing Jardine project which is the urge to know and to change the world through knowledge&quot;. Yet though displaying its author&apos;s usual zest, Going Dutch lacks a sense of direction and is marred by repetition, back-tracking and some hasty writing. Guinea, she tells us, is on the east coast of Africa. This is indeed changing the world, but perhaps not in the way she intended.", "sentences": ["At a time when it was easier for a Londoner to travel to Amsterdam than to Lincolnshire, the Narrow Seas were a highway rather than a barrier; and the Dutch impact on English life was enormous."], "title": "Review: Going Dutch by Lisa Jardine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview5", "tags": ["Books", "History", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-05T17:59:26Z", "article": "Sow: February to SeptemberHarvest: May to December Eat it raw, juice it, boil it, roast it - this versatile root can do no wrong. Planned carefully and with some love and affection, you can keep in carrots for at least nine months of the year. And, if orange just isn&apos;t your colour, go for fashionable white, purple, yellow or green-skinned varieties. Recommended varieties: Organic guru Bob Flowerdew says: &quot;Autumn King is always good and stores so well whereas the amazing sunshine-yellow Yellowstone grow huge without losing crunch. I grow the traditional Amsterdam Forcing year-round under cloches.&quot; Sowing and planting: Like potatoes, carrots have multiple sowing options. Sow earlies under cloches or in cold frames in late winter if you live in a warm area or early spring if you live in a cool area (seeds will germinate much more rapidly if sown in a soil temperature of 10C). On light soils, broadcast seed or sow in 7.5-10cm wide bands, 2cm apart. On heavy soils, sow in bands or drills 15cm apart and thin to about 5cm apart. Remove cloches or frames in mid-late spring when things heat up. Your earlies should be ready to harvest in early summer. You can then double-bluff your crop by planting a later crop of the same early variety. These should be sown in succession in the open from early spring through to mid-summer in drills 15cm apart and thinned to about 4-5cm apart. For a young crop to be harvested in the late autumn/early winter you can make your final outdoor sowings in later summer (or even early autumn if you&apos;re in the south), just cover with cloches if the weather turns. If you want carrots on the table in early spring, you are going to have to sow undercover in mid-autumn and hope for the best. Your standard maincrop cultivars can be sown from mid-spring through to mid-summer in drills 15cm apart. Cultivation: Despite rapid germination, carrots, sadly, aren&apos;t as easy to crop as you might hope. They are susceptible to competition in the early stages, which means high-maintenance weeding. Mulch between rows to keep the roots moist, but don&apos;t excessively water as this will encourage leaf rather than root growth and carrot leaves are good for nothing (except the compost heap). Heavy rainfall will confuse the carrot and can produce fanged roots (likewise, if it hits a stone). Unless you&apos;re prepared to stand over your bed with an umbrella, keep your soil mulched and hope for the best. Pests and diseases: Carrot fly can quickly destroy your crop. The fly is likely to strike in early summer (when they lay their eggs) and autumn/winter (when the eggs have hatched). Affected roots don&apos;t store well but are still edible. Plant with onions and marigolds to keep the carrot fly at bay or grow varieties with high resistance. Harvesting: Young carrots should be gently pulled up by hand. The rest of the crop can be left in the ground. Storage: The best place for carrots to remain is in the ground although they do store well in a shed, between layers of sand. Extending the season: If you&apos;ve messed up your timings it&apos;s worth knowing that mini carrots can be harvested within 11 weeks. Sow in situ from mid-spring to mid-August, leaving two to three weeks between crops.

Head of a Man, which hangs in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne As an art-hungry child growing up on the wrong side of the world, I shall be forever grateful to a man called Albert Felton who, when he succumbed to prostate cancer in Melbourne in 1904, left his entire fortune to be managed as a bequest fund. Half the income was to go to public charities, and the other half to the Melbourne picture gallery, later the National Gallery of Victoria. The gallery staff have bought wisely with the billion dollars or so that the bequest has brought. I can still remember the first time when, as a small girl, I tiptoed towards a small panel of the Mother and Child limned in jewel colours, set in a dimly lit room of its own, as if upon an altar. It was acquired in 1923 as by Jan van Eyck; it is now reattributed to the Flemish school, on no better grounds than that the Madonna doesn&apos;t sit upon a throne, as she does in other Van Eycks, but upon a cushion. A Monk With a Book in the style of Titian is actually a Titian. A self-portrait by Rembrandt isn&apos;t, but the portrait of Doge Pietro Loredano, thought to be a copy of a Tintoretto, turns out to be the original, after which all the other versions of this famous portrait have been made. Few provincial galleries have had the chance to play for such high stakes, and it is to the credit of the gallery&apos;s directors that they have so often found themselves on the winning side. Which makes it all the odder that they could have made such a mistake with their Van Gogh. In 1940, the gallery paid 2,196 Australian pounds for an oil sketch of the head of a man, 33cm high and 40cm wide. Any fool with an eye (let alone two) could tell you that it doesn&apos;t look anything like a Van Gogh, and the best opinion has decided that it isn&apos;t. Nor is it a forgery, because a forger always paints in a manner associated with the artist whose work he is faking: Van Gogh never painted anything remotely like this. The provenance can be traced back no further than the Berlin art market of 1928, from where the picture wandered to Cologne, the Hague, Amsterdam, Paris and London. But whatever it is, this picture is no journeyman piece. It is painted with a lightness, deftness and luminosity that one would seek in vain in the work of any of Van Gogh&apos;s contemporaries. The picture is almost certainly cropped just under the subject&apos;s beard, showing no more than a glimmer of neck linen. The subject is seen three-quarters on, just showing his left ear, facing towards a soft but glowing light source that throws into high relief his broad, open face, tanned and seamed as if from working outdoors. His hairline is receding, but his hair still springs in unkempt curls, each painted with a loose brush loaded with an umber so burnt it is almost black. His deep-set eyes are so widely set as to give him an air of innocence and wonder, which the painter has enhanced by filling them with light. Under a shallow chevron of moustache that reaches almost to his jawline on either side, his mouth is set and resolute. If you were looking for a St Peter for a Transfiguration, this would be he. The picture is unmistakably a study from life. The only possibility that it is in fact the hand of Van Gogh would be if it was a slavish, brushstroke-by-brushstroke copy of something he was trying to learn from. But we know how Van Gogh copied: he always copied the artists he admired, such as Millet and Delacroix, in his own manner. Suspicions were initially raised by the fact that the picture is painted on canvas laid down on a panel; in fact, dozens of the canvasses Van Gogh left behind him in Nuenen were mounted at some stage on boards, and some even on cardboard. Many of these are studies of heads, most of them with an extremely limited palette, but there the resemblance ends. The last thing Van Gogh was looking for in these dark and tormented images was the sprezzatura of the National Gallery of Victoria picture. The painting is not mentioned in Van Gogh&apos;s correspondence with his brother, the art dealer Theo van Gogh. The brothers were living together in Paris in the spring and summer of 1886, so there was no correspondence between them, but it was during this period that Van Gogh experimented with different ways of applying paint, sometimes trying a version of pointillism, and at other times brushing out the paint in the manner of Corot; but at no time did he produce anything remotely like this Head of a Man. The experts from the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam have now agreed that the picture was not painted at any time after Van Gogh&apos;s death in 1890. I am about to make a suggestion that will seem completely mad. For his own use in crowd scenes, Rubens made a repertory of types, hundreds of swift oil sketches of the heads of people he encountered on the streets. Those that are now surfacing on the art market have been identified by comparison with finished pictures.

Yes, we have more mosques now - but we have also a lot of empty churches.&quot; And here&apos;s a great thing to do with such atmospheric yet dormant spaces. I&apos;m in central Maastricht, standing in what must be one of the finest bookshops in the world. That&apos;s quite a claim. Yet who could fail to be thrilled by this extraordinary venture? Selexyz Dominicanen - a store created from a merger between the town&apos;s Bergman&apos;s bookshop, the Academische Boekhandel, and the Dutch Selexyz bookshop chain - is housed in the thrilling setting of a 13th-century Dominican church. This haunting building was once part of a friary knocked about over the centuries by various invading armies. Right up until last Christmas, in possibly its strangest incarnation, it was being used by the citizens of Maastricht as a glorious, or possibly inglorious, indoor bike pound. As for the Dominicans, they were driven out by Napoleon in 1794. After a brief spell as a parish church, this magnificent Gothic prayer hall - it has no tower or transepts, in keeping with the rules of the clerical order that built it - was turned into nothing holier than a warehouse. Today, the church, consecrated in 1294, could hardly be more popular. The beautifully restored building is an attraction in its own right, and yet the installation of a towering, three-storey black steel bookstack in the long, high nave, together with a fashionable if somewhat noisy cafe in the choir, works extraordinarily well. Church and bookshop look as if they might have been made for one another. As more European churches become redundant, we need to dream up new uses for them. Happily, books and churches have always gone together: in the beginning, as St John tells us, was the Word; the word was, in time, written down in books. At first, these were mighty tomes read by priests alone. Such was their value that, at the time this church was built, they were chained to vaulted library walls. The bookshop installation here is by the Dutch architects Merkx + Girod, founded in 1998 and led from Amsterdam by Evelyne Merkx and Patrice Girod. The dominant new element in the church is the high-rise bookshelf structure stretching up to the stone vaults. Popular books are kept on lower shelves, while academic, esoteric and theological works are kept closer to heaven. These are reached by stairs within the sleek, well-made bookstack, although there is also a lift. Views from the top shelf along the nave of the church are nothing short of uplifting, while just above your head are the faded remains of ceiling paintings from around 1337; in a very different style, there are others by the artist Jan Vessens, depicting saints and sinners and episodes from the Bible, dating from 1619. It is rare to get so close to such paintings anywhere, let alone in a bookshop. What other store can boast ceiling paintings dating back so far? The sheer scale of the black steel bookstack was necessary for two reasons. One was that a spread of shelves along and across the nave would have detracted from its character; the more worldly reason was that Selexyz needs 1,200 sq m of selling space to make the shop&apos;s finances add up. Given that the church has a floor area of just 750 sq m, the only way to go was up. The bookstack, though big, is not one great, irredeemable slab. You can walk through and up it, and it frames views of the nave on both sides beyond it. The bays of the nave are also neatly lined with bookshelves, so what you see through the bookstack are rows of books beyond rows of books. It has some similarities with a normal bookstore, though. The most popular works, the bestsellers and the ones on special offer, are stored on low tables, set about with minimalist modern chairs, on either side of the main bookstack. All this works well, and no sin is committed against the fabric or the spirit of the church. The one booming note that, inevitably, brings the core values of the 21st century to life and distracts from the great theological works stacked up on the high shelves is that of the hissing of coffee machines and the clanking of china cups. Dominican plainchant has clearly given way here to orders for cappuccinos and the gurgling of hot milk as it is frothed to make the drink that takes it name from the garb of Capuchin monks. The central feature of the cafe is a long, cruciform table lit by a lamp suspended from the stone vaults in the guise of a modern halo. In centuries gone by, such cheekiness - a table in the shape of the crucifix - would have been seen as blasphemous. Today, it seems fine, as does the offer of a glass of red wine from the chic bar. Despite its cafe and the large numbers of people who come here, the atmosphere is not unruly. Bookshops, except those in popular museums and galleries, tend to be a little hushed, and this one does seem to calm the nerves. It would be a fine thing if the store promoted interest in the extraordinary, if often overlooked, wealth of Maastricht&apos;s churches. Surely anyone with any curiosity will wonder what lies beyond the doors of the churches beyond the bookshop friary? Maastricht boasts such wonders as the Romanesque Church of Our Lady, which looks and feels like a fairytale fortress (the city is said to have been besieged at least 21 times), and St Servatius, a glorious marriage of calm and rounded Romanesque and flamboyant and pointed Gothic design. Merkx + Girod has been involved in remodelling a number of historic buildings in the Netherlands, including Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. It has also designed numerous shops and restaurants, including the cafe in Rem Koolhaas&apos;s congress hall in Rotterdam, and is currently busy on interiors for the Hermitage Amsterdam. This outpost of the St Petersburg institution, due to open later this year, is housed in the beautiful Amstelhof, a classical, soft-red-brick building built in the 1680s by Hans Petersom, the city architect, as a nursing home for elderly women. It could easily be by Christopher Wren. But the Maastricht bookshop is Merkx + Girod&apos;s finest work. And its transformation is, I think, a lesson to us all. Yes, we need to think up new uses for old churches, but we must also consider ways of converting them without altering their venerable fabric. A church is a prayer set in stone, and even if we do not use them as they were intended, their very presence is reassuring and comforting, reminding us that there is more to life than getting and spending, trade and toil. The Dominican church in Maastricht strikes just the right note.

Until recently, the answer had always been no. I&apos;ve read enough already about the joy of Haydn, Beethoven&apos;s deafness, or how the beauty of Schubert transcends life itself. I&apos;m not sure I want to expose myself to the dangers. In his author&apos;s note to An Equal Music, Vikram Seth says: &quot;Music to me is dearer even than speech.&quot; This puzzled me at first. Why, then, is he an author and not a musician? He must be referring to that harassment of the emotions, the way music pushes feelings so dramatically to the surface. It&apos;s not necessary to be a performer to experience this. Significantly, although the novel is about music, Seth becomes diverted by Venice and love. This seems to be the essential problem with writing about music. You get diverted. Any attempt to describe one form of art with another runs into similar problems. Whatever his source of inspiration, Mussorgsky&apos;s Pictures at an Exhibition exists as music in its own right. When I sit in the middle of an orchestra and blast out &quot;The Great Gate of Kiev&quot; with sweeping bows, hearing the brass thundering out behind me, I&apos;m not particularly interested in the original picture - which apparently no longer exists. But as soon as I decided that it was unwise to write about music, I knew I should give it a go. In my latest novel, The Language of Others, the main character, Kate, studies music, marries a brilliant, unstable violinist and plays piano duets in concerts. The language of the title, incidentally, is not music. It&apos;s Asperger&apos;s, and it refers to the way slightly autistic people see the world through different eyes. Music forced itself into the novel because it&apos;s sometimes the only way in which people who can&apos;t express themselves can access emotion. In Ann Patchett&apos;s novel Bel Canto, about a world-famous soprano and a hostage situation, Mr Hosokawa is CEO of a Japanese company whose life exists around his passion for opera, in particular the famous soprano. How does Patchett write about this passion for music? Not emotionally. The strongest thing she says about Mr Hosokawa is: &quot;The records he cherished, the rare opportunities to see a live performance, those were the marks by which he gauged his ability to love.&quot; What an elegant way to express the power of music. Writing about music must be a bit like trying to write about sex. Modern novelists, no longer bound by decency laws, have spent an excess of words attempting to portray the experience. Does it work? Not very often. After all these years of experimentation, it still seems best to leave most of it to the imagination. The finest writers come unstuck, and the end result is usually pornographic, purple or boring. It tends to make us laugh. It helps to be told about the cleverness of music, the technical details. Without them, the writing can sink into the kind of carelessness you often find in films portraying musicians. Within seconds, I can spot the stiff wrist movement of the violinist, the crooked bow, the fact that the action of the fingers doesn&apos;t correspond with the notes coming out of the loudspeakers. How is it that they could find an actor who looks and sounds like Johnny Cash, and a real dancer for The Red Shoes, but not a decent cellist to play Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in the film Hilary and Jackie? She moved a lot, they&apos;ve been told. So the camera concentrates on her physical exuberance from behind, where we can&apos;t see her lack of skill. But she doesn&apos;t move with the emotion and poetry of a real musician. She&apos;s an actress and we know it. The rest of the film loses all credibility. You can&apos;t bluff these things. In the same way, it&apos;s usually possible to tell if an author writing about music is not a musician. Research alone rarely produces the same verisimilitude. Information about the background of a work can add potency to descriptions of music. A few years ago, Simon Rattle agreed to conduct a charity concert at our school - his sons were pupils at the time. He conducted a performance of The Lark Ascending by an ex-pupil. He told us that Vaughan Williams finished this after the first world war and it was his way of saying that humanity could move forward, that something hopeful could arise out of the ashes of all those dead young men. I should have known this, but I didn&apos;t. And a piece of music that had always been beautiful acquired an added poignancy. In Anne Michaels&apos;s Fugitive Pieces, Jakob Beer is a young Jewish boy who loses his family in the Holocaust. He is haunted by images of his sister, Bella, who had been a gifted pianist. In one of his memories, Bella tells him how Brahms conducted and composed for the Hamburg Ladies&apos; Choir, who rehearsed in a garden. She told him that &quot;Brahms climbed a tree and conducted from a branch&quot;. Now Brahms is real to us - we&apos;re more receptive to a description of his music. So should the music be explored by metaphor? Forster spends several pages describing Beethoven&apos;s fifth symphony with extraordinary images. He talks of heroes and shipwrecks and how the music starts &quot;with a goblin walking quietly over the universe from end to end&quot;. He&apos;s rather keen on these goblins, who get several mentions. Surprisingly, these bizarre images are less jarring in their context than you might expect, bearing in mind that Beethoven probably wasn&apos;t thinking about goblins at all. But an author wouldn&apos;t get away with this now. Goblins and heroes are not exactly 21st century. It all has to be more subtle, as in Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam, where the composer Clive Linley works on a symphony while on holiday in the Lake District. &quot;An image came to him of a set of unfolding steps, sliding and descending - from the trap door of a loft, or from the door of a light plane.&quot; McEwan is describing the creative process itself here, the initial formation of notes, which lead to &quot;a sad little tune&quot; in Clive&apos;s head. In Bernard MacLaverty&apos;s Grace Notes, Catherine, a young composer who struggles with depression, describes the birth of her baby through music. She says it was like studying music theory, reading about harmony and counterpoint but never hearing an actual note. Then, as the voices burst out in the opening of Handel&apos;s Zadok the Priest, the teacher says: &quot;That&apos;s what it is. Now do you understand?&quot; Music becomes the metaphor for describing the triumph of giving birth. Powerful and effective. David Mitchell writes very convincingly about music in Cloud Atlas. In the part called &quot;Letters from Zedelghem&quot;, he introduces Robert Frobisher, a formidably clever, manipulative young man who cheats and lies and gambles his way through life with an endearing mixture of shame and need, exercising his own unique brand of selfishness. But he is a composer. How can a man like this lay claim to sincere emotion, beauty, skill? How can readers possibly identify with such a reprobate character? And yet we do. Frobisher wheedles his way into the household of a famous blind composer, Vyvyan Ayrs, in the guise of an amanuensis. He plans to be Eric Fenby to Ayrs&apos;s Delius. When he makes this proposal, Ayrs says: &quot;Are you mad?&quot; Frobisher replies: &quot;Always a trickier question than it looks.&quot; But despite his appalling behaviour, including stealing from Ayrs&apos;s home, his love for music is all-consuming. He describes a dream in which he hears a chord ring out, &quot;half-cello, half-celeste, D-major (?) . . . E-flat, whole string section, glorious, transcendent, angels wept&quot;. So here we have a fundamentally amoral man whose response to music is deeply emotional. And he tosses off wonder-ful judgmental criticism: Delius&apos;s Air and Dance is a &quot;syrupy Florentine of a piece, but its drowsy flute is rather successful&quot;. It&apos;s this offhand way of talking about music, by a man who couldn&apos;t be sentimental if he tried, that makes this writing so convincing. Mitchell&apos;s technical knowledge is impressive. Talking about work that he helped Ayrs compose, Frobisher says: &quot;It borrows resonances from Wagner&apos;s ring then disintegrates the theme into a Stravinskyesque nightmare policed by Sibelian wraiths.&quot; The reality, I discovered when I read some passages again, was that a minority of writers do it rather well, but it&apos;s hard to sustain. Cloud Atlas does it best, I think. Was I wise to attempt it myself? Probably not. As Forster said: &quot;What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?&quot; Onwards to those new horizons - tremolos from the violas, muted brass, the cellos rumbling out the first subject ... \u00b7 Clare Morrall&apos;s The Language of Others is published by Sceptre (\u00a312.99)", "sentences": ["It all has to be more subtle, as in Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam, where the composer Clive Linley works on a symphony while on holiday in the Lake District."], "title": "Clare Morrall on writers annd music", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/12/music.emforster", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Music", "EM Forster"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-13T10:23:49Z", "article": "Her story Niki Proctor, 30, is editor and stylist for Gorgeous Couture. She lives in Manchester and is single.  I thought Warren was gorgeous the first time I met him. I was with my best mate Suddi in a coffee shop and this friend of hers came bounding over full of mad tales and enthusiasm for life. He looked good in a metrosexual way: his hair was short, spiked at the front and he was tanned. Then a few months later, Suddi and I were at a club in Manchester, and this same guy came down the stairs. I&apos;d had three hours&apos; sleep the night before and was totally unprepared. I was even wearing flat shoes, which turned out to be a good thing - Warren is an inch smaller than me and paranoid about his height. We hit it off and were together for five-and-a-half years. Warren romanticises life and our relationship started like a cheesy movie. He delivered huge bouquets of lilies to my office. He rang up my work and booked time off so I could go to Amsterdam. He delivered flu capsules in a gift box when I was ill. He bought us chopper bikes which we used to ride around Manchester. In restaurants he&apos;d order all our food on one plate and ask if we could sit next to each other. We even had our own language where we changed the ending of words. We still speak to each other a bit like that. I was 24 when I met Warren and didn&apos;t expect him to have a child. I knew it was best for Sam, his son, to have both parents around because I understood what it&apos;s like to grow up in a home when someone&apos;s missing. Sam and I became very close and he sent me Mother&apos;s Day cards. But I remember writing in my diary when I was 26: &apos;I&apos;m spending Christmas in a romantic Alpine setting and I&apos;m sleeping in double bunk beds with his son.&apos; Of course Warren and I couldn&apos;t get up to anything. At the start of the relationship his ex, Dee, made it clear that she had ownership of Warren&apos;s family, which made it difficult to build a relationship with them. His mum would always invite her round for Sunday roast and we stayed at her house over Christmas &apos;for Sam&apos;s sake&apos;. But her involvement in our lives didn&apos;t stop there. She&apos;d turn up when we were out with friends and went to the football with Warren. Warren and I were always having meetings, organising club nights, and so it was natural I&apos;d join Gorgeous Couture, the business he&apos;d started with Dee. Our skills were compatible. She&apos;s an amazing pattern-cutter, he&apos;s very creative and good at sales and I&apos;d worked in fashion and had PR skills. It looks like a bizarre love triangle but it didn&apos;t feel that way. For four years Warren and I were madly in love then he started to take me for granted. He has his own set of rules. Once he asked me to look after Sam for an hour. Dee dropped him off but Warren didn&apos;t turn up until 2pm the next day even though I&apos;d had plans to go out. I couldn&apos;t see how we had a future together because I couldn&apos;t rely on him. I wanted a relationship with a mature man, not someone who acted like a teenager. Warren put a lot of things before me, including 18-hour working days. We didn&apos;t live together and he&apos;d go out with his friends and come back two days later. We split up a year and a half ago. There wasn&apos;t a massive ending. Warren went too far and lost me for good. His reaction was to cry his eyes out and beg me to marry him but it wasn&apos;t serious - he didn&apos;t have a ring. I didn&apos;t take any time off; luckily I could avoid him by working from home and the design studio. We&apos;ve both had relationships since and have had to adjust. Even now and then Warren will send me a gift box containing my favourite brownies. It would be dead easy for me to get back with him and we&apos;d have a great life, but I don&apos;t want to cross that line. His story Warren Bard, 34, creative director of Gorgeous Couture, is single and lives in Manchester. The first conversation I had with Niki was quite rude. I can&apos;t imagine talking to anyone else like that. We spent the night egging each other on at Aficionado - a Sunday recovery session in Manchester. We&apos;re really confident people anyway and it helped that I&apos;d been out drinking all day. But we didn&apos;t kiss until our first date. I was invited to a pimps-and-hookers party and I needed a date so I asked her. Even though it was in an old brothel on the outskirts of Manchester it wasn&apos;t seedy - it was a Looks magazine party. We dressed up in massive fur coats and had a fantastic time. Niki left mine the next day when I went to the Newcastle game (I support Man City). I missed her immediately and sent her a cheesy text saying: &apos;I&apos;ve just been to a service station and bought a pen with your name on it.&apos; I was disappointed when I didn&apos;t hear back. That week she invited me to a pub quiz and we went from there. Sex was important - it was the most sexually active relationship I&apos;ve had - and I really fancied her, but it didn&apos;t drive us. I was so happy because we were constantly chatting and doing bizarre things. I couldn&apos;t believe it when Niki told me that she&apos;d never been bought flowers. So I bought four bunches and took them to her office. Once I wore a T-shirt with her name on it and she wore one that said Warren. We became known in the area as &apos;Warreniki&apos; and had our own logo. Now we&apos;re not together I still do romantic things for her. Girls are always on diets so I&apos;ll go to KFC because I know she likes their chips and gravy and I&apos;ll leave the bag outside her door to cheer her up. I wasn&apos;t looking for a relationship when I met Niki because I&apos;ve always had a girlfriend and wanted to play the field. I&apos;d been having an on/off relationship with Dee, who is the mother of my son Sam and business partner. If Niki had said: &apos;I don&apos;t want you having any contact with Dee,&apos; I would have finished with her. I wasn&apos;t going to change my lifestyle because I was sleeping with her. I was a bit selfish and inconsiderate. My parents split up when I was 11 and since then I&apos;ve done what I wanted. I come from a council estate and have built up my own business. I&apos;ve got my beliefs and I&apos;m not going to act the way you want me to. I didn&apos;t know my dad but I speak to Sam every day. My time with him is precious. If I&apos;d asked Niki to marry me she would have said yes, but I didn&apos;t and she never pushed the question. If it had been a normal relationship we&apos;d have moved in together within a year but I wanted my independence so we had separate apartments, 100 metres apart. Life&apos;s quite long. I&apos;m 34 and still feel like a young boy. Niki has that hunger to be a mum but I&apos;ve had Sam and put a lot of time in with him. Having another child is a big commitment. I&apos;m 70 per cent responsible for the demise of our relationship. It&apos;s not that we lost interest or other individuals were involved; I should have met her in the middle. Things came to a head when I stayed out one weekend and came back drunk. Then I let her down the weekend after. Niki started dating a surgeon soon after that. He was the opposite to me - a smartly dressed gentleman who took her to the ballet. I sent her a card. It was based on the poster of The Break-Up and I superimposed her face on Jennifer Aniston&apos;s and mine on Vince Vaughn&apos;s. Inside I told her how amazing she is. She&apos;s got it on her fridge. Niki put a lot of time and effort into our relationship, and she feels angry when friends get married and they don&apos;t have 10 per cent of what we had. I&apos;d be lying if I said I&apos;m not sad. I&apos;d love us to settle down and have kids together in the future.", "sentences": ["He rang up my work and booked time off so I could go to Amsterdam."], "title": "The Ex Files: Niki Proctor and Warren Bard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/13/familyandrelationships.shopping", "tags": ["Life and style", "Relationships"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-13T12:02:00Z", "article": "Tomorrow I am going to Milan. And I am going to use the train. Europe&apos;s high-speed rail network is still a work in progress, sketchy in parts. Some places, Amsterdam for example, are incongruously difficult to access, but on certain long-distance routes, trains already offer a prospect of fast, convenient, comfortable travel. Enjoyable, too. It is a long, long time since pleasure was an element of the air travel formula. Can anybody now say the prospect of flying fills them with anything other than a lowering dread? The rapidly changing culture of air travel is one of the significant characteristics of our age. Within a generation, what was once a romantic, privileged adventure has turned into a humiliating ordeal. Unless you are in prison or have recently been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, no other experience in contemporary life requires an individual so completely to forgo his independence and endure such joyless, harrowing regimentation as travelling by plane.  It&apos;s not fear of flying. It&apos;s fear of airports. Psychologists know that the most rapid way to acquire debilitating, full-blown angst is to sacrifice a sense of control. This is admirably explained in Patricia Pearson&apos;s splendid new book, A Brief History of Anxiety. Step into an airport, then on to an aircraft and your destiny is no longer your own. You have gifted it to strangers on the flight deck, air traffic control, the weather and to baggage handling systems. The result is anguish. True, I have never actually met a train driver and I would not care to jump off a TGV travelling at 300km/h, but rail at least provides a plausible illusion of control and security. So my trip to Milan will be something like this. An early morning glass of champagne under WH Barlow&apos;s magnificent roof of St Pancras. On to the train with an armful of papers, magazines, books. I&apos;ll take a fresh notebook and some new Pilot roller-ball pens to write all those things I never have time to write in London. Oh and I&apos;ll probably look out the window a bit too. In Paris, a quick cab ride to Le Train Bleu, the wonderful belle \u00e9poque restaurant in the Gare de Lyon which Michelin Rouge rightly describes as a &apos;superbe et exceptionnel buffet de gare&apos;.  Here, I&apos;m going to introduce a friend&apos;s teenage son to the magic of proper steak frites. Then I will saunter to the Milan train. Tranquillised by lunch, I may doze. Or I may read Mark Twain&apos;s Can-cans, Cats and Cities of Ash, his European travel book, because I&apos;m certainly not going to at any other time. A car meets me at Milan&apos;s fabulously mad station, dump bag at hotel and I&apos;ll be having a reflective dinner in Antico Ristorante Boeucc before you can say: &apos;Baggage reclaim.&apos;  The same journey by air would, without delays, be rather quicker, but however long it took, I would arrive harassed and fretful, possibly without luggage. Certainly, at all times, I would have been exposed to officiousness, ugliness, discomfort and terrible food. So I know what I prefer. There are other variations. I recently went overnight to Barcelona on the Trenotel, since 1996 a joint-venture between the French and Spanish national railways. You have to have an astronaut&apos;s positive take on claustrophobia, but you can get a pleasant double berth with a surprisingly efficient bathroom and Niagaras of hot water. Contortionists will cope best with undressing, but by the time you are ready for that, you are either deranged by lust or pleasantly relaxed after rabbit stew and Ribeira del Duero in the excellent restaurant car. And you arrive in Barcelona at breakfast, composure and nerves intact.  In contrast, consider a recent flight to Munich for lunch. There was fog, so there were delays. Munich&apos;s airport is a long way out of town (while railways stations are usually in town centres) and there was a crash on the Leopoldstrasse and traffic was fouled up, so I got to my appointment about the same time as my intended flight back. I shouldn&apos;t have worried. Two flights were cancelled, so I had plenty of time. And I spent it looking at sad, tired folk wheeling their bags in the sort of circles Dante described, staring disconsolately at the sort of &apos;luxury&apos; goods airport operators alone so very wrongly imagine beguile us. What a horrible, inhuman, artless culture air travel has become. Last week&apos;s report by the Association of Train Operating Companies argues for a national commitment to high-speed rail. It imagines a second Channel tunnel to France and another under the Irish Sea to Dublin. Trains have never been more popular and as the allure of air travel turns into ordure, they will likely become more popular still.  If I am honest, this may be something of a threat. What if the hordes currently circulating indefinitely in the lightless intestines of Gatwick North discovered the delights of a comfortable seat, the poetry of passing landscape and the convenience of city centre termini? What if they changed their minds and got on my train ? This is something I can worry about tomorrow, my book on my lap, glass in hand as I watch Burgundy slip past.", "sentences": ["Some places, Amsterdam for example, are incongruously difficult to access, but on certain long-distance routes, trains already offer a prospect of fast, convenient, comfortable travel."], "title": "Stephen Bayley: Want to rediscover the joy of travel?

But this month Boeing revealed that it already exists, and made three test flights in February and March at the company&apos;s European research centre near Madrid. Admittedly, it has room for only two people, but Boeing claim it is the first manned plane in the history of aviation to be powered by fuel cells, which run on hydrogen, converting it through a chemical reaction into electricity and water, with none of the pollution associated with combustion engines.  The plane, which has taken five years to develop, has a wingspan of 200ft and flew at 60mph for 20 minutes. The development comes on the back of several other advances in green technology. January saw the maiden flight of Electra, a single-seater battery-powered experimental plane developed in France, while in February Virgin flew a Boeing 747 part-fuelled by biodiesel from London to Amsterdam.  Unfortunately, it&apos;s a little early to pop the champagne and stop worrying about climate change. Boeing says it will keep investigating fuel cell technology, but does not envisage it will be possible to use it to power large passenger planes.  Environmental campaigners remain deeply sceptical of the developments. The aviation industry is afraid of the government taking action - increasing taxes, stopping airport expansion - so it is trying to persuade the powers-that-be that it can solve the problem with technology,&apos; said Richard Dyer, aviation campaigner for Friends of the Earth. &apos;At present, the reduction in emissions due to technological advances is 1 per cent each year, but air travel is growing at more than 7 per cent a year.&apos; The immediate outlook is far from rosy. Boeing&apos;s long-anticipated 787, which is built of carbon fibre, meaning that it is lighter and uses 20 per cent less fuel than comparable airliners, was due to go into service next month. But last week the company announced further delays would mean it will now not enter service until late 2009 at the earliest.", "sentences": ["January saw the maiden flight of Electra, a single-seater battery-powered experimental plane developed in France, while in February Virgin flew a Boeing 747 part-fuelled by biodiesel from London to Amsterdam."], "title": "Is green air travel becoming a reality?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/apr/13/hottopic.carbonemissions", "tags": ["The hot topic", "Travel", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-14T23:04:52Z", "article": "Once, a few pints and some risque entertainment would have been more than enough, but in recent times the British stag do has evolved into a weekend-long festival of drink, debauchery and go-karting.

Far more unexpected - at least much more unexpected than tales of a trouserless Hazza drinking bitter and Red Bull through a hosepipe and funnel - was the location. Instead of Dublin, Newquay or Amsterdam, the party plumped for the Isle of Wight. One suspects this was all the idea of some judicious aide tasked with finding the least exciting place on earth. Indeed, if there are strippers on the Isle of Wight one imagines them to be Miss Marple-themed and to give away free fudge at the end.  In brief, it is the most sedate place in the United Kingdom - it makes Worthing look like New Orleans and its main attraction is a theme park, Blackgang Chine, whose biggest thrill is that part of it slips down the cliff into the sea every year. Maybe Phillips is a fan of model villages, its gnome garden or decommissioned London Underground trains (which end up here, like old colonels, in retirement). Or maybe he demanded to visit the only place in the world where you can fill up a small, hollow glass bear with stripes of different coloured sand. In fact, the answer is more mundane.

The healthy clutch of new ventures - 10 fresh productions next season - comes on the back of attendance this season averaging 82%, and a predicted surplus against budget of \u00a31m. It is the healthiest set of figures for a decade at ENO, which six years ago was fighting bankruptcy. Kiarostami, director of Taste of Cherry and Through the Olive Trees, will direct the Mozart comedy Cos\u00ec fan tutte - something of a departure, perhaps, for a man whose masterpiece concerns a suicidal man driving around the labour markets of Tehran to find a man to dig his grave. &quot;I&apos;ve admired his work for a long time,&quot; said ENO artistic director John Berry. &quot;He has always said that with films, he will work with whatever constraints he has to, and he is aware of the limitations of opera. He&apos;s very good at directing intense relationships between people in his films, which I think will be perfect for Cos\u00ec. I think it&apos;s a good idea that he didn&apos;t choose a big chorus piece as his first opera.&quot; Shaw, most recently seen on the London stage buried from the neck down in Beckett&apos;s Happy Days at the National Theatre, will direct Ralph Vaughan Williams&apos;s Riders to the Sea, his one-act opera based on JM Synge&apos;s play. Set in the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland, the drama centres on Maurya, who has lost eight men of her family to the implacable sea. Other firsts for the company next season include a libretto translation by Lee Hall, the writer of Billy Elliot. Hall will translate and adapt Leoncavallo&apos;s Pagliacci, to be directed in a double bill with Cavalleria rusticana by Richard Jones. Asked whether Hall&apos;s Pagliacci would be as fruity as his Billy Elliot, music director Ed Gardner said: &quot;He doesn&apos;t want to see expletive after expletive on our surtitles, so he&apos;s already taking reams of them out.&quot; Hall refers in the new season programme to the opera&apos;s &quot;low exclamations and filthy curses&quot;. Berry said it was sometimes a struggle to persuade theatre and film directors to work in opera - notwithstanding the success of, for example, the late Anthony Minghella&apos;s production of Madam Butterfly. &quot;They can see opera as conservative; and on the whole in London it is quite conservative. If you go to Berlin, Amsterdam, or Paris, it is much less so. &quot;One first-time opera director has said that going into opera is like going into a gated community - and you are likely to be mugged on the way. If the director does not have inner confidence, then you are in trouble. The film industry is tough, but some film directors don&apos;t believe how tough and savage the opera world is.&quot; Another figure from the film world who will make her operatic stage debut is Penny Woolcock, whose film for Channel 4 of John Adams&apos;s opera The Death of Klinghoffer won multiple awards. She will take on Adams&apos;s latest work, Doctor Atomic, about Robert Oppenheimer&apos;s development of the atom bomb. The new production will be made in collaboration with the Metropolitan Opera, New York; the opera itself was first seen in San Francisco in 2005. The company will also premiere L&apos;Amour de loin, a major new work by Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho with a libretto by the Lebanese novelist Amin Maalouf. Gardner said that ENO was fully intending to stage new works from British composers: Julian Anderson, he said, was under commission from ENO. That work, he said, &quot;will be staged when Julian has finished writing it&quot;. A new, as yet unnamed work based on Purcell&apos;s Dido and Aeneas will be devised by director Katie Mitchell; it will be produced in the Young Vic, where ENO is currently staging a sell-out run of Olga Neuwirth&apos;s Lost Highway, based on the David Lynch film, and Harrison Birtwistle&apos;s Punch and Judy, which opens on Saturday. The death of Minghella has meant the cancelling of various plans: he was to have directed a new Eugene Onegin in the 2008-9 season. Looking further ahead, he was also due to create a new staging of Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion, and direct a new opera with composer Osvaldo Golijov, the libretto of which he was also to write. As a tribute to Minghella, ENO will revive his Madam Butterfly production next season. The company also made \u00a37m from selling workshops in Stepney, in the East End of London. The expense of moving to new premises and of &quot;restructuring&quot; (losing 60 jobs from the company) accounted for \u00a32.5m of that, but ENO now has what it calls a &quot;buffer zone&quot; of reserves. Much of the prop and set making formerly carried out in the old workshops will now be outsourced.

For untold millions around the world raised on a diet of American pop culture, its landmarks and place names - the skyscraping Manhattan skyline, the Statue of Liberty, yellow cabs, Fifth Avenue, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Greenwich Village - are instantly recognisable. But wandering around the city&apos;s straightforward grid system, the visitor is struck by the dizzying profusion of everyday icons, in the form of road signs, public notices and advertisements which tell their own story about this metropolis and provide an interesting sign of our times. I don&apos;t believe I have ever seen as much street advertising as I have in the Big Apple. Everywhere you turn, you are bombarded by messages urging you to buy, spend and acquire. Although I admire the irresistible energy and culture which has drawn an old college friend of mine to make New York his home for most of his adult life, I find this intense commercialisation something of a turn off. The ultimate manifestation of this is to be found on Times Square. This rectangular slice of Manhattan can best be described as psychedelic and navigating it is akin to what I imagine tripping on LSD would be like. The casual stroller is bombarded with giant images of television anchors, sporting events, musicals, not to mention Titan-sized M&amp;Ms climbing the Empire State building in King Kong fashion. Our first jet-lagged day felt as if we were sleep-walking through a surreal advertiser&apos;s dream. Of course, New York, established as New Amsterdam by the Dutch east India company in the 17th century, has always regarded commerce as its lifeblood. Viewed from the top of the Rockefeller Centre, the city&apos;s most prized freedom - judging by the brightly lit Manhattan skyline and the lonely Statue of Liberty on a little island illuminated by her dim torch - is the freedom to trade. To my mind, New York is an extreme illustration of a challenge facing many other places: what are the psychological effects of intensive advertising and how far can matters go before we begin to consider advertising to be an intrusion on our privacy or excessive psychological manipulation? Today&apos;s society is concerned about second-hand tobacco smoke and the effects of pollution, but what about the health ramifications of this kind of visual pollution? Does it cause stress? Can this litany of aspirational messages cause people to feel bad about themselves and their lives? New York (like many other American cities) also seeks to provide its inhabitants with a comprehensive instruction manual on how to use and interact with the city: a sort of Big Apple for dummies. And, judging by the lack of confidence in the average citizen&apos;s intelligence reflected in some of these signs, &quot;dummies&quot; is an apt description. For instance, on one toilet door hangs the enlightening notice: &quot;Occupied when door is locked.&quot; Now, who would&apos;ve thought that a locked bog door means someone is taking a dump inside? The New York subway system is plastered with rules and edicts spelling out in minute detail what commuters and travellers may and may not do. One poster lists no fewer than 18 punishable violations. These range from the obvious, such as failing to pay the proper fee, to those that go beyond the call of obtuseness, such as telling passengers they are not allowed to lie down. The most bizarre is the insistence that passengers may not ride a scooter in the subway, which makes you wonder how many New Yorkers actually whiz down the stairs and along the platform on a Vespa or, for that matter, even own a scooter. This rash of notices has not gone unremarked. The Museum of Modern Art&apos;s gift shop sells a sign which reads: &quot;Thank you for noticing this new notice. Your noting it has been noted.&quot; One public notice has had me completely stumped since my first visit to the US some years ago. The landing form visitor must fill out asks: &quot;Do you seek to enter the US to engage in ... subversive or terrorist activities?&quot; Does that mean that, besides the regular tourist visa, there is a special terrorist visa or something? Does it allow you to enter the entire US or just that exclusive beachside terrorist resort in Guant\u00e1namo? Personally, I&apos;d be very interested in seeing some statistics on how many people actually ticked the &quot;yes&quot; box for this question and what happened to them afterwards. Of course, I was tempted to do just that, you know, for a laugh. But I stayed my hand recalling a warning from the wise that bureaucracy does not have a sense of humour. Now call me a poor judge of character, but I doubt any would-be attacker would be quite so forthcoming about the purpose of their visit. Naturally, bureaucracies the world over are hardly famed for their attachment to reality, but there seems to be something a little extra here. This could be an extreme manifestation of the US&apos;s litigation-obsessed culture. Perhaps the designer of this form was aiming to avoid a lawsuit by victims of future attacks by creating a fallback position in which the government could claim that it wasn&apos;t their fault because the attackers lied on their immigration form. And there are plenty of other manifestations of this litigation mentality. Ever since Liebeck vs McDonald&apos;s, you can&apos;t enjoy a warm beverage in the US - where mugs and cups seem to be on their way to extinction - without the rather self-evident warning, &quot;caution: extremely hot&quot;, staring up at you from the lid of your coffee. While there is a case for being as clear as possible, this dumbed-down, comprehensive signposting of daily life is insulting to people&apos;s intelligence. Could the distrust these signs reveal in people&apos;s common sense lead them to adopt a less responsible attitude in public spaces? Could advertiser&apos;s ceaseless, unrelenting sensory bombardment stress pedestrians out too much, leading to some kind of pavement, or sidewalk, rage? How do signs and billboards affect the aesthetics of our cities? Despite growing recognition of graffiti as urban art, it is widely seen as a defacement of our public spaces. A debate is needed on how much advertising and other signage we should tolerate in our urban areas. New York and other cities need a movement to reclaim the streets from that other breed of vandals in sharp suits.", "sentences": ["Of course, New York, established as New Amsterdam by the Dutch east India company in the 17th century, has always regarded commerce as its lifeblood."], "title": "Signs of the times", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/16/signsofthetimes", "tags": ["US news", "Advertising"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-16T15:40:19Z", "article": "NO BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER Simon and Garfunkel.

Cruyff had led the Oranje all the way to the 1974 final, where they were squashed by West Germany, but he controversially opted out of the 1978 edition without giving an explanation ... until now. Plenty of theories have been posited: that Cruyff was a conscientious objector, refusing to travel to Argentina so as not to give a propaganda coup to the military junta that ran the country at the time; that he stayed away on the orders of his wife, who four years earlier had spent the night before the 1974 final arguing with the three-times European Footballer of the Year after a German tabloid published sordid allegations about a swimming pool, scantily-clad floozies and excited Dutch squad members; or simply that, at 31, Cruyff feared he was over the hill. But now Cruyff has revealed to Radio Cataluyna that he stayed at home because he was still racked by fear after he and his family were threatened with a rifle during a failed kidnap attempt the previous year. &quot;I had a rifle at my head, I was tied up, my wife tied up, the children were in the apartment in Barcelona,&quot; recalled Cruyff, who didn&apos;t explain how the ordeal ended but said that the family needed police protection for the next four months. Under the circumstances, Cruyff didn&apos;t feel he could concentrate on the World Cup. &quot;To play a World Cup you have to be 200%,&quot; said Cruyff. &quot;There are moments when there are other values in life.&quot; Some may say that, as is turned out, Holland didn&apos;t miss him - after all, they still made it to the 1978 final where they were beaten by the hosts, just as they did four years earlier.

Photograph: Will Brady Until I moved to Amsterdam, my vision of the city was a clich\u00e9d composite of cycle lanes and canals, museums and multiculturalism, Queen&apos;s Day celebrations and liberal-mindedness. I hadn&apos;t thought much about issues like the toughening of immigration laws or lack of affordable accommodation. On the other hand, there were also positive dimensions to Amsterdam&apos;s culture that I had overlooked: its literary scene, for instance. On April 23, World Book and Copyright Day, Amsterdam will be officially inaugurated as World Book Capital 2008. The ensuing year-long programme of events centres around an &apos;open book&apos; theme, a reminder that Amsterdam&apos;s infamous tolerance doesn&apos;t just equate to legal coffeeshops and brothels - rather, it was vital in the city&apos;s development as a refuge for the written word. In the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, owing to its lack of government censorship, the city became renowned as a safe haven for the book trade, home to printers and booksellers, as well as controversial writers and philosophers such as Spinoza and Descartes. In more recent history, after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, works by exiled writers such as Bertolt Brecht, Max Brod and Joseph Roth were published in Amsterdam. Today, books here are almost as ubiquitous as tulips. Every Friday, Spui Square fills with stalls run by booksellers, and, on 18 May this year, coinciding with the Amsterdam International Literary Festival, the world&apos;s largest book market (with over 1,000 stalls) will meander its way through the streets of the city. Even at my local food market, there are several decent second-hand bookstalls from which I&apos;ve happily bought books in the manner of shopping-list staples, unceremoniously adding a four-euro copy of Virginia Woolf&apos;s The Death of the Moth and Other Essays to my bag along with a clutch of onions and some heavy bread. I also love the ritual of browsing and buying in a bookshop, and so, it seems, do the Dutch: last year, a record number of books - over 45 million - were sold in the Netherlands. In addition to branches of large chains, Amsterdam is packed with a high concentration of thriving independent, second-hand and antiquarian bookshops, most of which sell books in English and other languages as well as Dutch. Some of my favourite bookshops are found in the &apos;9 Straatjes&apos; (Nine Little Streets), a village-y area near the canals. Culturel is run by Hans and Ina Cramer, who I like to imagine spending their non-working hours amid a snug muddle of crosswords, sleeping dogs and homemade cake. Their business oozes quintessential second-hand bookshoppishness, with precarious towers of tomes and ceiling-to-floor shelves crammed with literature, art and history books hand-picked by Ina. None of them is catalogued; there is no computer, let alone a website, or even a till. Among other books, I have bought an Esperanto translation of The Little Prince here, and also a copy of The Diary of a Nobody, mainly because I liked the fact that on the inside cover Hans has written &apos;very funny&apos;. Nearby, the sleeker JOOT sells second-hand and antiquarian books. In the long, light-filled front room, a smattering of media types browse the fiction, art and photography monographs, or covet rare copies of the Amsterdam School&apos;s magazine Wendigen, while downstairs in the basement, there&apos;s a mustier, eclectic selection of multilingual titles. With its bright postcard racks and &apos;Two lips from Amsterdam&apos; t-shirts in the window, Boekie Woekie&apos;s veil of whimsy disguises the fact that it is serious about representing the phenomenon of self-published artists&apos; books, from the beautiful to the downright bizarre. This artist-run shop values freethinkers, both authors and readers - for as Jan Voss, one of the owners, explained to me, &quot;If you have any feeling for figuring [things] out yourself, you don&apos;t buy the books which they write big pieces on in the newspaper.&quot; In Western Europe today, it may seem that the literary safe haven Amsterdam was once renowned as is no longer needed. However, as mass-produced, media-boosted mainstream titles fill the large bookshops, the content of what is published and sold, even if not threatened by political censorship, is increasingly filtered by market forces. These kinds of independent shops, selling diverse and hand-selected stock, are not merely pleasant places for bibliophiles to visit: they are vital institutions for a genuine world book capital.", "sentences": ["Casual browsing: One of Amsterdam&apos;s countless bookshops.", "Photograph: Will Brady Until I moved to Amsterdam, my vision of the city was a clich\u00e9d composite of cycle lanes and canals, museums and multiculturalism, Queen&apos;s Day celebrations and liberal-mindedness.", "On the other hand, there were also positive dimensions to Amsterdam&apos;s culture that I had overlooked: its literary scene, for instance.", "On April 23, World Book and Copyright Day, Amsterdam will be officially inaugurated as World Book Capital 2008.", "The ensuing year-long programme of events centres around an &apos;open book&apos; theme, a reminder that Amsterdam&apos;s infamous tolerance doesn&apos;t just equate to legal coffeeshops and brothels - rather, it was vital in the city&apos;s development as a refuge for the written word.", "In more recent history, after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, works by exiled writers such as Bertolt Brecht, Max Brod and Joseph Roth were published in Amsterdam.", "Every Friday, Spui Square fills with stalls run by booksellers, and, on 18 May this year, coinciding with the Amsterdam International Literary Festival, the world&apos;s largest book market (with over 1,000 stalls) will meander its way through the streets of the city.", "In addition to branches of large chains, Amsterdam is packed with a high concentration of thriving independent, second-hand and antiquarian bookshops, most of which sell books in English and other languages as well as Dutch.", "In the long, light-filled front room, a smattering of media types browse the fiction, art and photography monographs, or covet rare copies of the Amsterdam School&apos;s magazine Wendigen, while downstairs in the basement, there&apos;s a mustier, eclectic selection of multilingual titles.", "With its bright postcard racks and &apos;Two lips from Amsterdam&apos; t-shirts in the window, Boekie Woekie&apos;s veil of whimsy disguises the fact that it is serious about representing the phenomenon of self-published artists&apos; books, from the beautiful to the downright bizarre.", "This artist-run shop values freethinkers, both authors and readers - for as Jan Voss, one of the owners, explained to me, &quot;If you have any feeling for figuring [things] out yourself, you don&apos;t buy the books which they write big pieces on in the newspaper.&quot; In Western Europe today, it may seem that the literary safe haven Amsterdam was once renowned as is no longer needed."], "title": "Amsterdam: literature's capital city", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/17/amsterdamliteraturescapital", "tags": ["Festivals", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-18T23:08:37Z", "article": "Imagine a holiday with no hotel bill to pay and even the use of a car thrown in for free. A holiday where you get to live like a local, but have all the comforts of your own home. This holiday is not only possible, it could be one of the cheapest - and most rewarding - you&apos;ll ever take. In the post credit crunch world, in which we are all expecting increases in mortgage payments, it is no surprise that house swapping is undergoing something of a renaissance. Websites connecting people who are looking to swap homes are doing brisk business. The fact that the pound is only buying \u20ac1.25 (compared with the \u20ac1.50 or so that most of us have got used to) provides a further incentive for anyone who wants a reasonably priced holiday this year to investigate swapping their home. If you&apos;re new to it, it may seem a little daunting. But in reality, the risks are small and the rewards can be great. For two or three weeks, you swap your home, and to some extent your lifestyle, with another person or family living in the UK or another country. In cost terms it can&apos;t be beaten. Most swapping websites require a registration fee (see below) but after that, all you have to do is to get yourself to your chosen location - the accommodation is free. Why pay hundreds or even thousands of pounds to rent a hotel room or bleak holiday cottage, when you can be tucked up in someone else&apos;s lovely home? Home swapping does need a bit of planning and it takes time to set up. You can&apos;t decide on the Friday that you&apos;d like to leave the following Monday. It also helps if you live somewhere attractive - although people with ordinary houses in mundane areas are also offered exchanges. To get going couldn&apos;t be easier. Start at one of the websites that list people from all over the world who are looking to exchange homes. The sites will generally show a few pictures of the property, including details of amenities, describe the people looking to swap, and when and where they are looking to exchange. Many swappers are &quot;open to offers&quot;. Most swaps are generally for two to four weeks, although some people will swap for as little as a weekend. If you like the look of one or more properties, simply sign up. Post details of your own home including a few pictures, and start contacting the people concerned. Experienced home exchangers say that once you have found a likely candidate, it is well worth spending time talking with potential swapees to make sure both parties know exactly what to expect. They say it helps if you are candid about your house - if a railway line runs past the end of your garden, the general view is that you have to be upfront about it. Many swappers are happy to include their car - although this requires extra insurance. They also advise that the two parties have an informal contract which sets out who will be arriving when, and who will pay for what. Some swappers ask for references - and it is worth doing a few basic checks to establish your guests are who they say they are. Most swappers pay their utility bills while the other family is in their house, although telephone calls are generally paid by the guests. It is a good idea to lock valuables away because, in the unlikely event that anything goes missing, your insurer will not pay out.  If you are the sort of person who is obsessed with keeping your home &quot;just-so&quot; then house swapping may not be for you. &quot;Many people are concerned about handing their home over to what they think is a complete stranger, but they shouldn&apos;t be,&quot; according to Lois Sealey, who runs the Home Base Holidays exchange, which has arranged link-ups for a number of companies including the Guardian. She adds: &quot;If you are diligent in talking to the people you are planning to swap with, you should have become friends by the time the actual exchange happens. Given that you will be in their house while they are in yours, the risks are minimal. In many years of doing this, we&apos;ve come across very few incidents where things have gone wrong.&quot; She says that although many people initially swap homes as a way of saving money, they soon find that the other benefits more than match the financial savings. &quot;Experienced swappers say they get so much more out of the holiday by swapping homes than they would if they just visited an area as a tourist. They like the fact that they get the inside track on somewhere, and get to meet people and do things they would not have done had they taken a traditional holiday. They keep saying that once you&apos;ve done a swap, you won&apos;t want to ever stay in a hotel again.&quot; Find the swap site that meets your needs The biggest home swap website is HomeLink (homelink.org.uk). It has thousands of swaps all over the world, but it is also the most expensive - \u00a3115 a year. A cheaper option is the Guardian&apos;s site, Guardian Home Exchange (guardianhomeexchange.co.uk). It is run by Home Base Holidays and costs from \u00a335 a year to join. Home Base Holidays&apos;s own site (homebase-hols.com) costs from \u00a329 a year. Another big site is HomeForExchange.com. It offers more properties than the Guardian site and costs \u00a337 a year. If you only want to swap in the UK and have children, the National Childbirth Trust operates a swap service between members - details at nctwgc.org.uk/houseswap.htm. Teacher Home Swap (teacherhomeswap.com) is a dedicated free service aimed at international teachers. The site SabbaticalHomes.com is aimed at academics looking for longer swaps - they pay \u00a318 to list their property. The gay and lesbian site Mi Casa Su Casa (gayhometrade.com) charges $75 (\u00a338) to list your home for five years. The Independent Living Institute (independentliving.org) has a swap page to help disabled people with similar needs swap their homes. After conquering the UK, the plan is to go abroad for the Gibson family ... After 10 successful house exchanges, Nicola Gibson is something of a veteran. She and her husband Giulio have taken their family all over the UK,in each case swapping their three-bedroom terraced home in the Queen&apos;s Park area of Brighton. Last August they spent a week at the Edinburgh Festival, staying in a smart flat in Morningside. This summer they are off to Amsterdam, their first foreign trip. House swaps have been such a success that they wouldn&apos;t now consider going on holiday in any other way. &quot;Living on a single, modest income, we initially started swapping because, having three young children, we simply couldn&apos;t afford to pay for hotels or bed-and-breakfasts. &quot;Also, because we don&apos;t have a car \u2014 and don&apos;t want to get one \u2014 house swaps are perfect because when you travel by train, you are limited in what you can carry. &quot;Camping is simply out of the question,&quot; she says. She initially organised all the family&apos;s swaps through the National Childbirth Trust. To extend their horizons abroad, they have since signed up with the Guardian&apos;s website. As well as longer holidays, they regularly swap houses for a weekend. &quot;We have been all over the UK and we haven&apos;t had a bad experience. Oneof the great things about swapping houses with other couples who are at a similar stage, is that they tend to have lots of toys to play with. It&apos;s great getting the inside tips on a place, and having money while you are there to spend on things like eating out. &quot;The only bad thing about it is having to make your home all spick and span for the people coming to stay in your place. We always leave some fresh flowers and a few goodies for the people staying here \u2014 it gets the whole thing off to a great start,&quot; she says.", "sentences": ["This summer they are off to Amsterdam, their first foreign trip."], "title": "Try taking your next holiday at home - somebody else's", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/apr/19/consumeraffairs", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-18T23:24:32Z", "article": "Homesick, by Eshkol Nevo, translated by Sondra Silverston (Chatto, \u00a312.99) At the heart of Eshkol Nevo&apos;s wise and humane book is the chaotic love affair between two young students. Noa is studying photography in Jerusalem, Amir psychology in Tel Aviv, so they compromise by living together between the two, in the politically charged village of el-Castel. Part of Palestine until 1948, el-Castel was then taken over by Jewish settlers. It is now 1995, and Israel is reeling from the recent assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Noa and Amir&apos;s exuberant lovemaking and quarrelling cannot drown out the sorrow emanating through the party wall of their flat. Neighbours Moshe and Sima&apos;s eldest son has been killed in Lebanon; their second, Yotam, feels neglected. Both Sima and Yotam turn to Amir in different ways as he and Noa&apos;s intense relationship begins to implode.

The End of the Alphabet, by CS Richardson (Portobello, \u00a39.99) Successful, deeply contented Ambrose Zephyr is a well-trusted creative for a famous advertising agency. He adores his book-lined house, his pre-breakfast Sunday walk in Kensington Gardens and his wife, Zappora &quot;Zipper&quot; Ashkenazi, to whom he has been married for nearly 30 years. One April day, &quot;that odd time between a thin winter and plump spring&quot;, Ambrose visits his doctor for an annual check-up, to be told that, due to the incurable nature of an inexplicable disease, time is running out for him. Fast. Fighting blind panic, Ambrose and Zipper decide to make the most of his final days by visiting every place that Ambrose has ever wanted to see in alphabetical order, from Amsterdam to Zanzibar. But will they complete their desperate whistle-stop itinerary before Ambrose dies? And does it matter if they don&apos;t? An elegant little fable, charmingly written, and a tender, grateful paean to time, love and literature. Voice Over, by C\u00e9line Curiol, translated by Sam Richard (Faber, \u00a310.99) Grim determination is necessary to get through this book, although it is less than 200 pages. It is an intense monologue by a young Parisienne infatuated with a man who is in love with another woman. Craving yet shunning intimacy as a result of disturbing events in her past, the narrator works shifts as a train announcer at the Gare du Nord and reacts to her unrequited feelings by thoroughly debasing herself in a series of depressing sexual liaisons. Socially inept at a dinner party hosted by the object of her desire, she ensures attention by announcing that she is a prostitute. It&apos;s bizarrely childish, like much of the novel, which, if the repetitive self-indulgence is overlooked, is also intelligent, sharply observant and oddly brave. Little Monsters, by Charles Lambert (Picador, \u00a314.99) When Carol is 13, her father kills her mother in a drunken argument. Carol is summarily hustled away to live above a pub with her poker-faced aunt Margot, Margot&apos;s Polish refugee husband Jozef, and their son Nicholas. Only Uncle Joey is kind; Margot displays a scarcely disguised hatred for her. Years later, Carol is ensconced in a comforting partnership with Jozef, and works with displaced refugee children. After teenager Kakuna is rescued from a boat carrying illegal immigrants, Carol befriends the girl. To Jozef&apos;s dismay, her identification with Kakuna becomes disproportionate, and forces the couple to confront their pasts - Jozef the horrors of the second world war, Carol her family history. The parts of the book dealing with Carol&apos;s adolescence are very good indeed, but the more contemporary passages appear spurious and incidental.", "sentences": ["Fighting blind panic, Ambrose and Zipper decide to make the most of his final days by visiting every place that Ambrose has ever wanted to see in alphabetical order, from Amsterdam to Zanzibar."], "title": "First novels: Apr 19", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview16", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-19T23:00:20Z", "article": "At the start of 1988, the London club scene was ripe for change. Rare groove and hip hop had dominated for a few years, but a select few DJs and clubs were popularising a new music called acid house. The two formative clubs were Shoom and Future, run by Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold, inspired by an infamous trip to Ibiza the previous summer. Danny Rampling (DJ and founder of Shoom): You will always get people saying &apos;My mate played &quot;acid house&quot; back in 1984,&apos; and some of the records had been around for a couple of years, but it wasn&apos;t until 1988 that it exploded and took the whole country by storm. Myself, Nicky Holloway, Johnny Walker and Paul Oakenfold had a complete revelation in Amnesia the summer before and were totally inspired. I had a crystal-clear vision of what I wanted to create back in England, and I&apos;m sure the others both felt the same. Carl Cox (DJ): I supplied the sound system for the first two Shoom club nights. Danny Rampling asked me to come down because he knew I was already into the music. It was in a fitness centre on Southwark Street in south London, but what happened in there was like nothing that had gone before. This whole rare groove movement had lasted for years in London but it couldn&apos;t really go any further, whereas house music pointed the way forward. Terry Farley (DJ and founder of Boys Own fanzine): At first you just had little pockets of people who knew about acid house. The very first people to get into it were those from London, Manchester and Sheffield who had been out working in Ibiza in the summers of 1986 and &apos;87 and been exposed to it there. Pete Tong (DJ): At that stage what we were playing was part acid house, part balearic and part rare groove. Mark Moore (S&apos;Express): It was a tiny little scene at first and felt really special. It had so much energy. At the time London was really into rare groove and hip hop and some people were saying house music is just not right for London. I remember saying if the drug of choice changes, people will get into the music, because the drug of choice then was weed. And people just laughed at me. Wayne Anthony (promoter of Genesis raves): I had taken ecstasy in Tenerife the summer before, but it hadn&apos;t really done anything for me. Then someone took me to Future one night. I didn&apos;t really know what to expect. I turned up in a three grand suit! Everyone looked like they had just come back from Ibiza. I had half an E and was totally euphoric. There was a huge positive energy being given out by everyone and I just knew it was something special. I knew it could change my life. Originating in Chicago in the early Eighties, house music took its name from a club called the Warehouse. What became known as acid house was characterised by the alien sounds of the 303 synth on tracks such as Phuture&apos;s &apos;Acid Trax&apos;, and wasn&apos;t a reference to LSD, as some assumed. But the arrival from Amsterdam of a new drug had a huge impact. Mark Moore: It definitely took ecstasy to change things. People would take their first ecstasy and it was almost as if they were born again. They suddenly got it: &apos;Oh my God, this is amazing!&apos; You could watch these people walk into the club as one person and walk out as a different person at the end of the night. We did think: &apos;Wow, this is going to change the entire universe. We are going to stop wars; we are going to stop people being repressed in other countries. We are going to elevate to a whole new level of consciousness.&apos; There was this very spiritual side to it originally. Nicky Holloway (DJ): The ecstasy and the music came together. It was all part of the package. People who hadn&apos;t done ecstasy didn&apos;t really get it, and as soon as they did an E they got it. That may sound a little sad, but there&apos;s no way acid house would have taken off the way it did without ecstasy. Terry Farley: People were evangelical about Shoom. They saw Danny as some sort of acid house Billy Graham figure. I remember one girl telling me she could see his aura as he DJ&apos;d, this glow around his head [laughs]. Phil Hartnoll (Orbital): It definitely came together, the drugs and the music as part of the same package. If you look back through history, new music is quite often associated with a new drug, isn&apos;t it? Danny Rampling: The people who had been in Ibiza had brought back a bit more of a hippy-ish look - and the clubs were so hot because a lot of them were in smoky basements full of strobe lights. So, naturally, people changed their dress sense and started weating baggier clothes. Nicky Holloway: There was no game plan, everything just seemed to come together in a way that it never has since really, from the music right down to the dress sense. Nothing like this &apos;new rave&apos; scene now, which no one can pretend is really anything apart from what journalists write. There&apos;s no scene there. Pete Tong: It was all one love, everyone together. Anyone can dance all of a sudden, freedom of expression. Dress down, not up. Converse trainers, smiley T-shirts - a sort of tribalism took over. Everyone was happy to be the same. In the north of England, DJs were also spreading the acid house word, not least in Manchester. Mike Pickering (T-Coy, M-People): There was quite a north-south divide at the start. People were dancing to house music for a year in Manchester before they were in London, because London was so steeped in the rare groove scene. The initial northern house movement was basically Graeme Park at the Garage in Nottingham and me at the Ha\u00e7ienda. I remember I did an exchange with a DJ called Simon Goth, who had a club called Fever at the Astoria. I came down in January 1988 and I distinctly remember playing [Derrick May, aka Rhythim is Rhythim&apos;s] &apos;Strings of Life&apos; and getting booed. People were standing with their arms folded and someone passed me this note saying &apos;Why are you playing this Chicago homo music?&apos; Jon Da Silva (Ha\u00e7ienda DJ): It was still quite rare to hear the music then. If you heard someone playing acid house in a car, you would cross the street to hear it, and if you heard it coming out of someone&apos;s house, you&apos;d want to know who lived there. Dave Haslam (Ha\u00e7ienda DJ and author): In January 1988, I bumped into Tony Wilson in Manchester. I&apos;d been in Piccadilly Records and he asked what I&apos;d bought and I said, &apos;Acid house&apos;, and he picked up on the drug reference and asked, &apos;Is it music people take drugs to listen to?&apos; and I said, &apos;No, not necessarily.&apos; But if he had asked me the same question in March I would have said, &apos;Yes, usually.&apos; Manchester has always had a big drug-taking music community and ecstasy use had spread through 1987, but it was in the first few months of 1988 that it just swamped the Ha\u00e7ienda. Graham Massey (808 State): For the first few months of 1988, it still felt like there were just a few of you doing this new thing. Me and [A Guy Called] Gerald [original member of 808 State] would get the National Express to go to Aberdeen Art College or somewhere to play live and they would project porn on to you. We didn&apos;t quite fit in just yet. Then we started to get booked at soul all-dayers and we&apos;d always be on the bill with Adamski and Guru Josh. Mike Pickering: Nude was the first big night for acid house at the Ha\u00e7ienda. It had started in 1986 and I gradually introduced some acid house. By 1988 we had about 1,600 people in there and when ecstasy hit it was like a Mexican wave that swept through the club over a three-week period. Suddenly everyone was on ecstasy. I could just stop a record and put my hands in the air, and the place would erupt. The whole club would explode. John McCready (DJ and journalist with The Face): It wasn&apos;t like anything you&apos;d ever experienced in a club before. The clubs we&apos;d been to previously were full of apprentices in pressed white shirts on the pull. Girls were huddled in groups like disorientated wildebeest. At the Ha\u00e7ienda it was almost as if a generation breathed a sigh of relief, having been relieved of the pressure of the chase. The baggy clothes desexualised the whole environment. The rising heat from 2,000 people dancing, even at the bar, in the queue for the toilets, damped down everyone. We all looked crap. If you held onto on the handrail on the balcony above the dancefloor, your palms would be dripping in accumulated human sweat. Many of the records talked about dancing as working, like &apos;Work it to the Bone&apos;, and suddenly the original intentions of the music started to make sense. You could feel the down when the music stopped. The room quickly went cold as all the exit doors were thrown open and we were herded out. Back to forbidding reality. Until next Friday. The whole experience was always far more addictive than the drugs. You started wanting it all to go on for ever. Dave Haslam: Ecstasy intensified the experience and also meant the crowd were pretty responsive to dancing to music they had not heard before, which was very liberating. Although sometimes I think you could have played a recording of a Hoover and 2,000 people would have screamed with joy. Mostly when you DJ you&apos;re faced with a crowd waiting to be entertained and it&apos;s your challenge to whip them up into a frenzy. In that era it was different; you were faced with 2,000 baying people on the verge of their heads exploding. It was more like you had to hold them back, like someone trying to guide wild horses. Danny Rampling: A lot of the old London crowd hadn&apos;t got it at first. When I played gigs in regular clubs, people were like, &apos;He&apos;s lost his mind! What&apos;s going on here? This is the work of the devil, I don&apos;t want anything to do with it!&apos; So many people dissed it in the early stages, at the tail end of 1987, and then, all of a sudden, people&apos;s enthusiasm for the whole experience just exploded in a matter of weeks. I can still see the faces of people in some of the clubs, the look of bewilderment was just astonishing. It was like, &apos;God, you don&apos;t know what we&apos;re experiencing here, you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re missing out on.&apos; Subsequently, a lot of those people joined the party, around the late summer of 1988, particularly a lot of the old rare groove and funky crowd. They weren&apos;t going to miss out on the greatest thing that had come along in years. Having run Future in the back room of Heaven, in early April, Paul Oakenfold opened a new club called Spectrum in the main room of the club, one of the largest club venues in central London at the time. Some viewed it as over-ambitious, but it was an almost instant success, the clearest demonstration of how quickly the acid house scene was exploding. Mark Moore: When Paul Oakenfold opened Spectrum on a Monday night, everyone laughed and thought it would never get off the ground. But the first night 200 people came and had a brilliant time and within weeks there were queues around the block. Paul Oakenfold: I think the moment we moved to Spectrum in the main club was when we realised just how big this thing was going to be. Fabio (Radio One DJ): My first proper exposure to acid house was at the first night of Spectrum. Steve Jackson, the DJ, had told us about it, but when we got down there it was pretty cold and there was a massive queue and we couldn&apos;t get in for hours. In the end Steve Jackson said to the bouncer &apos;Don&apos;t you know who I am?&apos;, and the bouncer said, &apos;Someone call a doctor, this guy doesn&apos;t know how he is.&apos; But they let us in, and I was just completely blown away. I was a soulboy really, and I&apos;d been through the rare groove thing, but this was something completely different. I couldn&apos;t believe the power of it. [Paul] Oakenfold was up there like a God, DJing surrounded by lasers and things, and everyone was off their heads. It was like stepping into another world. After one night I was completely and utterly hooked. 30 April: S&apos;Express scored 1988&apos;s first acid house hit single, reaching No. 1 with &apos;Theme From S&apos;Express&apos;. Mark Moore: I wrote the song about six months previously. I just thought they&apos;d play it at Shoom and Future and it would be a cult record. We sent out promos but couldn&apos;t get it on the radio; Radio 1 refused to play it. Then the first week it came out it went to number 27 or 28, then the next week it went to three and Radio 1 went &apos;Uh-oh, we&apos;re going to look really stupid if this goes to No. 1,&apos; so they started playing it. And it went to No. 1. Graham Massey: It did feel like a clean page in music, like the board had been wiped clean. We managed to get some very odd-sounding records in the charts as well. The music sounded very automatic, as if the music was making the music, rather than people. You can see that in some of the early 808 State stuff like Newbuild 4 June: Nicky Holloway opened the Trip at the Astoria, in London&apos;s West End, the first big legal Saturday night acid house club. Nicky Holloway: I was offered the chance to do something at the Astoria, because they had a seven-week gap in their diary when someone cancelled. So I thought if we could close off the upstairs we could maybe fill the downstairs part of the club, which was 600 people. But on the opening night we had 1,200 people. We called it the Trip and the first night was 4 June 1988. It was just really lucky timing really. The only two style magazines at that time were i-D and the Face, and they both had huge features in their June issue on acid house, which came out the week before we launched the Trip. I had no idea they were coming out, but it couldn&apos;t have been better timing for me. It meant we were full from day one. Mike Pickering: Nicky Holloway booked me to DJ and T-Coy to play at the Trip. This was only six months after I got booed at the same venue, but when I came back down the crowd were all in bandanas and smiley T-shirts, trance dancing... and I played what was probably 70-80 per cent of the same records, and they went mental. Nicky Holloway: At the Trip, people would refuse to go home at the end of the night. The roads would all be blocked, and people would be dancing in the fountains at the bottom of Centrepoint . The police would just be laughing because they had absolutely no idea what was going on. They didn&apos;t know what ecstasy was at this point, so they just couldn&apos;t understand. They just thought it was funny, because they could see that no one was hurting anyone else. Fabio: It wasn&apos;t just the drugs. I think the timing and the social aspect was just as important as the drugs. It&apos;s difficult to remember now what Thatcher&apos;s Britain felt like. A lot of people were unemployed and bored, and felt very distant from everything else that was going on in society. A lot of people were searching for something, for a way out. It&apos;s difficult to recall how drab things were at the time. Nicky Holloway: I remember standing in the club at its peak and thinking it is never going to get better than this, and it never did really, not for me. For the first time in my life I was not only DJing at the biggest and best club night, I was running it. I had to pinch myself. It was just mad. Everyone just went nuts. We all knew it was our Woodstock, our Sixties thing. We knew we were part of something that people would be talking about 20 years later, and here we are. It&apos;s amazing that most of the people who were part of the scene then are still making a living out of it now. Fabio: Even when it really began to take off in the summer it still felt like there was only a few thousand people who were in on it. Most young people didn&apos;t have a clue. You would come out of all-night parties and bump into people in the petrol station who were on their way to work, and they would look at us like we were zombies! 13 July: The Ibiza-themed Hot night launched on Wednesdays at the Ha\u00e7ienda, with a swimming pool on the dancefloor and free ice pops. Paul Cons (promoter at the Ha\u00e7ienda): Tony Wilson used to pay me to go to New York for a month each year for &apos;research&apos; purposes, and the previous year I&apos;d basically spent it all in the Paradise Garage on ecstasy, so I knew what was coming, and just had this idea to launch the new night with a summer beach party theme. Paul Mason (Ha\u00e7ienda manager): Myself and Fred, the maintenance manager, erected this huge pool and connected all the hosepipes up we could find to the sinks behind the bars, then went to the pub for a few pints of Stella. We came back three hours later and there was just this puddle in the bottom of the pool. We ended up having to get someone to connect us up to the main water supply. Of course the next morning we then had this swimming pool full of tonnes of water in the middle of the dancefloor and we had a bloody gig that night so had to empty it quickly somehow. Peter Hook [from New Order] turned up in the afternoon and said, &apos;I know what to do, my kids have got a paddling pool which is the same design, just smaller. You just take one of the panels out - it&apos;s much quicker that way.&apos; But we lost control of it and tonnes of water burst out of the cargo doors of the club. This little old dear was walking past the club pulling her shopping trolley and it washed her about 300 yards down the road. Jon Da Silva: The first couple of weeks of Hot were reasonably &apos;normal&apos;, but from the third week it was mayhem. It was almost scary. I came out of the DJ booth and there was this guy with dreadlocks who was almost hysterical, crying and laughing at the same time, just blown away by the atmosphere. You almost felt like you were missing out by DJing, you wanted to be on the floor. Hana Borrowman (Ha\u00e7ienda regular): I&apos;d just turned 16 and left school when I first went to the Ha\u00e7ienda. It just turned everything upside down. Within weeks I&apos;d left home and ducked out of college for a year to take it all up full-time. At \u00a325, though, ecstasy was pretty prohibitive for us, so we all dabbled in halves and even quarters. Dave Haslam: I was DJing at the Ha\u00e7ienda one evening and a girl came into the DJ box, lay down and took all her clothes off. She was naked, and started pulling at my trousers. I was wise enough to know it was E taking effect, rather than anything to do with me, but it was just one of those things; there was a lot of craziness in the air. Hana Borrowman: The clubs soon became just the warm-up for the evening&apos;s events. Most of the real &apos;rave&apos; experiences came after - at the after-hours parties in the makeshift venues and shebeens, like the Kitchen in Hulme. At 16, on small does of strong ecstasy, climbing piss-stained staircases towards the barely muffled basslines of massive speakers and entering the neon gloom of a barely lit council flat was like entering a futuristic fantasy. We used to dress in Converse booties, baggy sweats, Kickers, baseball caps and rucksacks stuffed with whistles, sweets and toys to entertain our fellow hallucinating party-goers. You would end up sitting cross-legged on the concrete floor of a car park, falling in love, staring pupil-to-dilated pupil into the eyes of boys with bowl haircuts. Mike Pickering: That whole period just felt so special because no one had a clue what we were doing. The authorities didn&apos;t have a clue. We used to come out of the Ha\u00e7ienda when it finished and go back to the Kitchen in Hulme, which was just two old council flats knocked together. Funnily enough, I bumped into Noel Gallagher recently and we were reminiscing about the Kitchen and saying hardly anyone mentions it. One of the first big raves in Manchester was put on behind Piccadilly Station by Chris and Antony Donnelly. Bizarrely, it was directly opposite what is now, 20 years on, the Warehouse Project. The coppers didn&apos;t turn up until about 9am when we were sweeping up, and it was just piles of water bottles. The police were like, &apos;What&apos;s been going on here?&apos; and we said, &apos;We&apos;ve just had a private party, officer, but as you can see there was no alcohol, and Tony Wilson from Granada Reports came down as well,&apos; and they were like, &apos;OK, fine.&apos; They didn&apos;t have a clue. Jon Da Silva: &apos;Voodoo Ray&apos; was the sound of the summer of 1988 for Manchester. One of the other DJs, Dean Johnson, had told me about this music [A Guy Called] Gerald was making which sounded incredible, and I&apos;d actually driven round Moss Side looking for him and his studio to hear it. Then one night at Hot he appeared behind the DJ booth with a 12-inch of &apos;Voodoo Ray&apos;. I stuck it straight on, which you would never do, and it was just amazing. In August, Tony Colston-Hayter hosted one of the first big warehouse raves at Wembley Studios in London, under the name Apocalypse Now, and let ITN News film the event, the first time news cameras had been let into a rave. On 17 August, the Sun published a story about drug-taking at Heaven, owned by Richard Branson, claiming that &apos;junkies flaunt their craving by wearing T-shirts bearing messages like &quot;Can You Feel It?&quot; &amp; &quot;Drop Acid Not Bombs&quot;&apos;. Branson gave an interview to ITN denying any link between the music and drug taking, although he referred to it as &apos;acid rock&apos;. Danny Rampling: It was a bit of a worrying time really. All of a sudden, it was horror stories all round - &apos;This is going to be the death of our children. Who are the people responsible?&apos; - and, of course, I was responsible for it, with a handful of other individuals. My wife at the time, Jenni, said, &apos;No matter what you do, do not become a spokesperson for this movement, because you will just get nailed,&apos; and she was so right. Tony Colston-Hayter became a spokesperson and ended up with MI6 on his tail and his phone was bugged. It was a pretty frightening time. Paul Oakenfold: As usual, the tabloids blew everything up and sensationalised it. They even tried to use the drugs issue, which was fabricated, to put pressure on Richard Branson to close down Spectrum, but, to his credit, he wasn&apos;t having any of it. Despite, or perhaps because of the tabloids&apos; interest, acid house parties got bigger and bigger. On 10 November, Wayne Anthony held the first Genesis warehouse party in Aldgate, east London. Wayne Anthony: I had already worked in the music business with Mel &amp; Kim, and, once I&apos;d been to a few acid house parties and saw it was just a sound system and a few lights, could see there was an opportunity for someone to do it properly. A lot of the parties were in derelict buildings and quite unsafe, so I thought there was a gap to do this a bit safer. The police didn&apos;t have a clue, so once you knew how to placate them it was quite easy. We would look for a warehouse that was up for let and in decent condition, and then we would break in. The only other promoter who was trying to do it on the same scale as us was Tony Colston-Hayter and his Sunrise outfit. Our first party was a couple of hundred people and then the second, a week later, was over a thousand people - and it was amazing. Danny Rampling: When it exploded it was taken out of the hands of the original people, which caused a funny Animal Farm-type situation. Previously it had all been &apos;We&apos;re all equal, love and peace&apos; and all of a sudden, there was a bit of snobbery and people taking the mick out of these newcomers who didn&apos;t quite get it, and calling them Acid Teds and Acid Sheep. People were pissed off that they didn&apos;t have control over it any more, but you can&apos;t control these things once they explode. Mark Moore: When the big raves started the elite would be like, &apos;Oh, my God, you didn&apos;t go there, did you?&apos; They really looked down on it; they thought they were just full of the hoi polloi. But if you look back at footage of those first raves everyone is completely off their heads but looks so innocent and natural. It was beautiful and I thought, &apos;This is a great atmosphere, there&apos;s nothing wrong with this.&apos; Wayne Anthony: Within a matter of weeks we had become the biggest promoters. We found this amazing warehouse venue in Hackney, and on Christmas Eve we had nearly 1,000 people in there. I was up all night and went round to my Mum&apos;s for Christmas dinner, but didn&apos;t end up eating much. Then we had another one on Boxing Day and 2,000 people turned up. We had quite a few celebrities that night, including Matt Dillon, Milli Vanilli and Boy George. Some of the West End&apos;s biggest club owners came down to, in their own words, &apos;see what all the fuss is about&apos;. They&apos;d come to see where all their punters had disappeared to and were gutted to find they&apos;d lost them to a party in a warehouse on a back street in east London. We then joined forces with Tony and Sunrise for New Year&apos;s Eve in the same venue, which was the biggest and best acid party yet. As the party continued into 1989, the focus switched more towards large-scale parties, sometimes involving 10,000 revellers, held in either warehouses or fields. Many took place around the M25, and thus became known as Orbital raves (from which Paul Hartnoll and his older brother, Phil, took the name of their band). In the north, similarly, the emphasis moved towards large raves, most famously in Blackburn. But for many of the founding fathers of the scene, nothing would ever quite recapture those heady early days. Phil Hartnoll: The thing I remember about the time was just jumping around with excitement about the whole scene really. Just loving it. I had never really wanted to be in a band. I was just plodding along with my brother and really interested in synthesisers as a hobby. Then we thought, &apos;Shall we try and put a track out on record?&apos; And we&apos;ve never looked back really. I still can&apos;t believe my luck. Liam Howlett (the Prodigy): I remember bumping into an old school friend on the train and he was like, &apos;You&apos;ve got to come to one of these acid house parties,&apos; so I went down to one late in the summer of 1988, but it didn&apos;t really grab me. I&apos;d come from a hip hop background and the music was a bit too trancey for me; I was more into beats. Also, someone had told me that if you had allergies then you should stear clear of ecstasy. I don&apos;t know where the hell they got that from, but I had hayfever so that put me off taking ecstasy for a bit, which probably didn&apos;t help. To be honest, I was more into the rave scene that exploded the year after - that made much more sense to me. Mark Moore: I don&apos;t think kids nowadays quite get how revolutionary and countercultural it felt. It changed, and stopped being about a holy sacrosanct where you knew you were going to go out and expand your consciousness and also have a fucking brilliant time. It became about just getting off your head, which was sad really. Dave Haslam: Breaking down social and musical barriers was an important part of what was achieved. In the late Eighties, courtesy of Thatcher, communities had been fragmented, ghettoised, marginalised; but on the Ha\u00e7ienda dancefloor those divisions, that horrible selfishness, seemed to melt away. The best music revolutions have always been about synthesis. That&apos;s been the case ever since the birth of rock&apos;n&apos;roll; Elvis bringing together white country music and black rhythm and blues. We had that synthesis; influences, people, coming together. Danny Rampling: It changed a lot of people&apos;s lives for ever. The strength of the whole experience was more than just going to a club and listening to music. It changed a million mindsets. It had a profound effect on anyone who experienced a night in a warehouse, a field, a basement or a club. And people have enduring memories to this day, quite rightly so. It was an absolutely amazing experience for a whole generation. It completely deconstructed the way we were thinking back then. If you look at youth culture now, it&apos;s just gang culture and violence and knives and just wasting that youthful energy. If only we could have it all again, because youth culture is screaming out for positive change. It really is.   Acid house essentials Smiley faces Danny Rampling: I picked up on the smiley face logo from a fashion designer called Barnsley. I ran into him one night when he was covered in these smiley face badges and I thought, &apos;Wow! That&apos;s it! The smiley face completely signifies what this movement is all about - big smiles and positivity.&apos; I think we first used them on the flyer for the third Shoom, and everyone picked up on it. Lucozade and water Danny Rampling: Everyone would just drink water and Lucozade. Unbeknown to Lucozade, the rave scene had taken their drink and used it as the drink of choice. Dave Haslam: I remember DJing one New Year&apos;s Eve at one club and it was full, and everyone was in there for five, six hours. Afterwards the bar manager told me he&apos;d sold just one pint of lager despite the amount of people present in the club. Ice pops Hana Borrowman: At the Ha\u00e7ienda, Hot were really good about little details. Just when the hallucinogens were kicking in and the dancefloor was so full with smoke you couldn&apos;t see or breathe, they&apos;d hand out ice pops to everyone. Mark Moore: Jenni and Danny Rampling used to hand out ice pops at Shoom with gay abandon to the parched and needy. Dungarees and baggy clothes Danny Rampling: A new dress sense was created simply in reaction to the fact that the heat was so sweltering inside the clubs, so people started wearing baggy clothes like big T-shirts and dungarees to cope with the heat. It was more about practicality and comfort than a styled look - dungarees, larger T-shirts and more ethnic clothes. It was quite anti-style because London was quite high fashion at that time. Whistles Hana Borrowman: Instead of jewellery, our accessories were toys and other playthings. Whistles on a string, lollipops and a Vicks Sinex. One girl always used to wear a dummy around her neck.

Lovingly restored by its American owner Bob Abrams, it has views of the Eiffel Tower from the deck, a large, well-equipped kitchen and bathroom and a set of bohemian neighbours. It receives the occasional wash from the B\u00e2teaux Mouches that pass by and from visiting ducks (which can sometimes be heard pecking moss off the hull).

Shaula is a 1930s yawl with a distinguished past - it was designed by Epaminonda Ceccarelli, whose boats have competed in the America&apos;s Cup. Cabins (there are three of them and the boat sleeps seven) can be booked separately but it&apos;s probably most fun to take the whole boat as a group. It&apos;s moored in a small marina overlooking San Clemente on Giudecca island, a short walk from a vaporetto stop (three stops from San Marco) and close to a supermarket. If requested, the owner, Ava, will unhitch the mooring and take you for a sail around the lagoon; an excursion costs around \u20ac80, including lunch.

For romance there&apos;s the Hendrick (reference number BO26 on the website), near the Nieuwmarkt, which sleeps two (or three if you use the rollaway bed). The views are lovely, there&apos;s a roof deck for chilling and you&apos;re just five minutes from Central Station. For large groups boat BO34, centrally moored behind Central Station, sleeps up to 24 (\u20ac35pppn), while The Captain&apos;s Place (BO20) is geared for the family market, with two large bedrooms, a conservatory and a selection of small-sized life jackets (\u20ac137 per night, for up to four adults and two children).  \u00b7 Hendrick costs from \u20ac165 a night, sleeping up to three (houseboathotel.nl)  Ruby and Lily May, Sheffield4 Moored in the Grade II-listed Victoria Quay, these two narrowboats are within easy walking distance of pretty much most things in Sheffield, including Weston Park museum and the Crucible Theatre.

Formerly a British lifeboat, which was kept busy saving lives (45 in total) between 1955 and 1979, the Lilla Marras is a Watson Class boat and was built at the Groves and Gutteridge boatyard in East Cowes (many of the people who rent it are into details like these). The furnishings slip into the luxury bracket, with Arne Jacobsen chairs and a wooden bath. Unlike many houseboats, the Lilla Marras is still seaworthy, and it&apos;s possible to hire a captain to sail it for a couple of hours.

While there&apos;s central heating in winter, the deck plays host to an open-air bar and restaurant in the warmer months (nights are unlikely to be quiet, especially in the summer). The location is near perfect. Eastern Comfort is moored on the river Spree, by the Oberbaum bridge and a choice piece of the Berlin Wall. The happening districts of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg are within walking distance. There are 24 cabins; those in search of comfort should opt for one of eight first-class cabins on the middle deck, while budget travellers can go for the triple and four-bed cabins with portholes.

Originally introduced by the British to get round local laws forbiding non-Kashmiris from owning land, they offer a unique accommodation experience. Graded by the local tourist board from A to D (with A the top of the tree), they vary in comfort levels and decor, but all have personalised service, with a &apos;houseboy&apos;, home-cooked meals and free rides to the nearest jetty (the boats aren&apos;t directly accessible from the banks), and often have beautifully carved cedarwood interiors. The majority of boats are on Dal Lake. \u00b7 Indus Tours features the luxury three-bedroom Royal Palace on Lake Dal for \u00a3250 a week or \u00a336 a night, including all meals (020 8901 7320; industours.co.uk)  B3, bed and breakfast boat, Ghent, Belgium15 This charming converted barge in the centre of Ghent has two double bedrooms for rent, each with its own entrance, sitting area (complete with flat-screen TV and DVD), bathroom and kitchenette.

The campaign, called Dream Big, aims to provide an antidote to the hype that will surround the footballing superpowers playing in this summer&apos;s European Championship in June. A 60-second ad, which will run on TV or online in countries across the world, features a host of Adidas stars and sets the scene for the Dream Big project. Mourinho provides the voiceover. A series of shorter TV ads feature a range of the footballers, including Robin van Persie, Kaka, Patrick Viera and Michael Ballack, visiting teams in Andorra, San Marino and the Isles of Scilly. A key goal of the campaign, which has been developed by ad agency 180 Amsterdam, is to get viewers to visit the Adidas website to view a series of four-minute films charting the story of the footballers visiting each place. In the Isles of Scilly the campaign features Chas Wood, the chairman of the smallest league in the world, saying that the Woolpack Wanderers and the Garrison Gunners manage to play 16 league games per season and compete for two cups and one charity shield. In San Marino, one of the lowest-ranked national teams in Europe, local footballers receive specialist coaching advice. And a team of talented young players from Andorra are taken to the Bernabeu, the home of Real Madrid, where former Chelsea manager Mourinho gives coaching tips to footballers from the 179th-ranked country in the world. The campaign consists of TV, digital, mobile, print and in-store advertising activity across Asia, Europe, Africa and the US.

Its fusion of techno with country and western was astonishingly bold, combining the most radical and reactionary genres of popular music. I started to check out the band&apos;s gigs and found that Jake Black (aka D Wayne Love), one of the band&apos;s founding members, and I had many mutual friends from our raving days in Glasgow, stretching back to the punk era. So I became one of the band&apos;s aficionados, known collectively as the &quot;bammies&quot;: we&apos;re the punters who help make A3 gigs the best party in town. I can&apos;t understand why the Alabama 3 aren&apos;t one of the biggest bands on the planet. Woke Up This Morning, which plays over the opening credits of The Sopranos, remains their best-known song, but you would expect at least one of their albums to have gone platinum on the leg-up from that alone. Over the course of seven albums - from Exile, through Power in the Blood (2002) and last year&apos;s MOR, to their latest retrospective, Hits and Exit Wounds - the A3 have turned a crazed mirror on the UK&apos;s mainstream cultural influences, parodying derivative and genre-based music through the lens of what the band call their &quot;sweet muthafuckin&apos; acid house country music&quot;, with a leavening of dirty rock&apos;n&apos;roll. I&apos;m wondering how they&apos;d cope if it all suddenly went mega. I settle down with D Wayne and Rob Spragg (aka Larry Love), the other founding member, in a dark corner of Dublin&apos;s Clarence Hotel, the smart, corporate, U2-owned enterprise, in front of a tray of our favourite blended margaritas. Does it concern them that lesser lights are fawned over, while they remain on the margins, albeit the exciting, interesting ones? &quot;As long as we do good work,&quot; Larry says, &quot;we know there will be a payback time.&quot; Larry is as cadaverous as ever, a man who still looks as if a ray of sunlight will combust him. D Wayne, though, is a more substantial figure than the skeletal, spectral one I&apos;ve seen grace stages, couches and floors over the years. But these boys are proper rock&apos;n&apos;roll stars. If they wear shades indoors, it&apos;s because they&apos;re covering up strung-out eyes and brawlers&apos; bruises. Glancing at the tape recorder I&apos;ve slipped on to the table, Larry asks me: &quot;Do you feel guilty that you haven&apos;t had a rock&apos;n&apos;roll death yet, and are still bounding down the highways and byways of self-destruction?&quot; Death is such a cheerful presence in the A3 canon, it&apos;s easy to think of the Grim Reaper as a band member. &quot;We&apos;ve got a lottery in the band about who&apos;s going to die first,&quot; Larry says. &quot;We&apos;re amazed we&apos;re all still alive.&quot; D Wayne comes from the Possil area of Glasgow and I&apos;m from Muirhouse, in Edinburgh, so when we get together we talk about art and politics, with all the pomposity, pretentiousness and guilt of true Scottish schemies. Playing back the tape of us rapping is like listening to two 80s Marxist polytechnic sociology lecturers vying to seduce an impressionable fresher. He tells me, touchingly, about my debut novel&apos;s influence on the band. &quot;Trainspotting was iconoclastic for us. It introduced a whole disenfranchised generation to literature - a generation that had been informed literature was the possession of an elite. It delineated the complex inner lives of the housing estates and communities people lived in. We&apos;ve been trying to do the same with our music, trying to show young people that they can make music based on their own lives, using genres like country and blues that they probably considered the territory of their dads and grannies.&quot; But writing novels is a lonely business, and release is often difficult. That&apos;s what I envy about these boys: they can hit that stage and perform together; the communication and catharsis is instant, and there&apos;s an immediate connection with their audience. &quot;That&apos;s the end of the process - the performance,&quot; Larry says. &quot;But we&apos;re constantly looking for new experiences, new people to bounce off, new shades of reality to reflect our twisted US accent-based view of life. We&apos;re always collecting experiences to use as songwriters. But you can write everywhere,&quot; he suddenly accuses me. &quot;You used to sit on the Circle line in London with your laptop and knock them out.&quot; I ask them what music kicked off their warped but exhilarating vision of the world. &quot;House affected us deeply,&quot; says D Wayne. &quot;But punk rock liberated people like me and those I knocked around with in Glasgow. For the first time, we were able to come out of the scheme, dress up and hit the city centre, talk about Rimbaud and Baudelaire, mix with Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill [of Simple Minds] and get shagged. It opened up a brand new lifestyle for us.&quot; In practical terms, the band grew organically out of its members&apos; acid house DJing activities. Larry explains: &quot;We were doing a gig in Italy, me and D Wayne in the early days, with two turntables and a load of acid house records and some obscure blues LPs. It was run by the Italian Communist Party. There were lots of punk bands. We played our house, the room was full, it was kickin&apos;. Then this guy from the CP came in and said we had to prepare and read out our manifesto. Someone tore a page from an Italian comic book and we read it out. It started, &apos;The techno warriors will save the Martians.&apos; It made me think about the veracity of political manifestos. The crowd loved it. I often wonder if there are still a few addled Italian CP members trying to live by the code we outlined that night.&quot; Things seem a lot blander now, in the age of Simon Cowell. &quot;Alabama 3 live in this world,&quot; Larry says. &quot;We reflect and comment on it. But we&apos;re trying to cut through the distortions of people who peddle popular culture as a series of Pop Idol-type creations.&quot; So are they speaking to the old punks and house heads, those of us who should know better but just can&apos;t quite stay indoors and behave? &quot;Yes,&quot; Larry says, &quot;But not exclusively. The last album was called MOR. Some say it stands for Middle of the Road, but it&apos;s based on those gorgeous California west coast sounds like the Eagles, and it maybe widened our audience. With the new collection, we just thought we&apos;d offer up a reminder of how we got there.&quot; One of the Eagles&apos; most famous tracks is Take It to the Limits. Rest assured, the A3 will continue to do just that. It would be nice if the mainstream caught on and this retrospective brought them their just rewards. Yet for selfish reasons, I enjoy being part of a cult who can access the best party around. \u00b7 Hits and Exit Wounds is out today on One Little Indian.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Dutch film-maker is publishing the book, the result of more than two decades of research, to drum up interest in producing his life-long ambition - a film about Jesus Christ based on scientific inquiry. Verhoeven, 69, also claims that Judas played no part in Christ&apos;s betrayal. His Amsterdam-based publishers are currently in negotiations for an English-language translation.

The independent directors of RDF Media, led by former ITV boss Richard Eyre, admitted yesterday that they had received an indicative cash bid for the business, whose hit formats include Wife Swap, Faking It and Location, Location, Location.  The bid comes from a consortium including the firm&apos;s executive directors. David Frank, who founded RDF Media in 1993, is understood to be working with chief operating officer Joely Fether and finance head Janice Price on a deal.  &quot;This approach is at a very early stage,&quot; RDF Media stressed. &quot;And there can be no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms of any such offer, should one be forthcoming.&quot; RDF Media saw its share price plunge last year after it emerged that promotional footage for a BBC documentary about the Queen, which appeared to show her storming out of a photoshoot with Annie Leibovitz, had been doctored. In fact she was walking into the shoot.  The furore about the footage, which coincided with a collapse in public trust in television following revelations about a number of rigged phone-in TV quiz shows, led ITV and the BBC to suspend commissions from the company. Chief creative officer Stephen Lambert took responsibility for the footage and resigned but the hiatus in commissions led RDF Media to warn on profits, leaving its shares at an all-time low.  Bankers said last night that Frank has funding in place for a deal, but it remains to be seen whether shareholders will be willing to accept a bid that could be lower than the 144p a share at which the company was floated. Before the Crowngate affair, RDF Media&apos;s shares were as high as 250p. Earlier this week they were languishing at an all-time low of 95p. Yesterday the stock closed up more than a third at 127.5p, valuing the business at \u00a353m. Frank has a stake of almost 12% in the company while Lambert still has 6%. But the largest shareholder is Big Brother creator John De Mol, whose Cyrte Investments vehicle has a stake of 27.5%. De Mol bought most of his stake before last year&apos;s share price plunge. Cyrte has since been bought by Amsterdam investment house Delta Lloyd Group but still houses De Mol&apos;s investments. Ingenious Securities analyst Patrick Yau said any deal would have to offer a premium of at least 30-40% on the previous closing stock price of 95.5p.  &quot;Having seen the RDF stock price fall dramatically over the last few months ... we are unsurprised that a management buyout proposal has been tabled,&quot; Yau said, adding that it could throw a &quot;spotlight&quot; on other production companies, such as Shed Media, as potential bid targets.  &quot;We believe that this move will be a trigger for more speculative interest across a sub-sector that has fallen out of favour with investors,&quot; Yau said.", "sentences": ["Cyrte has since been bought by Amsterdam investment house Delta Lloyd Group but still houses De Mol&apos;s investments."], "title": "Founder of 'Crowngate' firm leads bid approach", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/25/television.mediabusiness", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media business", "Media", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-25T12:06:40Z", "article": "The future of RDF Media depends in no small part on John de Mol, the Dutch media mogul who created Big Brother and returned last year to his old company Endemol. Through his investment vehicle Cyrte \u2013 which he no longer owns, but which houses much of his wealth \u2013 de Mol has a 27.5% stake in RDF, the maker of Wife Swap and Faking It. It is unclear, however, whether he supports the move being made by RDF&apos;s founder and chief executive, David Frank, and two other executive directors to mount a management buyout.  De Mol&apos;s spokesman declined to comment, while Cyrte had not responded to MediaGuardian.co.uk&apos;s request for a comment by the time of publication. But sources with knowledge of the situation believe that De Mol would need to be on side for any buyout to succeed, given the size of the Cyrte stake in RDF. If Frank were seeking to buy out Cyrte, it is unlikely the Dutch company would be keen to sell given that it bought most of its shares at prices of up to 250p, before they went into steep decline last summer following the &quot;Crowngate&quot; scandal. RDF has been hit hard by Crowngate, when it emerged in July last year that a preview clip for its documentary about the Queen had been edited misleadingly.  The company&apos;s chief creative officer, Stephen Lambert, was forced to resign over Crowngate and the company&apos;s share price fell to an all-time low of 95p earlier this week before news of Frank&apos;s bid emerged. Frank&apos;s plan is to take the company off the market less than three years after it floated, to take advantage of its lower share price and to spearhead a creative revival. But that would probably require the assistance of Cyrte, now part of the Amsterdam investment house Delta Lloyd. The trouble for Frank is that he is believed to have an uneasy relationship with Cyrte, fearing that the Dutch ultimately want to roll RDF into Big Brother producer Endemol. Cyrte is now one of the co-owners of Endemol as part of the consortium that bought the Dutch company from Spanish telcoms and media giant Telefonica last year. One source suggested that Frank&apos;s plans were flushed out prematurely because the independent directors, including chairman Richard Eyre, the former ITV chief executive, knew of them and felt obliged to make them public. The RDF board was mindful of the need for disclosure having spoken to the Takeover Panel over a rumour that rival &quot;super indie&quot; producer All3Media was planning to buy the company. However, All3Media \u2013 which is backing former RDF man Lambert&apos;s new venture, Studio Lambert \u2013 is understood not to be involved in Frank&apos;s plans. Lambert himself will have a stake in RDF&apos;s future through his 6% shareholding, while Frank owns 12%. Shares in RDF were up 2.5p or 2% to 130p today, having closed up more than a third last night at 127.5p. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

It was, I suggested, a dead form unnaturally perpetuated by fiction-writing workshops, after &quot;the transcendental conditions for its existence&quot; had, in the words of Luk\u00e1cs, &quot;already been condemned by the historico-philosophical dialectic&quot;. Shortly after the essay was published, I received an email from a recent Columbia graduate called Ezra Koenig, to the effect that these words &quot;really resonated&quot; with him: would I mind sending him my address, so that he could mail me some short stories he had written in a creative-writing workshop? What kind of person responds to an essay on the death of the short story by mailing its author some short stories? A very young person, clearly; this youthfulness was confirmed by the fact that the stories - for which, in all honesty, I did not have very high hopes - were accompanied by a self-produced CD of related songs performed by Koenig&apos;s band, Vampire Weekend. In my experience, the problem of the undergraduate artist isn&apos;t technique so much as the mode of audience engagement, which tends towards either a kind of needy, insistent quality or its equally tiresome opposite: disaffected too-cool-for-schoolness. Then there is the propensity of youth to infuse its works with an atmosphere of melancholy or rage, which, when insufficiently explained, produces such a wearisome effect. These, at any rate, were some of the tendencies I was expecting - yet they were totally missing in either the stories or the CD. The stories were stapled in a homemade booklet, entitled Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa; the cover art was a photo collage of shirts and sweaters, clipped from a J Crew catalogue (Orange Coral, Tangerine Heather, Harbor). Enclosed with the sky-blue CD was a charming note, handwritten on a small square of lined paper that appeared to have been cut, thriftily, from a larger piece of lined paper. The animating voice of all of these materials had a kind of winning, unselfconscious directness, which was also my overwhelming impression when I eventually saw Vampire Weekend perform live. Not only had I never witnessed such an intensely likeable pop performance; I had never conceived of the possibility of such intense likability in a pop performance. When Vampire Weekend signed with XL and became the next big thing, I was thrilled. For a depressed graduate student, it isn&apos;t every day that someone mails you some powerfully uplifting short stories and songs, then transforms overnight into a pop star. In recent months, various critics have described a similar emotional trajectory regarding Vampire Weekend: initial mistrust, followed by bemused surrender. &quot;By rights they should be incredibly annoying,&quot; the reviews begin, &quot;and yet ...&quot; In the Guardian, Alexis Petridis has expressed irritation at the premise of the single &quot;Mansard Roof&quot; (a &quot;plonking lyrical reference to 17th-century French architect Fran\u00e7ois Mansart&quot;), and yet, as &quot;the song skips along, deft and weirdly life-affirming&quot;, it is impossible to dislike. The &quot;mix of Afro-pop and Irish folk&quot; in &quot;Bryn&quot; ought to sound &quot;like something grisly you&apos;d hear by mistake while wandering Glastonbury&apos;s outlying fields&quot; - but, in fact, the effect of the &quot;weird, striking riff&quot; is &quot;unfathomably fantastic&quot;. Deft, weird, unfathomable, fantastic: why does this music have the effect it does? This is the mystery of &quot;charm&quot; itself, or at least the charm of a certain kind of pop music. Etymologically and mythologically, charm is linked not only with singing, but with the ability to lull people into sleeplike trances. I experienced charm firsthand last October, when I commemorated the end of my postgraduate education with a low-budget vacation in Spain and was persuaded to spend one night in a third-class sleeper car on a train: a windowless cubicle with six bunks, stacked in two rows, like drawers in a morgue. My fellow travellers included a drunk guy and a tiny couple accompanied by a large collection of Spanish salamis. Lying in my morgue-like drawer, I had thoughts such as &quot;I will never fall asleep&quot; and &quot;This is even worse than writing a dissertation&quot;. But I turned on my MP3 player and Vampire Weekend&apos;s &quot;Oxford Comma&quot; came on, and within two or three minutes the train car felt . . . not comfortable, but like a legitimate, interesting part of a larger world. There we all were, stacked in our bunks: there was the friend who had convinced me to take this train, engrossed now by what appeared to be an attempt to build a pillow out of some shoes; there was the drunk guy, sleeping peacefully; there were the tiny man and the tiny woman, who were so tiny that it really didn&apos;t seem to bother them to share their bunks with those huge plaid vinyl tote bags, full of salchichon and redolent chorizo and maybe even, qui\u00e9n sabe, an entire hock of air-cured ham. Beyond the shuddering walls, something was rushing by, probably the Pyrenean lowlands. Gone was the most annoying part of travel discomfort: the thought that &quot;it might have been otherwise&quot;. I listened to the whole album. After &quot;The Kids Don&apos;t Stand a Chance&quot;, I fell asleep and woke up in Madrid. It was during my research on the workings of charm and pop music that I stumbled on Internet Vibes (internetvibes.blogspot.com/), a blog that Ezra Koenig kept in 2005-6, with the goal of categorising as many &quot;vibes&quot; as possible. A &quot;rain/grey/British vibe&quot;, for example, incorporates the walk from a Barbour store (to look at wellington boots) to the Whitney Museum (to look at &quot;some avant-garde shorts by Robert Beavers&quot;), as well as the TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited, the Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada, &quot;late 90s Radiohead/global anxiety/airports&quot; and New Jersey. A &quot;vibe&quot; turns out to be something like &quot;local colour&quot;, with a historical dimension. What gives a vibe &quot;authenticity&quot; is its ability to evoke - using a small number of disparate elements - a certain time, place and milieu; a certain nexus of historic, geographic and cultural forces. Authenticity is a subject frequently raised by critics of Vampire Weekend, and anticipated on Koenig&apos;s blog. &quot;What is authentic for a guy like me?&quot; he asks, referring to his east-coast Jewish intellectual background. &quot;Growing up Jewish, you are presented with three images of your people: DESERT NOMADS BUILDING PYRAMIDS; EASTERN-EUROPEAN SHTETL-DWELLERS WITH BIG BEARDS; AMERICAN LIBERALS WHO EAT CHINESE FOOD ALL THE TIME. Now do you see where I&apos;m coming from?&quot; You do, I think; and you see also why Koenig chose the word &quot;vibe&quot;, with its connotation of music and overtones. It is easy to imagine those &quot;three images&quot; of Koenig&apos;s people as three sounds in a pop song, something like klezmer plus Aida plus Stan Getz. No other artistic medium can simultaneously convey so many different elements as music, with its harmonies and counterpoints and layering of beats; no other medium is so instantly suggestive of a vibe. The project of collecting and categorising vibes transforms the world and its music into a marvellous conspiracy, a vast, incredibly complicated symphony, overheard in brief snatches. Consider the episode of Internet Vibes in which Koenig, attracted by the album&apos;s &quot;dope cover featuring a Wolf, a Whale, an Eagle and a SWIRLY RAINBOW&quot;, purchases Paul Winter&apos;s 1978 album, Common Ground. Much of Winter&apos;s work turns out to consist of &quot;duets&quot; between animals and musical instruments. &quot;An African Fish Eagle goes up against Paul McCandless&apos;s unstoppable bebop oboe&quot;; another track pits the howls of a &quot;genuine Timber Wolf&quot; against the wail of Winter&apos;s soprano saxophone. (The timber wolf gets a writing credit.) For Koenig, Winter represents not just a lucky find, but a great coincidence, because the record was an &quot;amalgamation of a lot of things&quot; he happened to have been thinking of, at just that time (&quot;conservation biology, New Age, smooth-ish jazz, WORLD . . .&quot;). At the Salvation Army a few weeks later, Koenig discovers another Winter record, packaged with a giant map representing North America (aka &quot;Turtle Island&quot;) as the nexus of a &quot;mythical system of Animal communication&quot;: &quot;the Narwhal Messenger in Nova Scotia tells the Humpback Whale by the Arctic Circle who tells the Baby Seal in Alaska, etc.&quot; The last link in the chain comes when Koenig, bicycling down Amsterdam Avenue, hears some Brazilian percussion emanating from the cathedral of St John the Divine, where a large crowd of white-robed people have gathered, together with &quot;a camel and some donkeys&quot;. Pausing to investigate, Koenig is astounded to hear a beautiful soprano saxophone, played by none other than Paul Winter, who is standing right there in the cathedral of St John the Divine, with two parakeets on his shoulder. That&apos;s what charm can do: it can show us the world as a wonderland of hidden connections. Another of Koenig&apos;s hobbies is identifying similar photographic distortions, in otherwise unrelated pictures from Facebook - for example, he collects snapshots in which the &quot;N&quot; on someone&apos;s New Balance sneakers, caught by the flashbulb, radiates an otherworldly glow. &quot;Looking at those pictures at the same time really gives me a strange feeling in my gut. Is this what The Da Vinci Code is about?&quot; In a way, yes; it&apos;s about how an eye or ear for detail can transform individual experiences into part of a bigger picture. But there are good and bad ways of going about it. Take the often invoked comparison of Vampire Weekend to the films of Wes Anderson. Nobody can say Anderson doesn&apos;t have a genius for vibes, for &quot;local colour&quot; and the big picture, for the gorgeous interplay of historical-cultural forces in certain locations in the Upper West Side, the bottom of the sea, rural India, and so on. But what makes many of Anderson&apos;s films so annoying is that those intricate, breathtaking vistas usually turn out to have nothing to do with the lives of the main characters. The lives of the more autobiographical white American characters are never really integrated with the lives of the gorgeous ambient foreigners or fish. Seu Jorge is there, wearing a fez-like ski cap and singing David Bowie covers in Portuguese; the corpse of a little drowned Indian boy is literally immolated before our eyes - and all for the mere purpose of amplifying the self-pity of some emotionally stunted American thirtysomethings, still vying for the approval of their ageing, equally egotistical parents. Really, the Freemasons might as well be there in wet suits, playing the harmonica. Today I imagine the Wes Anderson of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou not unlike the monstrous nautical pin-striped apparition from Vampire Weekend&apos;s &quot;The Kids Don&apos;t Stand a Chance&quot;: the one who enters the scene by a &quot;devastating backstroke / all the way from France / With shiny shiny cufflinks, / His shirtsleeve to enhance.&quot; His MO: &quot;ignoring all their history / denying them romance&quot;. And that is the great achievement of Vampire Weekend: they don&apos;t deny anybody their romance. The songs are so efficient, the &quot;influences&quot; so seamlessly fused, that you can&apos;t really say where personal experience ends and exoticism begins. The key advantage of Vampire Weekend over Wes Anderson lies in the fact that they have found their perfect medium. Anderson has not yet managed to integrate his fabulous miniature worlds with the actual dramas of real life - a much harder thing to do in a two-hour narrative film than in a four-minute pop song. Indeed, judging from his very early short stories, linear narrative isn&apos;t Koenig&apos;s strong suit either; but he has already mastered a certain pop synchronicity. The title story in his college collection, Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa, is about a girl spending her childhood summers with her mother, driving around Welfleet in a white Volvo with an anti-apartheid bumper sticker, listening to Paul Simon&apos;s Graceland. Like the Vampire Weekend song by the same title, Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa is about a kind of Graceland &quot;vibe&quot;. For the little girl in the story, Graceland is a &quot;playland, another Candy Land&quot;; and yet it is also &quot;a decaying southern mansion with a &apos;jungle room&apos; . . . the temple that fat Elvis built to die in&quot;; and then, too, it is &quot;the middle-aged musings of a divorced Paul Simon and the fading spirit of your mother&apos;s activism&quot;. Pop music is perhaps the unique medium for expressing the truth about Graceland: &quot;It is all of these things at once.&quot; Although no pop music can provide a really satisfying answer to the question &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;, Vampire Weekend at its best can offer you a fantasy of total integration into a certain place and time in the world; it can transform your experience into a &quot;vibe&quot;. There is something potentially sinister about this transformation; I suspect this is what the band&apos;s detractors are responding to, when they complain about elitism, exploitation, and so on. Well, that&apos;s the sinister side of the power of charm. (&quot;Charm your way across the Khyber Pass,&quot; Vampire Weekend suggests, in the song &quot;M79&quot;.) You can&apos;t predict it, or control it, but succumbing is a great pleasure.", "sentences": ["At the Salvation Army a few weeks later, Koenig discovers another Winter record, packaged with a giant map representing North America (aka &quot;Turtle Island&quot;) as the nexus of a &quot;mythical system of Animal communication&quot;: &quot;the Narwhal Messenger in Nova Scotia tells the Humpback Whale by the Arctic Circle who tells the Baby Seal in Alaska, etc.&quot; The last link in the chain comes when Koenig, bicycling down Amsterdam Avenue, hears some Brazilian percussion emanating from the cathedral of St John the Divine, where a large crowd of white-robed people have gathered, together with &quot;a camel and some donkeys&quot;."], "title": "Elif Batuman on Vampire Weekend", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/26/popandrock", "tags": ["Vampire Weekend", "Books", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-27T11:20:35Z", "article": "The critics will have to hold fire. After nine days of competition in the Indian Premier League, it has become clear that the players and the fans, the two groups central to the competition&apos;s success, care passionately about the fate of their franchise. &apos;The IPL is here to stay,&apos; said Shane Warne on Wednesday, before going out the next day in Hyderabad and thrashing Andrew Symonds for 16 in three balls to win the tournament&apos;s most thrilling game yet. For the time being at least, few are inclined to disagree. Emotions have run surprisingly high. The Mumbai Indians&apos; stand-in captain Harbhajan Singh was yesterday suspended indefinitely for reportedly slapping his international team-mate Sreesanth, now of the Kings XI Punjab, following Mumbai&apos;s third-successive defeat. Sreesanth wept openly in the outfield as he was being comforted by team-mates; his captain Yuvraj Singh described the incident as &apos;ugly&apos; and his coach Tom Moody called it &apos;unacceptable&apos;. Following an official complaint by the Kings XI, Harbhajan will miss today&apos;s game against Deccan Chargers in Mumbai and faces a disciplinary hearing tomorrow in Delhi to decide his future in the tournament. But it is unlikely IPL organisers will be too concerned: a man under pressure as Mumbaikars await the return of their injured demi-god Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan has simply ensured more front-page coverage for a tournament currently thriving on it. And, however clumsily, his flailing hand might also have proved the dollar signs are not diluting the cricketers&apos; will to win. For the fans, Harbhajan&apos;s alleged slap arguably combined India&apos;s two great passions - drama and cricket - and if there remains some nervousness among tournament organisers about levels of interest come the fourth week of this extended 44-day soap opera, the early signs are promising: TV ratings for the first few matches were as high as they were during the testosterone-fuelled one-day series between Australia and India recently, prompting the IPL&apos;s chief executive Sundar Raman to say he was &apos;thrilled that this concept got consumer acceptance from day one&apos;. The Indian media are doing their bit to embed the tournament in the popular consciousness. News bulletins regularly lead with the latest IPL gossip, much of it focusing rather cynically on which celebrity is endorsing which franchise and the ex-pros in the commentary box have employed all the hyperbolic tricks in the book to make the viewers feel they are part of a brand that transcends mere runs and wickets. The hype is not to everyone&apos;s taste and attention in recent days has focused on the increasingly embattled cheerleaders who celebrate every four, six and wicket with a jiggle and a wave. Objections have been raised in India&apos;s parliament and one of the Pakistani players, Shahid Afridi, has described their presence as &apos;distracting&apos;. Typical was the outrage of Siddharam Mhetre, the minister of state for home affairs in Maharashtra. &apos;We live in India where womanhood is worshipped,&apos; he argued. &apos;How can anything obscene like this can be allowed?&apos; Everyone has had their say on a topic that has revealed a generational split in a largely conservative, but rapidly changing country. Police in Mumbai are tolerating the cheerleaders so long as they do not &apos;embrace vulgarity and indecency in the name of entertainment&apos;, but authorities in Bangalore, revealed last week to be the heaviest-drinking city in India, are more laissez-faire. &apos;As long as the show is within acceptable limits, we have no issue with cheerleaders performing at matches,&apos; said a police spokesman. The cricket, too, has had its moments ever since the world-record start provided by Brendon McCullum on 18 April, and no story has been more attractive than the Warne-led resurgence of Rajasthan Royals, the Jaipur-based franchise bought for less than any of the other seven and widely written off after they lost their first game to Delhi Daredevils by nine wickets. Two wins out of two since then have established the Royals as many fans&apos; second team and lent the IPL a welcome air of unpredictability. The competition&apos;s surge has been all the starker for the difficulties currently being faced by India&apos;s other traditionally popular team game, hockey. As if the failure of the men&apos;s team, winners of eight Olympic golds but none since 1980, to qualify for this summer&apos;s Games in Beijing were not bad enough, the game recently suffered an off-field scandal when the secretary of the Indian Hockey Federation, K Jothikumaran, was caught apparently accepting a bribe to select an unnamed player in a sting by the popular Hindi TV channel Aaj Tak. Jothikumaran has called the charge &apos;totally concocted&apos;, saying he accepted the cash to help organise a large international event he claims the undercover reporter, posing as a businessman, was trying to arrange. But the incident has merely added to the long-held suspicion here that Indian hockey is beset by incompetence and cronyism, and the International Hockey Federation, the game&apos;s governing body, has warned India it could forfeit the right to host the 2010 World Cup if it does not get its house in order. Comparisons with the IPL&apos;s rising star have been impossible to avoid. &apos;India&apos;s national game [hockey] needs aggressive pitching like the IPL, which has become the flavour of the season, with big names and huge stakes involved in it,&apos; said the Bollywood actor Suniel Shetty recently. &apos;Instead of blaming each other for the debacle, it&apos;s high time the officials thought of something on the lines of the IPL. Hockey needs corporate funding and sponsors just like the IPL to become popular.&apos; Hockey used to be a source of great national pride. The first of its Olympic golds, in Amsterdam in 1928, helped convince the western world of India&apos;s sporting promise and paved the way for the country&apos;s entry into Test cricket&apos;s inner sanctum, which at the time included only England, Australia, South Africa and West Indies. And if Jesse Owens is widely credited with single-handedly upsetting Hitler&apos;s Aryan theories at the Berlin Games eight years later, India&apos;s hockey team played its part, too, by beating Germany 8-1 in the final. But hockey&apos;s star began to wane in 1983, when India shocked the world by beating West Indies at Lord&apos;s to lift cricket&apos;s third World Cup. Like last year&apos;s victory in the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa, that result opened the nation&apos;s eyes to a form of the game it had previously regarded with suspicion, and hockey has barely had a look-in since. Unfortunately for a game that was once considered more representative of India even than cricket, Harbhajan&apos;s slap has simply added momentum to the IPL juggernaut. It shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.", "sentences": ["The first of its Olympic golds, in Amsterdam in 1928, helped convince the western world of India&apos;s sporting promise and paved the way for the country&apos;s entry into Test cricket&apos;s inner sanctum, which at the time included only England, Australia, South Africa and West Indies."], "title": "India's party of cheers, tears and beers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/apr/27/indiaspartyofcheerstearsa", "tags": ["IPL", "Cricket", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-04-28T09:10:35Z", "article": "In 1933 Mr and Mrs Frank left Germany with their two daughters. Margot aged seven, and Anne, aged four. They were Jews, and life under the Hitler regime appeared precarious. They settled in Amsterdam. All went well until the Germans invaded Holland. In July 1942. The &quot;call-up&quot; of Jews for deportation to concentration camps had begun. Mr Frank had been preparing and stocking a hiding place. It consisted of the second and third floor back premises of his partner&apos;s office building, the &quot;secret annexe&quot;. On July 9 1942, the Frank family moved in. They were joined by Mr and Mrs Van Daan and their 16-year-old son, Peter, and a Jewish dentist called Dussel. There they remained until August, 1944 when the Germans raided and carried them off to Germany. Of the eight inhabitants of the &quot;secret annexe&apos;, only Mr Frank survived. Anne died in Belsen. Anne kept a diary; and that diary was found. In a preface to the English translation Miss Storm Jameson finds &quot;no touch, not the slightest, of showing-off, acting a part... in the marvellously gifted child forced to hide from an-alas-imaginable cruelty&quot;. That is a matter of opinion. Other readers may find her a bundle of self-consciousness and self-dramatisation, a precocious and somewhat over-sexed child, thrown back upon the physical and mental symptoms of her own puberty in an unnatural atmosphere. But of her vitality, her unquenchable gaiety, her intelligence, her high courage, and her power to express herself on paper there can be no doubt. There is an uncanny penetration about her analysis of personal relationships and a touch of literary genius about her power to describe them. This book comes to us fairly late in the day. We have begun to forget Belsen and the persecutions and pogroms that led up to it. It may be too, that we have derived much from the post-war luxury of magnanimous forgiveness. It is a very easy kind of forgiveness and one from which the forgiver can derive ineffable spiritual satisfaction at small cost to himself. And it is particularly easy when those to be forgiven are as amiable and courteous as Germans habitually show themselves to be when defeated. If so, it may well be that this strange and moving diary of gifted vital child, hunted from home to exile, from exile to hide-out, from hide-out to death, has come to us at an opportune moment: the moment when we are about to arm her hunters for the defence of western civilisation. \u00b7 Anne Frank.

Boris Johnson&apos;s love of ancient Athens has been a recurring topic in this campaign. I guess we would all agree that Londoners would look better if we swapped our uniform of T-shirts and jeans for togas. But it was left to his biographer, Andrew Gimson, to set out the hard details in the Telegraph and explain exactly how Johnson&apos;s admiration for Pericles would inform his mayoralty. Ken Livingstone&apos;s biographer, Andrew Hosken, has also argued that Livingstone&apos;s inner circle sees London&apos;s future as an independent city state. He leaves us guessing as to which city is their model, but as Hosken describes them as Marxists, there can only be one candidate: the Paris commune of 1870-1871. Marx&apos;s analysis of the collapse of the commune - The Civil War in France - is his key text on practical politics. Marx was so enamoured of the commune, and so concerned that its mistakes should not be repeated, that he welcomed its refugees with open arms: two of the commune&apos;s more able soldiers married Marx&apos;s daughters. Marx&apos;s passionate engagement with the commune has led to an exhaustive library of leftwing writing on the commune, how it could have been improved and how it might have survived. The Trinidadian socialist C L R James put Marx&apos;s conclusions eloquently in an article from 1946.  &quot;Marx ... showed that the capitalist army, the capitalist state, the capitalist bureaucracy, cannot be seized by the revolutionary proletariat and used for its own purposes. It had to be smashed completely and a new state organised, based upon the organisation of the working class.&quot;  So which is better: Pericles&apos; Athens or the Paris commune? Both ended in failure. Aristophanes&apos; comic political plays depict Athens a little after Pericles&apos; time, in the midst of a profound credit crunch, with the poorer members of the electorate so deeply in hock to the rich, that they are practically enslaved. Alistair Horne&apos;s masterly history of the commune, The Fall of Paris, argues that far from being a civil war, the commune was a moment of madness, in which self-righteous revolutionaries initiated an impossible political project that, in its failure, led inevitably to a barbaric police state. Okay, the past results were dismal, but does anyone doubt the genius of Livingstone or Johnson to triumph over the past? Well, yes. So could Brian Paddick offer a rival image of the city state? Perhaps late-20th Amsterdam, with its liberal drug policies? In his autobiography, Brian Paddick talks about the way his faith informs his ethics and his politics. It seems Brian&apos;s preferred city state is Jerusalem, in its universal, yet oh so English form, of course. As William Blake asked: &quot;And was Jerusalem builded here?&quot; In a campaign that has too often focused on personalities, at least we now have clear distinctions: Athens, Paris or a green hill far away.

When a sequence of almighty crashes ends the third section, then recurs to open the fourth, it sounds almost comically over-scored.

Born in Bruges, he dropped out of school at 15 and, unhappy at home, left soon after for the second world war, working in a sugar factory for a while.

His first novel, The Duck Hunt - a work inspired by William Faulkner&apos;s As I Lay Dying - was published in the US in 1955, and other works, The Swordfish (1996) and Desire (1997) followed. He is perhaps best known, however, for his 1983 masterwork, The Sorrow of Belgium, published by Penguin in 1991 and recently reprinted by the Overlook Press. In the tradition of G\u00fcnter Grass&apos;s The Tin Drum, the novel recounts the story of Louis Steynaeve from his time in a Catholic boarding school through the second world war. Claus&apos;s clearly autobiographical narrative explores the natures of the Dutch and French-speaking Belgians, and their various collaborations. His intricate insights into the interrelationships of social and governmental corruptions, black-market profiteering, revenge, antisemitism and simple stupidity reveal the reasons for complacency and outright acceptance of the Nazis by thousands of his countrymen, including his own early romanticising of the Germans. As he later admitted: &quot;The Germans were disciplined, sang marching songs - they were very exotic enemies. Like Louis, I liked them very much.&quot; In all his works, Claus tackles difficult subjects, including incest, homosexuality, and what he determined were the detrimental effects of religion. Desire depicts a world of small-time drunkards and gamblers, in particular Michel and Jake, who travel together to Las Vegas in search of excitement; what the two discover in the American desert are the entangled tragedies they have left behind; Michel, we gradually perceive, has abandoned the woman he was to marry, Jake&apos;s daughter Didi, for a homosexual affair with another of the bar denizens, leaving her in mental collapse. Jake, a seemingly jovial and peaceful man, suddenly lashes out in anger, killing a young gay dancer. Claus&apos;s novel The Swordfish recounts the story of a wealthy woman and her son left by her husband in a small, provincial town. Martin, an intense child, who has been converted to religion by a local teacher, sees himself as Jesus bearing the cross to Golgotha, while their drunken hired hand, Richard - a former veterinarian who has been imprisoned for performing unlawful abortions - looks on. Accusations of child abuse and the sexual coupling of the woman, Sibyelle, with a nebbish-like schoolteacher, ends in the brutal murder of Richard&apos;s wife. In his 1969 play Friday, Claus explores an incestuous relationship. When George Vermeersch returns from prison, he discovers his wife is having an affair with another man. Partially in revenge, but also in an attempt at reconciliation, he admits that he has had a sexual relationship with their daughter; the wife, in turn, admits that she had known of the situation without demanding it come to an end, and, as the lover leaves her, the two are left to reconstruct their empty marriage. For all his seemingly dark and despairing portrayals of Flemish life, however, Claus was a great believer in the human race, recognising everyone as interconnected and linked; accordingly, any evil or mean act of his figures affects the entire society. The betrayal of anyone is the betrayal of all. As Claus noted in a magazine interview: &quot;We cannot accept the world as it is. Each day we should wake up foaming at the mouth because of the injustice of things.&quot; He was often nominated for the Nobel prize and it is on record that he had given up hope of winning. He did, however, receive numerous Belgian and European prizes for his writing. Claus was also a film-maker, and from 1953 until 1955 he lived in Italy, where his lover and, later first wife, Elly Overzier, acted in films. Overzier bore Claus his first son, Thomas, in 1963. In the early 1970s, he had an affair with Sylvia Kristel, the star of the Emmanuelle films; their son Arthur was born in 1975. Claus married his second wife, Veerle de Wit, in 1993. Often described as a &quot;contrarian,&quot; Claus was a writer who might be described as both traditional and experimental, often blending the two to produce powerful messages that, for sympathetic readers, could not be ignored. And in that sense Claus&apos;s canvas was, as he describes it in his poem A Woman: 14, a &quot;landscape of anger&quot;: Don&apos;t run from me (lame humans) Meet me, feel me, Crease and break, break, According to his wife, he had chosen euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium, as his agent of death. As the head of the Flemish Literature Fund, Greet Ramael, responded: &quot;He chose the moment of his death himself. He left life as the proud man he was.&quot; \u00b7 Hugo Maurice Julien Claus, novelist, poet, painter, playwright and film-maker, born April 5 1929; died March 19 2008", "sentences": ["As a visual artist - Claus was the son of a painter - he was also involved with the international art movement Cobra (which took its name from the first letters of the major cities of its proponents COpenhagen-BRussels-Amsterdam)."], "title": "Obituary: Hugo Claus", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/02/culture.obituaries", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-02T23:10:28Z", "article": "Last October, I stumbled across my eldest son sitting on a park bench in the middle of the day, wearing his school uniform but nowhere near his school. Ned is a highly strung, hormonal young man - but no more so than any other teenager, or so I had thought, and certainly not the sort of boy to skip lessons and look for trouble. He has never been interested in drugs or alcohol; he is not recalcitrant or naughty. So I marched him home, called his school - which didn&apos;t even seem to know he was missing - and we sat down in the garden so he could explain what he had been up to. It was difficult to get him to open up at first but then he said something that surprised me. &quot;I&apos;m really lazy,&quot; he told me. &quot;I just can&apos;t be bothered.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think you are,&quot; I said, taken aback. &quot;But are you tired?&quot; &quot;All the time,&quot; he confirmed. &quot;Do you mean you feel lethargic?&quot; &quot;I suppose so.&quot; What I was hearing began to ring alarm bells. In my work as a reporter on Tonight with Trevor McDonald, I have interviewed many people who were depressed - from the woman whose daughter was killed in the attack on the Twin Towers to victims of domestic abuse - and a common symptom was this state of lethargy. I called a friend who recommended I take Ned to a psychologist. At the time, this was terribly shocking - but looking back, Ned had experienced several traumatic events. He was knocked down by a car aged 12 and left with a bad compact fracture to his leg, then undiagnosed damage to his foot left him with a permanent limp. Meanwhile, my marriage was over. Divorce meant moving house, and on top of all that Ned had begun working for his GCSEs. With all this going on, I hadn&apos;t realised how nervous and frightened he had become. I resolved to spend less time away with work and more time at home with the children, and hoped my presence would have a steadying effect. Perhaps, now his worries had come to light, we could put this all behind us. Instead, life became more complicated for all of us. The truanting carried on, with Ned finding new ways to sneak back home from school, only now he had to be even more surreptitious to avoid his mother. Desperate with worry, I contacted Claire Casey, a psychologist who specialises in adolescent problems at the Priory clinic in London. She confirmed the diagnosis of depression and decided on a regime of therapy. At this point, she wanted to try to help Ned without medication. Then matters got worse. When I went to Ned&apos;s parents&apos; evening last December, two of his teachers were surprised to see me. They thought that Ned had left the school altogether. We decided he should drop some subjects to reduce the workload . His father took Ned&apos;s siblings away for Christmas so he and I could be alone together. We ate all our meals together and talked. I was optimistic that he would be better by the January term. On the second day of the new term, I found Ned hiding in the bathroom, having sneaked back into the house. He turned up at home several times that week, on one occasion having gone missing for so long that I called the police. On that occasion, I eventually found him hidden, wrapped up in a duvet inside a cupboard. Dr Casey decided that Ned&apos;s brain wasn&apos;t producing enough serotonin and she started him on a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. But the truanting went on - Ned would register for a mock exam and not turn up. We employed a tutor to help him catch up, and again cut down the number of subjects he was studying. We also brought in a personal trainer four times a week and concentrated on improving his diet. Ned&apos;s father came to take him away for a break, but Ned literally couldn&apos;t stand up. He had no energy at all. There was a huge showdown and Ned admitted he wasn&apos;t taking his tablets. Dr Casey gave him a new prescription for Prozac, which had to be taken once a day (not three times like the last set), and I kept them under my control. And we insisted he still went to school. He himself admitted that school wasn&apos;t the problem: he liked it there, and he had plenty of friends. The real problem - it began to emerge - was that Ned was frightened of the world. Life for teenagers has become incredibly pressured and complicated. You have to look the right way, have the right gear, get the grades - Ned just didn&apos;t want to engage with it all. Helping him to avoid it was his computer. Ned&apos;s cyber habit was feeding his fears of the real world, allowing him to hide in another, parallel world, one of his choosing, where he could defy reality and its complications. I should have spotted his addiction before. I had been sent on an assign ment 18 months earlier to do a story on cyber addicts in Atlanta and Amsterdam, and what I saw terrified me. Youngsters are lured into alternative worlds where they design their own characters and can be anything they want to be - thinner, richer, more popular, sexier. In a cyber world, you don&apos;t have to invest any real feeling, so knock-backs don&apos;t hurt the way they do in real life. You don&apos;t learn risk taking and emotional development is arrested. You facilitate connections - you don&apos;t forge relationships. These worlds are designed to keep children playing the games for hours at a stretch. You can&apos;t just log on for an hour and then walk away. One 20-year-old I met played for 17 hours at a stretch using a milk bottle when he needed a pee, rather than get up and go to the loo. I knew Ned was often playing late into the night after his brother - with whom he shares a room - had fallen asleep. But I had thought it was a harmless distraction. I had even sat with him as he played, like a good, responsible parent, so that I would understand and know how he spent his leisure time. But it was only after talking to Ned&apos;s doctor - who has a ward dedicated to cyber addicts - that I realised he was using this world as a haven. While he was online, Ned didn&apos;t have to venture out into the real world . And the longer he stayed in the cyber world, the more frightening the real world looked. I thought I could stop Ned playing simply by telling him to, but he was completely addicted. He would take junk food and pizza up to his room so he didn&apos;t have to stop for meals. Our kitchen was flooded three times when he began running baths that were subsequently forgotten, and ended up pouring through our ceilings. Meanwhile, I was becoming stressed - I found myself crying at traffic lights when I was driving. I, too, sought help. I was warned that I would have to stay well and strong for Ned and his siblings if we were to get through this. So that meant not too much alcohol, not going out too much and watching my own diet and exercise. It might have been easier if Ned had had a physical illness - it has been hard at times to remain patient with him. It has been hard, too, realising how different he is to other teenagers. Recently, a friend was complaining about her son&apos;s tatty Manchester United posters, but I would give anything for Ned to be interested in something like that. As it is, his bedroom is completely devoid of personality. We have now taken his computer away. At first Ned would scream and swear at his father, then took to sleeping for long stretches instead. &quot;Now I care about nothing,&quot; he told me. &quot;I don&apos;t think life is worth living.&quot; Was depression something that Ned would have suffered if he hadn&apos;t become addicted to video games? His doctor says he would always have been prone, but there is no doubt they helped create an environment that stopped him communicating with the outside world and made it worse. I&apos;m optimistic that we are getting through to Ned. He was keen that I should write this article and I&apos;m incredibly proud of the way he is handling his illness; he started a new type of therapy this morning, for which we have high hopes. Tackling depression is like turning round the Queen Mary - it will be a long, hard haul, but we all feel that Ned has made a start. He will take a couple of GCSEs this summer and then, hopefully, start working for the rest somewhere else next autumn. Most importantly, I know he doesn&apos;t want to be unhappy. I know he wants to be well. Which is what we - his family - want too. \u00b7 As told to Victoria Lambert.

Unfortunately, they have the reputation of being a tricky crop. On any allotment you&apos;ll hear tales of rudely forked roots, burrowing fly maggots and seeds that don&apos;t come up. But there are ways to beat the pests, and you don&apos;t necessarily need a vegetable plot to produce perfect, mouth-watering roots. One answer is to grow mini-carrots in pots or troughs. This makes sowing - and controlling pests and weeds - easier. Even a backyard can produce a crop. Grown densely and harvested young, the roots are sweet and tender - perfect for salads and stir-fries. Use containers at least 20cm deep, and fill with multipurpose compost. Scatter seed thinly on the surface, cover with a sprinkling of compost and water well. Aim for seedlings about 2cm apart. In 12 weeks they&apos;ll reach edible size, and three or four sowings (April to July) can give a continual summer harvest. On a garden or allotment plot, you can grow bulk supplies of carrots as well as baby roots, but to help you avoid the pitfalls, here are some tips: \u00b7 Prepare the soil. Stones or compacted layers will prevent carrots from growing straight down, causing forked or misshapen roots. They thrive in light soils. On heavy soils, concentrate on improving a small patch by forking in old potting compost or leaf mould. The seeds are small, so you&apos;ll also need a fine, crumbly seed bed. On cloddy soils, try filling substantial drills with old potting compost and sow into this. \u00b7 Delay sowing until the soil is really warm; the seeds should then romp up and be less vulnerable to slugs and fungal diseases. How to tell when it&apos;s at the right temperature? Watch for the weeds and sow when they start to take hold. Even large carrots for autumn and winter can still be sown from now until early June, spaced thinly in drills 15cm apart. Give earlier sowings extra heat by covering with clear polythene or cloches until they emerge. \u00b7 Pre-empt the pests. Slugs often graze on tiny seedlings, kidding you that the seed hasn&apos;t come up. Start controlling them as soon as you have prepared the bed - use traps or wildlife-friendly pellets, or make torch-lit hunts. The traditional advice against carrot flies is to avoid thinning seedlings and to use smelly companion plants, such as marigolds or onions, which mask the scent of the crop. But such measures are rarely sufficient, and although modern varieties marketed as &quot;carrot fly resistant&quot; are less attractive to the pest, they are not immune. The only foolproof way to prevent damage caused by the fly larvae when they hatch from eggs laid in the soil is to cover the rows with fine pest-proof mesh before the seedlings emerge (try Environmesh from agralan.co.uk). Carrot flies are poor fliers and usually stay close to the ground, so pots kept on a wall or bench may also escape attack. Weed seedlings thoroughly, because they are slow-growing at first and easily swamped. But once established, carrots need little attention, except to keep the soil moist. On light, well-drained soils, they can be dug straight from the ground all through the winter. On heavy or waterlogged soils, lift the roots in late autumn, mix them with just-moist leaf mould or old potting compost, and store in bags or boxes in a cool place. \u00b7 By choosing the right varieties, you can have roots from the first crisp accompaniment to summer barbecues right through to the last carrot and coriander soup the following spring. Even then, leftover roots that start to sprout needn&apos;t be wasted. Replant a few in a flower border or in the corner of the vegetable plot. Their ferny leaves make an attractive foil for other plants, and in midsummer they will produce umbels of frothy flowers - beautiful to look at and a magnet for bees and hoverflies. Top varieties to try Grow your own, and you&apos;ll have a choice not only of shape and size, but of colour, too. Red, yellow, purple or white roots are rarely found in the shops, but are worth seeking out because they look stunning on the plate, raw or cooked. They may seem novel, but in medieval times purple and yellow carrots were the only types to exist. It wasn&apos;t until the 17th century that orange carrots arrived (probably bred by the Dutch), but then they swamped the market. Today, biochemists say that the variously coloured varieties have health benefits, each providing different beneficial antioxidants. Their taste can be subtly different - yellow and purple carrots are particularly sweet, for example - but at the end of the day they all taste unmistakably like carrots. Try Yellowstone, Red Samurai or Purple Haze (from Thompson &amp; Morgan; 01473 688821, thompson-morgan.co.uk), or mixtures such as Harlequin (from Mr Fothergill&apos;s; 0845 166 2511, mr-fothergills.co.uk) or Rainbow (from the Organic Gardening Catalogue; 0845 130 1304, organiccatalogue.com). Despite the many new F1 hybrids, traditional varieties of orange carrots (all widely available) still give good results, and seed is much cheaper. Choose short, early varieties such as Amsterdam Forcing for baby carrots, because they develop good colour and sweetness when young. The almost-round Paris Market (from Thomas Etty; 01460 57934, thomasetty.co.uk) may succeed on very heavy or shallow soils where other carrots fail - or grow it just for its attractive shape. For larger summer or autumn roots, the cylindrical, round-ended Nantes varieties are a safe choice on most soils, but on heavy clay the conical Chantenay has more punch. Autumn King is still hard to beat for winter storage. Only on ideal carrot soils - the deep sands - will long, tapering varieties do well: the appropriately named Infinity (Thompson &amp; Morgan, as before) is my favourite. Reader offer Try six different carrot seed varieties for \u00a36.95, or buy two collections for \u00a38.95.

Clearly, the archbishop shared the ecstatic audience&apos;s view that a great new work had entered the repertoire. This astonishing piece started life three years ago, when the London Symphony Orchestra asked its former principal conductor Colin Davis to nominate a composer to write something to mark his 80th birthday. He chose MacMillan, but what started as a proposal for a modest 20-minute work grew into a massive score for full orchestra, soloist, chorus and chamber choir. The spectre of Bach hovers over any attempt to refresh the Passion story, but MacMillan, a devout Catholic, is equal to the challenge, such is his reverence for the material and his mastery of choral writing. In place of Bach&apos;s solo Evangelist, he uses a four-part narrator choir to relate the events leading to the crucifixion of Christ, an approach that illuminates the text in the manner of a medieval manuscript, the familiar words glowing with a special radiance. It&apos;s a compelling device which draws the listener in from the start and holds the attention as the story unfolds. MacMillan gives Christ, sung with awesome authority by Christopher Maltman, elaborate, declamatory passages full of anger and bitterness. This is not a saviour going submissively to the cross, but a furious rebel, railing against the stupidity of his tormentors. Divided into 10 parts, each a small music drama in itself, the piece is punctuated with violent orchestral interjections which reflect the raw cruelty of the subject. And it contrives to be claustrophobically menacing when Christ is being questioned by Pilate and the high priests. Again, these characters are not sung by a single voice, but by the main choir, the vital section which holds the whole drama together. MacMillan&apos;s writing made huge demands on the London Symphony Chorus, but they sang with distinction, producing some inspiring sound, particularly in the ravishing tone clusters of the opening pages. Chief credit for the night&apos;s success should go to Joseph Cullen, the LSC&apos;s director, who not only rehearsed the chorus, but also selected and trained the superb professional narrator choir. Davis looked delighted with his birthday present, conducting the complexities of MacMillan&apos;s score with his customary calm assurance. He goes on to perform it in Boston, Amsterdam and Berlin. And this feisty octogenarian will also be sharing a Covent Garden production of Engelbert Humperdinck&apos;s Hansel and Gretel with 25-year-old Robin Ticciati, who made his London debut last week with The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. He had the sort of problem on the night that he is going to have to get used to on the international stage: his star soprano pulled out. Lisa Milne was too ill to sing arias from Idomeneo, but Claire Rutter and Stephen Gadd came to his aid and sang some Figaro numbers, which rather blew a hole in the evening&apos;s theme of revolution in music, but hey... With his mass of bouncing curls and tall, gawky figure, comparisons with the young Simon Rattle are irresistible. He&apos;s obviously a huge talent, but he didn&apos;t really set the world alight last week with a safe programme of Gluck, Mozart and Haydn. What he did display was great rapport with his players. He&apos;s clearly popular, which will pay dividends in what looks destined to be a glittering career. If you happen to like sweet and sickly tunes, colourful costumes and a laboured, pointless plot, you should head to the London Coliseum for English National Opera&apos;s new production of Franz Leh\u00e1r&apos;s saccharine belle \u00e9poque operetta, The Merry Widow. I would rather eat glass than hear another bar, but this will undoubtedly bring in the crowds and help support ENO&apos;s more adventurous work. Besides, Leh\u00e1r lovers may be tempted to return for a Straussian dose of frocks and frolics when Der Rosenkavalier opens later this month. Canny thinking going on here. It&apos;s far, far better than ENO&apos;s last foray into the genre, the disastrous Kismet, which should have closed on page four. This, at least, has some likable performances and strong, no-nonsense direction from John Copley. Amanda Roocroft as the widow Hanna Glawari sings affectingly, even if her diction is dreadful; Alfie Boe hits a splendid top C in his portrayal of the lovesick Camille, but he&apos;s often overwhelmed by the over-loud orchestra. And gentle John Graham-Hall seems implausible as Hannah&apos;s louche suitor Danilo, but he at least has a sense of comic timing, something which eludes most of the cast, apart from old troupers Roy Hudd and Richard Suart. The whole thing grinds along like a weary pantomime until the welcome last act, when Fiona Murphy, as Valencienne, shows herself to be no mean dancer, can-canning with the best of them. It all looks as camp as Christmas, with more tailcoats, dancing waiters and champagne corks than you can shake a silver-topped cane at, but it never really bubbles over, despite Jeremy Sams&apos;s heroic work on the dialogue, which has some genuinely good gags. Sadly, his jokes can&apos;t rescue a tired plot, but that won&apos;t concern the fans, who will turn up in their droves and hum along (yes, they really do) to those irritatingly cloying melodies.

On one occasion he had a 6ft python wrapped round his torso next to his skin, to protect the creature from the cold. He said when lesson plans failed, the python always did the trick. We were both students at Brighton Teachers&apos; Training College, located opposite fashionably radical Sussex University, but separated by a dual carriageway and a railway line. The year was 1968, the annus mirabilis of youthful insurrection - though not for everybody in quite the same way. The university students had architecture with cloisters, courtyards and reflecting pools designed by Sir Basil Spence, set in 18th-century landscaped gardens suggestive of an Italianate retreat. We had pre-fabricated units perched on a hill of what was once arable farmland, suggestive of a rural business park. Their students travelled on the bus with briefcases full of books; we carried egg-boxes, off-cuts of fabric and powder paint. They read Marx&apos;s 1844 Philosophical Manuscripts, Marcuse&apos;s Eros and Civilisation and The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir; we read Makarenko&apos;s The Road to Life, Piaget&apos;s The Moral Judgement of the Child, and Village School by Miss Read. They had free concerts and raves; we had music and movement. Lessons from communism The radicalism of teacher-training has never received the attention it deserves. For much of the 20th-century it was imbued with an idealism based on an almost Talmudic belief in the inherent goodness of the child: beliefs that would cut little ice in educational or social policy today. In her recent book on Soviet education, Children&apos;s World: Growing up in Russia, Catriona Kelly argues that despite the horrors of nearly every aspect of life in Russia in the 20th-century, state provision for children, along with a cult of childhood, were aspects of that society which even hardline anti-communists claim to miss today. In Britain, a similar reverence for childhood was embedded in the ethos of teacher training. Progressive educational thought in Britain - which helped create this more sympathetic attitude towards children - started with The Fellowship of the New Life, founded in 1883 by the Scottish philosopher Thomas Davidson. An attachment to the idea of an elan vital made it attractive to DH Lawrence. Though Lawrence trained briefly as a teacher, he hated the job, though this did not stop him making two of his most ardent characters, Ursula Brangwen and Rupert Birkin, a classroom teacher and school inspector respectively. In Lawrence&apos;s time, and for some time after, county education officers and school inspectors bestrode the world of life and literary politics like giants, mixing with writers and poets, Freudians, philosophers and independent thinkers. Those professions associated with the education and development of the child were held in the highest intellectual esteem. The same could not be said today. Rural innocence Appreciation of the innocence and inner vitality of the child was not solely a rural concern, as it sometimes seemed in its Wordsworthian idiom. In the 1950s, photographers such as Nigel Henderson in London&apos;s East End, Roger Mayne in Notting Hill, Jimmy Forsythe in Newcastle and Bert Hardy working for Picture Post across Britain, all went to great lengths to capture city children at play - on bombsites, in back alleys, and in the empty streets. In 1959, Iona and Peter Opie finally published their peerless anthology of children&apos;s street songs, The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren, with a cover photograph by Roger Mayne. The Opies had been collecting rhymes and games for more than a decade across the length and breadth of Britain. They observed that while city children played more games (perhaps because they didn&apos;t have to work when away from school), the rural children knew more proverbs and sustained a wider repertoire of folk beliefs. In Edinburgh, JTR Ritchie published his anthology of Scottish children&apos;s games, The Singing Street, in 1964. For so long invisible to the world of politics and public policy, the image of children at play suddenly became a symbol of something better, even of national vitality. Furthermore, this was a realm of public performance and social presence in which young girls played an equal, at times dominant, role. Social change The child at play as a motif of a better world recurs at significant moments of social change. It was central to the Romantic movement in the work of Wordsworth and Blake; it emerged again in the Victorian campaigns against child labour, and then in 20th-century public health campaigns to combat tuberculosis and rickets in Britain&apos;s airless slums. In the aftermath of the second world war, experiments in free play sprang up across Europe: architect Aldo van Eyck famously created 700 new playgrounds in Amsterdam alone; adventure playgrounds proliferated in Scandinavia, and in Britain play provision was put at the centre of planning for the new towns. On the bombsites, and in the streets and school playgrounds, anthropologists, writers and photographers found a resonant symbol of a new world in the making. Reclaiming the streets What happened to the python? It caught a cold and died shortly before Jones moved to Stepney as a qualified teacher in 1969, where he has since spent a lifetime collecting children&apos;s rhymes. When the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood reopened last year, pride of place went to his mural painting The Singing Playground, depicting 148 playground songs from all over the world, mostly collected locally, though some came from his many years working for Amnesty International. As the events of 1968 are commemorated, it is worth noting that it was the postwar celebration of children&apos;s play that anticipated the reclamation of the street as a domain of political liberty. Even the Opies realised that many children&apos;s games were an implicit form of political protest, as when they saw that dangerous games of risk such as Last Across the Road were an &quot;impulse of the tribe&quot; against the encroachment of the car into their sacred territory. This position was endorsed by the anarchist Colin Ward in his seminal 1970s book, The Child in the City, the last great expression of belief in the power of play to turn the street and the playground, if not the world, upside down. \u00b7 Ken Worpole will be giving the Nicolas Walter Memorial Lecture at Conway Hall on May 10, part of 1968 and All That.

Tall and angular, with receding hair and a prominent chin, he became a regular authority figure and inquisitor, though not in leading roles. Archard was born in Fulham, London, where his parents were mayor and mayoress; his father was also a jeweller. He won a scholarship to Rada (1938-39), and an early stage role came as Orsino to Jessica Tandy&apos;s Viola in Twelfth Night at the Regent&apos;s Park open air theatre. During the second world war, he was a conscientious objector, and was sent to work on land owned by the Quaker movement. At the Edinburgh Festival in 1948, in a production of the Glyndebourne Children&apos;s Theatre, he met fellow actor James Belchamber, who was his partner for nearly 60 years. Making his way around regional repertory, Archard worked at Chesterfield with Margaret Tyzack and at Sheffield with Paul Eddington, Peter Sallis and Patrick McGoohan; like many, he believed McGoohan to be a truly great actor, and they worked together again in a couple of episodes of McGoohan&apos;s 1960s TV series Danger Man. In the mid-1950s, Archard and Belchamber ran a touring repertory company, based in Torquay, with Hilda Braid among its players. They also collaborated on the book and lyrics for Our Jack, a musical based on Walter Greenwood&apos;s The Cure For Love, in 1960. Nevertheless, by 1959 Archard was thinking about emigrating to Canada with Belchamber. He postponed his trip to appear in a TV medical drama, then again to do Treason (1959), a Sunday-night play about the July 1944 plot to kill Hitler. Unknown to him, this rush of work resulted from a plan by writer-producer Elwyn Jones to demonstrate his suitability for Spycatcher. Masterminded by Robert Barr, Spycatcher was also produced in the documentary manner, to the extent that Archard was not given billing in the Radio Times until some time into the run. Unlike later, action-orientated spy series, Pinto&apos;s half-hour cases, sometimes little more than two-handers, were based on true stories. The debriefing of wartime refugees afforded many opportunities for Archard&apos;s incisive qualities. One episode saw him get the desired answers from a suspect by throwing darts at a photo of Hitler. Running for three seasons, the series brought Archard much recognition; he was wryly amused about receiving &quot;two direct offers of marriage and about a dozen oblique ones&quot;. Athough half of the episodes still exist, it has never been revived. Nonetheless, when on a continental tour of My Fair Lady in 1983, Archard&apos;s presence in Amsterdam caused excitement - Pinto having been Dutch. He was proud of his role as a magistrate in Terence Rattigan&apos;s last play, Cause Celebre, in the West End in 1977, with Glynis Johns. Anthony Shaffer&apos;s mocking The Case of the Oily Levantine, at the same venue, Her Majesty&apos;s Theatre, two years later, was less successful. However, a full-scale theatrical disaster came with Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s Macbeth at the Old Vic in 1980. Archard played Duncan; he had previously been Angus in Roman Polanski&apos;s film version, in 1971. In the film version of Dad&apos;s Army (1971), Archard was a regular general dismissing Captain Mainwaring as a &quot;damn bank clerk!&quot; He was in several of the popular Edgar Wallace B-movies, as well as John Huston&apos;s playful The List of Adrian Messenger (1963); he and Huston had a mutual friend in Deborah Kerr. He was the Duke of Wellington in Number 10 (YTV, 1983), an anthology series depicting prime ministers. For publicity purposes, the actors who took the roles were photographed with Margaret Thatcher; Archard was not impressed by her, but then, he had been a lifelong reader of this paper. He also played a government figure in Hidden Agenda (1990), Ken Loach&apos;s controversial film derived from the John Stalker inquiry. After retiring in his early 80s, Archard lived contentedly in Somerset with Belchamber, who survives him. \u00b7 Bernard Joseph Archard, actor, born August 20 1916; died May 1 2008", "sentences": ["Nonetheless, when on a continental tour of My Fair Lady in 1983, Archard&apos;s presence in Amsterdam caused excitement - Pinto having been Dutch."], "title": "Obituary: Bernard Archard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/07/television.bbc", "tags": ["Television industry", "BBC", "Media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-07T01:58:15Z", "article": "Everton are to bid for the underemployed Chelsea midfielder Steve Sidwell at the end of the season with the former Reading player having been reduced to a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge since moving under the Bosman ruling last summer. Sidwell has not played in the Premier League since a brief substitute&apos;s appearance in the defeat of his former club in January, with his only match since coming in the FA Cup against Huddersfield Town. He would qualify for a winners&apos; medal should Chelsea secure the Premier League title on Sunday having made 15 top-flight appearances this season, though he has understandably grown frustrated at his lack of opportunities. A fee of around \u00a33m should secure the 25-year-old&apos;s services, though Sidwell&apos;s wage demands could yet prove onerous. The Everton manager, David Moyes, is keen to strengthen all areas of his squad and attended the end-of-season Champions League play-off semi-final second leg between Ajax and Heerenveen at the Amsterdam Arena on Monday to watch the visitors&apos; United States midfielder Michael Bradley. However, the 20-year-old was sent off for two bookable offences in the opening 39 minutes. The former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry has confirmed he will stay at Barcelona next season. The 30-year-old has been an inconsistent performer since moving to the Catalan club but is determined to stay. &quot;About my future, no, I do not want to leave,&quot; Henry said. &quot;I still have three years left on my contract here and I will still be here next year.&quot; It is likely the France international will play next season under the former Bar\u00e7a club captain Pep Guardiola, with reports in Spain saying he will take over from the coach Frank Rijkaard. Barcelona&apos;s delegate commission, which includes the club president, Joan Laporta, and the sporting director, Txiki Beguirist\u00e1in, met on Monday and recommended that Guardiola should replace Rijkaard as first-team coach, it was reported.

Another day, another Ramsay restaurant: nowadays, the great man is not so much cordon bleu as Gordon blur. Having opened his first French restaurant at the Trianon Hotel in the Palace of Versailles in March, the famously foul-mouthed chef now says he intends to double the size of his empire over the next three years. Ramsay has also recently launched Plane Food at Heathrow&apos;s Terminal 5 and is poised to open the Italian Morano restaurant and his first hotel, The York &amp; Albany, also both in the capital. This is not to mention Gordon Ramsay at the London hotel in LA, two Maze outlets in London and ventures in Amsterdam, Berlin and Geneva. Yet is all well in his expletive-laden kitchens? Ramsay&apos;s new Versailles venture has been panned by the doyen of French food writing, Francios Simon, who sniffs, &quot;You don&apos;t get gourmets at a restaurant where the name chef isn&apos;t in the kitchen.&quot; Ramsay has also seen the closure of Angela Hartnett at the Connaught and La Noisette. So what is Gord&apos;s next move? He is going to Australia to make a reality TV show. Some people might say celebrity has gone to Gordon&apos;s head and he is spreading himself way too thin nowadays. Nibbles, however, couldn&apos;t possibly comment. IN SEASON Cherries The cherry season in Britain really hits its swing in July but with the delicious red fruit already being harvested in southern Europe, it&apos;s surely worth a few extra pennies just to get a taste of summer a little bit early. There are so many traditional cherry recipes. In parts of Eastern Europe, sour cherries are used to make hot or cold soup. The French swear by clafoutis, a batter pudding made with sweet cherries, and Germans can&apos;t get enough of Black Forest gateau and the famously tangy kirsch spirit. Don&apos;t take the luscious fruit for granted, though. Foodloversbritain.com and The Real Food Festival recently launched the Cherry Aid campaign to &quot;bring together British consumers, cherry growers and producers of cherries in the battle to save them from extinction.&quot; If you feel the need to pop a cherry, there is even an ideal time to do so - though you&apos;ll have to wait until British Cherry Day on July 19. CRITIC&apos;S QUOTE One item on the menu had buried within it greatness - a coconut meringue with passion-fruit pur\u00e9e, these two concoctions quite superb. But they arrived buried beneath enough cloying whipped cream to have kept John Prescott in the toilet with his fingers down his throat for months on end.  Rod Liddle is unimpressed with Coles in Marlborough, Wiltshire BEST BUY La Tasca, the speciality tapas restaurant with 70 outlets in the UK, is mounting a Tapas for a Tenner campaign. It does exactly what it says on the tin: You can eat as much as you want in exchange for a crisp \u00a310 note, although if you&apos;re anything like us, you&apos;ll find if difficult to get beyond two hearty chunks of patatas bravas before the waistline starts groaning. The chain has also launched a new menu with a special section targeted at the &quot;Shy man&quot;. No, it&apos;s not Iain Duncan Smith, but the average conservative male British diner who is wary of leaving his comfort zone to try more exotic dishes. It is also introducing 30 different gluten-free dishes and 17 that are untouched by garlic. TOP TIPPLE Fruit juice company Pago Fruit Juices is calling on restaurants and hotels to give fruit juices a place in their wine lists. Pago claims that 17% of British adults are teetotal, while further large chunks of the population eschew alcohol every now and then on health grounds or because they are pregnant or driving. So up to one quarter of all customers could be looking for more than the usual options of cola, orange juice, lemonade or water. Tony Harwood, managing director of Pago Fruit Juices, comments: &quot;All restaurants take pride and time in developing a balanced and representative menu and wine list... All I&apos;m saying is that if 25% of diners can&apos;t or won&apos;t drink alcohol, why not give the selection of soft drinks and fruit juices the space in the wine list they deserve.&quot; Pago itself offers 15 varieties of fruit juices and nectars including apple juice, tropical juice cocktail, blood orange and lime - though Nibbles guilty favourite is the sweet peach.

HTC has not historically sold products under its own name. But that is changing with a TV campaign promoting the HTC Touch, which many observers believe is the smartphone with the best chance of challenging the much-hyped iPhone. The TV campaign, created by agency 180 Amsterdam, is aiming to establish the HTC brand in key markets including the US and Europe. HTC&apos;s campaign, which will initially launch in the US but is being considered for other countries, is called &quot;Set your fingers free&quot;. The 60-second commercial features a set of fingers that &quot;walk&quot; through different miniature scenes including a city, a train, ice skating and disco dancing. At the end of the ad the fingers alight on an HTC Touch phone with the aim to highlight the &quot;possibilities at your fingertips&quot;. &quot;It is about the experiences and freedom these devices give us,&quot; said Adam Chasnow, creative director at 180 Amsterdam.  &quot;It goes way beyond wireless data speeds and the specific technologies. It is about how smart devices, like the HTC Touch, fit into the lives we are already leading&quot;. The campaign will run from today in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles using a combination of TV, cinema, print, outdoor and digital advertising as well as online films. Ads will also run in the New York subway and on tray-tables in 11,250 US Airways flights.Earlier this week HTC unveiled the next generation of the popular Touch device, the Touch Diamond, which will be available in Europe from next month. Last year Guinness launched an ad featuring a pair of hands performing quirky movements while waiting to be served a pint of the dark stuff. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

The script may be deep-space corny, the plot borrowed from 2001, but De Palma launches into some scenes of high suspense, though he uses them up well before the tiresome finale. Buchanan Rides Alone  (Budd Boetticher, 1958) 2.40pm, BBC2 Light-hearted Boetticher-Randolph Scott collaboration investing standard plot with bushwhacking good humour. Scott plays cheery Buchanan, riding into the town of Agry and clearing it of the villainous Agry boys amid much fist-fightin&apos;, shootin&apos; and lynchin&apos;. This is how B-westerns were meant to be. Young Winston  (Richard Attenborough, 1972) 4.45pm, BBC2 This account of the dashing young Winston Churchill&apos;s youthful adventures protecting the British Empire in India and South Africa looks like pure Boy&apos;s Own invention, but it&apos;s largely true - the action is gleaned from Churchill&apos;s autobiography, My Early Life. Simon Ward is a tad effeminate in the title role, but it rips and roars through war, family strife and political chicanery.  East Is East  (Damien O&apos;Donnell, 1999) 9pm, C4 O&apos;Donnell&apos;s screen version of Ayub Khan-Din&apos;s play is a delightful little comedy about an Asian family&apos;s struggles in early-70s Salford. Om Puri is the Pakistani dad who runs the fish and chip shop with English wife Linda Bassett, and tries to bring up his large family in the traditional manner - arranged marriages, excruciating family gatherings and all; but the children start to rebel. A film that makes its points with wit and warmth. The Hole  (Nick Hamm, 2001) 10.50pm, C4 After four pupils at an English boarding school go missing for two weeks, and only one of them returns, police psychologist Embeth Davidtz question the survivor (Thora Birch) about what happened to the other three in the abandoned bunker where they were trapped. Adapted from Guy Burt&apos;s cult novel, it&apos;s an edgy, harrowing British excursion into teen-thriller territory - even if Hamm doesn&apos;t quite sustain it to the bitter end. The Lightship  (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1985) 12.15am, BBC2 Psychotic Robert Duvall and his ugly escapee henchmen hijack a lightship off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, but the captain is impassive Klaus Maria Brandauer and the baddies have run their flag up the wrong pole. Good, glowering performances and a suspenseful clash of light and dark, good and evil, in a drama reminiscent of Huston&apos;s Key Largo. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  (Tobe Hooper, 1974) 1.10am, C4 Hooper&apos;s intelligent and disturbing horror movie is based on the gruesome exploits of Winsconsin serial killer Ed Gein. A bunch of standard-issue teenagers (including Marilyn Burns) travelling in the Texas wilderness are carved up, one by one, by Gunnar Hansen&apos;s Leatherface, an inbred monster who wears a mask of human skin and wields a chainsaw. The film has a notorious reputation but there&apos;s little graphic violence and there&apos;s a wicked sense of humour at work in the depiction of Leatherface&apos;s cannibalistic family. La Nouvelle \u00c8ve  (Catherine Corsini, 1999) 3.10am, BBC2 Karin Viard as Camille has the gamine charm of Audrey Tautou&apos;s Am\u00e9lie, and is the best thing about this cliched French drama. Camille lives a carefree life of casual sex and drugs, until she falls for a happily married man (Pierre-Loup Rajot): then it&apos;s all about the emotional travails of the mistress, but with its dull script and two-dimensional characters, there&apos;s only the vibrant Viard to admire. Sunday May 11 The Jewel Of The Nile  (Lewis Teague, 1985) 3pm, ITV1 Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are reunited for this sequel to Romancing The Stone. After a few months of romantic stuff, the schooner the couple &quot;sailed&quot; through Manhattan at the end of the original is blown to bits, and they are pitched into a new adventure in the Middle East. There&apos;s another jewel, although it&apos;s not quite what they imagine it to be. Again it&apos;s fast and funny, with Danny DeVito enjoying himself as the villain. Remember: when the going gets tough, the tough get going... Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home  (Dwight H Little, 1995) 6.15pm, Five The cuddly killer whale returns to be menaced by an oil slick from a damaged tanker. Young human friend Jesse (Jason James Richter) helps save the day, while discovering youthful yearnings for Nadine (Mary Kate Schellhardt) and having problems with the foster parents. All pretty similar to part one, then. Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom  (Steven Spielberg, 1984) 8.05pm, BBC1 Harrison Ford&apos;s intrepid archaeologist, variously aided and hindered by companions Short Round and Willie Scott, launches into a death-defying quest for the magical Sankara stone. Yes, we&apos;ve been here before in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, but this second of the three Indiana films is still a hugely enjoyable adventure with some hugely enjoyable set-pieces. Hero (Zhang Yimou, 2002) 9.05pm, C4 If there were an Oscar for most beautiful movie, Zhang Yimou&apos;s historical epic would have won by the length of the Great Wall. It&apos;s set in the third century BC, where warrior Jet Li is telling the emperor how he has disposed of his enemies, in a series of flashback fights. Reactionary politics aside, it&apos;s exquisite. Legally Blonde  (Robert Luketic, 2001) 9.05pm, Five Reese Witherspoon&apos;s Californian sorority queen, Elle, is undeterred when her ambitious boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) dumps her for more intellectual types as he heads for Harvard Law School: she enrols there too. Witherspoon is in her element as a pretty-in-pink bull in a china shop in Harvard&apos;s hallowed halls - even if the way in which her Valley girl street-wisdom proves superior to the sophistication of her fellow students seems a tad implausible. Sudden Death  (Peter Hyams, 1995) 10.55pm, C4 Smooth villain Powers Boothe and gang have sealed off an ice hockey stadium&apos;s VIP lounge, taken the US vice-prez prisoner and are demanding an implausible ransom to be delivered before the game ends. Then, up steps firefighter Jean-Claude Van Damme, an ordinary guy, to save his little girl, who is among the hostages. Gossip  (Davis Guggenheim, 2000) 11pm, Five A flawed thriller from the director of Al Gore&apos;s global warming alert, An Inconvenient Truth. This is more an inconvenient falsehood, with three college students whimsically starting a rumour - that their virginal classmate (Kate Hudson) had sex at a party. Sounds fairly innocent, but it all gets ludicrously out of hand, and grows ever less plausible. The Invisible Circus  (Adam Brooks, 2001) 1.45am, C4 Pretty but limp drama in which Jordana Brewster&apos;s Phoebe tries to unravel the mystery of her sister Faith&apos;s (Cameron Diaz) suicide. She follows Faith&apos;s hippy 60s quest through Amsterdam and Paris to the Portuguese coast and takes up, hesitantly, with sis&apos;s ex, Christopher Eccleston. It&apos;s a long, cliche-ridden journey. Monday May 12 The Way We Were  (Sydney Pollack, 1973) 12.45pm, C4 Love on the grand scale between Robert Redford&apos;s indolent upper-crust writer and Barbra Streisand&apos;s brash political activist, from the innocence of 30s college days to the McCarthyite 50s. They make a lovely couple, but it&apos;s a long haul and the only really memorable part is the Oscar-winning theme song, sung by Streisand. Exit Wounds  (Andrzej Bartkowiak, 2001) 10pm, C4 If you were hoping Steven Seagal had gone to the retirement home for chubby washed-up martial arts stars, you&apos;ll be disappointed to see him jogging through his same old shtick here. He&apos;s disgraced cop Orin Boyd, back on the streets of Detroit and mixing it with corrupt cops and drug dealers. The Forgotten  (Joseph Ruben, 2004) 11.05pm, Five The excellent Julianne Moore works hard to keep this paranoid sci-fi thriller on track: she&apos;s a mum grieving for her eight-year-old son who died in a plane crash - except that now she&apos;s being told by shrink Gary Sinise, and everyone else, that she has invented the whole tragedy and never had a son. Cue gradual revelation of a giant, not-very-credible conspiracy... Tuesday May 13 The Last Command  (Frank Lloyd, 1955) 12.50pm, C4 A less well-known account of the siege of the Alamo, in which 187 Texans held out against a massive Mexican force in 1836. John Wayne&apos;s 1960 movie, The Alamo, is of course the definitive version, but this earlier movie from Lloyd is authentically done, focusing on Sterling Hayden&apos;s heroic James Bowie. Phenomenon  (Jon Turteltaub, 1996) 11.15pm, BBC1 John Travolta stars as George Malley, an ordinary garage mechanic until a bolt from the blue turns him into a genius who speed-reads, soaks up facts and figures, and predicts natural disasters. For a while he&apos;s the talk of the town while he woos single mum Kyra Sedgwick; but there&apos;s a price to pay for his new gifts... Wednesday May 14 Bounce  (Don Roos, 2000) 11.30pm, BBC1 Ben Affleck stars as a cocky ad executive who gives his plane ticket to an acquaintance at the airport so that he can dally with Natasha Henstridge; the plane crashes, killing all on board. Wallowing in guilt and booze, he seeks out the dead man&apos;s widow (Gwyneth Paltrow) and of course falls for her, but can he cast off his arrogant, womanising ways? Friday May 16 Timecop  (Peter Hyams, 1994) 11.40pm, BBC1 Jean-Claude Van Damme knocks holes in the space-time continuum to investigate crooked senator Ron Silver. And while he&apos;s there, to check out the murder of his wife (Mia Sara). Hyams is pretty adept at these sci-fi shenanigans, and Van Bam does the business with fists, feet and guns. Day Of The Dead  (George A Romero, 1985) 12.35am, BBC2 After Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead, this concluded Romero&apos;s zombie trilogy (that, with Land Of The Dead, belatedly became a quartet). Surviving humans are in an underground silo trying to rehabilitate the flesh-eating undead in another gory, tongue-in-cheek, intelligent horror movie.", "sentences": ["She follows Faith&apos;s hippy 60s quest through Amsterdam and Paris to the Portuguese coast and takes up, hesitantly, with sis&apos;s ex, Christopher Eccleston."], "title": "The week's best films", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/may/10/features16.theguide3", "tags": ["Culture", "Television", "Television & radio"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-12T12:45:07Z", "article": " No prizes for popularity ... Ralph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett in the film adaptation of Peter Carey&apos;s shortlisted Oscar and Lucinda The recent announcement of the Best of the Booker shortlist has slightly wrong-footed me. Salman Rushdie&apos;s Midnight&apos;s Children, JM Coetzee&apos;s Disgrace, Nadine Gordimer&apos;s The Conservationist, Pat Barker&apos;s The Ghost Road, JG Farrell&apos;s Siege Of Krishnapur and Peter Carey&apos;s Oscar And Lucinda are all creditable choices. It may be a very &quot;Bookerish&quot; list, with all that that entails, but what did you expect from a Best of the Booker? It&apos;s hard to have a truly cynical reaction. The three selectors (Victoria Glenridding, Mariella Frostrup and John Mullan) haven&apos;t just gone for the most obviously populist novels (The Life Of Pi and Possession are both out). Nor have they simply opted books that people are more likely to remember thanks to more recent publication. The selection of The Conservationist shows they aren&apos;t afraid of the difficult, discomforting or deadly serious. The Siege Of Krishnapur&apos;s inclusion also suggests that they have a healthy sense of humour. Okay, there&apos;s a clanging inevitability to the appearance of Disgrace and Midnight&apos;s Children - but imagine what we&apos;d all be thinking if those two hadn&apos;t made the cut. Still, even if all that makes sneering harder than it might have been, I&apos;m going to give it a shot. This is the Booker, after all. Healthy scepticism is the default and certainly a pleasingly typical British reaction to all things related to our most prestigious and exciting literary prize. You might argue that the whole exercise is doomed from the start. Selecting a list of the best winners is a strange thing to do because it doesn&apos;t compare like with like - there&apos;s no consistency since the judging panels change every year. So it is that, say, DBC Pierre scooped the award in 2003 even though Vernon God Little probably wouldn&apos;t have made the longlist in other years. There&apos;s also the problem, as John Mullan pointed out, that plenty of good novelists who have won the award didn&apos;t do so for their best book: &quot;Lucky the novelist who won for his or her best book, like Coetzee. If Ian McEwan&apos;s Atonement had won the Booker it would have had a great chance, but he won with Amsterdam. And it&apos;s a pity that Margaret Atwood won for The Blind Assassin.&quot; But the final - and most depressing - objection: there&apos;s probably nothing any of us can do to prevent Salman Rushdie from winning. The latest odds from William Hill say it all: 6/4 Salman Rushdie - Midnight&apos;s Children (1981) 3/1 Pat Barker - The Ghost Road (1995) 4/1 Peter Carey - Oscar and Lucinda (1988) 5/1 J M Coetzee - Disgrace (1999) 8/1 Nadine Gordimer - The Conservationist (1974) 10/1 J.G. Farrell - The Siege of Krishnapur (1973) Even William Hill&apos;s media relations director Graham Sharpe seemed unhappy about the fact that it&apos;s such a forgone conclusion. &quot;In literary terms,&quot; he told me, &quot;Midnight&apos;s Children has come to occupy a similar position to Sgt Pepper. There&apos;s a kneejerk reaction from people who haven&apos;t read it an think that&apos;s the correct answer to the question that ensures it&apos;s always going to top these polls.&quot; He also explained that my own personal favourite (from those I&apos;ve read, anyway) The Siege Of Krishnapur, is languishing at the bottom of the chart as much because of its age and the lack of public interest as because of quality. Still as Sharpe also pointed out, &quot;if it gets people talking and promotes a bit of interest in a few books&quot; the Best of the Booker shouldn&apos;t be viewed as an entirely bad thing. Aside from all the above griping and methering there&apos;s also the simple truth that speculating about these things is fun and occasionally even enlightening. And much as I dislike the fact that Midnight&apos;s Children is such a soft choice, I have to admit it&apos;s gone time I actually read the thing, as well as its rivals, so that I can produce an informed opinion of where I think it should stand. I&apos;ll be blogging on those I haven&apos;t covered yet over the next few weeks in authorial alphabetical order starting with Peter Carey.

Her name was Rosemary Toole and, police said, she had been suffering from depression. Her suicide would probably have gone unreported were it not for the fact that she&apos;d been spotted at Dublin airport a day earlier, picking up two jolly-seeming Americans at arrivals. The three of them were then seen drinking Jack Daniels and coke at the Atlantic Coast Hotel in County Mayo. At one point - other drinkers later testified to the police - Toole stood up to go to the toilet and did a jig at the table. The next day she was dead and that night the two mysterious Americans, one wearing a dog collar, left Dublin. The Irish police released the names of their suspects. They were seeking the arrest and extradition of the Reverend George Exoo and his partner Thomas McGurrin, of Beckley, West Virginia, for the crime of assisting a suicide, which, under Irish law, carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. I telephoned Exoo to ask if I could follow him around. I imagined myself as being pro-assisted suicide, although I didn&apos;t know much about the ins and outs. But it seemed only fair to let someone kill themselves and have a reverend at their side if that is what they wanted. The Irish prosecutors struck me as draconian and anachronistic. I wasn&apos;t alone in believing this: radio phone-in shows across Ireland were ablaze with callers supporting Toole&apos;s right to kill herself with a reverend at her side. And so, at dawn on a Monday in 2003, Exoo and I set off in his clapped-out old Mercedes towards Baltimore (a five-hour drive) to visit a new prospective client, Pam Acre, who said she had been suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome since the 70s and was considering killing herself later in the year. Exoo was paying for the petrol even though he was broke. He said he asked for donations from his clients but often didn&apos;t get them, but he didn&apos;t care because this was his calling. &quot;I&apos;ve never done anything as important as this in my ministry,&quot; he told me en route. &quot;I think it&apos;s the reason I was placed on this planet. I&apos;m a midwife to the dying, for those who want to hasten their deaths.&quot; Exoo was cheerful, quite giggly, a gay, liberal, libertarian Unitarian preacher, cultured, funny, charming. He said he often carried around a large, gas-filled inflatable alligator to his &quot;exits&quot; in case the police stopped him on the way. He often used gas as a suicide method. With the alligator, he could pretend he was a children&apos;s party entertainer. But lately he had begun phasing the alligator out. &quot;It made me feel conspicuous,&quot; he said. &quot;Part of the thing is that I want to not be noticed. I&apos;m always careful and I always work quietly, like the Lone Ranger. I do so generally at night and for the most part I make it look like they just died in their sleep. I&apos;ll prop a book up on their lap so it looks like they just expired. But if I&apos;m carrying a big alligator people are going to notice me.&quot; &quot;Plus,&quot; I said, &quot;surely the last thing your clients would want to see in the minutes before death is a large inflatable alligator coming through the door.&quot; &quot;Exactly,&quot; said Exoo. So that was why he no longer kept an alligator in the boot of his car. There was something Laurel and Hardy-ish about Exoo. Earlier he had demonstrated the gas method for me by attaching a hose to the end of a gas tank, but he did something wrong in the preparation and the gas tank practically exploded, shooting the hose across the room and whiplashing his stomach. We all shrieked. &quot;Does this happen when you&apos;re helping people?&quot; I asked, aghast. &quot;This has never happened before,&quot; Exoo replied, a bit sheepishly. Acre lived in a decrepit old country cottage in the outskirts of Baltimore. She looked as crumbling as her house. She was 59 but she acted 30 years older. She let us in. We all sat on her sofa.  &quot;Tell me about your illness,&quot; Exoo asked her. &quot;This is a difficult disease to cope with,&quot; Acre replied, &quot;because they run all the tests and they come back negative. Then they decide that ...&quot; &quot;It&apos;s all in your head,&quot; said George.  &quot;Right,&quot; said Pam.  They smiled at each other.  &quot;They start wanting you to go to psychiatrists,&quot; said Acre. &quot;But of course that&apos;s totally useless.&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; said Exoo, softly. &quot;Sure.&quot; Exoo wasn&apos;t, I noticed to my surprise, saying anything to Acre that might possibly dissuade her from committing suicide. Instead they talked about the &quot;mechanics of the dying&quot; (what pills and gas and apparatus Acre would need) and she seemed delighted to have someone there who didn&apos;t question her symptoms or intentions at all. Then she turned to me. &quot;I&apos;ve learned what I can from this,&quot; she said, indicating her skinny, frail body. &quot;I don&apos;t judge much of anybody for anything. Because until you walk in somebody else&apos;s shoes you do not know.&quot; Exoo told me he drifted into assisting suicides in the early 90s when he was a Unitarian minister in Pittsburgh. Unitarianism is a middle-class, liberal religion and Pittsburgh is a tough, working-class town, so he didn&apos;t have many parishioners. He would look at his tiny congregation and wonder if he was wasting his life. One day a parishioner approached him and said, &quot;My husband has got ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neurone disease] and your name has been given to me as someone who might help.&quot; &quot;It was that vague,&quot; Exoo said. &quot;But I knew what she meant. Two weeks later he said to his wife, &apos;It&apos;s time. Call George Exoo.&apos;&quot; That&apos;s how Exoo found his calling. He says he has gone on to assist 102 people, including Acre, who killed herself, with Exoo at her side, a few months after our visit. In early 2004, Irish police formally instigated extradition proceedings against Exoo. They asked the FBI to arrest him. Exoo telephoned me. Could I come to Seattle? He had something he wanted to tell me. It was all quite cloak and dagger. I met him in the lobby of a Seattle airport hotel. There was a slightly weird smile on his face. &quot;What is it?&quot; I asked him. &quot;I&apos;ve ordered a magic potion because I certainly don&apos;t intend to travel to Dublin,&quot; he replied. &quot;So I may be the first right-to-die martyr.&quot;  There was a silence. Exoo gave me a big, profound look. I didn&apos;t know what to say. It was a bit of an awkward moment. &quot;Other than that,&quot; I said, &quot;how are you?&quot; &quot;Fine,&quot; he said. &quot;So, anyway, maybe I should call you over to Beckley for the big event.&quot; I narrowed my eyes. He wanted to kill himself and he wanted me on hand to chronicle it. &quot;I don&apos;t want to,&quot; I said. He looked a bit disappointed. Exoo was in Seattle for a private meeting of international right-to-die activists. The biggest names in the movement were here, such as Derek Humphry, a former British Sunday Times journalist who wrote a bestselling memoir, Jean&apos;s Way, about helping his terminally ill wife commit suicide in 1975. Jean&apos;s Way pretty much began the movement: a network of right-to-die groups inspired by it sprang up across the world in the late 70s. These activists meet once a year in an anonymous hotel somewhere to discuss advances in suicide technologies. &quot;It&apos;s very hush-hush,&quot; Exoo said. &quot;I&apos;m surprised they&apos;re letting you in.&quot; The delegates sat around a table in a conference room. Exoo began by announcing his intention to martyr himself rather than face extradition. Then he scanned the room. I think he was expecting an outpouring of shock and sympathy but in fact people seemed much more interested in what method he was intending to use. &quot;My curiosity is why would you go with a drug approach?&quot; one delegate asked him, and then the others leaned forward, paying attention. Exoo&apos;s reply was that, when one uses gas, the person killing themselves often tries to involuntarily remove the apparatus once they&apos;re unconscious, and he has to hold their hands down, and he &quot;didn&apos;t want to involve anyone else in my passing&quot;. He then changed the subject, saying that Toole in Dublin had promised to send him a message from beyond the grave. The message would somehow take the form of roses. And she fulfilled the promise the day after she died. &quot;What happened was Thomas [Exoo&apos;s partner] and I flew out the next morning to Amsterdam,&quot; he said, &quot;and a man brushed by us on the street. He had roses flung over his shoulder. I&apos;ve never seen anybody with so many roses. There must have been 10 dozen roses! And Thomas said, &apos;There she is! There she is!&apos;&quot; There was a silence. Then Dr Pieter Admiraal, a pioneering Dutch advocate of euthanasia, coughed grumpily and said, &quot;Oh, dear George. To meet somebody with roses in the Netherlands is not so extreme because we are growing them to export to the whole world.&quot;  There was laughter from the others.  &quot;And now you are in trouble,&quot; Admiraal added. &quot;Maybe God can help you.&quot; &quot;Maybe so,&quot; snapped Exoo. That evening I approached Admiraal for an interview. We talked for a while about Exoo&apos;s idealism. &quot;He&apos;s too good for this world,&quot; Admiraal said. Then he added, &quot;I&apos;ve been observing him for a long time, and I&apos;ve asked our psychiatrists to observe him ...&quot; He paused. He was obviously weighing up whether to tell me whatever was on his mind. &quot;He is,&quot; he finally said, &quot;in my opinion, enjoying the death of another person. And that&apos;s dangerous. I have the strong impression that he wants to be there and see something dying. Well, he cannot help that. It&apos;s his character. It&apos;s a kind of phobia to enjoy death. And that&apos;s why he says, &apos;I will commit suicide.&apos; Because he will want to die at that moment.&quot;  (Later, Admiraal clarified this. He said he didn&apos;t mean Exoo derived psychopathic pleasure from being around death. Instead, he thought Exoo was too in love with the afterlife. He believed in it too much and the pleasure he got was from clapping and cheering his clients to this better place.) I didn&apos;t know what to think. I hoped Admiraal was being overdramatic because I had considered myself pro-assisted suicide, and once your mind is set on something it can be hard to do a 180-degree turn. Still, my own doubts had been creeping in. For instance, I&apos;d noticed that very few of Exoo&apos;s clients were terminally ill. Most were depressed or suffering from psychosomatic diseases. When I asked him about his client list he said, &quot;Many of my colleagues will avoid such persons like the plague but I feel a very strong identity with the story of the good samaritan. I stop while others walk by and ignore their pleas.&quot; How, I wondered, did Exoo and his clients find each other?  After the conference, I visited Humphry, father of the modern right-to-die movement. He is from Wiltshire but now lives in Oregon. &quot;Once or twice a week,&quot; Humphry explained, &quot;I get very strange people on the telephone who are anxious to commit suicide because of their depression or sad lives. When they get your number they want to talk and talk. And they call again and again. And they also call all the other right-to-die groups.&quot; Humphry said that the mainstream right-to-die groups will tell them, &quot;&apos;We can&apos;t help you. It&apos;s not within our parameters because you aren&apos;t terminally ill.&apos; But they pursue you. They call and call. And eventually someone will say, &apos;George Exoo will probably help you.&apos; And that gets them off the phone and on to George.&quot; &quot;Isn&apos;t that terrible?&quot; I asked. &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Humphry. Three years passed. Even though the Irish government was pressing the FBI to arrest Exoo, they didn&apos;t. Meanwhile he was travelling around America helping non-terminally ill people die. In the spring of 2007 a package arrived. It was a video. I went into my office, closed the door, put it into the VCR and pressed play. Exoo&apos;s messy office blurred fuzzily on to the screen. Then he skulked into shot from behind the camera, looking as if he had been awake for days. He said, &quot;Now, what I&apos;m going to do is call my friend Shirley who is out in a western state in a motel.&quot; And he picked up the phone and dialled and it became obvious what was going to happen. A woman called Shirley was sitting in a motel room in Arizona waiting for his call. She had a bottle of poison in front of her and he was going to guide her through her suicide.  He said, &quot;Hey, Shirley. This is George. The hour has come that we&apos;ve been planning.&quot; He hadn&apos;t bugged the phone so I could only hear his end of the conversation. &quot;I know you&apos;re nervous,&quot; Exoo said. &quot;You&apos;ve never done this before. But that&apos;s all right. We&apos;re going to get through this. It&apos;s time for you to&quot; - he sighed - &quot;drink the potion that&apos;s in front of you. It&apos;s bitter and horrible tasting so it&apos;s important that you chugalug it right down. I ask you to raise that glass and I want you to know how honoured I am to be with you at this moment.&quot; There was a silence of perhaps 10 seconds. Then Exoo&apos;s voice hardened: &quot;I know it&apos;s bitter. Just keep drinking. Put your finger over your nose and get it all down.&quot; He was talking to Shirley like someone would talk to a child who had disobeyed him. Then he began to chant a Buddhist chant: &quot;Gate, Gate, Parasamgate ... &quot; (Gone. Gone. Gone completely beyond.)  After five minutes he said, &quot;Shirley? Can you hear me?&quot; Then he looked into his camera. He said, &quot;I think I heard the phone drop. Which would mean she is probably now gone.&quot;  He shrugged slightly. &quot;And that&apos;s it. That&apos;s the way it&apos;s done.&quot; He leaned over and turned off the camera. Exoo&apos;s irritable attitude towards Shirley was startling but it wasn&apos;t totally unexpected. He had, he told me, behaved in a similar manner towards Acre. She too had prevaricated, and he told her he wasn&apos;t leaving town until he had &quot;finished&quot; guiding her through her suicide. I&apos;m sure Exoo wasn&apos;t encouraging reluctant clients to kill themselves - I&apos;m sure the choice was always theirs - but he did seem to speak impatiently at them during apparent moments of hesitation. In May 2007 Exoo began teaching a friend, Susan (not her real name), the ropes. He said he needed an assistant in case he was arrested or killed himself. We arranged to meet at Susan&apos;s house in North Carolina. I arrived before Exoo. Susan lived alone, a middle-aged lady with a collection of plastic lizards. While we waited I asked her how they met. &quot;I was bitten by a brown recluse spider in 1993,&quot; she replied. &quot;It was so painful I wanted to die.&quot;  She said she called the official right-to-die groups, &quot;but they wouldn&apos;t help me.&quot; &quot;Because you weren&apos;t terminally ill?&quot; &quot;Yeah, they rejected me,&quot; she said. &quot;But then somebody said, &apos;You might want to call George.&apos; Kind of like under the counter.&quot; Susan said she would have killed herself with Exoo&apos;s help - he was perfectly willing - but she couldn&apos;t find anyone to look after her pet snake. Eventually, they got talking. If she wasn&apos;t going to be his client, perhaps she should be his assistant.  Then Exoo arrived. He had a second job now, buying up houses that had been seized by the banks, and then selling them on for a quick profit, although he hadn&apos;t managed to sell any yet. It was oddly nice to see him. We joked about how he could provide his clients with the full service: he could sell them a house and when the banks foreclosed he could help them kill themselves. For all the ambiguities, he was fun to be around. And he was a strange mix, often going to the ends of the Earth to help people in distress, but also getting cross with them if they seemed hesitant about killing themselves. I said to him, &quot;In the Arizona tape, Shirley said, &apos;It&apos;s bitter,&apos; and you snapped, &apos;Drink it!&apos; &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he replied. &quot;Because I&apos;d been through that argument with her before.&quot; &quot;She&apos;d tasted it before?&quot; I asked. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. He was getting annoyed with me. &quot;I&apos;d been with her twice before in person. What kind of bull twaddle is that? If you&apos;re serious you&apos;re going to drink it and not whine about it!&quot; &quot;But this was somebody who didn&apos;t know whether to kill themselves,&quot; I said. &quot;Just drink it,&quot; he said. &quot;Three or four swallows and you&apos;re going to go to sleep. Permanently. In 10 minutes you&apos;ll be off this planet. Yes, I was probably pressing her to some extent. But I was pressing her to make up her mind one way or another because I can&apos;t go flying across the country week after week and have nothing come of it. I want her to either go on and live her life, or check out. But it&apos;s her choice. It&apos;s not mine.&quot; We went for lunch. Susan had told me that morning that her multiple chemical sensitivities (triggered by the 1993 spider bite) were so severe there was only one local restaurant she could eat in where the atmosphere did not set off her symptoms. But we ate in another restaurant - an all-you-can-eat buffet - and she was fine. She ate all she could. I began to see Susan as living proof that Exoo really shouldn&apos;t help people like Susan kill themselves. After lunch I told him about the view - held by some psychologists who had observed him - that he was out of his depth and it was a slippery slope and he should stop. &quot;And what&apos;s the slippery slope I&apos;m on?&quot; he asked sharply.  &quot;Not being able to stop helping people because you see it as your calling and you like to be there at the moment of death because you get something out of it. And you may consequently be encouraging them towards suicide.&quot; &quot;Bullshit,&quot; he said. &quot;It just hasn&apos;t happened. Otherwise these people wouldn&apos;t be hanging on for years and years and years.&quot; And that part seemed to be true: he claimed to have clients who had been prevaricating for years. Exoo drove off to do some real estate business and I was left alone with Susan. We sat on her porch. And she said something extraordinary. She said that unbeknown to Exoo she had set up her own suicide business and was willing to help practically anyone if the price was right. &quot;I see this as a business,&quot; she said. &quot;George sees it as a calling. There&apos;s a big difference there. For me it&apos;s no cash, no help.&quot; She said her price was approximately $7,000. &quot;You&apos;re bound to get it wrong, aren&apos;t you?&quot; I said. &quot;And help someone who shouldn&apos;t be helped.&quot; Susan shrugged. &quot;Probably, at some point, yes,&quot; she said. She said Exoo&apos;s worst crime was his financial imprudence: that he&apos;ll help people who can&apos;t afford to pay. &quot;George will get to a point where he&apos;ll run out of money,&quot; she said. &quot;He won&apos;t scale down the expensive cuts of meats every night. He would rather kill himself than economise.&quot; &quot;He seems quite keen on killing himself,&quot; I said. &quot;I think he&apos;ll do it soon,&quot; said Susan. &quot;And that&apos;s why I&apos;ve been pressing him to give me a list of his current clients.&quot; A few weeks passed. Then I got an early morning call from Susan. She said the FBI had just arrested Exoo. His partner McGurrin had woken up to find Exoo and two men standing there. They said, &quot;We&apos;re putting George in prison until we can take him to Ireland.&quot; A few weeks after that (I later learned) Susan flew to New Zealand to help a depressed, non-terminally ill woman she had met on the internet commit suicide. The woman had previously asked a mainstream right-to-die group called Dignity NZ to help her, but they had refused. &quot;I was of the impression that she needed assistance in living rather than advice on how to end her life,&quot; Dignity NZ&apos;s founder, Lesley Martin, later explained to me in an email. She added, &quot;I imagine you are developing a good understanding of what an absolute mess the euthanasia underground is. Unfortunately, there are &apos;gung-ho&apos; individuals involved [she meant Susan] who, in my opinion, treat the matter of assisting someone to die as an exciting relief from the boredom of their own lives and do so completely ill-equipped and dismissive of the responsibility we have of ensuring that people who need mental health assistance receive it, while still working towards humane legislation that addresses the real issues.&quot; I visited Susan and asked her what had been wrong with the New Zealand woman. &quot;She had some sort of breathing disorder,&quot; she said, &quot;and the doctors there wouldn&apos;t give her the medication that she needed. I happened to take the same medication. I gave her a little bit of mine and she was fine.&quot;  &quot;But you helped her commit suicide, even though you helped her breathe better?&quot; I asked. &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Susan. &quot;Isn&apos;t that ironic?&quot; &quot;You shouldn&apos;t do it,&quot; I said. &quot;Somebody&apos;s got to pay the bills so you can have some water in that glass you&apos;re drinking,&quot; she said.  I had agreed to protect Susan&apos;s identity before I knew she was going around the world helping people die for money. On October 25 2007 a federal judge in Charleston, West Virginia, freed Exoo. He decreed that because assisted suicide is not a crime in 25 of the 50 states, he couldn&apos;t allow the Irish prosecutor to try him in Dublin. I visited Exoo one last time. I thought there wouldn&apos;t be any more twists and turns in this story about the messy assisted suicide underground, but he offered one. &quot;You know I provided you with a tape?&quot; He meant the Shirley/Arizona telephone tape. &quot;That was not a real deathing. I was talking to a dial tone.&quot; I looked at him askance. &quot;You&apos;re a very good actor,&quot; I said. &quot;I wanted to give you an example of how I would work with somebody,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;And she was the only possibility.&quot; He explained that Shirley was a real person, and he really had visited her on many occasions, and that she really had prevaricated. All that was true. &quot;She really is now dead,&quot; he added, sounding quite triumphant. He said she killed herself in Kingman, Arizona, while he was in prison. (The Kingman police later confirmed this.)  I think Exoo was stupid to fake that tape and that someone who helps people decide whether or not to kill themselves shouldn&apos;t play weird games like that. The things I liked most about Exoo when I first met him six years ago - his libertarian, maverick qualities - are actually the things that are most worrying about him. \u00b7 Jon Ronson&apos;s documentary, Reverend Death, is on Channel 4 on May 19 at 10pm.", "sentences": ["&quot;What happened was Thomas [Exoo&apos;s partner] and I flew out the next morning to Amsterdam,&quot; he said, &quot;and a man brushed by us on the street."], "title": "Jon Ronson talks to Reverend George Exoo on assisted suicide", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/may/12/mentalhealth.health", "tags": ["Assisted dying", "Mental health", "Health", "Society", "US news", "Ireland", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-12T14:55:16Z", "article": "From the birth of modern India to the wild early days of settlement in Australia, the unmistakable golden thread linking them all is the long shadow of the British empire. Some of the most revered novels of the past 40 years have been narrowed down to just six in a shortlist which will produce what the public judge to be the greatest Booker prize winner of all time. Salman Rushdie is the favourite to win the Best of the Bookers with 1981&apos;s Midnight&apos;s Children. The lineup for the award - which aims to honour the best winning novel since the prize began in 1969 - sets him against JM Coetzee&apos;s towering Disgrace (1999), as well less well known books such as JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur and Nadine Gordimer&apos;s The Conservationist. The other shortlisted books are Pat Barker&apos;s The Ghost Road (1995) and Peter Carey&apos;s Oscar and Lucinda (1988). The shortlist was chosen by biographer Victoria Glendinning, broadcaster Mariella Frostrup and John Mullan, professor of English at the University of London. The public will have the final say: voting for the best book begins today at the Man Booker prize website, in advance of a result to be announced on July 10. Of the six shortlisted books, five deal more or less directly with postcolonial experience, and three are historical novels. The authors span four continents: Barker and Farrell were born in England, Coetzee and Gordimer in South Africa, Carey in Australia and Rushdie in India - although Farrell spent much of his life in Ireland, Rushdie settled in Britain, and Carey moved to the US. The shortlist also represents a senior generation of writers: four were born in the 1940s, one in the 1930s and one in the 1920s. While JG Farrell died in a fishing accident in 1979, the rest are very much with us. According to Professor Mullan, the unflinching focus of the panel was to choose what they regarded as the best books: those likely to outlast the fashions that created them. &quot;As judges we were consciously trying to blot out the hype and trying to erase expected judgements,&quot; he said. The shortlist does not include recent popular hits such as Yann Martel&apos;s The Life of Pi (2002) - indeed the most recent winner on the list won nine years ago. And, while some observers had tipped celebrated books such as Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day and AS Byatt&apos;s Possession, neither made the cut. According to Mullan: &quot;Had we been looking for novels that had been the most influential, then Possession would have been on the list.&quot; Mullan also noted that the list would have looked quite different had every shortlisted title been eligible. &quot;All three of us felt that quite a lot of really good novelists have won, but not for their best book. Lucky the novelist who won for his or her best book, like Coetzee. If Ian McEwan&apos;s Atonement had won the Booker it would have had a great chance, but he won with Amsterdam. And it&apos;s a pity that Margaret Atwood won for The Blind Assassin.&quot; The judges had not consciously aimed to revive the perhaps ailing fortunes of books such as The Siege of Krishnapur and The Conservationist - although they did, Mullan said, go to some effort to track down some of the most obscure titles, such as PH Newby&apos;s Something to Answer for (1969). &quot;The organisers managed to track down a single, thumbed copy which we passed among us like a samizdat,&quot; he said. Of The Conservationist, which focuses on the character of Mehring, a middle-aged white South African businessman, he said: &quot;I read the book when it came out and I have to admit that at the time it did not make much impression. I remember it as all about race, politics and apartheid. Reading it now, all that seems to have dropped away: it is a brilliant book about a man&apos;s ambitions and desires, about a peculiar, solitary manliness. The whole exercise to me seems worthwhile to rediscover this.&quot; And he called The Siege of Krishnapur, the central book of Farrell&apos;s empire trilogy set during the Sepoy rebellion of 1857, &quot;the most psychologically subtle historical novel I can remember reading&quot;. He praised Carey&apos;s Oscar and Lucinda as &quot;incredibly inventive&quot;; Barker&apos;s The Ghost Road as &quot;an extension of the sympathetic imagination&quot;; and Rushdie&apos;s Midnight&apos;s Children as &quot;an ebullient and buoyant book containing a concatenation of cultures, and which transformed literary fiction&quot;. Of Coetzee&apos;s Disgrace, he said: &quot;It&apos;s a searing book, and though it is often called spare, it is delightfully intricate containing a tissue of literary allusions that are brilliantly used.&quot; The judges, he said, proceeded more or less in harmony. &quot;We only really wrangled about one book,&quot; he said. Winners: What the Guardian reviewers said 1973 - The Siege of Krishnapur  &quot;By the time the comedy of terrors is over and the stinking scarecrow garrison, overcome by a celebratory drink, are observed curiously by the relief force as they keel over, the pet spaniel has become a corpse-eater ... and many fetishes of Victorian enlightment, spiritual and material, have disappeared up the spout ...&quot; 1988 - Oscar and Lucinda  &quot;Gradually, all builds into a novel of extraordinary size, in every sense of the word: yet the method of it is not unlike the way a person might set out to construct a model of the Taj Mahal out of matchsticks, and the general effect of Oscar And Lucinda does indeed have some of the unselfconscious strangeness of folk art.&quot; 1974 - The Conservationist  &quot;Nadine Gordimer&apos;s well-known obsession with landscape is carried to intensely physical extremes, until the reader must surely feel that his face is being pressed into the dry weedy soil and an insect eye-view imposed.&quot; 1995 - The Ghost Road  &quot;The carnal wit of [the narrator&apos;s] voice marks out The Ghost Road as an important book. With his divided sexual and class loyalties, he seems a very contemporary figure, yet also a fitting monument to the mounds of historical dead.&quot; 1981 - Midnight&apos;s Children  &quot;Salman Rushdie&apos;s hero is born in 1946 on the stroke of India&apos;s independence, one of a group of children all born at the same time and all with strange powers: one is a werewolf, one can walk through polished surfaces, one is a time traveller. He is India, growing, struggling, finally mutated by a figure called The Widow, or Indira or Shiva.&quot; 1999 - Disgrace  &quot;The undeniable power and focus in Coetzee&apos;s novel lies in its ability to analyse not only two differing forms of disgrace: David&apos;s relationship with his student, which was almost rape, and Lucy&apos;s sexual humiliation, but two differing forms of penitence.&quot;", "sentences": ["If Ian McEwan&apos;s Atonement had won the Booker it would have had a great chance, but he won with Amsterdam."], "title": "Sun never sets on Booker's six best", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/12/bookerprize", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Booker prize", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-13T23:11:00Z", "article": "There are photographs hanging on the walls of my dressing room in the Staatsoper Berlin; photographs that remind me of what I see when I look out the windows of my house in Jerusalem. They are slightly faded and here and there the paper is crumbling, but one can easily recognise the views. The old city, the Dome of the Rock with its shining cupola, the walls, the gates. Sometimes I sit in this room before a performance, looking at these pictures and thinking of Jerusalem, of Israel, my home. Before 1989, this room was supposedly a refuge of the East German Stasi, the state police; if I happened to be a sentimental person, that fact would surely help me to become unsentimental, but I am not a sentimental person. The situation in the Middle East is much too close to me, much too personal for me to be sentimental about it. Since 1952 I have owned an Israeli passport. Since I was 15 years old, I have travelled the world as a musician. I have lived in London and in Paris and I commuted for years between Chicago and Berlin. Before I had an Israeli passport, I had an Argentinian one; later I acquired a Spanish one. And in 2007, I became the only Israeli in the world who can also show a Palestinian passport at an Israeli border crossing. I am, so to speak, living evidence of the fact that only a pragmatic two-state solution (or better yet, absurd as it sounds, a federation of three states: Israel, Palestine and Jordan) can bring peace to the region. My answer to those who say I am naive, only an artist? That I am not a political person, even if I shook the hands of David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres as a child; not politics, but humanity has always concerned me. In that sense I feel able and, as an artist, especially qualified to analyse the situation. Both my paternal and maternal grandparents were Russian Jews who fled to Buenos Aires in the pogroms of 1904. Unfortunately, I never asked my parents much about our family&apos;s history. For one thing, as a child, I was very preoccupied with myself and for another, it was &quot;normal&quot; that we were in a state of permanent change. The story of my maternal grandparents, however, is a very special one. When they arrived in the harbour of Buenos Aires (he was 16, she 14) after the miserably long trip, it was announced that only families would be allowed to disembark; the quota for all others had been exhausted. They were both alone, and my grandfather said to my grandmother, &quot;Let&apos;s get married!&quot; And they did. Once on land, they went their separate ways. After two or three years they met again by coincidence, fell in love and spent the rest of their lives with one another. This grandmother was a fervent Zionist. Already in 1929, she went to Palestine for half a year with her three daughters - including my 17-year-old mother - to see if one could live there. My father&apos;s family, on the other hand, had completely assimilated; the &quot;Holy Land&quot; had no significance for them, at least not until they discovered that I was musically talented. Suddenly it seemed important to my parents that I, as a future artist, should grow up as part of a majority and not as part of a minority somewhere in the diaspora. The conviction that normality would be a fundamental element of my intellectual development was, so to speak, fuel for the fire of my grandmother&apos;s Zionism: the Barenboim family resolved to emigrate to Israel. Our first stop on the long journey was Salzburg, where I participated in the final concert of conductor Igor Markevitch&apos;s summer masterclass. The entire trip took 52 hours with stops in Montevideo, Rio, Sao Paulo, Recife, the Isla del Sol, Madrid - and then we took the train from Rome to Salzburg. As a nine-year-old I spoke only Spanish and a bit of Yiddish, which I had learned from my grandmother. This was not especially problematic as we did not plan to stay in Austria and I would be mostly in the company of musicians. While I had not been aware of any Jewish problem in Buenos Aires, I began to take notice of one in Salzburg. Jewish friends took me along to Bad Gastein one day to a great waterfall and told me that, during the Nazi era, Jews had been thrown into it. Here I received my first inkling of the fate of the Jewish people; the stories my parents had told me about the Holocaust also deeply disturbed me, although I was unable to understand them fully at the time. In December 1952 we reached Israel. It was winter, the school year had started long before, and I had to learn a new alphabet and a new language. It was anything but easy, but since I was an uncomplicated and extrovert child, I adapted quickly, and it was the beginning of a wonderful and very intense new life. Everything was on the verge of change and progress. Imagine - in the streets of Tel Aviv, of all places, I learned to play football. Later on I became part of a youth movement and I still remember how much we looked down upon young men with moustaches and girls who wore lipstick; we felt they were superficial, simply not of the essence. Because my family had no money, we were supported in the beginning by an uncle from Brazil. His daughter is now the Brazilian ambassador to Slovenia - at least one Barenboim got somewhere ... As for the name, my family was encouraged to translate it into Hebrew in the new spirit of Jewish-Israeli self-confidence. Ben-Gurion, for one, whom I vastly admired as a statesman and visionary, came from the Polish city of Plonsk and was originally called David Gr\u00fcn. It was he who tried to convince my parents that I would never become famous with the name Barenboim (the Yiddish version of Birnbaum, pear tree); he felt that Agassi, the Hebrew word for pear, would be much better. One could always think I might be Italian. None of us, though, was truly enthusiastic about this idea. Strictly speaking, the length of time that I have spent in Israel is not substantial. It was mainly restricted to the years between 1952 and 1954 and between 1956 and the early 60s. When I was not in school, I was on concert tours in Zurich, Amsterdam or Bournemouth. In the winter of 1954 I went to Paris to study counterpoint and composition with the famous and famously strict Nadia Boulanger for one-and-a-half years. She taught me that the ideal musician should think with the heart and feel with the intellect. My parents accompanied me on all my travels, being of the opinion that it was necessary for me to have the most &quot;normal&quot; family life possible. The Europe of the 50s was deeply scarred by the consequences of the war. Being a traveller between both worlds, I found the contrast between Europe and Israel especially stark. Israel was at the time the most social, idealistic state imaginable. It was lucky for Israel and for us that we were young at the same time. Nobody had the feeling of working &quot;for the state&quot;, because there was no such thing. The state literally evolved before our eyes and fed on our idealism, our daily commitment, our work. To live in Israel as a Jew meant no longer pursuing only the so-called free professions as in the diaspora (artist, lawyer, doctor, banker), but also becoming farmers, police officers, soldiers or, as the case may be, even criminals. State and home, home and state, melded into one unit. The Israeli left wing, the workers&apos; party, was in power until 1977, an often forgotten fact. Twenty-nine years. Why was this so? The traditionalists had no chance after the war of independence in 1948; the war had already been won. The religious Jews were still waiting for the Messiah. That left the socialists. Only after the six-day war of 1967 did the winds change. The idea of a &quot;grassroots Israel&quot; paled. Suddenly there was cheaper labour from the Palestinian territories, and, not much later, the first Israeli millionaires appeared. The socialist system lost its balance; the idea of Israel teetered. I grew up in Israel with European culture and values; the director of my high school was an art historian, the kind of woman one might find in Berlin-Dahlem. This suited me very well, because in my rebellious adolescent phase I wanted to have nothing to do with Argentina, the Spanish language, or anything from the diaspora. For me this was all history. What counted was Israel&apos;s present and future. At the age of 19 or 20, I was called to do my compulsory service in the Argentinian military. I was able to postpone it twice, finally arguing that I should be exempt because I was a citizen of Israel. The result was that I could go anywhere with my Argentinean passport except to Israel, and that I could go anywhere with my Israeli passport except to Argentina. In 1966 I met the cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in London. We felt immediately attracted to one another, both personally and musically, and two or three months later, we decided to get married. Without any influence on my part, Jacqueline took it upon herself to convert to Judaism. The thought of eventually having children played a role in her decision, as well as the fact that she knew many great musicians who were Jewish. Her conversion was not always a boon to her career; one read and heard that she had joined the &quot;Jewish music mafia&quot;. In June 1967 we got married in Jerusalem, shortly after the six-day war. Ben-Gurion, who did not think much of music, was present at our wedding. He was impressed that a non-Jewish English girl could identify with his country so strongly. On May 31, when the war had seemed inevitable, we had flown to Israel on one of the last passenger planes. We had given concerts almost every evening. The last one took place on June 5 in Beersheba, a town halfway between Tel Aviv and the Egyptian border. As we were leaving the concert to drive home, the first tanks began to come toward us. After 1967 Israel turned very much toward the US - not necessarily to its own advantage. The traditionalists said: &quot;We will not give up the newly occupied territories.&quot; The religious Jews said: &quot;These are not occupied but liberated, biblical territories.&quot; And with that the end of socialism in Israel was sealed. For decades we have seen headlines about exploding violence; one war and terrorist act follows another. This has cemented the situation in people&apos;s minds. Today, in the time of Iraq and Iran, one hardly reads anything more about it, which is even worse. Many Israelis dream that when they wake up, the Palestinians will be gone, and the Palestinians dream that when they wake up, the Israelis will be gone. Both sides can no longer differentiate between dream and reality, and this is the psychological core of the problem. Since the 60s I have no longer felt comfortable in Israel. Of course, it is my home; my parents lived there and are both buried in Jerusalem. Whenever there was war in Israel, I played there: 1956, 1967, 1973. Music was my language, my &quot;weapon&quot;. However, after the black September of 1970, the then prime minister Golda Meir said: &quot;What is this talk of the Palestinians? We are the Palestinian people!&quot; At that point it clicked in my mind: this was morally unacceptable. Yes, the Jews had a right to their own state, and they had a right to this state. This demand was made even stronger by the Holocaust and the guilt of the Europeans after 1945. It is all too easily forgotten, however, that there was a moderate Zionism; there were people such as Martin Buber, who said from the beginning that the right to a Jewish state must be made acceptable to the existing population, the non-Jews. Militant Zionism, on the other hand, did not develop any further in its thinking. Even today, it is still based on a lie: that the land that the Jews settled was empty. Today, many Israelis have no idea what it must feel like to be Palestinian - how it is to live in a city such as Nablus, a prison for 180,000 people. There are no restaurants there, no cafes, no cinemas. What has become of the famous Jewish intellect here? I am not even speaking of justice or love. Why does one continue to feed the hate in the Gaza strip? There will never be a military solution. Two peoples are fighting over one and the same land. No matter how strong Israel becomes, there will always be insecurity and fear. The conflict is eating away at itself and at the Jewish soul, and it has been allowed to do so. We wanted to own land that had never belonged to Jews and build settlements there. The Palestinians see this as imperialistic provocation, and rightly so. Their resistance is absolutely understandable - not the means they use to this end, not the violence nor the wanton inhumanity - but their &quot;no&quot;. We Israelis must finally find the courage to not react to this violence, the courage to stand by our history. The Palestinians cannot expect that we should have been able to take care of anyone besides ourselves after the Holocaust; we had to survive. Now that we have done so, we must both look forward collectively. The Israeli prime minister who can do this has not yet been born. Essentially, we are no further today than we were in 1947, when the UN voted to divide Palestine. Worse yet, in 1947 one could still imagine a binational state; 60 years later, this seems unthinkable. Today, people in Israel speak of separation, of divorce in respect to a two-state solution: what cynicism! Divorce is normally only possible between people who once loved each other ... I suffer from this situation, and everything I do has something to do with this suffering, whether I am conducting Wagner in Israel (and I was by no means the first to do so), citing the Israeli constitution in the Knesset, founding the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra with the writer Edward Said, establishing a music kindergarten in Berlin, or - as recently in Jerusalem - performing a concert for two peoples. Some of these things are undeservedly exaggerated by the media, but I do as I do because it drives me crazy to see how much injustice we Jews commit daily, and how much we endanger the future existence of Israel. As cynical as it sounds, I am glad to have been born in 1942 and not in 1972. As it is, hopefully I will not live to see the day when it becomes possible that the State of Israel might no longer exist, just as I will no longer live to see the day when perhaps classical music may no longer play a role in our thinking and feeling. I have not lived in Israel for many years now, and I am very conscious of my outsider&apos;s perspective. Sometimes people ask me, &quot;What is a Jew?&quot; The answer is the following: a Jew who has antisemitic experiences in Berlin in 2008 is different from the Jew who had antisemitic experiences in 1940. The Jew of 1940 felt threatened; the Jew of today can think of his own land, of Israel. Today I can say, &quot;Either you learn to deal with me, you antisemite, or we go our separate ways.&quot; That makes an existential difference. I am a short-term pessimist about the Middle East, but a long-term optimist. Either we will find a way to live with each other or we will kill each other. What gives me hope? Music-making.

But these are residents of a secret safe house in the Netherlands for children who have been trafficked by criminal gangs into prostitution and other forms of forced labour in Europe. Some of the 14 have come from Sierra Leone and Taiwan, others from Bulgaria and Gujarat in India. The youngest, a 14-year-old, has a baby who is starting to crawl. Four of the girls are pregnant - most likely a consequence of their exploitation as prostitutes. In the UK, evidence emerged last month that more than 400 suspected victims of trafficking have gone missing from local authority care, triggering calls from politicians in the three main parties for the government to act. Keith Vaz, chair of a home affairs select committee investigation into human trafficking, says he is &quot;shocked by the number of children going missing&quot; and his committee is taking evidence about how it can be stopped. An increasing number of child protection campaigners and politicians in Britain believe the Dutch-style system of guardians for every foreign child suspected of having been trafficked may hold the answer to protecting these vulnerable youngsters from falling back into exploitation. In the Netherlands, there are 2,157 rescued children looked after by guardians. These are professional social workers who handle the legal status, housing and education of their charges. The most vulnerable are given 24-hour care and chaperones when they go out. For some, the fear of being taken back by traffickers is so great that they cannot even skip in the safe-house yard without someone to watch over them. The Dutch ministry of justice funds the \u20ac25m (\u00a319.7m) a year system run by Nidos, an independent child protection agency. Now 8% a year go missing from care, a third fewer than estimates for the UK. So far, the Home Office has said a similar guardianship system for Britain is unnecessary, but in the Netherlands the challenges facing the authorities are much the same as in the UK. &quot;There is a big risk the traffickers will pick the children up [from care] and we have seen it,&quot; says Karin, a guardian at the safe house. &quot;The trafficker tells them their future will be better, so they go with them. Often, [the children] have to pay back a lot of money - we hear about fees of \u20ac40,000 [\u00a331,600] for their trip to Europe - so the pressure [to go with the traffickers] is very big. The traffickers also threaten to hurt their family.&quot; CCTV cameras film all the approaches to the safe house. The social workers operate a system of green, amber and red alerts relating to the threat of abduction of each child, based on police intelligence and information the girls give. But from the outside, the house offers few clues to its purpose. It stands in the heart of Dutch suburbia in an acre of gardens. There is an exercise bike and a box of skipping ropes to make up for the regular confinement that is for their own safety. The property is one of four safe houses - two for girls, two for boys - located in north Netherlands, away from the big cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam where the traffickers are most active. The guardianship system aims to make the children self-reliant by the time they reach 18 and focuses on educating them about what has happened to them so that they appreciate the criminal behaviour of the trafficker. It also helps them plan a future in the country. The children must learn basic Dutch before they can attend school. Life in the safe house can be frustrating and many of the girls are eager to move away from 24-hour care. &quot;I eat, I sleep, but I am not living a good life,&quot; says Lauren, a 17-year-old from Guinea. &quot;Eat and sleep is not life for me. When you sit here, you have to think about the problems when you came here. That for me is painful. My pain is not for lack of sleep, food or clothes but I have big pain in my head.&quot; &quot;I need something good for me in the future,&quot; says Maya, a 17-year-old from Sierra Leone. &quot;I&apos;d like to go to school to learn more to be a better child for my parents and myself tomorrow. I&apos;d like to be a nurse. I don&apos;t know if this will happen here. I don&apos;t have anyone here, only the guardians who help me. I feel safe when I am in here inside.

I&apos;m now in Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname, next to Guyana on the northern shores of South America, and stylishly dressed Diana is here in her official capacity: president of the local chapter of Servas, the world&apos;s oldest travel networking site. The internet may have driven the new wave of travel networking, but the original global hospitality project started back in 1949. With members in over 100 countries and a motto of promoting &quot;peace through understanding&quot;, Servas (joomla.servas.org) was founded by an American pacifist, Bob Luitweiler, who died last month, aged 90. Most intriguingly, unlike the new websites, where anyone can sign up and log on, potential Servas members can only join after having a face-to-face interview. The Suriname chapter has been running since the 1990s and has 20 members - all female, ranging in age from 48 to 84. It&apos;s a far older demographic than any network I have encountered so far and Diana has promised to enlighten me on its quirks over an evening at Paramaribo&apos;s Torarica hotel, famed for its casino and glitzy decor.  The rest of Paramaribo isn&apos;t quite so flash, but it certainly doesn&apos;t lack charm. There&apos;s a public park made from a forest of palm trees and a historic centre where Unesco-listed buildings with wooden verandas look like they came straight from the set of cowboy movie. As a former colony of the Netherlands, Dutch is the national language, but English is widely understood.  At the hotel poolside, Diana orders some coconut water, served with a straw stuck into the open husk and, before long, we are joined by another local Servas member, Henna. I tell them I&apos;m intrigued by the interview process: is this more for verifying security or attitudes? &quot;It&apos;s a bit of both,&quot; explains Diana, 48, &quot;but it certainly makes Servas much safer. Some branches ask for written references as well.&quot; &quot;Suriname&apos;s different though,&quot; adds Henna, 52. &quot;We don&apos;t usually need to interview here. Everyone already knows everyone else&apos;s background.&quot;  Servas members pay an annual fee (typically $US25), and, instead of browsing online profiles, they find hosts by getting in touch with one of the national secretaries, who provides them with a list. Members are only asked to host others for two nights, and, after that, are entitled to ask for payment. Alternatively, they can just offer to be a day host and show someone around town.  Henna was one of the Suriname branch&apos;s founders. She is also a member of hospitalityclub.org and owner of an eco-travel company (morindatours.net). Sometimes she lets Hospitality Club members join her tours for free. &quot;They are usually young people with little income, and so I help them,&quot; she shrugs. The next day, Henna offers to take me to the eco-resort she&apos;s building. Just over an hour from Paramaribo, and surprisingly close to the airport, we find her &quot;paradise&quot;. We park the 4x4 and walk down a dirt path, canopied by palms, fringed by vibrant red heliconias and echoing to the sound of cicadas. Then comes a clearing, where a small cluster of thatched huts sit next to a perfectly still lake.  She takes me on a boat trip along the river, its surface like dark-green glass, reflecting the reeds, mangroves and purple orchids. Our only disturbance is an occasional splash, which Henna tells me could be a black river dolphin, although I never actually see the proof. &quot;Do you like the trip?&quot; she asks. Chuckling with proud delight, she already knows my answer. I can&apos;t stay with Henna that night as she already has a house guest, but she goes out of her way to find an alternative. She suggests a property down the road that she manages for friends, and so, for one night only, I have my own bungalow in the Surinamese suburbs.  I head downtown the following morning and Diana takes me to visit Servas Suriname&apos;s two oldest members. First, we head to the home of 84-year-old Polly, who started travelling when her children studied in Holland and hasn&apos;t stopped since, taking in Israel, Spain, Germany and much of the Caribbean. She joined Servas eight years ago, around the same time as the death of her husband. Was that the reason she signed up? &quot;Oh no, I&apos;ve always been a member of lots of things. I&apos;m still with the Girl Scouts. I just like to help people,&quot; she says passing me some orgeade, a cold drink made from crushed almonds. Next, we pay a visit to 81-year-old Rudia, also defying her age, with short cropped jet-black hair, held in place with a sparkly alice band. Her house, brimming with souvenirs of her travels, has played host to so many people - Servas members and otherwise - it now has its own guest book. Rudia also uses Servas when she travels abroad. &quot;It was great in San Francisco,&quot; she says. &quot;I used to live there and yet the Servas couple I met still managed to take me to places I&apos;d never seen before.&quot; When it comes to reciprocating, Servas members certainly have a lot to show off in their homeland, the so-called &quot;beating heart of the Amazon&quot;. But, as I prepare to head onwards to French Guiana, I wonder what future the organisation has. Will it focus on targeting the ever-growing market for over 50s travel? Or will it try and compete with the younger upstarts? It looks like Polly, my new Surinamese grandmother, has her heart set on the latter. &quot;We need more young people,&quot; she says, squeezing my arm. &quot;Don&apos;t forget to tell your friends about us.&quot;  vicky.baker@theguardian.com Henna&apos;s tips \u00b7  Take a boat trip from Paramaribo waterfront to where the Suriname and the Commewijne rivers converge.

Hope (1769-1831) belongs in the company of Horace Walpole, William Beckford and Sir John Soane: people of original taste and talent, who made legendary homes and filled them with quite extraordinary collections. Hope, a very wealthy merchant-banker whose family (Scottish in origin) came to London from Amsterdam, shortly after the French revolution, made himself two homes. The mission of the first, in Duchess Street near Cavendish Square, was to pioneer neo-classical taste in London - but the term neoclassical has to be stretched in this case to include Egyptian revival and an &quot;Indian room&quot; decorated in a &quot;Saracenic&quot; and &quot;Moorish&quot; style. Its ceiling, Hope explained, &quot;imitated from those prevailing in Turkish palaces, consists of a canopy of trellice-work ... The border and the compartments of this ceiling display foliage, flowers, peacock&apos;s feathers, and other ornaments of a rich hue, and of a delicate texture, which ... seem peculiarly adapted for this lofty and suspended situation.&quot; When he said the hues were rich, he meant it.

His Indian room featured Persian carpets on the floor, and specially commissioned views of India on the walls. All this was done in about 1800, which predated the orientalism of the Brighton Pavilion by some 15 years. One has to imagine something on the scale of the Wallace Collection in Manchester Square, in London, a house (originally designed by Robert Adam) built around a courtyard, and incorporating - in a palatial sequence of rooms - a statue gallery, picture gallery, four &quot;vase rooms&quot; for the display of Greek pots, in addition to the Egyptian and Indian rooms, an Aurora room and a &quot;Lararium&quot; (a shrine for the household gods). Each interior was designed by Hope himself, as were the furniture and all the fixtures and fittings, the sconces for the lamps, the candelabras, the silverware, the bronze ornaments. And although Hope&apos;s collections have long since been dispersed, one can deduce a great deal about what his London house was like because he published a book about it all, in 1807, called Household Furniture. The purpose of this work - the first of its kind to be commercially printed - was to make it possible for others to copy Hope&apos;s ideas. The second home, in a wooded Surrey valley not far from Dorking, was called the Deepdene. Again, an adaptation of an existing building, the Deepdene was a demonstration of the picturesque style, which meant that, in the manner of a picture, it was asymmetrical. It had a tower, an &quot;Italianate&quot; belvedere, of a kind new to England - indeed, you might say new to architecture. One has to think quite hard, looking at images of this tower, before one realises exactly what it was in Italy that was being imitated, it has been so developed in the adaptation. More extraordinary, in this pursuit of the asymmetrical, is a wing that Hope added to this country house at a 45-degree angle to the existing structure. A large part of this wing consists of a conservatory and statue gallery, leading down to a &quot;theatre of the arts&quot;, which was a structure like a miniature Roman theatre, the banked seating of which served as a display platform for yet more classical relics. The relation of house to garden is very marked, in the illustrations of the Deepdene that survive. There is a sense that the chief consideration is for the views afforded, both from inside the house looking out past the treasured relics, and from all kinds of vantage points in the grounds. That the place did indeed possess a power to enchant is illustrated by the fact that Disraeli acknowledged Coningsby to have been &quot;conceived and partly executed amidst the glades and galleries of Deepdene&quot;. The expression &quot;glades and galleries&quot; reflects something of the intended effect: the woods came up very near to the house, but the garden was also full of colour. There were peacocks and large agaves in pots, giving a bright, sharp, exotic look. Inside, a colonnaded hall of double height displayed classical statuary: these were the galleries one might wander, deep in thought. And once again a vase room, giving home to part of the collection which had been transferred from London, and which had originally been purchased from Sir William Hamilton, the volcano-loving husband of Nelson&apos;s Emma. By the 1820s, the taste for rich colours had come to seem, to a younger generation, &quot;heavy &amp; inharmonious, tinselly, tawdry&quot;. This was an era of tent beds and tent rooms, a military fashion brought from Napoleonic Paris, which not only gave a room the air of being something put up in the course of a campaign, but also contained a reference to the tent as being one of the primeval forms of domestic architecture. When Hope died, his son had the house remodelled and revised, although there is still something of its chief creator&apos;s vision to be seen in the photographs taken of it for Country Life in 1899. By now, the taste for Hope&apos;s furniture and his interior style was so specialised that when the contents of the Deepdene were dispersed in 1917, there was really only one purchaser interested in the furniture: Edward Knoblock, the author of Kismet. Regency itself, as a style, was generally discounted, and the Brighton Pavilion considered utterly ridiculous. Reading only slightly between the lines of the excellent catalogue, we find, however, that this taste was kept alive by a small minority of gay men, including Lord Gerald Wellesley, doomed (when he became Duke of Wellington) to the nickname The Iron Duchess. British Rail took over the Deepdene, and pulled it down in 1968-69.", "sentences": ["Hope, a very wealthy merchant-banker whose family (Scottish in origin) came to London from Amsterdam, shortly after the French revolution, made himself two homes."], "title": "James Fenton on the style of Thomas Hope", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/architecture.art", "tags": ["Books", "Architecture", "Culture", "Art and design", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-16T23:26:35Z", "article": "Most of it was flattened by Hitler, and parts of it reconstructed using detailed paintings by Canaletto, but now Warsaw has beaten London and New York in a survey to find the best value cultural destination. According to the survey by the Post Office, which looked at 10 world cities, the Polish capital was judged cheapest for a three-day trip visiting museums, galleries and heritage sites. The cultural highlights of Warsaw include the Palace of Culture and Science - Poland&apos;s tallest building and a towering example of Stalinist architecture - and the Polish National Opera. Helen Warburton, the head of Post Office travel services, said that while museums and galleries were a staple of city breaks, this had now extended to booking the opera, ballet and concerts. &quot;We based our report on the idea that culture vultures will want to pack in two gallery visits a day and spend evenings out at music-based events,&quot; she said. A three-day visit to Warsaw would cost around \u00a375. By contrast, a cultural visit to London - the most expensive city in the survey - would cost around \u00a3308, despite many free attractions including the Tate Modern and the Natural History Museum. Other comparisons included a visit to the Royal Opera House (\u00a3137) and Warsaw&apos;s Polish National Opera (\u00a324).  Jurek Juczkowicz, a sculptor whose work includes a monument in Warsaw&apos;s Krasinski Square, said: &quot;Warsaw isn&apos;t big like Paris and London but I think it&apos;s dynamite. It was rebuilt from the beginning and from nothing came a city. It&apos;s still creating and wanting to be a city.&quot;  According to Visit London, the number of visitors staying in the UK capital fell 8% in 2007 to 10.1 million.  Jamie Talmage, a business analyst for Visit London, said: &quot;The long-term trend is that it&apos;s easier and cheaper for people to go abroad, with a big push from the low-cost airlines. On the plus side the day trip market in London is quite buoyant. Theatres are doing tremendously well and it seems more and more people are travelling down for the day.&quot; Among the other cities in the survey New York was the second most expensive, where a visit would set you back around \u00a3260. It is closely followed by Barcelona for \u00a3259. However, travellers could take advantage of favourable exchange rate between the sterling and the dollar.  &quot;Art lovers who want to benefit from the favourable US dollar exchange rate can halve their costs by substituting New York for Washington DC, which boasts the Smithsonian museums as well as the White House,&quot; Warburton said.

The gunman sauntered up to his target outside a gym on a Liverpool council estate. From under his jacket he calmly produced a pump-action shotgun and, from close range, aimed at his target&apos;s head. Colin &apos;Smigger&apos; Smith, Britain&apos;s so-called Cocaine King with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a3200m, was dead.  Six months on, his assassin remains at large despite a massive police investigation. Only now, though, can the circumstances behind the murder of Britain&apos;s biggest cocaine baron be revealed. It is a vicious tale of duplicity, violence and retribution in the shadowy world of international drug dealing. But Smith&apos;s killing carries more profound implications, threatening a ferocious war between Britain&apos;s original drug syndicate, the so-called Liverpool mafia, and the largest Colombian cocaine suppliers to Europe, the Cali cartels. At stake, say underworld sources, is control of Britain&apos;s \u00a32bn cocaine market. They revealed that Merseyside&apos;s crime gangs believe Colombian cartels ordered the hit on Smith over a missing consignment of the Class A narcotic worth \u00a372m. Merseyside police are aware of at least one meeting in which the heads of Liverpool&apos;s cocaine trade met and agreed to avenge the death of Smith, a high-stakes player whose 1,000kg deals were legendary and sometimes affected the price of cocaine throughout Britain. Police throughout Europe are concerned that any attempt by Liverpool&apos;s gangs to target the Cali cartel&apos;s sophisticated cocaine distribution network will produce a spate of killings. Sources in Amsterdam, where Liverpudlians and Colombians operate together to disseminate cocaine across the continent, claim that Liverpudlian expat dealers in Amsterdam, Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria, Turkey and South America - allied to the Merseyside mafia - have been warned to prepare for a &apos;mafia-style bloodbath&apos;. Already Liverpool dealers are understood to have shot at least one senior Colombian cocaine emissary in Amsterdam. Smith&apos;s murder raises the question of how a suspected foreign mercenary could fly into Liverpool and assassinate one of the country&apos;s best known cocaine barons - the first time a Colombian cartel has successfully eliminated one of Britain&apos;s biggest dealers on UK soil.  Officially Merseyside police will confirm only that the investigation into Smith&apos;s murder &apos;is ongoing&apos;, but detectives believe that his death has triggered a standoff in a volatile business. Liverpool&apos;s gangs have traditionally worked directly with their Colombian counterparts, with Smith&apos;s syndicate buying cocaine from South American networks whose origins can be traced back to the infamous cartels that controlled international cocaine traffic in the 1990s. Established in the late 1970s, the Liverpool mafia protected its power base by forging close links to the IRA and, in particular, a contract-killing outfit called The Cleaners, a group of paramilitaries believed to be responsible for more than 20 drug-related assassinations around Liverpool.  Merseyside police, the only force outside London to possess a level three capability, meaning it is able to tackle organised international crime, has repeatedly warned that Liverpool&apos;s cocaine barons are heavily armed and capable of murder. One drugs bust in the Netherlands, involving 1,600kg of cocaine hidden in sardine tins belonging to Merseyside traffickers, was linked to a subsequent haul of 3,000 rounds of ammunition and two silencers.  The Cali cartel, despite many high-profile arrests, has evolved into one of the most powerful crime syndicates in the world. A senior British detective described the opening of hostilities with such a long-established Colombian cartel as &apos;unwise&apos; - an understatement worthy of coppers&apos; black humour. Colin Smith, 40, balding, was not an archetypal gangster. His success in the cut-throat world of international drug dealing was built on a flair for calculating complex smuggling operations and schmoozing contacts, not on violence and intimidation. The rise of the father of five to the summit of Britain&apos;s cocaine trade came in 1996, 20 years after he started selling \u00a35 bags of cannabis while a pupil at Liverpool&apos;s New Heys comprehensive. Unlike his peers, Smith was never really flash, preferring to adopt a low profile by wearing old Lacoste shirts and driving a Ford Mondeo around Liverpool. For protection, he hired Stephen Lawlor, 34, who ran a Liverpool firm of nightclub bouncers that doubled as foot soldiers. A source close to Liverpool&apos;s cocaine scene said: &apos;Lawlor wasn&apos;t just your usual security boss pumped up on steroids. He was clever. Lawlor rose to become Smith&apos;s full-time understudy.&apos;  In time, Smith delegated responsibility for dealing directly with the Colombians to Lawlor. It was a decision that would result not only in Smith&apos;s assassination, but also to the growing friction between the Colombian cartels and the Merseyside mafia. During the spring of 2001 Lawlor arranged for a 500kg load of cocaine to be smuggled from South America to Amsterdam and then to Britain. Relations then between the Cali gangs and Liverpudlians were healthy. As usual, the deal was done on trust; on credit until peddled on the street. Again, as agreed, the 500kg would be &apos;bashed up&apos; to produce a yield of 900kg, each with a street value of \u00a380,000.  Lawlor never saw a penny of the \u00a372m deal. In May 2001 he was shot as he left a Liverpool party. British army corporal Peter Clarke, 23, was later acquitted of the murder. Even so, Clarke&apos;s older brother, Ian, 32, was shot dead in a revenge attack four months later. Weeks after that, Lawlor&apos;s brother, Tony, was murdered. Amid the ensuing chaos, the 500kg of coke vanished. Smith told the Colombians that the Liverpool mafia had never received the missing drugs. The underworld source said: &apos;Smigger decided to front it out. He was a good blagger. He told them Lawlor had kept all the details of the deal to himself. He told the people from the Faraway Place [the Liverpool mafia&apos;s nickname for Colombia] that the load was probably rotting on a dockside somewhere in Holland and that he knew nothing about it. &apos;Smith was a trusted operator who built his fortune by keeping his word, not behaving like your normal gangster. At first the Colombians believed him,&apos; said the source. But an informant, believed to be a close lieutenant of Smith in the Netherlands, told the Colombians a different story. Smith, it seemed, knew exactly where the mystery consignment was. A Dutch businessman with links to the Liverpool mafia said: &apos;Smith had no problem recovering the cocaine. It was in containers lined up on the docks like a row of new cars.&apos; An established network of Liverpool gang members based in Amsterdam was secretly tasked with selling the drug. A meeting in Amsterdam was arranged between the Colombians and Smith&apos;s syndicate. The former demanded a &apos;yellow pedal&apos; - a police charge sheet or newspaper cutting proving that the goods had been confiscated. Smith could not produce one. The Colombians warned him of dire repercussions if he did not hand over the money. A standoff between the two gangs developed, one that would presently claim a Colombian scalp.  The source in the Netherlands said: &apos;The Colombians contracted a top emissary in the Flat Place [underworld slang for the Netherlands] to recover the debt. He went to Amsterdam, but he was shot by Smigger&apos;s firm.&apos; Police have also investigated an Amsterdam shooting of a prominent Liverpool dealer currently in jail on drugs offences.  The source added: &apos;The Colombians couldn&apos;t believe that a bunch of scallies who they saw as being lower down the food chain were treating them like this. They put a contract out to kill Smigger. And in November last year they finally caught up with him.&apos;  Smith was shot just after 8pm on 13 November last year as he left Nell&apos;s Gym in Speke, Liverpool.  In the aftermath of the murder meetings of senior Liverpool criminals were bugged by police. One meeting, held late last year, was recorded in the Marriott Liverpool South Hotel, popular with Liverpool football players and close to John Lennon Airport, from which Smith&apos;s killer is believed to have made his getaway. Those aware of the meeting&apos;s agenda liken it to a &apos;mini-Appalachian&apos;, a reference to a famous get-together of Mafia bosses in Fifties America. The comparison was telling. Merseyside police had been tipped off about the mafia convention. A senior police source, who cannot be named, said: &apos;A lot of these heavy fellers checked in. One of them asked a manager to switch off the CCTV. Everyone expected Smith&apos;s allies to get revenge immediately. But it&apos;s taken months to unravel. It&apos;s a nest of vipers,&apos; added the officer.  Last Thursday Britain&apos;s equivalent of the FBI, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, revealed that it confiscated 89,000kg of cocaine last year, most of it from Colombia, a 20 per cent increase on the previous year. A Soca source confirmed it was investigating Colombian involvement &apos;across the entire supply chain&apos; of cocaine in the UK.  British detectives are now preparing to target Puerto Banus, a luxury suburb of Marbella in Spain from which Smith had flown before his murder. It is a popular foreign base for British cocaine dealers. Among those on British police&apos;s &apos;most wanted&apos; list is Liverpool drug fugitive Scott Coleman, 33, whom detectives hope to catch before it is too late. As one Merseyside source said: &apos;Colin was a nice feller, but sometimes he didn&apos;t pay his bills. And everyone knows what happens when you don&apos;t pay your bills.&apos; The Liverpool-Cali Connection They call it Easydrugs. With counter-narcotics officers able to monitor emails and telephone conversations, the latest modus operandi of Liverpool&apos;s cocaine dealers relies on catching budget flights from Merseyside to contacts throughout Europe, relaying messages and instructions in person, often returning the same day. Such methods help explain why officers have failed to dismantle the Liverpool mafia and curtail its 30-year reign at the pinnacle of the drugs trade.  The Liverpool mafia was Britain&apos;s first drug-dealing cartel, formed in the late Seventies by heroin baron Tommy &apos;Tacker&apos; Comerford, gaining strength after a group of white, middle-aged, former armed robbers brokered a strategic alliance with young black gangs following the Toxteth riots. Under the control of a shadowy former docker called &apos;The Banker&apos;, it became the richest gang in the UK. Strong links to corrupt port officials and haulage contractors ensured its status as an accomplished smuggler.  As cocaine&apos;s popularity soared, links were forged with the notorious Cali cartel, a Colombian cocaine-supplying gang. The cartel was grateful to the Liverpool mafia, whose contacts and own distribution network allowed it to crack the European market. Yet its single biggest break came when the rival Medell\u00edn gang was smashed in 1987. Since then, the Cali cartel has suffered a number of arrests, with its founders, Gilberto and Miguel Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela, extradited to the US in 2004. Although operating under a number of different aliases, the cartel has continued to evolve and remains one of the most fearsome in the world.

When on earth did Kevin Pietersen become such an earnest and sincere young man? Here he is talking to Atherton refusing to speak about the prospect of skittling New Zealand out tomorrow and forcing a win, excessively sceptical about the possibility of pushing on to a huge total today, and waffling frankly about his technical worries (something to do with the positioning of his grip in relation to his stance) and all yes, no, of course not thankyouverymuch and yesitwascharming wasn&apos;t it Athers?  31st over: England 89-0 (Strauss 31 Cook 53)So Mills resumes the uncompleted over from yesterday, and settles sharply into a good line on and outside off stump. And that, I&apos;m sure, will typify New Zealand&apos;s approach throughout the day.  32nd over: England 93-0 (Strauss 33 Cook 54)New Zealand, as Atherton is currently mumbling into his mic, can&apos;t win from here. They don&apos;t have enough runs and there isn&apos;t time. England are the side that will have to force the pace through. Whether that involves, as a Gary Naylor suggests, a declaration I&apos;m less sure: &quot;Once England have settled into the day, should they look to get on with it setting up a declaration 100 or so ahead to allow ten overs tonight at the fragile NZ top order? Okay, that&apos;s the only scenario that opens up the possibility of an NZ win, but isn&apos;t that the nature of declarations? To give yourself a chance to win, you have to be prepared to face a chance of defeat?&quot; Well indeed, but that attitude all seems a little Corinthian these days doesn&apos;t it? In the first match of a series England will tend towards conservatism, and neither Moores nor Vaughan strike me as great risk-takers or gamblers. Martin is on at the other end: fuller, straighter than Mills. Indeed he&apos;s too straight, and Strauss taps two to leg.  33rd over: England 98-0 (Strauss 37 Cook 55)Aha! Intrigue. New Zealand are unhappy with the ball, which has been knocked out of shape and fails to pass through the eye of those metal hoops that umpires have for these things. And after a long delay the batsmen take a run to Tim Southee at mid-on. The last ball of the over is from around the wicket and it drifts to leg, Strauss sends it further on its way with a delicate glance, which brings him four runs.  34th over: England 101-0 (Strauss 34 Cook 56)Unbelievably, this is now the highest stand these two batsmen have had for England&apos;s first wicket. The previous mark of 95 actually came all the way back on Cook&apos;s debut, all of which is just a reminder of what a dismally matched pair they used to seem. With both men now a little older and a lot wiser from what has transpired between now and then you wonder whether this marks the flowering of a genuinely successful opening pair. We&apos;ll soon find out when South Africa come to town. What they&apos;re noticeably doing better here than at any point past is in taking quick singles. As Strauss drops the ball by his feet they steal another run to bring up the 100.  35th over: England 105-0 (Strauss 38 Cook 56)Turns out those four runs I awarded Strauss for a &quot;delicate glance to leg&quot; or somesuch bumpf were actually four leg-byes, so he loses four runs and moves back to GO. Fortunately the very next ball is edged past slip for four rather more genuine runs, so he moves right back up to where he started the over, on 38.  36th over: England 105-0 (Strauss 38 Cook 56)Best ball of the day by Martin, straightening off the pitch and drawing Cook&apos;s bat along the rail and to within an inch or so of an edge.  37th over: England 105-0 (Strauss 38 Cook 56)Strauss watches a wide one pass by his off stump, and my fibres ache for him to show a little gumption and slot the thing away past point for four with a delicious crack, which is what the ball was begging for. Another maiden it is though.  38th over: England 105-0 (Strauss 38 Cook 56)Flat stuff this, in more ways then one. Martin&apos;s third ball hardly lifts off the wicket, and slides wide away from off stump, Cook reaches wide to drives and edges the ball through behind on the bounce.  39th over: England 111-0 (Strauss 43 Cook 56)A single brings the first run for four overs and earns a round of sarcastic applause from the crowd. And then, the bottle unstopped, Cook cuts hard past point for another, and then Strauss himself essays that distinctively robust pull shot of his and whistles the ball away through mid-wicket for four. As if that wasn&apos;t drama enough by the morning&apos;s standards the Kiwis raise a confident caught behind appeal from the sixth ball, which slipped through Strauss&apos;s gate and flew through to McCullum. Tauffel shakes his head, and rightly so.  WICKET! Cook 61 c McCullum b (39th over: England 121-1) (Strauss 48)Strauss pulls four through mid-wicket with a vicious crack, a single puts Strauss on strike and he then cuts four more up the slope. Time for a bowling change I&apos;d imagine. Notice how I haven&apos;t chosen to delete that last comment despite what&apos;s just happened: my uncanny powers of anticipation are endorsed again. Cook plays a touch outside the line and edges the ball onto his thigh and through to McCullum for a catch, the &apos;keeper running across in front of slip to take the ball.  40th over: England 125-1 (Strauss 49 Vaughan 2)Well then, here&apos;s Vaughan, and there he goes, leaning on the ball and forcing it out to square leg for two. All that early season talk about Vaughan&apos;s poor form is about to amount to what...? And now for some serious worrying, courtesy of Alfred Moore: &quot;Is it just me who has a deep foreboding about the South Africa series?&quot; Alfred asks, not just you Alfred, but do go on...  41st over: England 125-1 (Strauss 49 Vaughan 2)&quot;Take this opening partnership. Atherton, and the rest of the Sky team, can&apos;t stop creaming their jeans over Andrew Strauss, principally, it seems, because he&apos;s stopped playing any run-scoring shots other than the cut, pull, and nudge. That&apos;s great for him, but now we have a situation where England are treating Kyle Mills like he&apos;s Glenn McGrath, and - here&apos;s the kicker -the commentators all think this is brilliant.&quot; To be fair, Al, Strauss never did play many shots other than those, but I take your point, which continues here: &quot;This opening partnership says to the opposition &apos;pull up a chair, relax, bowl ten maidens, get your rhythm, don&apos;t worry about getting wickets, because in two sessions time the score will be less than a hundred&apos;. That&apos;s fine against New Zealand, if you don&apos;t mind a lot of draws, but we&apos;re going to get murdered by South Africa.&quot; Another edge here, dropping just short of Marshall in the slips.  42nd over: England 125-1 (Strauss 49 Vaughan 2)An hour in and Vettori makes the first bowling change of the day, bringing on Mary Shelley&apos;s Jacob Oram for a fiddle. His first ball sails past Vaughan&apos;s forward defensive, causing the England captain to purse his lips and sigh as though his mother had just set a hot pie down on the family table.  43rd over: England 125-1 (Strauss 50 Vaughan 2)Strauss turns one off his hip and moves to fifty, and a very tidy, tight and steady innings it&apos;s been too. John Wilson &quot;can&apos;t help responding to something in over 32 about Athers muttering into the mic that New Zealand can&apos;t win from here. Very true, but England are more than capable of losing from here - a sudden collapse followed by McCullum mayhem followed by another collapse.&quot; Cynic.  44th over: England 130-1 (Strauss 53 Vaughan 2)Strauss punches three out to deep cover. (NB: in the interest of full disclosure it should be pointed out that this over was phoned in because it is Sunday and your correspondent was staring out of the window.)  45th over: England 131-1 (Strauss 55 Vaughan 2)Strauss swings and misses wildly at a wide-going-wider delivery from Martin. Tom vd Gucht has written to reassure Alfred Moore that he&apos;s not the only one &quot;bricking it about the SA series. The England team seems to have been happily bungling around for a while now like overly chirpy characters from a second rate sports movie (Mighty Ducks, Bad News bears etc), not doing especially well or especially badly but doing just enough to avid any ill feeling from the fans. Sadly I think their daydreamy, unduly optimistic world may be torn away by the SA speed crew ripping out any last semblance of pride, self respect and belief that remains. However it is also possible that their lack of spinning option, England&apos;s kryptonite of late, will give them breathing space.&quot;  46th over: England 136-1 (Strauss 55 Vaughan 6)While I see where Tom is coming from, I think it&apos;s possible that we may see the summer tale an alternative course, and that period of rather hesitant development that marked Moores&apos; first year may flower this summer into something far more assured and assertive. The bowling is looking better resourced than it has in a long while, so the onus for me is on the top six, and the combination of Bell, Strauss and Cook in particular to play with a new-found authority. Vaughan tucks one to fine leg and Oram switches around the wicket to draw a wildly optimistic lbw shout against Strauss.  47th over: England 140-1 (Strauss 58 Vaughan 7)Vettori brings himself on for his first bowl of the match, and what is, in fact, only his 12th over on this tor so far. &quot;Aww that&apos;s lovely bowling that Danny!&quot; encourages McCullum, as Vettori has the the ball drifting in towards leg. Strauss drops to one knee next ball and sweeps three to fine leg. England now trail by 137 runs.  48th over: England 143-1 (Strauss 61 Vaughan 7)Again we&apos;ve an England fan, Tom Cox, tapping into what seems to be the predominant feeling about this England side at the moment: &quot;England are, in my eyes, in a quandary. They can compete with and often beat the majority of sides by playing in the manner they are today - conservatively, looking to win matches by consistently winning the majority of sessions and guarding against collapses. This game plan does then not work against Australia who play much more positive cricket and can turn games in an instant. 2005 was achieved by playing fearless cricket - as embodied by Flintoff and Trescothick in particular. Bearing in mind all the talk before the series about positive mindsets, the shortened format of today should necessitate urgency - we&apos;ll wait and see...&quot; I&apos;d suggest Tom that the kind of aggression you&apos;re alluding too only comes when a side is confident in it&apos;s ability to force a win from any situation, that is, when winning has become such a habit for them that they lose their fear of defeat. It&apos;s not something you can manufacture, it has to come from a team developing over time, and as I was saying I think we may see England acquire the winning habit this summer. 2005, remember, was the end-product of the phenomenal 18 months that came before it, all kick started by a win against the West Indies at Sabina Park, which came shortly after some very indifferent performances that weren&apos;t unlike what we saw from England this winter.  49th over: England 148-1 (Strauss 63 Vaughan 10)Vaughan eases his way through Vettori&apos;s latest over with a degree of ease that bodes well for his form.  WICKET! Strauss 63 lbw Oram 50th over: England 148-2 (Vaughan 10 Pietersen 0)&quot;Apart from the weather and the fact he is going at 6s an over, any idea why Southee has only bowled three overs?&quot; asks Nathan Green. Well he&apos;s only 19, remember. And he&apos;s warming up now, lying on his back and rolling his hips from side to side. But as the camera cuts away we see Oram pin Strauss lbw. The ball pitched on leg and Strauss played across the line, a decision he presumably regretted when the ball slid through his gate and thumped into his front pad. Tauffel&apos;s finger rose, and Strauss tucked his bat under his arm to trudge off. And here comes the man they pay their money to see, Kevin Pietersen.  50th over: England 148-2 (Vaughan 10 Pietersen 0)Tim Maitland has got me bang to rights: &quot;re: the 44th over: &apos;England 130-1 (Strauss 53 Vaughan 2) Strauss punches three out to deep cover.&apos; The OBO has established a tradition of greater and grittier honesty than that! If you were having a dump with the door open so you could still hear the TV, fielding a phone call from a disgruntled girlfriend/mother/mother-in-law or simply mailing it in because-it&apos;s-Sunday-and-no-one-gives-a-toss-and-it&apos;s going-to-end-in-the-dullest-draw-since-the-Jurassic we have a right to know!&quot; Tim, you&apos;re right, it was remiss, lazy even, of me to try and maintain some veneer of professionalism about these proceedings. Truth is I was simply staring out of the window, probably thinking about sandwiches or somesuch thing. So of your three guesses your last would be closest to the mark.  51st over: England 152-2 (Vaughan 10 Pietersen 3)KP walks across his stumps and down the pitch in an effort to play Oram to leg. It prompts a wide from the bowler by way of over-compensation, and then KP succeeds in getting off one next ball, three runs coming from a Kyle Mills misfield at mid-wicket.  WICKET! Pietersen 3 lbw Vettori (52nd over: England 152-3 (Vaughan 10 Bell 0)Holy calamity! Pietersen is undone, out, gone! He played outside the line and was plumb lbw. It was that familiar drift through the air from Vettori that did him, the ball just shading its way in towards middle stump and spitting straight on. An early, costly, mistake from KP brings Ian Bell to the crease, and if there was ever a chance for this guy to finally stamp some goddamn authority on things this was it. Bell, to me, seems to get more chances and lives than any other batsman in this side given the erratic, often indeterminate, nature of his contributions.  53rd over: England 159-3 (Vaughan 12 Bell 5)Well that&apos;s ruined a lot of folks&apos; day out. KP is back on the balcony, arms folded. And that&apos;s a glorious shot by Bell, chopping the ball hard in front of point.  54th over: England 159-3 (Vaughan 12 Bell 5)A maiden from Vettori, as Vaughan draws back into his shell ahead of lunch.  55th over: England 160-3 (Vaughan 12 Bell 6)Well excuse me while I make like everyone else and hustle through this last over to little effect, but my mind has come over all Gatting and is thinking about lunch. There is a quick single to end the session, and what an interesting one it&apos;s been too.  **************************** That&apos;s New Zealand&apos;s session then, capped by removing KP. Equally telling could be the fact that once again we&apos;ve seen England batsmen set but fail to kick on to play a truly match-influencing innings. One of Cook and Strauss should surely have found a ton to be there for the taking. Interesting stuff, but not nearly so interesting as the prospect of my lunch. James Dart will be here to guide you through the afternoon, as I&apos;ll be watching my beloved Bath put a full stop on Lawrence Dallaglio&apos;s career (hopefully) in the Guinness Premiership semi-finals. Enjoy it, and I&apos;ll see you in the afternoon.  Good afternoon readers. It should be an interesting one at that, courtesy of the three tumbling England wickets. Anyhow, given that it&apos;s lunch, and in the spirit of topicality, I&apos;ve been wondering which cricketers have played in FA Cup finals. Sad, probably, but I blame a fascination with older generations of sportsmen playing different sports to a particularly high level. So far, I&apos;ve got: CB Fry (Southampton 1902), Denis Compton (Arsenal 1950), Harry Makepeace (Everton 1906, 1907), Jack Sharp (Everton 1907), Jack Dyson (Man City 1956), Jim Standen (West Ham 1964), Graham Cross (Leicester City 1963, 1969), William &apos;Fatty&apos; Foulke (Sheffield Utd 1899, 1901, 1902 - four games for Derbyshire, apparently) and Ireland&apos;s Noel Cantwell (Man Utd 1963). Any suggestions? I&apos;m drawing the line at Phil Neville.  58th over: England 162-3 (Vaughan 12 Bell 8) Vettori hands the ball to, well, himself as the second session begins. He bowled particularly cleverly in a brief five-over spell before the lunch break and he starts in a similar fashion now. The second ball is just a shade quicker and pins Bell on the back foot; a loud shout for lbw is rightly ignored by Steve Bucknor due to a faint inside edge. Bell responds well and tucks two runs down to fine leg.  59th over: England 164-3 (Vaughan 13 Bell 9) Tim Southee replaces Oram at the Pavilion End and his over is notable for two simple singles and a delivery that seamed a tad and beat Vaughan&apos;s outside edge. &quot;So, the 12th man for the next Test will be announced by management at the end of today&apos;s play,&quot; begins Tom van der Gucht. &quot;Who gets your vote?&quot; Well ... &quot;The paper seemed to think Harmy may be in with a shout due to his liking for the Old Trafford pitch. Personally I reckon picking him will send out the wrong message and that Peter Moores should carry on bringing in well-aged and groomed county pros rather then picking on potential and give Charlie Shreck the nod. Pace, bounce and bushy hair. Whilst he&apos;s at it, he may as well drop Monty and bring Graeme Swann in instead. Would Notts be able to put in a formal complaint if that happened?&quot;  60th over: England 170-3 (Vaughan 14 Bell 14) Apologies for the brevity of entry. Technical issues here, I&apos;m sorry to say. Bell is less troubled by Vettori in this over and flashes a lovely four through the third man area.  61st over: England 174-3 (Vaughan 18 Bell 14) Vaughan&apos;s best stroke of his innings so far, clipping Southee off his pads for four through mid-wicket.  62nd over: England 176-3 (Vaughan 19 Bell 15) Bell is working hard to get himself playing forward to Vettori, especially with the New Zealand skipper keeping him as honest as he has thus far. Two singles take the partnership to 24.  63rd over: England 177-3 (Vaughan 20 Bell 15) Another quick single, this time for Vaughan, is the only scoring of note. England&apos;s batsmen have looked rather sprightly in this innings and these important runs bring them within 100 of New Zealand&apos;s total.  64th over: England 177-3 (Vaughan 20 Bell 15) &quot;The crowd looks thin,&quot; writes Gary Naylor in lieu of major drama from the returning Chris Martin&apos;s maiden over. &quot;Doesn&apos;t the ECB realise that it&apos;s just too expensive, especially when the players gleefully race off in &apos;bad light&apos;? \u00a340 is plenty for a England v New Zealand. Test matches have become much too corporate in the last few years - the ECB should announce now how many tickets will be made available to the public for the Ashes Tests and what each ground will charge. Test matches are hugley more expensive here than in any other country.&quot; At least the public got 53 balls for free yesterday, Gary. I was a little surprised that seven more weren&apos;t squeezed out to save \u00a3550,000.  65th over: England 179-3 (Vaughan 21 Bell 16) Southee is straying just a little from the ideal line and both Bell, then Vaughan, take advantage with straightforward singles. &quot;I love CB Fry, love him,&quot; writes Patrick O&apos;Brien. What&apos;s not to love about a man who claimed Albania offered him their throne? &quot;There was a picture of CB Fry in the Arsenal museum at Old Highbury. I doubt he&apos;s anywhere to be seen at the new palace of money, unfortunately.&quot; He should, tall tales or not.  WICKET! Bell 16 c McCullum b Martin (66th over: England 180-4) An absolute beauty from Martin puts New Zealand right back into the thick of things. The ball rears up a little more than Bell expects, seams away and catches the edge. McCullum takes a regulation catch behind the stumps and England are four down. Bell wasn&apos;t particularly at fault; Martin deserves all the credit.  67th over: England 184-4 (Vaughan 26 Collingwood 0) For England fans, this isn&apos;t quite the entertainment they would have planned at the start of the day, but the tourists&apos; bowlers are providing a fascinating contest right now. Southee keeps Vaughan under pressure with a tight over until he drifts on to the pads. Vaughan takes full advantage and clips away through square to the ropes.  68th over: England 184-4 (Vaughan 26 Collingwood 0) Martin immediately has Collingwood on the back foot, beating the edge. He has been far and away the pick of New Zealand&apos;s seamers today. Another maiden.  69th over: England 188-4 (Vaughan 30 Collingwood 0) Again, Southee lets England off the hook with one poor ball, offering excessuve room outside off stump which Vaughan takes advantage of. He drives off the bottom of the bat, mind, but it beats the poor dive of Jamie How at point and makes its merry way to the boundary. Southee is going at around four an over at present.  70th over: England 191-4 (Vaughan 31 Collingwood 1) A scampered single for Collingwood and a no-ball is followed by a massive shout for lbw against Vaughan, which is ignored by Bucknor. The ball angled in from outside off stump and caught Vaughan - not really that far forward - just below the knee. HawkEye shows that the top of middle and off would have been clipped, but Vaughan just shaded it on the benefit of the doubt. A nervy moment for the England skipper and no mistake.  71st over: England 200-4 (Vaughan 35 Collingwood 5) Scroll down to the 69th over and you&apos;ll get the gist of this one. Southee&apos;s opening delivery is downright ugly and gets the treatment, again from Vaughan, but this time on the leg side. Hugely frustrating for New Zealand and downright agonising for Martin at the other end. Further insult is added with the final ball: Collingwood is offered a little room outside off stump, but his flashed drive Chinese cuts to McCullum&apos;s left and flies away to the fine leg boundary. Up comes the 200 and with it should be an end to this Southee spell.  72nd over: England 203-4 (Vaughan 38 Collingwood 5) Vaughan is still struggling with his timing on the off side. Martin offers him a rare cheap delivery and he drives through mid-off again with the bottom of the bat. The positioning and running is good enough to pick up three runs, at least. Martin hits back with a spearing delivery with extra pace that beats Collingwood&apos;s outside edge. Drinks.  73rd over: England 203-4 (Vaughan 38 Collingwood 5) Vettori has indeed had enough of Southee and his first delivery prompts a loud lbw shout against Vaughan. Taufel rightly waves it away and smiles at the bullishness of the claim. Vettori then deceives Vaughan with a slower ball, producing a sweep that misses completely and the stumps unmoved, agonisingly below.  74th over: England 208-4 (Vaughan 42 Collingwood 6) Respite is offered to England with a change in the bowling: Kyle Mills on for the excellent Martin. Collingwood chalks up an easy single, dropping the ball to short cover, before Vaughan plays delightfully off his pads - as he has all innings - to the square-leg boundary.  WICKET! Collingwood 6 c Taylor b Vettori (75th over: England 208-5) Brilliance from Vettori, who manages to get one to turn back up the slope. It gets a thick edge from Collingwood&apos;s bat and Ross Taylor makes an easy catch look a little tougher than it should have at first slip. A superb bowling display from Vettori and Martin this afternoon.  WICKET! Ambrose 0 lbw b Vettori (75th over: England 208-6) A golden duck for Ambrose, who is caught out by more magic from Vettori. This time he chooses to drift one back into the batsman; Ambrose offers no shot and umpire Taufel has no choice but to raise his finger. Vettori is on a hat-trick and Stuart Broad will be facing ... and he barely survives! A quicker ball is just a little too good for Broad, who only just plays and misses. A fantastic double-wicket maiden from Vettori and England are suddenly struggling to secure a first-innings lead.  76th over: England 212-6 (Vaughan 43 Broad 2) Six wickets have gone down for the addition of just 88 England runs, but all credit must go to both Vettori and Martin for undoing all the good work of England&apos;s openers in reaching 121 without loss. Vaughan prods into short mid-on for a single, before Broad, anxiously on his toes, tucks a no-ball around to square. Mills responds well and gets a thick edge that falls a long way short of the slip cordon.  77th over: England 216-6 (Vaughan 47 Broad 2) A quicker ball from Vettori, but Vaughan is more than equal to it, clipping a really classy shot through mid-wicket for four.  78th over: England 218-6 (Vaughan 47 Broad 4) Strange-sounding moans and gasps from around the desk - think Chewbacca mid-coitus ... actually, don&apos;t - can mean only two things: Bath are losing to Wasps in the Premiership play-offs and Inter are in the process of the biggest choke in Italian football since, well, since they last tossed the Serie A title away on the final afternoon of the season. An uneventful over from Mills and Broad finely clips the final ball off his pads for two.  79th over: England 223-6 (Vaughan 50 Broad 6) A punchy two through mid-on takes Vaughan to 49 and one ball later he registers his half-century, a composed innings when England have most needed it (six fours in the 125-ball knock).  80th over: England 231-6 (Vaughan 54 Broad 9) &quot;Will Athers apologise to Vettori and McCullum for his mean-spirited piece in Thursday&apos;s Times?&quot; wonders Gary Naylor. &quot;McCullum batted beautifully in bowler-friendly conditions on Thursday and now Vettori is bowling beautifully in batsman-friendly conditions. Good cricketers are good cricketers and can adjust quickly between formats and conditions - it&apos;s one of the definitions of a good cricketer.&quot; Mills is proving the Southee to Vettori&apos;s Martin in terms of the bowling at present: a loose over offers both Vaughan and Broad cheap runs, eight of which are gratefully received.  81st over: England 233-6 (Vaughan 56 Broad 9) Two runs for Vaughan, comfortably driven off Vettori to deep mid-on. And with that, Vettori ends his superb stint by calling for the new ball.  82nd over: England 233-6 (Vaughan 56 Broad 9) With the new ball comes the return of Martin, who is likely to provide another stern challenge in these 15 minutes prior to tea. And then afterwards, I&apos;d envisage too. Broad deals with the over well, but Martin won&apos;t mind too much, given the amount of seam to be had. And that it was a maiden to boot.  83rd over: England 233-6 (Vaughan 56 Broad 9) Unperturbed by his disappointing previous spell, Vettori throws Southee the new ball and the bowler responds to the vote of confidence in promising fashion with a maiden.  84th over: England 235-6 (Vaughan 57 Broad 10) Martin attempts to catch Broad out with an inswinging yorker, but a sharp downwards thrust of the bat denies the bowler and adds another to Broad&apos;s total as the ball heads down to third man. Vaughan then fends off a snarling short ball for another single.  85th over: England 239-6 (Vaughan 61 Broad 10) Shot! Vaughan finally times one on the on-side, driving Southee through the covers and up the hill to the boundary. Frustrating from the bowler but arguably the shot of Vaughan&apos;s innings. Twenty-seven runs have now been added for the seventh wicket. And with that, it&apos;s tea. Seventy-nine runs and three wickets: a good session for New Zealand and Vaughan. Andy Bull will be back for the final session after the break.  Afternoon. Bloody Wasps. Bloody Dallaglio. I&apos;ve what, four minutes till play starts? That&apos;s time to make it downstairs to the carpark and back isn&apos;t it? Of course it is.  86th over: England 241-6 (Vaughan 61 Broad 12)OK so I just made it back in time. Just. To see Martin opening the bowling after the break. But that&apos;s about all I do see of this over. What I hear though, are predictable rumblings about the form and future composition of England&apos;s top six.  87th over: England 242-6 (Vaughan 62 Broad 12)At the other end comes Southee, shaping the ball towards the slips from back of a length. Vaughan drops a single out to leg.  88th over: England 243-6 (Vaughan 63 Broad 12)In Broad then we&apos;re seeing one area where this team has made palpable improvement - the strength of the tail. Broad, here swinging and missing, may be the most important gain the side has made since Monty made his debut. In the commentary box Nasser Hussain has utterly lost it in the face of some bafflingly incoherent - and, as it turns out entirely erroneous - analysis. Nasser is in fits of giggles.  89th over: England 243-6 (Vaughan 63 Broad 12)&quot;Is it any wonder we were rubbish in the 1990s?&quot; deadpans Atherton, reflecting on Bumble&apos;s confusion in the last over about which of Vettori&apos;s wicket-taking balls was quicker than the other. If you&apos;d like to read what the Guardian&apos;s Paul Weaver makes of the day so far,  click here to see his verdict.  90th over: England 250-6 (Vaughan 64 Broad 17)A thin edge from Broad bobbles onto the turf just short of McCullum&apos;s gloves. And then. to show he can play, Broad eases forward and drives four sweet runs away through cover. Next ball he pops up onto his toes and turns a single away to fine leg. Vaughan duly follows suit for one more.  91st over: England 255-6 (Vaughan 65 Broad 21)Edged and dropped! Southee spits an away swinger up from a length and Aaron Redmond almost pulls off a spectacular diving catch, falling to his right at second slip but the ball just flicks his fingers on its way to ground. For a young shaver making his debut at Lord&apos;s, Southee is bowling quite brilliantly. Speaking of young shavers, that&apos;s another lovely shot from Broad, a clipped straight-drive fetching him four through long-off. A great contest here as Southee comes back with an outswinger which clips the edge and flies through only to land short of first slip.  92nd over: England 256-6 (Vaughan 66 Broad 21)And a bouncer from Martin, firing the ball over Broad&apos;s head. It&apos;s all very uneventful, innocuous Sunday afternoon fare.  93rd over: England 261-6 (Vaughan 66 Broad 25)Seeing as it looks set to be the topic of conversation for the coming weeks, here&apos;s Gary Naylor&apos;s twopence worth on who should be first against the wall from England&apos;s top six: &quot;I&apos;m a bit fed up with Belly Boy. His average has been falling for 20 Tests and perhaps the time has come to ditch this, &quot;He looks so good, he&apos;s bound to come good&quot; nonsense after 37 Tests. Will he make a ton when you really need it (often enough?) I don&apos;t think so. If looking good with bat in hand is the criterion for batting in the top six, Broad might as well bat there.&quot; Indeed he might, having just smeared a sweetly struck cover drive away for four more. The question is who is the next man in line, the shortlist look something like this: Bopara, Shah, Key. And of the three I&apos;d plump for the first.  94th over: England 269-6 (Vaughan 74 Broad 25)Danny Vettori decides to bring himself back on. Really, could Vettori be any more impressive as a cricketer? Astute, orthodox, effective... and driven for four by Michael Vaughan. And here Vaughan comes down the pitch to hit Vettori over the top, but is beaten by the flight of the ball, which screws off his leading edge over mid-on for four very streaky runs.  WICKET! Broad 25 b Oram (95th over: England 269-7 (Vaughan 75 Sidebottom 0)Naked aggression from Vaughan in that over, and about time too. Oram is in to the attack from the Pavilion End. An with immediate effect. What a ball that is, coming back up the slope and in towards Broad&apos;s pads and on through the gate into middle stump. Watching the crabby Sidebottom grub around the crease for the first two balls gives a potent reminder of what excellent technique Broad has for a tailender.  96th over: England 276-7 (Vaughan 82 Sidebottom 0)Vaughan squeezes four runs past backward point with a late cut. Four balls into the over and Vettori brings in his fielders from behind the wicket to keep Vaughan from stealing the strike, deliciously Vaughan responds with another adept late cut which fetches three runs to long leg and so confounds Vettori&apos;s scheming.  Can I just insert a note here to say that the new Qantas ad, with the orchestral reworking of Down Under by Men At Work, that&apos;s MAGIC.  96th over: England 284-7 (Vaughan 87 Sidebottom 3)So the scores are level now. And Sidebottom has put England into the lead with three runs through mid-wicket, scooped off his pads. The next ball flies off the pitch and leaves all and sundry grinning in acknowledgment of how brutal it was; There&apos;s been plenty of uneven bounce today, which suggests to me that England should be more than able to wring enough out of the pitch to come close to victory tomorrow. Vaughan is up to 87 with a straight drive.  97th over: England 287-7 (Vaughan 87 Sidebottom 3)Sigh.  98th over: England 287-7 (Vaughan 87 Sidebottom 3)Unfortunately for all concerned Sideshow Bob Sidebottom seems to be getting all the strike. What with Oram bowling his typically immaculate line it makes for a rather dull maiden.  99th over: England 288-7 (Vaughan 88 Sidebottom 3)England should really be attacking here, and Vaughan is playing as though he knows it. Fifty runs earned quickly, leaving time for a good bowl tonight, would contribute far more to the pursuit of victory than 90 runs in slow-time.  100th over: England 288-7 (Vaughan 88 Sidebottom 3)This is Vaughan&apos;s 18th Test innings at Lord&apos;s, and he&apos;s on the brink of his sixth century at the ground. That, as a Sky graphic is helpfully pointing out, would see him equal Graham Gooch&apos;s record, though Gooch took 39 innings.  101st over: England 290-7 (Vaughan 88 Sidebottom 5)How apt though that Vaughan, a throwback in style and technique, should thrive at the Lord&apos;s of all places. Sidebottom takes two runs.  102nd over: England 293-7 (Vaughan 89 Sidebottom 6)Vaughan drops a single out to square leg and Sidebottom then does likewise. Again Naylor taps me on the shoulder, leans forward and mutters: &quot;Shouldn&apos;t England declare? Even if the light is deemed &quot;bad&quot; Vaughan could bowl Monty and KP. Right now, England need wickets to force the win, not runs.&quot; which is true enough, though you imagine Vaughan might want to wait just a little longer - say the time it takes him to add another 11 runs to his score - before entertaining such a thought. Not that I think he would entertain it mind, I imagine he&apos;d serve it the cold shoulder of leftover lamb and a glass of tapwater before telling it to do one out the backdoor.  103rd over: England 295-7 (Vaughan 91 Sidebottom 7)Sidebottom clumps one out to square leg and strolls one from the sixth ball. Pity.  104th over: England 299-7 (Vaughan 91 Sidebottom 11)Ah I&apos;ve done him an injustice, he runs the first ball of Oram&apos;s latest over past gully got four, which will teach me for being a miserable bugger.  105th over: England 300-7 (Vaughan 92 Sidebottom 11)Good grief this is soporific stuff isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s as though everyone has just returned from a long walk in the country and the Sunday papers are scattered across the wicket and there&apos;s a smell of roast beef wafting out of the Lord&apos;s kitchen and across the ground. Vaughan, Gower points out, has never been out in the 90s in a Test, which is as close to a cast iron jinx as I&apos;ve ever heard.  106th over: England 305-7 (Vaughan 93 Sidebottom 15)Just when I&apos;m beginning to feel like someone has been secreting ketamine in my water, Sidebottom stirs me into some kind of life with a crashing cover drive for four.  107th over: England 317-7 (Vaughan 104 Sidebottom 16)And a glorious sweep from Vaughan brings him another couple. It could have been four but for a brilliant diving stop by Tim Southee at deep backward square. Beautiful to watch. Ah, and that&apos;s more like it... Vaughan raises his 18th Test century by stepping down the pitch and lifting the ball over square leg to the boundary for four. Great shot, played with some panache. And he&apos;s attacked the next one two, dropping to one knee and launching a Trescothick-esque slog sweep over towards the rope. he was aiming for the top tier of the stand but didn&apos;t quite catch it cleanly.  WICKET! Sidebottom 16 c Taylor b Mills (108th over: England 317-8 Vaughan 104 Panesar 0)Mills continues. Sidebottom has latched onto the spirit of the thing and tries to swat the next two balls for six over long-off and then gets out to the third, again abandoning any attempts at orthodoxy and simply swinging his bat free and loose, snicking the ball to slip instead of sending it into the crowd. Monty is in ahead of Jimmy Anderson, which seems a bit rich.  WICKET! Panesar 0 c Flynn b Vettori (109th over: England 318-9 (Vaughan 104 Anderson 0)Vaughan bunts one out to leg and leaves Monty to face five balls. Monty has, as Nasser suggests, licence to try and hit Vettori past the media centre into the nursery. He doesn&apos;t get to use it though, but tries to play a polite glance and gloves his second ball straight to short leg instead. What a shame. Bucknor raises his finger with the most rueful of grins on his face. What odds Jimmy Anderson surviving these four balls then? Vaughan, mad keen for a final blast, backs up a mile and tries to hustle Jimmy into a single. Vettori of course wants one more for a five-for and place on the honours board.  109th over: England 319-9 (Vaughan 106 Anderson 0)Yahboosucks, Bucknor has whipped out his light meter again. &quot;Vettori has won the first battle of the beards against Monty- that could be significant for the outcome of the entire series&quot; points out Keith Flett, ever alert to all matters pertaining to facial hair. Nasser Hussain has finally caught up with Gary Naylor&apos;s thinking and is proposing England declare. Vaughan seems to prefer to swinghis bat, does so twice for no return an then settles for a strange single. Anderson leaves the first alone, as he does the second.  WICKET! Vaughan 106 c Marshall b Vettori (110th over: England 319-9 (Anderson 0)Vaughan steps out to smash Vettori out over leg but fails to make contact and is nearly stumped. He&apos;s a terrible slogger is Vaughan, and he&apos;s been caught next ball, slapping a sweep straight down Marshall&apos;s throat at mid-wicket. That gives Vettori a well-earned five for and makes more work for the Lord&apos;s engraver.  So England lead by 42 and should squeeze in an over or two before the light closes in on them tonight.  1st over: New Zealand 3-0 (How 3 Redmond 0)How is almost off to a shocker when he turns Sidebottom&apos;s first ball just past the grasp of short leg for two. Vaughan has three slips and a gully in, plus the short leg catching close. Sidebottom is swinging the ball into the off stump.What with Redmond on his debut and also on a pair, Vaughan brings in even more close catchers just to make him feel even more comfortable.  2nd over: New Zealand 7-0 (How 7 Redmond 0)Anderson opens at the other end with a leg-stump half-volley which How spanks for four through wide long-on.  3rd over: New Zealand 7-0 (How 7 Redmond 0)Redmond keeps his bottle and refuses to play at a string of tempting wide balls from Sidebottom... and then, quite curiously, Redmond steps away as a little girl in a green top gets in front of the sightscreen. Sidebottom curses, loudly and coarsely, at being made to break his delivery stride. It&apos;s a maiden.  4th over: New Zealand 13-0 (How 13 Redmond 0)How knocks two runs out to leg as Jimmy continues to look a touch wayward. The next scoring shot is all about How though, as he stands up on the back foot and drives four through cover from underneath his nose. Great shot.  5th over: New Zealand 17-0 (How 13 Redmond 4)Redmond&apos;s first Test runs come with a sweet cut shot from a short wide delivery by Sidebottom, it skims over the grass and across the rope for four. Frankly, this is all looking a little too easy for New Zealand&apos;s openers. Sideshow seems to think so too, and sends down a bouncer to remind Redmond that this is Test cricket afterall.  6th over: New Zealand 22-0 (How 18 Redmond 4)Vaughan tosses the ball to Stuart Broad to see if he can effect an early wicket. It looks unlikely as How thunders another drive away for four.  7th over: New Zealand 23-0 (How 18 Redmond 4)And, as early as the seventh over, Vaughan is giving a Monty a go with the shiny new ball. Adventurous stuff, and admirable too seeing as you wouldn&apos;t think either of these two was going to be especially comfortable with playing spin at this point in the game. And so it goes - Monty had How there, plumb lbw playing inside the line. But the finger stayed down, Taufel for some reason unconvinced. Another lbw appeal follows, and that too is turned down.  8th over: New Zealand 24-0 (How 20 Redmond 4)Broad hammers down a pair of bouncers at How, incensed by How easily he&apos;s negotiated what should have been a difficult half hour&apos;s play.  9th over: New Zealand 26-0 (How 20 Redmond 5)I&apos;m getting a little hungry for the light meter. And here it comes... alas though Bucknor shakes his head and pockets it again, meaning it looks as though we&apos;re set until 7. I mean, i say &apos;we&apos;, but lets be honest, i&apos;ve had six emails in the last 150 minutes, and four of them have come from Gary Naylor.  10th over: New Zealand 32-0 (How 22 Redmond 10)Redmond clatters a straight drive past Broad&apos;s head for four down the ground.  11th over: New Zealand 32-0 (How 22 Redmond 10)In fact the last email I had was 40 minutes ago, from somebody named Julia Hutton advising me that the England Women have been crowned Amsterdam Sevens Champions, and I have no sodding idea what any component of that message means, or is meant to mean. But it;s still a damn sight better than the efforts of the rest of you lazy buggers.  12th over: New Zealand 39-0 (How 26 Redmond 14) A mad rush of three emails into my inbox causes me to faint in excitement. I&apos;m just collapsing now... using my last strength to type this before my frame hits the floor... I&apos;ll be back for the next over if I&apos;m up in timeeeeee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  13th over: New Zealand 40-0 (How 26 Redmond 14)Another bloody fruitless lbw shout from England and Monty. Seeing as Alex Cochrane had written, I&apos;ll publish: &quot;This game is deader than that parrot in the Monty Python sketch. Your only hope was that it was going to rain today and no play would be possible. I was watching the Parma v Inter game earlier and I thought they&apos;d decided to play water polo instead.&quot;  14th over: New Zealand 40-0 (How 26 Redmond 14)Sidebottom is back on and he&apos;s strung together a series of little dots, six of them in fact, to make a maiden. Weird science is what you might call it.  15th over: New Zealand 40-0 (How 26 Redmond 14)I&apos;m so out of here the moment this over ends. You won&apos;t even see me for the dust. In fact I&apos;m going to fit in my thankyous and farewells now just so I can save an extra minute. Thanks for you emails, and maybe even for your company (I think there was some of that). England close with a lead of just two, after a very disappointing final spell of 15 overs in which they failed to take a wicket.

The discovery of the work, along with a notebook of sketches also purportedly drawn by Van Gogh, has raised the prospect of the post-impressionist artist having painted a third portrait of his physician, Dr Gachet, perhaps only days before a bout of insanity induced him to commit suicide at the age of 37. For art historians it would add to the controversy that has surrounded the famous painting by one of the fathers of modern art. &quot;A lot of interest has been expressed in the work from very big museums and auction houses,&quot; its owner, Doretta Peppa, said. &quot;A well-known institution will soon make an announcement about its historical background that will leave no doubt it is an original work by Van Gogh.&quot; Peppa said the portrait&apos;s colourful history began in France when the Nazis stole it from a Jewish family during the second world war. After Hitler&apos;s forces marched into Greece in April 1941 it was brought to Athens, an exhibition centre for looted treasures. The Athenian writer claims it was &quot;liberated&quot; by her father, Meletis, a prominent figure in the partisan movement, during a raid on a German train in the waning days of the occupation in 1944. &quot;It was not the only treasure that was liberated but understanding its particular value my father kept it stored in a safe place for years,&quot; she said. Peppa put the painting in a bank vault after approaching the head of conservation at the Greek National Gallery who, after studying its brushwork and signature, told her she not only had an original Van Gogh in her possession but one of his rarer works. Tests by other art experts supported the assessment. &quot;It has gone through so many laboratory analyses that I am 100% convinced it is a Vincent van Gogh,&quot; said Athanasios Celia, a Paris-based painter and art historian. &quot;We have examined and dated the materials used and there is no doubt in my mind that it is unique,&quot; he added. &quot;As the other portraits of Dr Gachet were painted towards the end of Van Gogh&apos;s life, it also raises the possibility that this less detailed version is the last [work] he ever produced.&quot; It had been thought that the Dutch-born artist painted two portraits of the physician who cared for him in the last months of his life. One belongs to the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Orsay in Paris. The other, sold by Christie&apos;s to the Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito for \u00a348m in 1990, held the distinction for 14 years of being the most expensive painting sold at auction. But in a market where Van Gogh fakes abound, questions have also been raised about the painting in Athens. In 1990 the Art Newspaper claimed that the portrait of Dr Gachet hanging in the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Orsay was a counterfeit. The plot thickened after scholars suggested the physician may have been the source of some of the forgeries. Although the authenticity of the Van Gogh notebook found with the portrait has also been questioned - the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has discredited it - Peppa says the Nazi stamp and code on the back of the painting provides added proof of its authenticity. As the identity of its Jewish owners has not been revealed, and no one has come forward to reclaim it, under Greek law it belongs to Peppa. Some experts have valued the work at $100m (about \u00a350m).", "sentences": ["Although the authenticity of the Van Gogh notebook found with the portrait has also been questioned - the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has discredited it - Peppa says the Nazi stamp and code on the back of the painting provides added proof of its authenticity."], "title": "Experts fall out over Van Gogh's 'last painting'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/may/19/art.news", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Netherlands", "Greece", "Second world war", "World news", "Culture", "Van Gogh", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-19T01:30:16Z", "article": "Steve McClaren is considering an offer to return to management in the Netherlands with FC Twente, who yesterday secured the country&apos;s second Champions League spot by beating Ajax in a play-off.

Photograph: CorbisI simply don&apos;t believe today&apos;s story that a painting by Vincent van Gogh has turned up in a bank vault in Athens. Of course, it may yet prove to be an authentic version of Van Gogh&apos;s portrait of his doctor, but what a fishy find! The painting&apos;s supposed story is such a cocktail of all-too-convenient details, echoes of other recent art stories that ended up with people making a lot of money and a damning mistake by a possible forger that it stinks like week-old calamari. This raises a question about art cons - the painting is being examined by &quot;art experts&quot;, but should the opinion of literary critics or novelists also be consulted? They would surely be good at spotting bad fiction. Forgery is not only the physical replication of an object. It also involves making up a good story about that object - faking its &quot;provenance&quot;, in art historians&apos; lingo. It&apos;s the wildly exciting nature of this painting&apos;s purported provenance that sounds too good to be true. Apparently the Nazis took it from a Jewish family, dispatched it to Athens for an exhibition, only for it to be seized in a daring partisan raid on a train. The partisan hero who grabbed it kept it hidden away. Now his daughter has brought the painting and its tale to light. Sounds like a novel. Art works seized by the Nazis, returned eventually to the heirs of their rightful Jewish owners and then sold for big money have been in the news recently. Throwing in that detail is therefore one of the reasons I find the story so corny. As for the bold resistance fighter finding it on a Nazi train ... isn&apos;t that a scene from an old Frank Sinatra war film? And even if that story were to be proved true, the fact that it&apos;s a portrait of Dr Paul Gachet, the medical man in whose charge Van Gogh spent the last months of his life, is in itself worrying. Gachet was a peculiar character, an art-loving friend of the impressionists who turned out to be a poor protector of Van Gogh&apos;s interests. There have been rumours that Gachet himself was involved in faking his deceased patient&apos;s work. But the flakiest thing about the story is the discovery, along with the painting, of a notebook containing supposed Van Gogh sketches. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has already discredited this and that is surely a damning insight into the painting&apos;s (in)authenticity. Why would a real painting be found in a bank vault together with fake sketches? How would the real and the fictive become conjoined in this way? The hypothesis of a fake painting is more likely. Perhaps I&apos;m wrong and the painting will be proved real. But if I&apos;m right, don&apos;t be surprised if it is sold through some minor auction house to a naive buyer eager to join today&apos;s insanely excited art market. Of course, if it is real, its Jewish owner should be identified and the rightful heirs sought - for the current owner has no right to sell a piece of Nazi war loot.", "sentences": ["The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has already discredited this and that is surely a damning insight into the painting&apos;s (in)authenticity."], "title": "Is the Van Gogh 'find' too good to be true?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/may/19/vangoghfindistoogoodtob", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Van Gogh"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-19T23:45:13Z", "article": "Back story Straight outta&apos; Govan, Ferguson is a one-time shop steward whose left-wing credentials have been damaged slightly by accepting a CBE ... and a knighthood ... and managing arguably the most commercialised club in the world.

It is plain from a brief examination of the data available that blowing your whistle in the final of Uefa&apos;s most prestigious club tournament is likely to bring down on your head a curse so vile that even Wayne Rooney, Neil Warnock and Barry Fry would be unable to match it, even if they were locked in a room all summer with a dictionary, a thesaurus and Rob Stiles. Misfortune dogs these prestige men-in-black as Nobby Stiles once did Eusebio.  Take, for example, the referee of last year&apos;s final, Herbert Fandel. The mild-mannered German piano-teacher had barely recovered from his stint in the heat of Athens when he was assaulted on the field in Copenhagen by a furious Danish fan, during a European Championship qualifier between Denmark and Sweden.  Examine also the fate of Urs Meier, the Swiss in charge in the 2002 final. The grocer ended up being renamed &quot;Urs Hole&quot; by the British tabloids and receiving 16,000 abusive emails after his performance in the 2004 European Championship quarter-final between England and Portugal. The referee in 1993 was another Swiss, Kurt Rothlisberger. Four years later Fifa banned Rothlisberger for life after it was alleged that he had solicited $68,500 for fixing a 1996 tie between Grasshopper Zurich and Auxerre.  Still not convinced? Then what of Tullio Lanese? The Italian oversaw Red Star Belgrade&apos;s penalty shoot-out win over Marseille in 1991 and 15 years later was banned for 2\u00bd years for his part in the Serie A match-fixing scandal.  Or Sandor Puhl, who took charge of the 1997 final? He was subsequently suspended for the rest of the 1997-98 season following a failure to spot Paul Bosvelt&apos;s attempt to remove Denis Irwin&apos;s leg without the benefit of an anaesthetic or surgical instruments. Or Charles Corver, who presided over Liverpool&apos;s 1-0 defeat of Club Bruges in 1978? He later earned his place as the top offender in the list of worst refereeing decisions of all time when he failed even to award a foul after Harald Schumacher steam-rollered Patrick Battiston in the 1982 World Cup semi-final.  Nineteen-eighty-four is best remembered for Bruce Grobbelaar&apos;s rubber-legged antics during the penalty shoot-out. The referee was Erik Fredriksson. The Swede subsequently irritated Soviet football officials so much by his failure to spot Diego Maradona punching a goal-bound shot off the line during the USSR&apos;s 1990 World Cup match with Argentina that one of them, Nikita Simonya, told reporters: &quot;If Fredriksson had any morality, he should pack his bags, burn his referee&apos;s licence and leave football for ever.&quot;  The evil that befalls European Cup final referees does not confine itself to football matters, either. The referee of the first final was England&apos;s Arthur Ellis. Ellis was widely regarded as a paragon of British fair play and regularly flew to South America to take charge of volatile derby matches. A brewery rep by trade, Ellis was well known and much praised for his man management skills. Once, when the irate Liverpool manager, Bob Paisley, threatened to take Ellis outside and &quot;part your hair&quot; (an ancient County Durham expression denoting a sound thrashing), Ellis reached into his top pocket, pulled out a comb and said: &quot;There you are, Bob. You can do it right here.&quot; Laughter ensued and the crisis passed.  Yet Ellis&apos;s enviable reputation did not prevent him falling foul of the Champions&apos; Cup final curse, for what else could explain the fact that a man of such international renown ended up spending 18 years exchanging banter with Eddie Waring on It&apos;s A Knockout? The Dutchman Leo Horn was made of the right stuff. A black belt in judo, he had fought in the Dutch resistance in the second world war, alongside the father of a future Holland star, Ruud Kroll. Horn took charge of the Champions&apos; Cup finals of 1957 and 1962. In the latter, at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, he made a notable contribution to the history of match officialdom when he reacted to Ferenc Puskas&apos; furious appeals for a penalty by hurling his whistle at the Hungarian legend, striking him on the ear. An angry Puskas picked the whistle up and threw it into the crowd. Luckily Horn had a spare in his top pocket. But even a man cut from such admirable cloth could not cheat the curse. A textile manufacturer by trade, he was declared bankrupt in 1994. Perhaps the most cautionary tale of all, though, involves Concetto Lo Bello. Handsome and flamboyant, as befits a man whose name means &quot;Conceived the Beautiful&quot;, the Sicilian took charge of the 1968 and 1970 finals. He later went into politics as a Christian Democrat and was elected mayor of Syracuse. Alas, he was in office for only five months before being ousted. As if this alone were not proof of the malign influence of the European Cup final, Lo Bello had to live with the knowledge that his career was the inspiration for the 1974 soft-porn movie L&apos;Arbitro, starring Joan Collins.

By 9am, the beach will be deserted again, but at first light it will be busy, the last revellers of the night before scattered amid the many who come here, day in, day out, to surf or swim or walk. It&apos;s impossible in the early morning light not to be awed by the place. Or to glimpse something of the private world that is often obscured in the press of the afternoon crowds, some sense of why for so many Sydneysiders, Bondi is more than just a place to live, it is a way of life, a way of being. It&apos;s an idea, that half-mythical, half-remembered place of adolescent escape, of the long summer day, with its rolling surf and glaring sand, their peculiarly potent association of heat and salt and sexual possibility.  The name Bondi is Aboriginal in origin, a derivation of &quot;Boondi&quot;, which is traditionally assumed to have meant &quot;the sound of falling water&quot; in the local language. But like much about the Aboriginal tribes that once populated Sydney even this is uncertain, and other sources suggest it might also have meant &quot;a place where a fight with nullas (Aboriginal clubs) took place&quot;.  Today&apos;s Bondi owes more to the real estate boom that began in the 1990s. Before that, while still a popular destination, the suburb itself was decidedly down at heel, a mish-mash of rundown flats and rambling houses occupied by the area&apos;s traditional working class population, students, surfies and the various layers of migration that have transformed the area since the second world war, in particular the influx of Jewish refugees after the war (Bondi still has one of Sydney&apos;s largest Jewish communities, including a sizable Orthodox community, as its many kosher establishments and synagogues attest). Through the 1990s and into the 21st century the influx of money has changed the area, both for the better and the worse, driving the development of some of Sydney&apos;s best restaurants and cafes. It&apos;s possible this aspect of Bondi is largely lost on tourists, most of whom rarely venture further than the fairly grim takeaways of Campbell Parade, which is a pity, because Bondi offers some of Sydney&apos;s best restaurants, not least Robert Marchetti&apos;s Mediterranean-inspired menu at Icebergs Dining Room and Bar (1 Notts Avenue, idrb.com), situated at the bay&apos;s southern end. Taking its name from the winter swimming club which meets in the pool downstairs, whose members swim every Sunday morning from May to September, Icebergs is blessed with one of best views in Sydney (if the restaurant seems a little pricey it&apos;s always possible to adjourn downstairs to the bistro, which has the same view for half the price, or for a different perspective entirely, to relocate to Icebergs&apos; more garrulous outpost, North Bondi Italian (120 Ramsgate Avenue) at the beach&apos;s northern end. Less formal options include the woodfired pizza and home-made gelati of Pompei (126 Roscoe Street) or its neighbour, a perennial favourite of the area&apos;s growing South African community, Hurricane&apos;s Grill and Bar (130 Roscoe Street, hurricanesgrill.com.au), while locals in search of coffee congregate at Jed&apos;s Food Store (60 Warners Avenue) or Luigi&apos;s Delicatessen (154 Glenayr Street), or, at the beach&apos;s northern end at Aqua Bar (266 Campbell Parade) or the Bondi Kiosk right next door. Organic and vegetarian options are available in the excellent cafe attached to Earth Food Store (81a Gould Street, earthfoodstore.com.au).  The last year or two has seen the beginning of what may be the end for Bondi&apos;s current renaissance. Rapidly rising rents are placing increasing pressure on many of the younger generation who call Bondi home, driving the sort of demographic shift that has already altered the character of inner-city areas such as Surry Hills and Darlinghurst. Yet it seems hard to believe that even if Bondi were to become another suburb filled with lawyers and stockbrokers it would entirely lose its character. For in the end it is the beach that makes it what it is, and no matter how the suburb changes, the beach will stay the same.James Bradley \u00b7 Ravesis (0061 2 9365 4422, ravesis.com.au), a hotel/restaurant/bar/has 12 rooms overlooking the beach from \u00a3120.

Los Lances Beach, Spain Ten minutes from Tarifa on the southern tip of Spain&apos;s Costa de la Luz, Playa de Los Lances is a 3km stretch of beach stretching west from the town&apos;s outskirts. As the beach reaches the sand dunes at Punta Paloma, the Hotel Arte Vida&apos;s terrace and chill-out bar emerges beyond the camber. Restaurant favourites include fresh tuna carpaccio and grilled daily catch, but the bar is the big attraction, coaxing scores of sunbathers and kiteboarders from the beach as the sun sets. And once the party is over, each of the hotel&apos;s simple but stylish rooms opens on to a veranda facing the sea - an ideal spot for a nightcap. \u00b7 hotelartevidatarifa.com, doubles from \u20ac100pn over the summer. Fly to Cadiz or Malaga. Bloemendaal, Holland On hot summer days in Amsterdam, flocks of beautiful monied types flee the city centre for their retreats in Bloemendaal aan Zee, the wealthiest town in Holland, 30km from the capital. The savvy clubber will follow them, even if this means having to catch the bus. By night, a handful of discerning bars and clubs on Bloemendaal beach ratchet up the music from daytime chill-out to thumping house and disco, completing a money-plus-music scene that has been dubbed the &quot;Ibiza of the Netherlands&quot;. Favourites include the wooden terrace at Bloomingdale (bloomingdaleaanzee.com) and the bohemian, south-east Asian vibe at Republiek (republiekbloemendaal.nl). \u00b7 Bloemendaal has no hotels, but De Lakens campsite (kdc.nu) is a few metres from the beach. There are plenty of hotels in Zandvoort (hotels.nl/zandvoort), 3km to the south. Train to Amsterdam. Bacoli, Italy Fifteen minutes from the bustle of Naples, the beach at Bacoli undertakes a yearly transformation at the beginning of May when it becomes destination of choice for the Italian clubberati. The exact date is dependent on when Nabilah (nabilah.it), the beachfront club, decides to open for the season. This year, the party started three weeks ago, when their trademark white decking was rolled out on to the large wooden terrace on the sand, overlooking the Gulf of Pozzuoli. The grill is fired up as the sun sets and the cocktail waiters crank into action. As the evening progresses, DJs set up on booths constructed on the sand, beckoning guests on to the beach. \u00b7 Portalba 33 (portalba33.it) in Naples has doubles from \u20ac150. Fly to Naples. Baltic Beach Party, Latvia The Baltic Beach Party at Liepaja on the Latvian coast is something of a monster. More than 40,000 revellers from across the Baltic states descend on the beach for two days of dancing in the sand, with hundreds of acts stretched across five stages and interspersed with football tournaments, fashion shows and, ahem, bikini contests. While beach parties conjure images of Ibiza-style electro and house, this beach fest has a distinctively guitar-driven vibe, meaning the average punter is more likely to be a beach bum/surfer dude than part of the immaculately coiffured, super-sized sunnies crew. \u00b7 July 25-6, beachparty.lv, camping available on site. Fly to Riga with ryanair.com. Cascais, Portugal With a sizeable Brazilian population, it is unsurprising that Cascais, an hour from Lisbon on the Portuguese coast, knows how to party. Guincho beach is one of the more lively night-time options, where the action is focused on the Guincho Bar, where parties spill on to the sand. For those on a budget, there are two superb hostels nearby, both with private options. The apartment in the Sintra National Park belonging to the brand new Guincho Surf Beachostel sleeps up to eight for \u20ac850 per week during peak season, and is minutes from the beach. \u00b7 guinchosurfbeachostel.com. Fly to Lisbon. Praia Mole, Brazil There are 42 beaches on Florian\u00f3polis, a beautiful island an hour&apos;s flight from S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio. Among their number, Praia Mole - a 20-minute cycle from the lakeside town of Lagoa de Concei\u00e7\u00e3o - is the most excitable, lined with dozens of caipirinha-soaked beach bars and restaurants that hum with samba and reggae. Flanked by two superb left-handers the beach is something of a mecca for local surfers, but the flirting on the sand can be just as active - Praia Mole has a reputation for attracting the most beautiful boys and girls in Brazil.  \u00b7 The Praia Mole Eco Village (praiamole.com.br) has doubles from \u00a370.

Water Taxi Beach, New York Harry&apos;s restaurant and bar, neighbouring the Hunters Point ferry stop on Long Island, is surely one of the world&apos;s most obscure destinations for a beach. But 400 tonnes of New Jersey sand has been transplanted on to a wharf overlooking the East River with spectacular views of midtown Manhattan across the water. OK, you can&apos;t actually swim here, but the crowd is game for the illusion, playing volleyball in their swimwear as the barstaff churn out cocktails and cold beers. Over the weekends, top DJs turn up after the kids have been whisked home, pushing the entertainment into the wee hours. \u00b7 watertaxibeach.com.

Taganga, Colombia Backpackers have been flocking to the remote village of Taganga, on Colombia&apos;s stunning Caribbean coast, for years, drawn by its reputation for excitable nocturnal activity and some of the cheapest diving courses in the world. Until recently, accommodation has been a little rough around the edges, but with the arrival of the Ballena Azul, a gorgeous French/Colombian-owned guesthouse with 33 open-plan rooms with ocean views, things are beginning to change. Getting to Taganga is half the fun; taking a scenic, winding coastal road from the bustling city of Santa Marta, through the rainforest ans awsome beaches of Tayrona national park, you pass some of the country&apos;s most idyllic, lesser-visited coastline. \u00b7 Book the Ballena Azul through Journey Latin America (journeylatinamerica.com).

But it&apos;s a good one - the Brighton beach party spiritual leader himself, Fatboy Slim. Previous summer events hosted by Mr Slim in his home town have been out of control, attracting crowds of more than 200,000, but strict measures are being put in place by the local council to ensure that numbers are limited to 22,000 per night. Little information has been released so far, but the event is likely to be hugely popular.

The office was deserted, with just one person, from the accounts department, to take delivery of the great man&apos;s work. When Chesterton produced from his bag not only his corrected pages but a bottle of port and a glass, the terrified clerk confessed he was teetotal. &apos;Good heavens,&apos; Chesterton squeaked in dismay. &apos;Give me back my proofs!&apos; When I joined The Observer in 1996, the world of books was in limbo between hot metal and cool word processing, but it would have been recognisable to many of our past contributors, from George Orwell and Cyril Connolly, to Anthony Burgess and Clive James. Everything smelled of the lamp. It was a world of ink and paper; of cigarettes, coffee and strong drink. Our distinguished critic George Steiner used to submit his copy in annotated typescript. The business end of books - WH Smith, Dillons and Waterstone&apos;s - was run by anonymous men in suits whose judgments were largely ignored. Trade was trade. Literature was another calling. The atmosphere was dingy, time-hallowed and faintly collegiate. Every October, we all got together in the Guildhall and gave a cheque to the novelist of the year. In 1996, the winner of the Booker Prize was Last Orders by Graham Swift. Now that world is more or less extinct. Many of the great names from those times (Hughes, Murdoch, Mailer, Heller, Gunn, Miller, Vonnegut) are gone. Books, meanwhile, have been pushed to the edge of the radar. A series of small but significant insurrections has placed the language and habits of the market at the heart of every literary transaction. The world of books and writing has been turned inside out by the biggest revolution since William Caxton set up his printing shop in the precincts of Westminster Abbey. Heaven or hell? It&apos;s too soon to say. This is a story whose outcome remains mysterious. There&apos;s no doubt that this transitional decade from the 20th to the 21st century has been decisive, but no one knows when or how it will end. One thing is certain: the appetite for print is growing. In 1996, there were between 60,000 and 100,000 new titles in the UK each year. By 2007, it was pushing 200,000. That&apos;s the biggest annual output of any country in the Western world, turning over some \u00a34bn a year. All this has been fuelled by an explosive mixture of global commerce and technology. In simple terms, you could say that Amazon plus Microsoft equals a new literary stratosphere. Two things complicate this equation. First, despite the steady evolution from typesetting to digitisation, the printed book has held out against electronic options. It is as if, after lift-off, the Apollo mission turned out to be not a space capsule but a Spitfire. Second, it remains the paradox of the world wide web and the global economy that, while this has been the decade in which millions have found a voice through the internet, only a minority has discovered an audience. Self-expression has been democratised, but books and writers still face that age-old struggle to achieve a readership. How they do that remains a mystery, but in the alchemy of literary success, &apos;word of mouth&apos; remains essential. At the turn of the millennium, this concept was given a brilliant new spin by a young Canadian journalist, Malcolm Gladwell. The Tipping Point was almost a flop. It was published to mixed reviews in the US, did no serious business in the UK and was saved by - yes - word of mouth. After a dismal launch, and as a desperate last resort, Gladwell persuaded his American publisher to sponsor a US-wide lecture tour. Only then did the book &apos;tip&apos;. Eventually, it would become a literary success of its time, turn its author into a pop cultural guru and spend seven years on the New York Times bestseller list. This was one of those pivotal moments that illustrates the story of this decade. People will argue about the decisive milestones (I have come up with my own 10, which I have set out in chapters), but there will be general agreement that, in Britain, a decade of change starts with the election of New Labour in 1997. That was also the year Random House launched its website, John Updike published a short story online and Vintage started a series of reading guides to encourage new book clubs. As well as new readers, the millennium saw the emergence of a new literary generation, writers born in the Sixties and Seventies, and few of them more fascinating than Zadie Smith... Chapter 1: New Blood: Zadie Smith The author of White Teeth was first noticed in 1997 when she landed an unheard-of advance, rumoured to be \u00a3250,000, for her work-in-progress. Such hype was dangerous. When publication came in 2000, there were plenty of envious critics to pronounce her book dead on arrival, as they had done to so many precocious talents in the past. But White Teeth was exhilaratingly and distinctively new. In his review for The Observer, Caryl Phillips declared that her &apos;wit, her breadth of vision and her ambition are of her own making&apos;. With worldwide sales of more than 2 million, White Teeth won success that was sustained by a new global market. The effect was almost instantaneous. In London, Sydney, Delhi and New York, publishers were now on the alert for &apos;the next Zadie Smith&apos;, a new generation of writers - Hari Kunzru, Monica Ali, Kiran Desai, Peter Ho Davies and Ali Smith among them - who would replace Ackroyd, Rushdie, Swift and Seth. These new faces represented a global culture. The revolution in the marketplace was global, too. It can be expressed in one word: Amazon... Chapter 2: Amazon In the excitement of the dotcom boom, from which Amazon (launched in 1995) emerged as a fortunate survivor, the most visible symbol of change was a marriage between the 600-year-old printed book and the high-tech world of online selling. At first, it seemed like a marginal enterprise: in 1996, Amazon sold just $16m worth of books to 180,000 customers. By 2007, sales had soared to $3.58bn in 200 countries. On one single day, 10 December 2007, Amazon customers ordered 5.4 million items. Without Amazon, there would have been no &apos;long tail&apos;, no &apos;online bookselling&apos; and no Richard &amp; Judy Book Club. The club&apos;s executive producer, Amanda Ross - identified by an Observer poll as the most powerful figure in the British book world - says it was Amazon&apos;s rankings that provided the essential data for &apos;doing books&apos; on TV. &apos;When we started,&apos; she remembers, &apos;we used to plug into Amazon before and after the show. We could see at once that people were watching and then buying the books we&apos;d featured.&apos; Ross&apos;s company, Cactus, was influenced by the example of Oprah Winfrey in the US, but she says: &apos;We were doing something rather different. Oprah was sycophantic towards the author. We didn&apos;t want to have the author anywhere near the studio. We wanted to have a proper chat about books. And we used celebrities because we didn&apos;t want to intimidate the viewer.&apos; Amazon was indispensable to this process. Across the English-speaking world, it did one simple thing, with profound consequences: it united the market. Previously, new editions of books had been confined to territories like &apos;North America&apos;, &apos;Australasia&apos; or &apos;the West Indies&apos;. Now books could be accessed by and sold to customers across the world. Where once books travelled from the publisher&apos;s warehouse to the consumer at the speed of a Dickens stagecoach, now two or three days was the norm. Almost as revolutionary, Amazon, and its imitators, put the customer first. New writers who found a readership in the global marketplace began to command substantial advances. By the end of the 1990s, a new generation of market-savvy literary entrepreneurs was beginning to emerge. A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (2000) by Dave Eggers was one of the first titles to benefit from this new global English audience. Hari Kunzru netted about \u00a31.25m from international sales of The Impressionist (2002) and Nick Hornby endured all kinds of envious commentary for an advance of \u00a32m from Penguin. Several other bestselling writers wisely kept their earnings to themselves, but the headline news, never fully reported, was that, at the top end, the book trade was now bestowing extraordinary riches on a privileged and talented few. Money (too much of it) also cursed the launch of Londonstani by Gautam Malkani and Richard Mason&apos;s The Drowning People. Nobel laureate Doris Lessing has been one of the few writers secure enough to speak out against the aggressive marketing of young quasi-celebrity authors. She observed recently: &apos;If you&apos;re a girl who&apos;s good-looking and has written even a passable book, you can be earning enormous sums very quickly and are then sent on a promotional tour.&apos; This, says Lessing, is the worst possible thing for a young writer because it denies them the all-important environment of the &apos;empty space&apos; in which to write. Such a market-driven process makes the young writer a hostage to the book trade, reversing the traditional flow of influence between artist and merchant. There are, of course, any number of counter-examples. One writer, who found plenty of empty space to develop her vision, and who would eventually hold the world&apos;s book trade in the palm of her manicured hand, was a children&apos;s book writer named Jo Rowling... Chapter 3: JK Rowling I began to grasp the true dimensions of the Harry Potter phenomenon on the morning of 8 July 2000. Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone had been published - a good lesson this - with a tiny first printing of 500 in 1997, to modest but enthusiastic reviews, swiftly followed by Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Such was the word-of-mouth success of the series that Bloomsbury took the unusual step of releasing the new book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, to the literary media at 6am on a Saturday morning. As I drove at dawn to Bloomsbury&apos;s central London offices for my copy, I passed an extraordinary sight. Snaking down the pavement outside Hatchards on Piccadilly was a long line of Harry Potter fans, all waiting to devour the latest 636 pages of Harry Potter. This was not driven by celebrity hype or massive discounting (this was Hatchards, not Asda) or bestsellerism, but by readers&apos; passionate desire to get the next instalment. Just as ardent Dickens fans in New York were said to have greeted transatlantic vessels with: &apos;How is Little Nell?&apos;, so the queue in Piccadilly was animated by the same question: &apos;What will happen next?&apos; Rowling never failed to grasp that her job was to tell a story. In the countdown to the launch of the final volume, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, one London bookshop teased its readers with a huge window display: How Will It End? My feeling, as I wrote in the summer of 2000, remains that this was &apos;a commercial blockbuster with knobs on, storytelling of a high order but not to be spoken of in the same breath as CS Lewis. Not that Rowling will give two snitches: she will be laughing all the way to the bank.&apos; Indeed she did. Ms Rowling has now sold some 400 million copies of her books and is worth \u00a3545m. By nice coincidence, the story of the public-school boy with magical powers came to a close in the same month that Tony Blair stepped down from his premiership. Occasionally, the pressures of this new market for books, and its concomitant vulgarisation, would inspire a protest, but such moments were rare. In 2001, American novelist Jonathan Franzen staged a highly significant freak-out... Chapter 4: The Corrections Jonathan Franzen, who had laboured in near-destitute obscurity throughout the Nineties, spoilt his publisher&apos;s lunch by refusing to allow The Corrections, his &apos;sweeping account of a dysfunctional American family&apos; and the surprise literary bestseller of the stricken 9/11 season, to be selected for Oprah&apos;s Book Club. What Franzen objected to, as he had every right to do, was that in order to join &apos;Oprah&apos;s authors&apos;, a rollcall that included Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, he had to allow the chat-show queen to label The Corrections with her garish orange book club logo, a promotional vehicle, he said, for &apos;schmaltzy, one-dimensional novels&apos;. Franzen&apos;s artistic soul would not permit this. &apos;I see this book as my creation and I didn&apos;t want that logo of corporate ownership on it,&apos; he was reported to have said, presumably overlooking that the logo of his distinguished American publisher (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) already identified his book as part of the Holtzbrinck corporate empire. Just in case his message had been misunderstood, and as a further assertion of the disintegrating old-school claim that highbrow and popular culture are mutually exclusive, he added: &apos;I feel like I&apos;m solidly in the high-art literary tradition.&apos; To this, Ms Winfrey responded by swiftly disinviting him from her club. The Franzen episode illustrates the paradox of this decade that the more golden the opportunities available to the book, the more marginal, even vulnerable, it has seemed to become. Despite, or perhaps because of, this market transformation, the common reader, and many authors, have not been grateful. An oddity of this New Labour book boom is that it has left many readers querulous and unsatisfied. Like many cultural phenomena, this is partly real, partly an illusion. Behind the brilliant fa\u00e7ade of new technology, new money, and new markets, there has indeed been a massive interior renovation in the house of books: senior editors taking early retirement, small imprints selling up, little magazines folding, middle-aged writers giving up and corner bookshops closing down countrywide. At the same time, introspective, old-style bookishness has been replaced by another icon of these times - the literary festival... Chapter 5: Festivals When Peter Florence and his father, Norman, enthusiastic provincial bibliomanes, launched the first Hay-on-Wye literary festival in 1988, the experience offered to the public was distinctly unpromising. A wet weekend in Wales? A town devoid of acceptable hotels and restaurants? A marquee in a muddy field? But against the odds, Hay flourished. The punters came. The writers had a good time. Slowly the idea took off. Hay&apos;s tipping point came in 2001 with the visit of ex-US President Bill Clinton. With his genius for infectious slogans, Clinton declared Hay &apos;the Woodstock of the mind&apos;. Exactly! After Clinton&apos;s barnstorming visit (who could ever forget the way he worked the crowd?), literary festivals became the new rock&apos;n&apos;roll. Soon, there was hardly a town in Britain that did not hold some kind of literary festival. Traditionally, the special joy of the book was that you communed with it in the one place that no one else can trespass: your head. Only poets and playwrights were expected to celebrate their art in public. With a few exceptions, like Dickens, writers of novels stayed at their desks, their proper domain, in the world of the imagination. Not any more. The novelist had become a cross between a commercial traveller, a rock musician and a jobbing preacher. What did it signify? The cultural historians of the future will surely pick over the larger meaning of this festival fever but one thing was indisputable: in just over a generation, the novel had gone public in the most astounding way. Even the Booker Prize, symbol of tradition and continuity in the literary world, surrendered to the new mood and found a typically 21st-century sponsor, the Man Group, a Canadian venture capital company. After 2001, prizes joined festivals at the cutting edge of literary life.... Chapter 6: Prizes In 2002, exhilarated by the Man Group&apos;s new money and grandiose cultural ambitions, the Booker administrators moved the prize-giving dinner from the Guildhall to the British Museum and appointed the witty and provocative Lisa Jardine as the chair. Professor Jardine immediately set the tone by declaring that the shortlist for 2002 marked &apos;the beginning of a new era&apos;. Promisingly, for those who had grown weary of Booker fiction, some of her fellow judges then waded in with snappy comments about the novels they had been required to read. &apos;It&apos;s like a formula,&apos; complained David Baddiel. &apos;They attempt to grab a big theme, and have a vulgar, obvious seriousness, even a kind of pompous pretentiousness, about them.&apos; Way to go! We hadn&apos;t heard this kind of talk since John Berger donated his prize money (for his novel G) to the Black Panthers. Next, in another defining moment of literary prize marketing, Jardine took her panel for an impromptu ride on the London Eye (ostensibly to settle a dispute about the plausibility of a scene from Howard Jacobson&apos;s novel Who&apos;s Sorry Now?). It would be hard to imagine previous panellists - for instance Philip Larkin, Penelope Fitzgerald or Cyril Connolly - submitting to such a jape. But the Man Group wanted a marketable prize and this Jardine delivered with merry zeal. She also steered her committee to choose a novel, The Life of Pi by Yann Martel, that the reading public actually enjoyed (it remains the favourite with Booker&apos;s reading public). Book prizes, notably Orange, Whitbread (rebranded as Costa) and Samuel Johnson, now began to play a new and important role, one previously played by reviews. In 2008, the literary prize has become one of the most reliable guides to the literary maze, a map to the perplexing contours of the book landscape. Kate Mosse, founder of the remarkable Orange Prize, says: &apos;Prizes, far more than star reviews, are what make books succeed now and it&apos;s also prizes that give readers the confidence to trust a new writer.&apos; For example, Anthony Cheetham of Quercus Publishing reports that when Stef Penney&apos;s The Tenderness of Wolves won the 2006 Costa Prize, her sales jumped from about 40,000 to 400,000 copies. So all-consuming were these upheavals in the book world that few paid attention to that other great crisis of these years, the Iraq War. In literary terms, this was the dog that did not bark. True, there have been many volumes of reportage from Baghdad (notably George Packer&apos;s The Assassins&apos; Gate). But as far as I am aware, and in stark contrast to the many novels inspired by 9/11), only one novelist has been moved to tackle the subject of Iraq, achieving a high-low cultural response derived partly from his own anguished reaction to the war. If there was one writer whose popular success typifies this decade, it is Ian McEwan... Chapter 7: Ian Mcewan Saturday is probably not McEwan&apos;s best book and comes some way down a list that includes Atonement, The Child in Time, The Innocent and Amsterdam. Nevertheless, when it was published in 2005, Saturday enjoyed the kind of success that can only be explained by this new worldwide market for English literature. After its first week of publication, Saturday was doing so well that it actually became a news item on the ITN evening news. The conventional reviews had been far from ecstatic but there it was, piled up in the supermarkets and reported on commercial television. The day a British novel by a &apos;literary novelist&apos; became a TV news item was certainly one of the moments of this decade. Although the new millennium had seen the changing of the guard, McEwan was a canny survivor whose command of the market was sustained by the film of Atonement and then by his novella On Chesil Beach, shortlisted for the 2007 Booker Prize. Even so, in the new marketplace, literary fiction still had its limits. This was dramatically demonstrated when On Chesil Beach, together with the entire Booker Prize shortlist, was outsold by Crystal, a ghosted novel marketed under the brand name Katie Price, formerly the model Jordan. Last month, another book by Katie Price appeared as a contender at the British Book Awards, producing a frisson of anxiety in some literary quarters. Tracy Chevalier was &apos;shocked&apos;. Robert Harris described the affair as &apos;emblematic of the tacky culture we live in&apos;. Had the market gone too far? What did it say about British culture that a ghosted children&apos;s book should be considered for a literary prize? Actually, it was just the market flexing its muscles. The crisis in confidence among some cultural gatekeepers was revealing. After a decade of change, many of the old, elite signposts through the contemporary jungle of books and writing had become smothered in a profusion of comment, from blogs to book clubs. It became harder and harder to achieve a serious-minded consensus. The dictates of commerce seemed to threaten the traditional authority of the critic. Could it be that booksellers were now more important than reviewers...? Chapter 8 Blogs Vs Reviewing If you believe, as I do, that Britain still sustains a vigorous and independent literary culture, look at America. The omens are not encouraging. American democratic instincts have transformed its literary landscape as surely as its colossal market has revolutionised bookselling. Anyone can review books - and now, in America, everyone does. Book blogs such as emergingwriters.typepad.com, maudnewton.com and syntaxofthings.typepad.com now have such power and influence that a publisher&apos;s editor in Manhattan is likely to advise a new novelist not that they will be reviewed in the New York Times but that they will be covered on curledup.com. This, according to Trish Todd of Simon &amp; Schuster, &apos;is the wave of the future&apos;. Occasionally, in the past year, this wave has threatened to sweep away many of the old landmarks on the coast of literature. In California, the LA Times merged its stand-alone book review section into a &apos;comment&apos; supplement, while the San Francisco Chronicle&apos;s book review shrank from six to four pages. But the news that hit the headlines and inspired widespread head-shaking was the decision by the Georgian daily newspaper Atlanta Journal-Constitution to abolish its books editor. Howls of pain reverberated across the States. The New York Times, which still publishes an excellent books section, noted mischievously that a certain Dan Wickett, a former quality-control manager for a car-parts manufacturer, was now singlehandedly writing &apos;half as many reviews as appeared in all of the books pages of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution&apos;. Readers had been posting reviews on Amazon for year. Now these book blogs - in Britain, for example, a highly responsible site like Vulpes Libris - could take over and hand the power back to - time honoured term - the Common Reader. My view is that the Common Reader generates more heat than light. On closer scrutiny, we find that this creature, as fabled as the hippogriff, is just as uncertain as everyone else. The equation of Amazon plus Microsoft has left the Common Reader dazed and confused. How else to explain the extraordinary success in 2003 of Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves...? Chapter 9: Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves A little book with a fearsome subtitle - The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation - Lynne Truss&apos;s plea for proper English usage touched a nerve. Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves spoke to an anxiety about usage and standards in an age of cultural upheaval. Perhaps you can&apos;t police the internet but at least you could take a stand on the sanctity of the Oxford comma. Truss&apos;s little book (scarcely 200 pages) was a statement of defiance in a complex and troubling cultural landscape. Here, the new global market played its part. Word of mouth on a worldwide scale made Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves a bestseller in Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. With such numbers in so many parts of the globe, now intimately linked via the world wide web, had the time not come for the printed word to be available in electronic form...? Chapter 10: The Kindle There have been many false dawns in the new world of digital publishing, but this spring can make a good claim to have witnessed the tipping point in the innovative commercial development of e-reading. While the market expanded, and more and more readers were enfranchised by the English language, the technology was racing to keep up. In November 2007, these two forces finally converged with the American launch of the Kindle, the first electronic book to capture the imagination of professional readers - the publishers and literary agents. The Kindle, in direct competition with the Sony Reader, is a handheld, wireless reading device that can hold all manner of digital material, ranging from PDF files containing unpublished manuscripts to the complete works of Marcel Proust. The Kindle is the brainchild of Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, a man who has already made one fortune from global online bookselling. It has many of the features of its e-book predecessor, the Sony Reader. But what sets the Kindle apart is one new feature: wireless connectivity via a system called Whispernet. As a result, says Bezos: &apos;This isn&apos;t a device, it&apos;s a service.&apos; Here, with the actual marriage of Amazon with the world of internet technology, a reckoning seemed finally to be due. Was it not time to say Goodbye Gutenberg? Were we now about to see that long-predicted &apos;iPod moment&apos; for books, the moment when the new technology finally swept six centuries of ink and paper aside in the low electronic hum of integrated microchips. For five years and more, there had been a steady trend towards the digitisation of the world&apos;s copyright material, pioneered by the Google Print Initiative. To Google&apos;s alliance with some of the world&apos;s greatest libraries, including the Bodleian, all the major publishers had responded by digitising their back lists. There were protests and baleful warnings about &apos;intellectual property rights&apos;, but almost everyone had begun to anticipate the day when a workable e-book would arrive. You know the game is up for traditional publishing when the CEO of Random House delivers a lecture entitled &apos;New Chapter or Last Page? Publishing Books in a Digital Age.&apos; On 11 March this year, Gail Rebuck declared: &apos;Digitisation is here and books will never be the same again. Digitisation frees books to reach new audiences in new ways. Books used to furnish a room,&apos; she joked. &apos;Now they will furnish a virtual world. The e-book is here and its impact will be far-reaching.&apos; She was, at times, even blithe in the face of change: &apos;We are not concerned,&apos; she said, &apos;as long as you want to read it, we are happy to supply books in whatever form you like...&apos; No, said Rebuck, this was not a threat - not the end of civilisation - but a wonderful opportunity. Rebuck&apos;s message, now widely shared, is that the Kindle and its e-book competitors will not kill the book but happily co-exist with it in a bright new bi-literary environment. Richard Charkin of Bloomsbury concurs. He says: &apos;There will continue to be a market for printed books for a very long time. I believe the bulk of people will still prefer to hold, feel, treasure, give, receive, display and read a printed book.&apos; Tellingly, Charkin adds: &apos;Unlike CDs, I do not think books will be displaced by downloads.&apos; The &apos;iPod moment&apos; in the book world, so often postponed, is expected to happen this year, probably in the autumn. It&apos;s an awesome prospect. John Naughton, The Observer&apos;s veteran internet correspondent, has calculated that &apos;the indexed part [of the world wide web] hovers at around 40 billion pages&apos; while the so-called &apos;deep web&apos;, hidden from search engines, is between 400 and 750 times bigger than that. Universal access to this virtual library, and electronic browsing through its myriad files, will be an enthralling prospect in the immediate future. Charkin says: &apos;There will be continuing competition for leisure time. Publishers will have to make books even more desirable as objects. If we do so, there will continue to be a thriving market for great printed novels.&apos; Readers and writers may now experience the liberation of literature in ways that Caxton never dreamed of. The word, written and spoken, remains at the heart of our culture, but it&apos;s no longer watched by a Praetorian Guard of elite gatekeepers. It has been handed back whence it came, from the few to the many. This, perhaps, explains the paradox that despite more book activity than ever, the book itself seems less central than before. Actually, what I have described are the birth pangs of a golden age. The market for the printed book is now global; the opportunities for the digital book are almost unimaginable. To be a writer in the English language today is to be one of the luckiest people alive.", "sentences": ["If there was one writer whose popular success typifies this decade, it is Ian McEwan...

My date was with Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the young Mexican whose vocal ardour and dramatic intensity have singled him out as the successor to the venerable Placido Domingo; at the appointed time, a dinosaur turned up. No, not some lumbering relic of an extinct species like Pavarotti, but an actual saurian, admittedly made of plastic. Through the door poked the head of a triceratops, its jaws grinning as it chomped on a furry teddy bear. While it ate, the head emitted a jungly, rumbling growl. When the mask came off, I recognised Villaz\u00f3n, a madcap jester who has eyes like burning coals, eyebrows like scorched earth and hair that looks as if it might have been twisted into curls by red-hot tongs. He had spent the day rehearsing the Hamlet-like title role in Verdi&apos;s Don Carlos, the most eagerly awaited new production of the Royal Opera&apos;s season, sold out months in advance; that, he said, explained his impersonation of a prehistoric beast. &apos;Ah yes, it is the director&apos;s concept. Nicholas Hytner is setting the opera in Jurassic Park, not 16th-century Spain. Interesting, no?&apos; Then a wild burst of laughter jolted him. &apos;OK, I am joking, I tell you why I wear this. It is because the fans stop me everywhere in the street wanting autographs and this frightens them away!&apos; Another fit of giggles followed, after which, on his third try, Villaz\u00f3n, who siphons off surplus energy by clowning and spends his spare time scribbling caricatures, let slip the dull, domestic truth. He had picked up the mask at a novelty shop in Covent Garden and was taking it home as a bedtime present for one of his young sons. Before the dinosaur unmasked, I noticed that it was carrying a thick paperback. Most tenors have resonance cavities where their brains should be, but Villaz\u00f3n is a great reader and was immersed in The Goose Man, an untranslated novel by German expressionist Jakob Wassermann, which describes the travails of a misunderstood composer. The two accessories sum up his complexity: a child&apos;s mask on his head, an adult&apos;s weighty, frowningly obscure book in his hand. Villaz\u00f3n claims that novels help him to flesh out the inner lives of the sometimes vacuous operatic characters he has to embody. &apos;In books I discover the real human beings,&apos; he said in 2006. &apos;In life, you often meet only the masks.&apos; I met the mask first. But the face underneath the dinosaur&apos;s head is another kind of mask, elasticised when Villaz\u00f3n laughs or torn apart by anguish as he surrenders to the rage of Alfredo in La traviata and the sobbing misery of Rodolfo in La boh\u00e8me. When he sings, his head sometimes seems to disappear altogether, engulfed by a mouth that opens preternaturally wide to let out what he calls &apos;the cry of the unconscious - a continuous primal scream&apos;. I had seen the layered disguises. Would I discover the real human being? The task, I found, was like trying to catch a whirlwind. Unstoppably loquacious in several languages and physically restless to the point of frenzy, Villaz\u00f3n is a self-transformer. His slim body and his thin skin are the cage for a menagerie of creatures as feral as that triceratops: a predatory libertine like the Duke in Verdi&apos;s Rigoletto, a crazed stalker like Don Jos\u00e9 in Bizet&apos;s Carmen, a morbid narcissist like the poet Lensky in Tchaikovsky&apos;s Eugene Onegin. The man who lets these alter egos inhabit him, and who voices their neuroses with such eloquence, must sometimes wonder who he actually is. Last summer, overcome by just that anxiety, Villaz\u00f3n cancelled his engagements for five months and retired to an island off the coast of Spain to brood about the forced pace of his career and the emotional self-expenditure it entailed. &apos;It was,&apos; he told me, &apos;a physical and vocal collapse. Just before it happened, it was not me performing, it was my reflection. Somehow I wasn&apos;t there. My voice is a horse and it wanted to be ridden by a man, not a reflection.&apos; He then treated that voice to a little exercise in mythological metamorphosis, extra evidence of his flair for changing himself. &apos;When it goes well, the man and the voice are one, like Centaur. And when it goes really well, the horse becomes Pegasus - he flies!&apos; His arms raked the air in anticipation of take-off; Villaz\u00f3n always seems on the point of going through the roof. He is, conveniently enough, married to a psychologist and also has a trusted shrink in Mexico, whom he consults every week by telephone. He has often toyed with the idea of rounding up the operatic characters that are his multiple, optional selves and banging their heads together in a session of group therapy. The medical analogy breaks down, however, because opera is a sickness from which Villaz\u00f3n doesn&apos;t want to be cured. &apos;That&apos;s right, the theatre is not a doctor&apos;s office,&apos; he said. &apos;The stage is a playground - a macabre playground, because it&apos;s where you set fantasies free, where the demons dance around like ghosts on the Day of the Dead in Mexico.&apos; Villaz\u00f3n applies his knowledge of psychoanalysis to the roles he performs; but having uncovered the reasons for their perverse conduct, he does not restore them to sane, unoperatic normality. Instead he allows himself to be infected by a mania that the analyst would want to dispel. Don Carlos, for instance, is a Spanish Oedipus, defying his tyrannical father Philip II and making abject love to his stepmother. Villaz\u00f3n filled in the emotional history of Carlos for me - his guilt at having killed the mother who died giving birth to him, his fear of a lethal father whose pastime was signing death warrants - and illustrated the schizophrenia of the music Verdi wrote for him. &apos;Listen to the way he is - sometimes very soft, pleading, lyrical, then he suddenly explodes with craziness.&apos; He crooned a few honeyed bars into my ear, then erupted in a spitting fury that I tried not to take personally. Before I had the chance to recover, he was lying on the floor, acting out the epileptic fits from which Carlos suffered. His eyes popped, his chest heaved, his breath came in rasping spasms; I was about to call for help when he laughed to exorcise this particular devil, jumped back into his seat, and talked about the tricky end of the opera, in which a spurious miracle saves Carlos from the Inquisition. &apos;When I did this opera in Amsterdam, the director refused to stage the miracle, so Carlos committed suicide in front of his father. I don&apos;t know yet what Nick Hytner wants me to do. But I have to say I love to kill myself!&apos; That is actually Villaz\u00f3n&apos;s vocation: wearing himself out on stage, shedding blood as he pours forth that molten, plaintive voice. &apos;I have to give the audience 100 per cent,&apos; he said. &apos;I can do it no other way.&apos; At lunchtime the day before, launching his new CD Cielo e Mar in a bar at the Royal Opera House, he treated a few dozen guests to three alternately ecstatic and tormented arias, sung with a force that made me fear for the chandelier above his head, then made an equally impassioned speech in which he celebrated music as &apos;the true nourishment of the spirit&apos;. Corporate honchos from Rolex, with whom he has an endorsement deal, swilled their champagne uneasily: they were there to shift merchandise, not save souls. &apos;We are living in the decadence of the interior life,&apos; Villaz\u00f3n went on, adding a brief tirade against text messaging and the instant gratification of consumerist whims. &apos;We feel empty, so we fill up with stupid movies, or with food.&apos; My hand, extended to grasp a passing canap\u00e9, guiltily retracted. &apos;But art opens our chests,&apos; he continued. &apos;Art is a scalpel. Of course it can be hurtful. To open the chest you must make a wound, but that wound is a door. It shows the things that live inside a person - what makes it possible for us to jump into the sea or up to the clouds.&apos; Once again, his rhetoric achieved lift-off, as he reached up towards the tinkling, agitated chandelier. No wonder he has described his wife, Lucia, as a necessary anchorage, tethering him like gravity: &apos;If I am the kite, she is the cord that keeps it close to the earth.&apos; She must need both her hands to tug down her volatile husband, who is as aeronautical as his own high notes. Villaz\u00f3n&apos;s messianic earnestness startled his listeners at the launch party. &apos;People said to me that they never hear speeches like that,&apos; he told me later. &apos;Usually it&apos;s a just a few jokes so they can go back to drinking the champagne. But I meant it all, every word.&apos; He may have meant more than he was saying out loud, because during his months off he questioned his conscience about the hucksterism that keeps classical music in business. His disc of duets with incendiary Russian soprano Anna Netrebko had a booklet in which they were photographed hugging, romping hand in hand and tickling one another&apos;s toes. Sex sells, and the recording company needed to unload CDs and DVDs of La traviata and La boh\u00e8me; Netrebko and Villaz\u00f3n insisted that their partnership was confined to the theatre, though the denials sounded teasingly coy. Last July in London, Netrebko began an affair with Uruguayan baritone Erwin Schrott, by whom she is now pregnant. Villaz\u00f3n&apos;s period of medical rest began soon afterwards, and he and Netrebko have not sung together since (though they are contracted to make joint appearances at the Metropolitan Opera and eventually, in Massenet&apos;s Manon, at Covent Garden). He looked back ruefully on those prurient efforts to brand them as a couple. &apos;A story was told though pictures about me and Anna that was not true or correct,&apos; he said. For once, his rubbery, animated face had a solemn fixity. He is an idealist, who now knows that he can expect to be disillusioned or, perhaps, betrayed. In his incautious, almost infantile candour, Villaz\u00f3n is a kind of holy fool or, perhaps, a knight riding off on an absurd crusade, preaching his musical gospel to an unworthy congregation of marketers, publicists and gossiping hacks. It was he who mentioned Don Quixote, the literary character who represents the interconnection of nobility and nonsense, aspiration and disaster. &apos;Living is a Quixotesque thing,&apos; he said. &apos;We know we are going to die, we fail at whatever we try to do. But this is what gives us a reason to continue.&apos; Growing up in Mexico City, Villaz\u00f3n intended to devote himself to a calling more sacred than the erotically obsessive art of opera. He studied in a seminary and was a candidate for the priesthood. Before his ordination, he went on an Easter retreat to Popocat\u00e9petl, the quiescent volcano outside the city. He climbed to the top, perhaps expecting to hear God boom megaphonically from the crater or erupt in fire as on Sinai. The deity, however, was not in residence. &apos;Nothing happened for me. And I began to feel sorry for God - I understood that he needs us, not the other way round. So I went back down the volcano through the snow, and I felt the wind, and I looked at the village at the bottom and gradually I saw the people who lived there. Finally, I had this vision of Lucia, who was to become my wife. That revealed what my dream ought to be; to enter the monastery would be hiding. I just wandered away from Christianity - though I still admire Jesus as a man, a socialist maybe.&apos; Or perhaps a singer, who made audible the distress of those he comforted. I recalled Villaz\u00f3n&apos;s claim that art performs open-heart surgery, baring our innards: had he been volunteering for the stigmata? Vaulting ahead of me, he denounced imperial Rome for its corruption of Christianity. &apos;When the Emperor Constantine made it all official, it became the power machine that Jesus fought against. I think religion is a mistake that&apos;s now behind us. It was an invention - an invention of the rich, just like opera. I still have faith, but in other things. I believe in a force inside us, not in heaven. People who can afford opera tickets sometimes go for the wrong reasons, and fall asleep when the music starts. I hope that in Don Carlos we will make them cry with joy and sadness. Why not have faith in that? Or in a great violinist - someone who shits and pisses like me, but when he takes up his instrument he grows extra fingers and can do things that are extraordinary? Someone like that is flesh and blood, but he is also spirit.&apos; Physiology blends with metaphysics in Villaz\u00f3n&apos;s thinking. He went on to rhapsodise about the division of cells and outlined his belief in creative evolution, which - with opera as its chosen agent - is showing us how to reconcile body and soul. &apos;I realised two things during those months when I was not singing,&apos; he said. &apos;One is that what I have to give to opera is unique, just as my colleagues have their own unique contributions to make. The second is that opera can get on perfectly fine without me. The performances I cancelled took place with other singers; evolution continued. I am only a voice among all the other voices, like in Verdi&apos;s Requiem.&apos; For a moment, I fancied I could hear a celestial choir making the sky resonate. Villaz\u00f3n, however, is a tenor, capable of surmounting that massed ensemble with a high C or a B flat. Without pausing for breath, he described the &apos;nucleus of fire&apos; he has inside him and lamented the way it was muffled and dampened by the &apos;watery sphere&apos; that comes with success. He found his calling on a volcano; his period of retirement enabled him to reignite the blaze. I reminded him that he once told a German interviewer that he felt &apos;a little like Prometheus, who challenges the gods and steals fire from heaven&apos;. &apos;Oh shit,&apos; he moaned, &apos;it was so pretentious of me to say that! No, what happened last year was different: I recovered my humanity.&apos; Despite this modest attempt to ground himself, Villaz\u00f3n is a human being with a gift that seems superhuman, as well as a fondness for pretending to be a subhuman dinosaur. I hope that he tends the fire carefully and doesn&apos;t let it burn out. The life story Early Life Born 1972 in Mexico City.

Switzerland takes the credit for that.   Dutch is the official language of the Netherlands, although they also recognise several minority regional languages, including West Frisian, Low Saxon, Twentse and Limburgish.  Roughly 70% of the Dutch population speaks English. If you&apos;re ever stuck for an example of a &quot;synecdoche&quot;, ie a term for part of something that is employed to mean the whole of that something, remember Holland. Though frequently used as a synonym for the Netherlands, it officially refers to just two of the 12 Dutch provinces, North Holland and South Holland. The Dutch sometimes use &quot;Holland&quot; this way themselves, particularly with regard to the national football team.  The Dutch don&apos;t actually refer to the Netherlands in the plural the way we do in English. They call it Nederland. The plural form is an archaic construction which refers specifically to the loosely confederated provinces of the Dutch Republic of 1581 to 1795.  More than 60% of the Netherlands lies below the mean sea level. The highest point is just 321 metres above sea level. Over the past century and a half the Dutch have gone from being among the shortest people in Europe to among the very tallest. The average height for a Dutch man is 6ft 1in; the average woman is 5ft 8in. It has become necessary to raise door lintels and extend hotel beds to accommodate their extra length. This growth spurt could be attributable to several factors - a steady increase in income, improved diet or better health care, combined with the fact that they started from such a low point - but no one knows when it will end.  The Netherlands as we know it originated with the Seventeen Provinces, which also included modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg, a chunk of France and a sliver of Germany.  A brilliantly named edict, The Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, transformed the Seventeen Provinces into a single entity. Later, seven northern provinces revolted against Philip II of Spain at the instigation of William the Silent, touching off the 80 years war.  The 80 years war actually did last 80 years. The Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, to which the modern day Netherlands is heir, won its formal independence in 1648.  The Netherlands exports a quarter of all the world&apos;s tomatoes.  The Netherlands has the highest population density of any sizeable European country;  484 inhabitants per square kilometre, if you discount the 18.4% of the country that is water. And yet none of its major cities has a population of more than a million. The Dutch national anthem, Het Wilhelmus (literally, The William) is said to be the oldest in the world (though it wasn&apos;t officially declared the Dutch anthem until 1932) and is written in the first person, from the point of view of William the Silent: &quot;William of Nassau am I/ of Dutch Blood/ loyal to the fatherland/ I will remain until I die.&quot; The Netherlands has the lowest incidence of lactose intolerance in the world, about 1%. The Dutch were the first Europeans to happen by Australia, which they immediately christened New Holland. They were also among the first to colonise America, which they called New Netherlands, and the first to settle New York, which they named New Amsterdam. New Zealand, named after the Dutch province Zeeland, provides a rare example of the Dutch coming up with a name that stuck. Remember that Unicef report in which the UK came bottom out of all rich countries in terms of child wellbeing? Guess who came top.  Propionibacter shermani is a bacteria that consumes lactic acid produced by other bacteria and in turn produces carbon dioxide gas, which creates the distinctive holes in Emmental cheese.

Their philosophy on the game and how it should be played is one I respect and I think many other football fans would say the same. It&apos;s all about technique and playing with imagination. In the last European Championships, Greece managed to grind their way to victory, which was a fantastic achievement in the circumstances, but, idealistically, you want to see tournaments won by great teams and great players. 2 English-based players A lot of Holland&apos;s most talented players are based in the Premier League. There will be people like Dirk Kuyt, Ryan Babel, Robin van Persie and Edwin Van der Sar on show in Switzerland and Austria as well as others like Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben, who have played in the Premier League in the past. We were also very lucky to see Dennis Bergkamp a few years ago -\u00b1a fantastic player and a great role model for the game. 3 Tulips Tulips are synonymous with Holland and they also remind me of a funny story relating to my wife and her best friend, Rosemary, who sadly is no longer with us. About five or six years ago they decided that they wanted to visit Holland to see the tulips - we all know the song Tulips From Amsterdam - so they paid for an overnight trip. Unfortunately, the morning they arrived, almost the length and breadth of the country, the tops were cut off the tulips. So they were left looking at a load of green stalks for two days. 4 Johan Cruyff We talk about Pele and Diego Maradona as the best players ever but, during my time, Johan Cruyff was right up there with the top three or four players we have ever seen. I had the opportunity to play against him once for England and I have also played in a couple of friendlies with him. He was so quick and he had this ability to turn and twist away from players with incredible speed. Holland have been blessed with some really great players over the years and, in my opinion, Cruyff was the best of the best. 5 Nearly team Holland have contributed so much to world football but they&apos;ve not managed to win the number of tournaments they should have. Their great time was in the 1970s, when Ajax won the European Cup three times. Unfortunately, during that period the national team played World Cup finals in the backyard of two of the great sides, West Germany in 1974 and Argentina in 1978. Holland did win the European Championships in 1988 but there should have been far more silverware. It would be nice to see a genuine footballing nation win the European Championships this summer. \u00b7 Sir Geoff Hurst MBE is McDonald&apos;s director of football and spearheads the company&apos;s community football coaching programme, which provides children across the UK with more access to qualified coaching.

Prof Dave Newman of the University of Exeter has created a portable magneto-optical instrument to do the job in a minute. And, when his new method is fully refined, it may not even need a blood sample. Newman&apos;s expertise as a physicist involves materials for magneto-optical recordable discs. Used since the late 1980s, these rely on measuring a change in laser light reflected from magnetic media in different magnetic states.  There&apos;s also a link between malaria, magnetism and light. Red blood cells are infected by the malarial parasite (Plasmodium) from female Anopheles mosquitoes. The oxygen-carrying haemoglobin is then digested by the parasite, forming haemozoin which exhibits properties of being attracted to magnetic fields. Some years ago, Newman had considered researching malaria diagnosis but was prevented by blood safety restrictions. Then he moved to the University of Exeter. &quot;I went back to this idea and, by talking to a biologist friend of mine, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was possible to detect malaria by detecting the haemozoin by magneto-optics.&quot; Thanks to European Union funding, Newman and colleagues from Exeter and Coventry universities have now tested a prototype instrument at the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam. Clinical trials are also planned in Kenya.  It works like this. The parasite produces haemozoin in the form of rectangular rod-like crystals and, normally, the long axes point in random directions. &quot;When you apply a [magnetic] field to them, they become magnetised and all orientate in the field direction,&quot; says Newman. The crystals also absorb polarised red laser light more strongly along their length than the width (optical dichroism). Put a blood sample into the instrument, apply a directional magnetic field, then a laser and photodetector take optical measurements proportional to the haemozoin concentration. &quot;The intention is to produce something about the size of a shoe box which will be rugged enough to go out into the field,&quot; says Newman.  Colin Sutherland is a senior lecturer at the London School of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene and a clinical scientist at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. He says that malaria is usually identified with a microscope or by antigen diagnostic kits which may not be too reliable. &quot;This particular test looks very exciting,&quot; he says. &quot;The fact that it&apos;s rapid is great but it will, of course, need to be emphasised for a test to be usable by a malaria control programme in Africa, it must be affordable and portable.&quot; Newman is researching a prototype which doesn&apos;t use a blood sample. Instead, he envisages putting a finger inside a box within a magnetic field, shining a laser beam onto a fingernail, and taking an optical reading from the blood beneath.", "sentences": ["&quot;I went back to this idea and, by talking to a biologist friend of mine, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was possible to detect malaria by detecting the haemozoin by magneto-optics.&quot; Thanks to European Union funding, Newman and colleagues from Exeter and Coventry universities have now tested a prototype instrument at the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam."], "title": "Magnetic device could be used to diagnose malaria", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/may/29/research.medicalresearch", "tags": ["Research and development", "Medical research", "Technology", "University of Exeter", "Education", "Higher education", "Malaria"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-30T08:30:03Z", "article": "Returning from the Cannes film festival and going through Marseille on the skytrain, I think about how Chet Baker used to like Marseille a lot but he didn&apos;t play there - it was mostly in Paris at the New Morning. He was always making a quick jump in a friend&apos;s fast car to Germany to record a CD in a day and then return to Paris. It was 21 years ago when I filmed part of Let&apos;s Get Lost in Cannes, as well as screening my first documentary, Broken Noses, at the Jean Cocteau theatre and photographing for Per Lui. Yes, there was a lot of confusion, but that was the best way for me to be with Chet, because if he didn&apos;t show up, we always had something else to do. But guess what? There he was, on time, hair slicked back, trumpet case in one hand and his girlfriend in the other. It seemed in those days, because I was so obsessed with Chet and my film, that everyone started to resemble him in some way. I knew Andy Minsker, the boxer who starred in Broken Noses, looked like him, but bodyguards, waiters, lifeguards and other actors also seemed to look like Chet&apos;s twin brother. Now, of course, in the real world this wasn&apos;t true, but I was lost on this journey with Chet and I had this great fear of losing him to the outside world. It&apos;s almost like when a dog runs away from home: you try to replace him and call the new dog by the same name - but somehow it&apos;s never the same. When I finished editing Let&apos;s Get Lost in 1988 at the Brill Building in New York, we got a call from Cherry Vanilla, who also appeared in the film. She sadly told us that Chet had died and that they found him lying on a street outside his hotel in Amsterdam. Years later Johnny Depp came to see me and Nan Bush, the producer of my films, at our loft in New York City. Johnny curled up on the couch and said he wanted to play Chet in a feature film. He asked us &quot;if we owned the rights to Chet&apos;s story&quot;. Nan and I laughed and told Johnny that Chet had sold his story countless times, but no one ever owned Chet&apos;s story - he wanted to be free as a bird. I was sad because no one looked like Chet any more - and Johnny surely didn&apos;t, but he&apos;s someone I always liked and photographed from the beginning of his career. So I told him: &quot;Anyway, you look more like Art Pepper and there&apos;s a great book on his life by his girlfriend called The Straight Life.&quot; A day in the life of Art was like a year in most people&apos;s lives. I don&apos;t think Johnny ever read that book and he never made that film. As I took Johnny down in the freight elevator he said: &quot;So what&apos;s going on with you these days?&quot; I told him that Nan and I were making a documentary about Robert Mitchum. Johnny gave me a big smile and said: &quot;He&apos;s one of my favourite actors besides Brando, and my dad looks so much like him that when I go out for dinner with him, people come up and ask for his autograph.&quot; When the freight elevator reached the ground floor we hugged each other goodbye and I said, &quot;Maybe you could write an introduction for our book to accompany the Mitchum film?&quot; &quot;Count me in,&quot; Johnny said as he waved goodbye. Oh well, I thought, here I go again: now everyone&apos;s going to look like Bob Mitchum! I made that film on Mitchum and I never met Johnny&apos;s dad, but I didn&apos;t see anyone resembling Bob - maybe because I still had images of Chet floating in my subconscious. You have to understand that I first saw photographs of Chet, taken by William Claxton, about 40 years ago on the cover of an album called Chet Baker Sings and Plays. I collected jazz records in those days. (I still do, but most of the little record stores in the East Village of New York City that I used to hang out in are closing.) At that time I was attending NYU film school. I got to meet Claxton and his wife Peggy Moffitt; she was the first model to wear the topless bathing suit by Rudi Gernreich. Bill photographed me and made a short film with me and Peggy. He had three great distractions in his life: Peggy, Steve McQueen and Chet Baker. I couldn&apos;t compare with that, being a shy and awkward film student, but Bill was a real sweetheart to anyone who happened to be in front of his camera. He made me feel very confident so I could fantasise that I was in the same gang as Steve and Chet. I learned a lot from Bill, and now when I photograph so many college kids for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, I think of Bill and his respect for the individual and how everyone was beautiful until it was discovered they didn&apos;t have a soul to go along with a great body. I always thought Chet had that soul - no matter what age he was, no matter if he got his teeth knocked out, or no matter how many lines circled his eyes. People always ask me, &quot;What is beauty?&quot; I always laugh and say: &quot;Today is one thing and tomorrow another.&quot; As we travelled to film festivals with Let&apos;s Get Lost and my other documentaries, I kept looking for another Chet Baker, someone who made you travel to some far outpost in your mind, never worrying about a return ticket. Peter Johnson, who starred in my next film Chop Suey, resembled Chet when he was growing up in Oklahoma. I even photographed Peter&apos;s profile with a trumpet rested softly against his cheek. After that came A Letter to True, an antiwar documentary starring my dog True and Dirk Bogarde, and with voiceovers by Julie Christie and Marianne Faithfull. Sometimes there was a sense of longing in True&apos;s eyes just like I used to see in Chet&apos;s eyes after he finished a song and there was silence in the recording studio. Recently I had lunch sitting across from Clint Eastwood. We talked about Bird and Chet, his music and my film, over a strange buffet for &quot;two hamburger kind of guys&quot; of the kind of food that the French sometimes serve, which I like to call &quot;mystery food&quot;. I laughed, remembering when I was growing up in Greensburgh, Pennsylvania - you couldn&apos;t hear a sound in my parent&apos;s house (all the jazz music was shut off) so we could religiously watch Clint on his TV series Rawhide. Even then I photographed everyone to look like Clint: cheerleaders, my mom and dad, and the captain of our local football team. Well, I didn&apos;t tell Clint that, because I was taking a family portrait of him with his wife and child, and they would have thought I was an &quot;odd duck&quot;. Maybe I am, but that&apos;s OK because I&apos;m still looking for another Chet Baker in my life - because Chet spoiled me. I began to realise that there are not a million nor even one other Chet Baker. I can&apos;t help but carry on searching for a new Chet, so I can make another movie, so I can take photographs for another book, and so once again I can have &quot;just for a thrill&quot; the chance of knowing someone magical that you can never ever forget. \u00b7 Let&apos;s Get Lost is rereleased on June 6", "sentences": ["She sadly told us that Chet had died and that they found him lying on a street outside his hotel in Amsterdam."], "title": "Director Bruce Weber on filming Chet Baker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/30/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic47", "tags": ["Jazz", "Film", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-05-30T23:01:00Z", "article": "InBev 12.8% of the world market Biggest brand Brahma Chopp Annual group sales 38.7bn pints (12.8% of the world market) InBev was forged in 2004 by the merger of Belgium&apos;s Interbrew and Brazil&apos;s AmBev.

Now Brazil&apos;s fifth-richest man, Lemann and his lieutenants occupy four seats in the InBev boardroom. Three aristocratic Belgian families - the De Spoelberchs, Van Dammes, and De Prets - sit at another four. Together the Brazilian and Belgian founding family shareholder blocks control about 64% of InBev shares, with Lemann still bringing his considerable deal-brokering influence to bear, particularly on acquisition strategy.

A merger six years ago with Miller brought in the American brewer&apos;s former parent group Altria Group as a major shareholder. The US conglomerate continues to hold a 29% stake. Three years later SABMiller added Colombia-based rival Bavaria to its empire in a deal that gave the Santo Domingo family a 15% holding in the global company. The family is headed by Colombia&apos;s richest man, Julio Mario Santo Domingo. Until 2004 he was a long-standing investor in Avianca Airlines. In 1989 a terrorist reportedly blew up one of the airline&apos;s planes after buying a ticket under Santo Domingo&apos;s name.

The boardroom is well populated with family members and associates. It also provides a bizarre forum for the complicated relationship between Busch and his austere father, August Busch III.

In the 1980s, he wrecked a sports car late at night and a woman passenger was killed. Busch left the scene. Police decided against pressing charges.

As he subsequently told writer Gordon Burn: &apos;I&apos;m not afraid of meeting somebody and them being shocked and going, &quot;Oh fuck, he&apos;s just a little twat from Leeds, really.&quot;&apos; He also had part-time jobs with a market research company and at Anthony d&apos;Offay gallery. The first taught him how to blag stuff on the phone, while the second provided the all-important art world connections - the names that needed to be attracted to see the work, notably the Royal Academy&apos;s Norman Rosenthal, the Tate&apos;s Sir Nicholas Serota and collector Charles Saatchi. These three, and a few others, were presented with a selection of items whose cohesion, if there was one, lay in the fact that Goldsmiths did not differentiate between painting and sculpture (&apos;It&apos;s just like , you go there and you can do anything,&apos; Hirst said in 1992) - and this resulted in a dominance of confident mixed-media work. Furthermore, the students were receiving advice - and important avuncular encouragement - from tutor Michael Craig-Martin, whose art heart lay in the Duchamp &apos;joke&apos; - aka Neo-Conceptualism. The nostalgic palette has become more brightly hued thanks to the fact that time has proved these artists to be what Craig-Martin, with justifiable pride, remembers as an &apos;extraordinary group&apos;. Hirst&apos;s career has been stellar, while many of the others were nominated for or won the Turner Prize, and most have pieces in public galleries all over the world. Only Stephen Park (and possibly Steven Adamson) deviated - Park now enjoys a career as a stand-up comedian, and no one seems sure about Adamson&apos;s current whereabouts. Angus Fairhurst&apos;s name, though familiar on the art scene, entered households this year when he was found hanged in a suicide that had the carefully planned characteristics of the emotionally charged Situationist statements that had marked his life. He made the silk rope by hand and died on the day that his show closed at Sadie Coles gallery. &apos;It annoys me when the press says that Angus was less successful than say Damien or Sarah [Lucas],&apos; says Abigail Lane. &apos;What they actually mean was that he was not as rich...&apos; Twenty years ago they were all, as Craig-Martin puts it, &apos;insanely young&apos;. The keen merchants who did make their way to the London Port Authority building were treated to the sight of a pile of crumpled metal by Sarah Lucas, a door painted by Gary Hume, light bulbs switching on and off by Angela Bulloch and tiny pencil drawings by Richard Patterson. &apos;I felt reasonably confident in them,&apos; says Patterson, &apos;insofar as you can be confident in an isolated set of six drawings, but I didn&apos;t feel confident about the idea of showing. It was premature for me. Everyone else seemed more intent on doing their growing up in public... I remember some poor bastard doing a performance in the exhibition space where he buried himself naked in a mound of earth with only a breathing tube. After about 15 minutes the mound started to twitch and they had to dig him out. He was getting hypothermia. Awful really.&apos; Mat Collishaw&apos;s Bullet Hole - a cibachrome on a lightbox which showed a head being fractured by a bullet - was to become one of the seminal images of the Young British Artist movement. It also gave the name to the show (according to the catalogue, &apos;the title comes from Mat Collishaw&apos;s lightbox, dedicated to a moment of impact, a preserved now, a freeze frame&apos;). Collishaw recalls that a dealer offered him less for Bullet Hole than it cost to make. &apos;I said I&apos;d rather let it rot in the car park - which is exactly what it did. Saatchi bought a remake 10 years later.&apos; Ian Davenport, then 21, enjoyed the first success as he was immediately taken up by Leslie Waddington, by whom he is still represented. Hirst, generous to his friends, devoted his considerable energy to the hanging and promotion of Freeze - gathering both the money needed for the exhibition as well as sponsorship for a well-designed and professionally written catalogue. His own contribution to the show took the form of some painted boxes stuck in a pattern on to the wall, and the first spot painting - also painted on to the wall - which remained there for two years. &apos;People have said that Freeze was about making money,&apos; Craig-Martin says, &apos;but it wasn&apos;t. Nobody could have bought the spot painting... it was about being young, about being excited about what they were doing, and getting people to see their work.&apos; Hirst himself has said that a collector wanted to buy the boxes as one installation, but after attempting to pin them together with gold paper clips he smashed the thing up for being, in general, too annoying. Carl Freedman was an old friend of Hirst&apos;s from Leeds. His input, though supportive at the Freeze show, gelled in 1990 with the warehouse shows Modern Medicine and Gambler, held at a former factory in Bermondsey. Charles Saatchi sponsored the former to the tune of \u00a31,000 and subsequently bought Hirst&apos;s A Thousand Years - a glass box containing a rotting cow&apos;s head, thousands of flies and an electric fly killer. &apos;I could understand how art acquired a monetary value, though I don&apos;t have any in-depth knowledge of art itself - this Damien supplied,&apos; says Freedman. &apos;I had studied anthropology at university, and my first reading of the contemporary art world was as an exchange system of economic signs. Damien and I lived together at the time, and both fed off each other&apos;s area&apos;s of knowledge. We shared a youthful sense of unbounded ambition.&apos; They were both admirers of the Saatchi Collection, and it was that scale and ambition they set out to emulate. &apos;I think we shared the same goal - to make London a place where contemporary art could thrive and have the same vitality as cities like Cologne and New York (at that time London was somewhat of a backwater). We went different ways when Damien decided he wanted to spend more time making Damien Hirst the centre of the international art world - which on some levels he has achieved.&apos; While Freeze alone cannot be credited with launching the YBAs on the world, it did, as art critic Peter Timms put it, &apos;start an inexorable process of change&apos;. For the first time, younger artists were taken seriously, and as the recession lifted and wealth infused the culture of ideas, art became stock and this new group began to be taken very seriously indeed. Hirst again: &apos;Everything in the whole world is worth what anyone else is prepared to pay for it. And that&apos;s it. Simple.&apos; Career-making shows were subsequently held at the Saatchi Gallery (then in Boundary Road, north London) and the Serpentine Gallery, but the Salon des Refus\u00e9s moment did not arguably arrive until the 1997 Sensation show at the Royal Academy. Then the mob got involved, and the YBA phenomenon entered the mainstream. An almost instantaneous and characteristically British backlash culminated in the jaded archetype of Birch&apos;s &apos;Young British Artist&apos; comic strip in Private Eye, while the feeling of ennui is encapsulated by Stephen Park&apos;s comment: &apos;By the mid-Nineties I had lost count of how many friends had won or been nominated for the Turner Prize. I had shared a bed with at least three of them and genuinely lost interest. In the Turner Prize, I mean.&apos; Says Richard Patterson: &apos;The YBA thing has to rank as the silliest of all names. Certainly not a movement. I suppose it is a kind of licence to show tits and arse more than anything.&apos; Nobody, least of all the artists, is pretending that the work shown at Freeze was great; they mostly recall cleaning the space, being bossed about by Damien, and the irritation of fellow students who had been excluded from this court. Richard Patterson remembers thinking that Hirst&apos;s was &apos;solid student work - neither good nor bad, but intelligent and honest. He was fearless. Some of the others, myself included, were dealing with what it meant to inherit postmodernism - it seemed a shitty fate. Those that didn&apos;t know what postmodernism actually meant were free to bang out whatever they saw fit and have never looked back.&apos; Stephen Park: &apos;I remember it as a kind of sociological experiment in which Damien played the alpha baboon. It was all about body language and status games. I also remember trying to persuade a group of us that Sarah Lucas&apos;s sculpture was not good enough to be included...&apos; Abigail Lane, whose starched white collars were arranged on the wall like flying ducks, remembers sitting in a white space in an administrative block to which &apos;nobody came&apos;. But Freeze was professionally presented, with proper money and a catalogue; the artists had taken the initiative, and though subsequent successes sometimes strained friendships, 20 years later, Lane says, there is still a loyalty between them. She herself, though not richly remunerated by her work, is happy and living in Suffolk with a new baby, Eric. She likes working and, installations being her metier, was recently pleased to arrange a circus artwork, For Your Pleasure, in the shop Matches in Marylebone High Street. Hirst&apos;s slipstream is not something one would wish on anyone; and, though most of the Freeze artists still enjoy a respected presence in the art world, they have also learned to become philosophical, growing with themselves and in their work. For a time, Richard Patterson gave up making art after Freeze: &apos;My stopping seems conspicuous in retrospect because many of the others became so successful so fast. I thought it was philosophical to not make things for a while, though in truth I simply wasn&apos;t in a head space where I could make art at the time. I was still going to see shows and openings and thinking about art. You don&apos;t really &quot;give up&quot; art once you&apos;ve started. Fiona Rae persuaded me to hurry up and start painting again. The truth is, you&apos;re only as good the last painting you&apos;ve made, so I&apos;m grateful to her for the kick in the arse. I wanted to draw a line under that part of my life and then start a life as an artist. Why would this not be a struggle? Look at De Kooning, for instance. For many of the others in Freeze it was more seamless, and I envied them that at the time. They&apos;ll have their reassessment moments later maybe. Rehab, even. It&apos;s part of being an artist.&apos; &apos;Being involved in Freeze helped my career,&apos; says Lala Meredith-Vula, &apos;It always appears in my press biography with the fact that I have represented Albania in the Venice Biennale. I went my separate way from the group, though. It was not intentional to leave them, but I followed my own interests as an artist and went back to my roots to live in Kosovo for a few years.&apos; &apos;The real point of being an artist is to have time to play and to decide for myself what I value,&apos; says Stephen Park. &apos;I live in Devon. It&apos;s beautiful here. I stay creative. I make drawings. I perform. I write. When no one&apos;s looking I sing and dance, too. I rarely stop to envy the others. I especially don&apos;t envy Angus.&apos; THE 16 ARTISTS: WHAT HAPPENED NEXT STEVEN ADAMSON It&apos;s not known what Steven Adamson does now.

In 2006 he completed Poured Lines: Southwark Street, a 50m painting which is permanently installed beneath the Western Bridge on Southwark Street. He is represented by Waddington Gallery DOMINIC DENIS Was listed in the catalogue but did not show work ANGUS FAIRHURST Born in l968 in Pembury. Committed suicide on 29 March 2008. A close friend of Damien Hirst and Sarah Lucas he is remembered for being a kind and supportive friend, generous with his ideas. Represented by Sadie Coles, his most recent solo show finished on the day he died. Was also included in high-profile group shows such as In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida at Tate Britain, with Lucas and Hirst in 2004 ANYA GALLACCIO Born in 1963 in Paisley, she was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2003. Uses organic materials such as fruit and vegetables and flowers, which means that the pieces tend to whither and rot. She now lives and works in London and has had solo exhibitions at Tate Britain and the Ikon Gallery as well as across Europe. Her most recent exhibition was Comfort and Conversation at Annet Gelink Gallery in Amsterdam DAMIEN HIRST Born in l965 in Bristol, Hirst grew up in Leeds. A sensational career has been marked by what his former tutor Michael Craig-Martin calls an, &apos;elaborate game with money&apos;, culiminating this year in the \u00a350m sale of a diamond encrusted skull entitled For the Love of God GARY HUME  Born in 1962 in Tenterden, his early work featured life-like representations of hospital doors which were sold to Charles Saatchi. In the early Nineties he turned to painting in gloss paint on aluminium. He represented Britain at the 1999 Venice Biennale, and was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1996. He was made a Royal Academician in 2001 MICHAEL LANDY Born in l963 in London. In 1992, Landy started an association with Karsten Schubert by making Closing Down Sale for his gallery, an installation made up of a number of objects in shopping trolleys labelled &apos;BARGAIN&apos;.

A solo show at Karsten Schubert was followed by exhibitions at Victoria Miro Gallery and abroad. In October 2003, with Bob Pain and Brigitte Stepputtis, she launched the art and design company Showroom Dummies. An installation by Lane will be on show in Matches, Marylebone High Street, from 11 June SARAH LUCAS Born in 1962 in London, Lucas is seen as one of the more provocative contemporary female artists, and her work is exhibited all over the world. Her first two solo exhibitions in 1992 were titled &apos;The Whole Joke&apos; and &apos;Penis Nailed to a Board&apos;. In 1993, she and Tracey Emin rented a retail space in east London, The Shop, where they made artworks. She is now represented by Sadie Coles, where she most recently contributed to a Films exhibition. Her most recent solo show was at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands LALA MEREDITH-VULA Born in 1966 in Sarajevo, her work is in collections all over the world.

It was called the Flute of Shame, a medieval instrument of torture used for the express purpose of punishing bad musicians.  The contraption, which does indeed look like a flute, although you really wouldn&apos;t want to try and play it, was hung around the neck of an offender whose fingers would be stuck through the flute, rendering the offending muso unable to play. As if this wasn&apos;t enough punishment for the heinous crime of performing an earlobe-bashing melody or - equally punishable - &quot;offending public morals&apos;&quot; the &apos;orrible little miscreant would also be forced to parade around the streets, where he or she would receive a pelting of rotten fruit and the kind of verbal humiliation with which James Blunt is familiar. My first response to the device - &quot;What a horrible little gadget&quot; - was quickly superseded by: &quot;What a brilliant idea!&quot; Just imagine what it would be like if we hadn&apos;t gone all soft in these cosy, iPod, MySpace and in-car air-con times; if we had stuck with medieval concepts of morality and punishment and had been more vigilant against dastardly crimes against music - were an instrument like the Flute Of Shame still in active use today, prog-rock may never have happened. Phil Collins may have been physically prevented from leaving the drum stool in Genesis to launch that Godawful solo career. Dire Straits may not have been given Money for Nothing. The Darkness might have been restrained from appearing onstage on large rubber sexual organs. Radiohead would never have made anything but entirely listenable albums, and the world need never have even been troubled by the tinnitus-inducing rackets made by people like Sinitta, Avril Lavigne or the 173,908 bands who sound like under-the-counter copies of Arctic Monkeys or Libertines. While our Sunday afternoons are generally spent watching overpaid Premiership footballers in the pub, we could be having hours of much cheaper fun hurling rotten tomatoes at the Kooks. Alas, the government appears to have far more pressing troubles than reinstating the Flute Of Shame. But while we wait for Gordon Brown to stop dithering over crime and tackle the real criminals - those producing twiddly-twiddly guitars solos or wailing though Stevie Wonder songs in front of Sharon Osbourne - how about some of your suggestions for musicians who should be first for the Flute treatment? Here are some of mine: 1) Pete Doherty. An easy target, maybe, but let&apos;s face it, no crack-abusing musician with a silly hat who comes up with such bad druggy puns as Pipe Down should ever escape the Flute Of Shame. 2) Amy Winehouse. Not for her oft-discussed &quot;lifestyle&quot; or, admittedly, top-notch music, but for those appalling combinations of tiny tops, red bras and hideous tattoos, which appear in the papers every day halfway through your breakfast. Truly, an outrage against public morals and boiled eggs. 3) The Mars Volta. If ever a band were invented just to wear the Flute, this is that sorry combo. Twiddly-twiddly solos? Check. Prog-rock orchestral pomposities? Check. Songs about &quot;Toltec bones&quot; and &quot;antlers&quot;? Check. The Flute it is, chaps. 4) Anyone who has ever appeared on The X Factor, ever. Instead of the current format, wide-eyed wannabes should be made to warble before a Flute-wielding executioner and an audience specially supplied with old tomatoes and rotten eggs. If the scheduled song to be sung is by Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye, they should just be put in the Flute anyway. As should Sharon Osbourne, Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell, now I come to think of it. 5) Those nerdy, bespectacled electronic music types who call tracks things like pik - Mi -Ar$e676 and usually dream of recording for Warp Records. Go away and never trouble music again, you anally retentive, tunefully challenged, navel-gazing bores. 7) All bands with silly names. The latest in a disreputable line are a new combo We Smoke Fags. Not with your musically criminal &apos;orrid little fingers in the Flute, you don&apos;t. 8) Any musician called Sir who is over 60. Begone you horrible karaoke jukebox former legends, your time was up in 1977... and we still haven&apos;t forgiven you for the trousers you were wearing in 1975. Or The Frog Chorus. 9) The Courteeners, for that ridiculous &quot;We&apos;re what the world is waiting for&quot; stunt in Q, then turning out to be a Mancunian Arctic Monkeys with a chip shop on each shoulder. 10) Robbie Williams, for being Robbie Williams.", "sentences": ["For whom the whistle blows ... the Flute of Shame I was visiting Amsterdam&apos;s Torture Museum the other day - as you do, when it&apos;s raining and you&apos;ve reached saturation point with sex, drugs and the little men selling tulips and asking for money to take your photo - when a fiendish little device caught my attention."], "title": "Who should wear the Flute of Shame?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jun/02/thewindofchange", "tags": ["Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-05T23:10:52Z", "article": "When so many releases these days originated as live performances, it&apos;s useful to be reminded that what seems impressive in the concert hall does not always transfer as convincingly to disc.

Jaap Van Zweden&apos;s transition from orchestral violinist (he was the youngest ever leader of the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam) to conductor has been an effortlessly seamless one, and his previous Bruckner recordings have demonstrated that he is an interpreter to be reckoned with.

This dream of mine may not be as elegantly articulated or stirring as Martin Luther King&apos;s, but it nevertheless represents some creative brainstorming. It all began with this short passage in the Jerusalem Post last week:  The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) detained and deported Finkelstein, who is a prominent critic of the Israeli occupation, when he landed at Ben-Gurion International Airport on Friday. He was interrogated for several hours and held in an airport holding cell before being returned to Amsterdam, where he had been lecturing. Finkelstein said he was told he could not return to Israel for at least 10 years. On Tuesday, the Shin Bet said that if [Norman] Finkelstein tried returning to Israel it would need to re-evaluate its position.&quot;  This got me to thinking: by God, the Shin Bet is tacitly inviting Finkelstein to try again. I started wondering: why not test the Shin Bet&apos;s statement? Why not return to Israel? Then my brainstorming became grander and bolder: don&apos;t just return to Israel, but make a bold political statement out of Finkelstein&apos;s return. After the ugliness at DePaul University, where Finkelstein was denied tenure, local Chicago activists organised a teach-in on academic freedom that included Ben Gurion University professor Neve Gordon, John Mearsheimer and Finkelstein himself. So I started thinking why not do something similar in Israel with Finkelstein again being either the guest of honour or featured speaker. You could turn this into an academic conference on issues like Israeli democracy, ethnic identity and conflict in Israel, Israel-Syria peace negotiations and the critical importance of freedom of travel and speech in democratic society. The conference could happen both in Israel and in the West Bank \u2013 say, at Bir Zeit University (since one couldn&apos;t expect Israelis to be able to travel freely to the West Bank nor Palestinians to travel to Israel to attend either session).Think of the interesting figures you could invite who have had experiences similar to Finkelstein&apos;s who could address this gathering: 1. Tariq Ramadan, whose US visa to teach at Notre Dame was revoked in part because Daniel Pipes and other neocons lied, claiming Ramadan was a supporter of Islamic terror. 2. Yigal Arens, computer security expert at the University of Southern California and son of former Israeli defence minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens was invited to lead a section of a Ben Gurion University conference in his field. But the Shin Bet conference participants objected to his presence because he is a strident critic of Israeli policy. Conference organisers disinvited him. 3. Avrum Burg, whose new book The Holocaust is Over, scandalised the Israeli political elite when it was published in Hebrew last year because Burg, scion of a distinguished Orthodox Zionist family, has moved to France and turned his back on Israeli Zionism. 4. Menachem Klein, professor at Bar Ilan University, whose academic department refuses to grant him tenure because his analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict violates the department&apos;s narrow political-academic consensus. 5. Neve Gordon, professor at Ben Gurion University, who has endured a savage letter-writing campaign to his university president and trustees smearing his name and seeking to get him fired for his critical writing about Israeli policy. Another Israeli academic, Steven Plaut, called him a &quot;kapo&quot; and &quot;Juden-Rat,&quot; and ended up losing a libel case brought by Gordon and a subsequent appeal. 6. Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, an Israeli-Arab law professor at the Hebrew University who was denied permission to exit Israel (again while at Ben Gurion airport) to attend an academic conference; all this at the hands of the same Shin Bet which deported Finkelstein. 7. Hadeel Abukwaik, one of seven Palestinian Fulbright winners who recently gained permission to take up their US studies after it was initially denied by the IDF, which refused to allow them to exit Gaza. 8. Juan Cole, professor at University of Michigan, denied an endowed chair at Yale University after a campaign by right-wing alumni attacking him for being anti-Israel. 9. Rashid Khalidi, professor of Middle East studies at Columbia University, similarly smeared while he was under consideration for an endowed chair at Princeton and also fired from teaching a course to New York public school teachers about the Middle East, because of false charges made by Daniel Pipes of supporting Arab radicalism. 10. Nadia Abu El-Haj, professor of anthropology at Barnard College, targeted by pro-Israel militants who attempted unsuccessfully to deny her tenure for her critical writings about Israeli archaeology. 11. Sami Bahour, Palestinian-American entrepreneur and peace activist denied entry to Israel for no discernible reason. 12. Zvi Schreiber, Israeli technology entrepreneur and developer of G.ho.st, a program allowing computer users to access their computers anywhere in the world. The project is a collaboration between Israelis and Palestinian programmers. 13. Rabbi Menachem Froman, founder of Gush Emunim and a West Bank settler, who is close to Hamas. The Shin Bet prevented Froman from holding a joint press conference to promote his ideas about Israeli-Palestinian peace. As part of this conference, I&apos;d love to hear a concert by Mira Awad, a wonderful Israeli Arab singer and popular theatre and TV actress who hasn&apos;t been able to get a contract to produce her first recording. Her music is not considered commercial enough (as defined by Israeli-Jewish record executives). And why not add to the concert David Broza, who recorded the first Israeli-Palestinian musical duet for his song B&apos;Libi. And Noa and Khaled, whose performance in Hebrew and Arabic of John Lennon&apos;s Imagine is stirring beyond belief. And Idan Raichel, whose music is at the cutting edge of the intersection of Israeli and world music. A performance by the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra under Daniel Barenboim would also be stirring. I also devised a few ideas about how to shame/compel the Shin Bet into granting Finkelstein entry. He could fly to Israel with several of the conference speakers, forcing the Shin Bet to grant entry or eject all of them. (The could call the flight the Voyage of the Banned.) Other conference speakers could meet him at Ben Gurion along with his lawyer, Michael Sfard (just in case). Joining them could be a few journalists, TV cameras and perhaps an MK or two. I&apos;d say this might give the Shin Bet pause. And if it didn&apos;t, the conference organisers could hold the event anyway and leave an empty &quot;Elijah&apos;s chair&quot; on stage for anyone detained by the Shin Bet. Of course, it&apos;s easy to dream. Israelis would have to be the ones to do the hard work to make this dream a reality. But it was great fun dreaming a dream of Israeli democracy and of forcing the Shin Bet to live up to the ideals of its own country&apos;s Declaration of Independence.", "sentences": ["He was interrogated for several hours and held in an airport holding cell before being returned to Amsterdam, where he had been lecturing."], "title": "Richard Silverstein: Norman Finkelstein should return to Israel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/06/israelandthepalestinians", "tags": ["Israel", "Education"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-06T23:07:54Z", "article": "On Sunday I came home from a stag weekend to find that our elder boy, who is four, had drawn a bonkers picture.

How much nobler it would have been to board not the Eurostar but a sturdy male deer, to travel not to Paris but to Narnia, and to drink as deeply as we did from the spring of life rather than the bottle of Stolichnaya. As we convened at St Pancras station in London and I gazed at the grinning male company, eager - let&apos;s face it - for a weekend of pure evil, how much better I would have felt if I hadn&apos;t realised that, appallingly, I was the Only Dad on the Stag. It could be the title of a comedy starring Ben Stiller, but it&apos;s hard to overstate the horror of that moment. I have a confession to make: before I became a dad I was a man, with all the depravity and moral ambiguity that mortal state entails. I hung around with handsome, blithe, charismatic young blades, consecrated to pleasure. And surveying their carefree faces I realised that during the five years I had been away changing nappies and fretting about primary schools, these fellows had been out honing their skills. From the very first pint, I was outgunned. I was less like Ben Stiller, and more like Clint Eastwood in The Unforgiven. In fairness, the boys took pity on me. I was allowed to share a hotel room not with Jordi, the male model from Amsterdam, but with Colin, the neuroscientist from Leipzig. (This is how we avoided a threesome of the variety that must never be elucidated in the Family section.) I was also permitted to skip every other drink, not that this helped when we hit the sack at 5am on the first night and my body clock, configured to toddler time, snapped me wide awake at 6.30am, ready for a full morning of wandering the streets while the unbetrothed slept it off. My defining dad moment came on the second night, in Paris&apos;s glitziest nightclub under the Pont Alexandre III. I stood in a dark corner, wearing what I had conceived to be good clothes, but looking as I now realised rather like a memento mori for the assembled young clubbers. I declined the generous Gallic offers to slap me in the face by way of stimulation (apparently its the jaded generations chic alternative to cocaine), and I watched my companions befriending beautiful Parisian girls who would very soon be eligible to vote. I was happy for everyone, but that&apos;s when I realised how very, very happy I was myself and how very, very badly I wanted to rush home and discover what demented drawings my kids had scrawled for me. Probably it showed. As my good friend wryly put it, winking at me with his arm around a blonde and a vodka-and-lime in his other hand: &quot;Oh, mate, its finally happened - you&apos;re more dad than human now.&quot; Next week: Ros Coward", "sentences": ["I was allowed to share a hotel room not with Jordi, the male model from Amsterdam, but with Colin, the neuroscientist from Leipzig."], "title": "The stag-do dad", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/07/familyandrelationships2", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-06T23:11:13Z", "article": "Blanket media coverage of the 2006 World Cup was lit up, even for people who think Tord Grip is a new hair straightener, thanks to the effortlessly photogenic presence of the England squad&apos;s WAGs. So what is there to distract lovers of high fashion and conspicuous consumption this summer, since England have failed to qualify for Euro 2008? Here&apos;s our introduction to a few of the women who you might just see peering out from oversized designer sunglasses in the weeks to come. The star players Sylvie van der Vaart, wife of Rafael van der Vaart (Netherlands) This Dutch VJ and her superstar midfielder hubby would surely be Holland&apos;s answer to Posh and Becks, had Posh taken the career path of Donna Air, and had Becks been blessed with what is known in the game as &quot;Phil Neville jaw&quot;. Rafael&apos;s career path has been not dissimilar too, as he was stripped of the captaincy of Ajax Amsterdam in 2004 by a no-nonsense coach who seemed to resent his frequent appearances at parties with Sylvie. That didn&apos;t stop the couple marrying in a lavish ceremony broadcast live on Dutch TV in 2005. Despite his move to unglamorous Hamburg, they now pose for 24-page photoshoots, then claim to be &quot;very private people&quot;. A Google image search will reveal them indulging in pillow fights, enjoying a woodland walk, and cuddling up in their sumptuous home. Yet they are national treasures, to the point where Dutch parliament discussed what should be done to tackle crude terrace chants aimed at Sylvie. What&apos;s the Dutch for &quot;sticks and stones...&quot;? Alena Seredova, girlfriend of Gianluigi Buffon (Italy) Ever since George Best first breathed alcohol-scented sweet nothings into Miss World&apos;s ear, footballers and beauty queens have naturally gravitated towards each other. The 1998 winner of Miss Czech Republic, who holds the outsized hand of Italy&apos;s goalkeeper, also ticks another essential box for Euro WAGs in that she has made regular appearances on Italian television, invariably on game shows or &quot;comedy&quot; shows that make Benny Hill look like Jerry Seinfeld. To clinch the treble, she also models. During the 2006 World Cup, she took part in a football-themed fashion show for underwear manufacturer Triumph, sporting a bra with cups shaped like footballs bulging in a goal net. Nereida Gallardo, girlfriend of Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) The girlfriend of Manchester United&apos;s Madeiran wonderkid may be from humble stock, working part time in a nursing home (and modelling topless the rest of the time, as the tabloids recently felt duty bound to reveal along with full pictorial evidence) but Ronnie clearly values her enough to buy her a \u00a325,000 pair of earings in the shape of the legend R7 (in celebration of his initial and shirt number). Earlier this season, the Sun reported an Old Trafford onlooker making the convincing-sounding statement: &quot;Her earrings sparkled under the floodlights and we all instantly realised they were dedicated to Ronaldo.&quot; Nereida (which, as you surely know, means water nymph) met Ronaldo in a nightclub (where else?) in Mallorca in January, and since then they are said to have been &quot;inseparable&quot;. Apart from when he&apos;s on the pitch of course, that might hinder his famous step-overs slightly. The bad girls Nuria Berm\u00fadez, girlfriend of Dani G\u00fciza (Spain) A legend among WAGs. A passionate Real Madrid fan, Nuria once claimed to &quot;know&quot; the whole squad, and no one took that to mean she merely played the odd game of Scrabulous with them on Facebook. It was she who vowed, &quot;I will bed David Beckham,&quot; on his arrival in the Spanish capital, and she even hid behind a bush on one occasion so she could spring up beside him and sell the pre-arranged photographs to the gossip magazines. However, more recently she seems to have put her talents to more constructive use, as a Uefa-licensed football agent. One of her clients, Daniel Gonz\u00e1lez G\u00fciza, became her lover; she helped broker a \u20ac5m move to Real Mallorca, and this previously erratic, underachieving striker became one of the Primera Liga&apos;s top scorers, something his manager put down to his settled domestic life. Back of the net! Belen Rodriguez, girlfriend of Marco Borriello (Italy) After her fiance, Genoa forward Marco Borriello, failed a drugs test in December 2006, she bravely sprung to his defence, and thenceforth into the gossip pages. His failed test, she claimed, was the result of him applying ointment to his privates for an STD which he had caught from her, which happened to contain the banned substance cortisone. &quot;I advised him to use the ointment but forgot it contained cortisone. Our sex session proved fatal,&quot; she explained. We&apos;ve all been there. The model professionals No\u00e9mie Lenoir, wife of Claude Makelele (France) Mrs Makelele is one WAG who should be a familiar face to anyone who has looked at the 30 per cent of UK billboard ads which don&apos;t feature Myleene bloody Klass. Noemie is one of the models photographed frolicking around in her underwear with Laura Bailey, Twiggy and Erin O&apos;Connor. Oh and actually Myleene&apos;s in that one as well. Why? She is also keen to break into acting, and has had small parts in a couple of Hollywood films, including the critically acclaimed, impressionistic arthouse masterpiece Rush Hour 3. Oksana Andersson, fiance of Christian Wilhelmsson (Sweden) Some would have you believe that WAGs have no talent of their own. Yet as Oksana points out on her website, she used to be a dancer with &quot;international famous pop group Sunblock&quot; who specialise in Bundes-house remixes of 1980s cheese such the Baywatch theme I&apos;ll Be Ready. After that hit, we are told, &quot;her career increased in every direction&quot;. Thankfully, it&apos;s heading away from the UK charts - Sunblock&apos;s last effort only got to No 16.  \u00b7 Euro 2008, Sat, 4.30pm, BBC1", "sentences": ["Rafael&apos;s career path has been not dissimilar too, as he was stripped of the captaincy of Ajax Amsterdam in 2004 by a no-nonsense coach who seemed to resent his frequent appearances at parties with Sylvie."], "title": "A game of other halves: Johnny Sharp scouts the Euro WAGs limbering up for the cup", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/07/features16.theguide", "tags": ["Culture", "Euro 2008", "Football", "Sport", "Life and style", "Fashion"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-06T23:14:30Z", "article": "Stoners. What are they good for? Absolutely nothing! They spend years adrift on their couches, limbs splayed to all four points of the compass, staring slack-jawed at the TV or playing video games, which for them counts as strenuous exercise. Otherwise they&apos;re forever going down on their bongs, sucking up a chamberful of hot, sweet smoke, letting it cool as it bubbles up through the water before unthumbing that carburettor and letting a fat, mind-bending lungful rush down their throats. Cue much explosive coughing, bloodshot eyes, and several more hours of zoned-out stasis and heroic underachievement. I ask you: Could these people ever run a revolution? Could they bring a society to its very knees and then remake it in their own bleary-eyed image? Fat chance, but the decades-long American paranoia about marijuana is predicated precisely on the notion that that is exactly what the potheads and the weirdos have in mind. The Straights and The Squares and The Narcs and The Man are so convinced that potheads constitute a threat to society that the potheads become rebels, insurgents and anarchists almost by default. And why? Because pot makes the people who don&apos;t smoke it even more paranoid than the people who do. So where better to find Harold and Kumar, the most keen-eyed and satirical of all the pothead duos, than locked up in Guant\u00e1namo Bay in their latest film? Because wherever there is idiocy on the part of authority, there you shall you also find Harold and Kumar - stoned to the gills - and they&apos;re the only people making any sense. Over the last few years, the wake-n-bake likes of Harold and Kumar, Bill and Ted, Jesse and Chester from Dude, Where&apos;s My Car?, Redman and Method Man in How High, the kids from Dazed And Confused, That 70s Show, the forthcoming Pineapple Express, and pretty much everyone in every Judd Apatow movie have come to resemble a new breed of hero. As harmless but enthusiastic potheads, they constitute an anarchic threat because, well, basically they don&apos;t give a shit, can&apos;t deal with schedules or squares or assholes or jobs, and wanna be left alone to smoke out. This is just too much for law enforcement, fun-ophobes, ambitious politicians, bluenoses, and devotees of the Protestant work ethic, so a great pointless war on drugs, even on harmless weed, has been waged for five decades to no discernible deterrent effect. The war on terror draws inspiration from the same paranoid well, and the new Homeland Security infrastructure looks for all the world like a gigantic, hypertrophied version of the Drug Enforcement Agency. If you want a subversive movie, consider this: Harold And Kumar Escape From Guant\u00e1namo Bay says more cogent and pertinent things about post-9/11 America than all the socially responsible and endlessly dreary war on terror movies combined. Sure, it has the usual gross-out moments and gay-panic alerts, shit-and-zit jokes and mucho smokage, dude, but, as with its predecessor (US title: Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle), it also carries an undercurrent of jokes about America&apos;s transformation into a &quot;post-racial&quot; society, where it becomes harder and harder to say what an &quot;American&quot; looks like. Asian-American Harold and Indian-American Kumar fetch up at GitMo after Kumar produces his scary-looking &quot;smokeless bong&quot; on a flight to Amsterdam. An old white lady - who has already hallucinated an image of Kumar dressed like Bin-Laden - mistakes the word &quot;bong&quot; for &quot;bomb&quot; and all hell breaks loose. This brings them to the attention of the racist head of Homeland Security (Rob Corddry), who sees all non-whites as foreigners and who at one point proudly wipes his ass on the Bill of Rights. He thinks he&apos;s found in Harold and Kumar the wet dream of Homeland Security paranoids: a working alliance between Al Qaida and North Korea, and his racist outbursts soar high on wings of idiocy and extremism. It&apos;s easy to tell who the villains are, and most of them are white. But it&apos;s not just some spasm of reverse racism. Everybody&apos;s stereotype is up for display and for demolition. Harold accords with the perception of Asian-Americans as &quot;the model minority&quot; - hardworking, studious, and something of a control freak (&quot;Don&apos;t fuck with my presets,&quot; he tells Kumar in White Castle when the latter fiddles with his car radio. To which the freewheeling Kumar replies, &quot;Dude, your whole life is on preset!&quot;). Kumar doesn&apos;t accord with any particular stereotype of equally industrious Americans of Indian ancestry, being eternally horny, party-hearty and in no hurry to take up the medical profession he&apos;s so gifted in. Their Jewish neighbours Goldstein and Rosenberg tell some of the sickest Jewish jokes I&apos;ve ever heard. When asked how good Katie Holmes&apos;s breasts look in The Gift, Goldstein offers this: &quot;You know the Holocaust? OK, the exact opposite of that!&quot; Elsewhere in both movies, other stereotypes are upended: the looming, scary-looking black guy turns out to be a sweet-natured dentist; the Klansman has a tastefully appointed, Architectural Digest-style home; and when Homeland Security pedantically question Harold&apos;s parents in Korean, they respond - surprise, surprise - in perfect, unaccented English. Harold and Kumar are the latest in a long line of pothead-rebels that stretches all the way back to Cheech and Chong, and there is a broad similarity between all of these stoner duos. They&apos;re all hedonistic innocents, living before the Fall in the Garden of Weeden, but The Man won&apos;t leave them be. They&apos;re so puppyishly devoted to one another that you wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they slept innocently in the same bed, like Laurel and Hardy or Morecambe and Wise. If they and the countless stoners of recent movie history have a political outlook, it is essentially live-and-let-live left-libertarianism, alloyed with disdain and pity for those too uptight to get down. But if there&apos;s one thing that can bridge all manner of irreconcilable differences, it&apos;s Sweet Lady Mary Jane. Ever since Cheech and Chong got narcotics cop Stacy Keach high in Up In Smoke, one of the stoner genre&apos;s most predictable rites - like the gunfight in a western - is the moment when the villain gets stoned. Method and Red lace the dean of Harvard&apos;s brownies with pot to remind him he&apos;s still a black man, H&amp;K go to GitMo achieves a new pinnacle in this area, in that they toke up and smoke out with Dubya, the priznit himself. And it&apos;s Dubya who&apos;s holding the killer buds. Their stoned interlude ends with choruses of, &quot;Dude, you&apos;re awesome!&quot; &quot;Nah, you guys are awesomer!&quot; Imagine what pot could achieve for the Israelis and the Palestinians. Like it or not, marijuana is as American as apple pie and as old as the young republic, as How High, the finest stoner comedy of all, reminds us. In the final sequence - don&apos;t ask how - the ghost of Benjamin Franklin, founding father and hemp farmer (just like George Washington) is summoned from the dead to demonstrate his 200-year-old, self-designed super-bong, which he calls his &quot;Liberty Bong&quot; and a sly connection is thus established between the live-free-or-die-trying/don&apos;t-tread-on-me mentality that gave birth both to America and that zonked-out stoner on the couch. Even the film&apos;s Al Gore-alike US vice president (a sublime Jeffrey Jones) happily huffs his share of Ben&apos;s bong hits. As Franklin urges, in the spirit of comity and goodwill to all men, &quot;Light that shit, smoke that shit... and passssssss that shit!&quot; That&apos;s a prescription for unity for all you heads on the couch, luxuriating beneath your overhanging blue-grey fug of pot smoke. \u00b7 Harold and Kumar... is out now", "sentences": ["Asian-American Harold and Indian-American Kumar fetch up at GitMo after Kumar produces his scary-looking &quot;smokeless bong&quot; on a flight to Amsterdam."], "title": "John Patterson: Harold and Kumar are blazing a trail for a new breed of Hollywood hero", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/07/2", "tags": ["Culture", "Film"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-07T23:01:00Z", "article": "The nervous flyer &apos;I want to go the distance, but slowly&apos;, Kate Daniels, 55, family therapist, from London The brief: &apos;I&apos;m afraid of flying and don&apos;t like it for environmental reasons either. I fancy travelling slowly, perhaps on horseback. I love ferries and boats too - the idea of a canal boat journey somewhere through Europe is appealing. I don&apos;t mind camping, but quite like the idea of something a little bit extravagant, too.&apos; The budget: \u00a31,000 for a week, to \u00a31,800 for two weeks The solution: Laura Burgess from Ecoescape: &apos;There are no end of options for slow travel in the UK and Ireland. On horseback, try Free Rein Riding Holidays in Wales (01497 821356; free-rein.co.uk) which offers two- to six-day guided trails. Its three-day &apos;Onto the Trail&apos; tour is designed for beginners and the price (\u00a3435) includes two nights&apos; B&amp;B in local inns. &apos;Alternatively, take to the water on one of the UK&apos;s canals. Hire a narrowboat with Waterways Holidays (0845 127 1020; waterwaysholidays.com) and navigate your way through the locks in Shakespeare Country, starting in Tardebigge and visiting Stratford-upon-Avon, Tewkesbury and Worcester (prices for a week on a boat sleeping up to four start at \u00a3450).  &apos;Otherwise let someone else do the work by staying on a hotel boat. Away4Awhile (0845 644 5144; away4awhile.co.uk) offers a range of hotel boat cruises on canals in the Midlands (weekend breaks start at \u00a3350pp full board).&apos; Andy Brabin from Railbookers: &apos;We would suggest Kate takes the train to Venice, Florence and Rome, spending a couple of nights in each city with transfers by first-class Eurostar Italia train. Kate won&apos;t have to go near an airport for this trip; she can enjoy the journey through the Italian countryside as well as the historic destinations, and on arrival in Venice she can take to the water with a trip on Venice&apos;s Grand Canal. A package including overnight sleeper travel from London to Venice, and Rome to London, train transfers between Venice, Florence and Rome and six nights in three-star hotels with breakfast, would cost from \u00a3819.&apos; Laura Johnson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;For boats, Brittany has some excellent routes, with a great choice of waterways, from wide river estuaries to canals. If Kate feels confident she could take a boat herself, full instruction is given. A week costs from \u00a3975 with Blakes Holiday Boating (0870 2202 498; blakes.co.uk), but the boats sleep four if Kate wants to go with friends.  &apos;For the second week, perhaps camp at Le Grand M\u00e9tairie (00 33 2 9752 2401; lagrandemetairie.com), just outside Carnac, so not only would you have the beautiful beaches of Brittany but the ancient standing stones to explore. Prices start at \u00a3693 for a fully equipped tent (for up to four), with car ferry crossings from Dover to Calais from \u00a335 each way, so you are well within budget.&apos; The student adventurer &apos;A low-cost post-exam break with my mates&apos;, Elliott Bannister, 16, student, from Northampton The brief: &apos;By the beginning of July I will have finished my GCSEs and am looking for a well-earned break, but won&apos;t fly for environmental reasons. I want something adventurous, not a beach holiday - and would prefer not to stay in a hotel. I will probably be travelling with a couple of friends. The journey will be a big part of the adventure. I don&apos;t mind how we get there: long train or bus rides are fine. I&apos;ll have lots of time but a limited budget.&apos; The budget: \u00a3500 for as long as it lasts The solution: Vincent Dedecker from Rail Europe: &apos;An InterRail trip (interrailnet.com) is a great way to see Europe, meet people and immerse yourself in new cultures, as well as being a green way to travel. High-speed lines connect many major cities, cutting down on journey times and giving you more time to explore. Save money on accommodation by taking overnight trains between international destinations - you pay a small &apos;passholder fare&apos; on some trains, but this will often be cheaper than a hotel. As you are under 18, you&apos;ll need to carry a letter of permission from your parents or guardians, or a completed Unaccompanied Minors form (available when you book your tickets) if you start your trip on Eurostar. A one-month Global InterRail pass costs \u00a3339 and covers travel in up to 29 countries. Single-country passes are also available for 27 European countries.&apos; Laura Burgess from Ecoescape: &apos;I&apos;d suggest a Scottish odyssey. Start in London by taking an overnight sleeper (0845 601 5929; firstgroup.com/scotrail) to Edinburgh. Singles start at \u00a319. Book one of Wild in Scotland&apos;s tours (0131 478 6500; wildinscotland.com) from Edinburgh and cover a range of locations in the Highlands and Islands. I recommend the nine-day Island Hopper Tour travelling to the Orkneys and Outer Hebrides, as well as Loch Ness and the Trossachs. This costs \u00a3480 including contribution to the group kitty, basic accommodation and good local food. If there&apos;s money left over, try hostelling around Scotland (0870 155 3255; syha.org.uk). Loch Ossian in the Highlands is one of the greenest hostels in the country - reached by train and a mile&apos;s walk from Corrour station (from \u00a314 a night). Even more remote is Jenny&apos;s Bothy (019756 51449; jennysbothy.co.uk) in the Cairngorms. Beds cost just \u00a39 a night and the local Heatherhopper buses offer free cycle carriage.&apos;  Andrea Robinson from STA Travel: &apos;How about exploring Eastern Europe by bus? You can buy a student Eurostar ticket to Paris with STA Travel from \u00a347 return and then get on a hop-on hop-off bus tour to Eastern Europe with Busabout (020 7950 1661; busabout.com), which costs \u00a3299. The Northern loop route takes in 10 cities including Amsterdam, Berlin, Dresden, Prague and the pretty town of Cesky Krumlov in southern Bohemia, which has become a huge hit with backpackers in recent years thanks to its laidback hostels and riverside picnic spots. You could spend as long as you want at each stop and then just jump on the next bus when you&apos;re ready to move on. There are other &quot;loops&quot; in Italy, southern France and Spain. A flexitrip pass, where you choose your own route, costs \u00a3259 and includes six stops.&apos; The young family &apos;Find us an easy-going driving holiday&apos;, Lisa Wragg, 36, product manager, husband Adam Wragg, 41, head of graphics, and Georgia, two, from Nottingham The brief: &apos;With a two-year-old we&apos;re keen to avoid airport hassles and just throw everything we need in the car and go. We&apos;ll have about two weeks and don&apos;t want to spend the whole time driving, but a holiday that maybe combines the coast and the countryside could be good. We like France but wouldn&apos;t mind trying somewhere else instead. As for accommodation, we&apos;re flexible, and are happy in small hotels, guesthouses or self-catering. Any suggestions?&apos; The budget: \u00a32,000 for two weeks The solution: Laura Johnson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;You can take your car to Spain from Portsmouth to Bilbao from only \u00a3299 each way with P&amp;O Ferries (08716 645645; poferries.com) and then we could book you into the fabulous Parador hotels in Spain, which are lovely state-owned properties across the country. A lot of them are converted castles, monasteries or nunneries, which would be a fantastic way to discover the real Spain. They have all been meticulously preserved and maintained to give you the best possible standard of accommodation, most are good for children, and with prices from \u00a336 per person per night they are excellent value for money.&apos; Laura Burgess from Ecoescape: &apos;County Wicklow, south of Dublin, offers coast and country to explore, and you can get there in a day from Nottingham. Stena Line (08705 204204; stenaline.co.uk) runs regular ferries from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire, from where you can drive to the Old Milking Parlour (00 353 4044 8206; ballymurrin.ie in Ballymurrin in under an hour. Use this renovated Quaker cottage as your base and explore the nearby hills or visit Mount Usher Gardens (00 353 4044 8206; mountushergardens.ie). Otherwise make the most of long sandy beaches such as Brittas Bay. The cottage is elegant and eco-friendly, with its under-floor geothermal heating and wood-burning stove. Children are welcome and there&apos;s a selection of play equipment provided in the garden. Two weeks will cost between \u00a3950 and \u00a31,558.&apos;  Bill Gibbons from the Passenger Shipping Association: &apos;Travel by ferry is a convenient, family-friendly and stress-free way to travel to Europe and Ireland. They can take as much luggage as they like for no extra cost, enjoy short check-in times, travel with their own car and relax on board. Most ferries have children&apos;s facilities and kids can also stretch their legs and run about .  &apos;Brittany Ferries (0871 244 1400; brittanyferries.co.uk) offers 14-night villa breaks on the northern coast of Spain from \u00a31,740 providing easy access to both the countryside and the coast, including return crossings from Plymouth to Santander for two adults, one car and a two-year-old child with a four-berth cabin suite each way.  &apos;Alternatively, head to northern Europe and explore Denmark with DFDS Seaways (0871 522 9955; dfds.co.uk) which offers cottage and villa breaks that are ideal for families. Sailing from Harwich to Esbjerg, stay at the Seawest Holiday Centre in the beautiful region of Vestjylland (from \u00a31,502 for eight nights with a car and two people sharing a cabin - a two-year old travels free - including two nights onboard DFDS and six nights at Seawest).&apos; The dog owner &apos;Where can I take my four-legged friend?&apos;, Jossy Smalley, 45, freelance journalist , and her dog, Santa, from Worthing The brief: &apos;I&apos;d love to take a trip with my active Jack Russell cross. Hiking would be good - the UK perhaps, preferably the south west, but France would also be great. I know Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re well and walking there would be lovely. It&apos;s easiest to drive, but we could travel by train. He has a passport, but may need some checks or vaccinations. It&apos;s harder than you might think to find accommodation that accepts dogs. I&apos;m flexible on whether it&apos;s hotel, B&amp;B, self-catering or camping.&apos; The budget: \u00a31,000 for a week The solution: Laura Johnson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;I&apos;d suggest driving to France: we can arrange ferry crossings from \u00a335 one way. The French love animals so a lot of places are geared to your needs. &apos;Check that Santa&apos;s vaccinations are all up to date well in advance. In the Alps, stay in Chamonix, as some of the winter ski resorts are not fully open in summer. H\u00f4tel Mercure Chamonix Centre (00 33 4 5053 0756; mercure.com) charges from \u00a3595 for a week&apos;s B&amp;B and welcomes dogs.  &apos;In this country, try West Venn farm in Devon (01409 211246; westvenncottages.co.uk). Its converted barns are near Dartmoor and they are only 16 miles from the coast, with prices from \u00a3475 a week plus \u00a325 for your pet.&apos; Laura Burgess from Ecoescape: &apos;You can take up to two dogs for free on First Great Western Trains to the south west (0845 700 0125; firstgreatwestern.co.uk). Change at Exeter for a train to Umberleigh in north Devon and stay at Millbrook Cottages (0800 298 2288; millbrookcottages.co.uk), where dog-friendly apartments sleeping two cost \u00a3320 a week. The cottages are close to the Tarka Trail for country walks. Or take the train to Bodmin Parkway, and treat the hound to the slightly pricier Trevenna (01579 320013; trevenna.co.uk). &apos;Converted barns cost from \u00a3560 a week and there are 142 acres for dogs and owners to enjoy. For more strenuous walking, attempt Rough Tor on Bodmin Moor - Cornwall&apos;s second-highest point. For B&amp;B, try Rezare Farmhouse (01579 371214; rezarefarmhouse.co.uk) in the Tamar Valley. Food is all home-grown or from local suppliers, and the Tamar Valley railway runs from Plymouth to Gunnislake nearby.&apos; Vincent Dedecker from Rail Europe: &apos;Unfortunately, only guide dogs are permitted on Eurostar, so you would need to cross the Channel by ferry. In France, dogs can be carried on trains if they are on leads and muzzled or in a carrying box (under 6kg). You will pay a fixed fare per journey of around \u00a34.50 for a dog in a box, or 50 per cent of the full fare for a dog on a lead. If you take an overnight train from Paris to Bourg St Maurice (the closest station to Val D&apos;Is\u00e8re), you would need to book an entire couchette. Fares from Calais to Bourg St Maurice start at \u00a3233 return with sole occupancy of a four-berth couchette, or from \u00a3178 on day trains, leaving most of the budget for renting somewhere in Val D&apos;Is\u00e8re.&apos; The thrill seekers &apos;Can you send us to Wales ... and beyond?&apos;, Emma Critchley, underwater photographer, 27, and Angus Light, location manager and photographic producer, 32, from London  The brief: &apos;It&apos;s great being able to go on holiday without flying, and mid-Wales is one of our favourite places - there are good train connections and plenty of outdoor activities, from kite-surfing and sailing at Aberdyfi, to mountain biking in the hills around Machynlleth or walking in the mountains.

Some of Bollywood&apos;s biggest names - virtually unknown in the west but huge stars across Asia - arrived in Bangkok last week to promote the industry, which has had a lean year thanks to the arrival of the country&apos;s wildly popular domestic cricket league, which has kept audiences out of cinemas for the past six weeks. Launched by the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) eight years ago, the event has become a pit stop for global cinema buffs. The inaugural ceremony was held in London and in past years has been to Amsterdam, South Africa and, in recognition of the British diaspora&apos;s contribution, Yorkshire. Although Thailand has not traditionally provided big Bollywood audiences, police struggled to control the crowds who turned up to see the stars attend the Sarkar Raj preview on Friday. The dark political thriller, based on the real-life controversy around an Enron power plant built in India a decade ago, is the kind of new-wave cinema Bollywood wants to show the world - an Indian movie with an international feel that goes beyond the traditional song-and-dance format. The movie, which stars Indian megastar Amitabh Bachchan, is the follow-up to the 2005 film Sarkar, which borrows heavily from American classic The Godfather. Another mould-breaking movie is likely to be the slick sci-fi flick Love Story 2050 and the much-hyped thriller Mission Istanbul. The Indian film industry, which churns out hundreds of movies a year, has revenues of more than \u00a31bn, a fraction of what Hollywood earns. However, sales are growing. Bachchan told reporters that the unique culture of Bollywood has protected it from being subsumed by the Hollywood movie machine. &quot;The way Hollywood was able to destroy most of the other cinemas in the west - whether it was Italian, French or German, or British even - it will have a tougher time in India because there is a cultural difference.&quot; Keen to associate themselves with global causes, the big names of Bollywood, including Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, waltzed down a green carpet, instead of red, to spread awareness about global warming. On Friday, the head of the UN&apos;s Nobel-prizewinning climate panel took centre stage to call for greater efforts to stop climate change. Rajendra Pachauri accepted a special global leadership award and praised the event&apos;s host, Bachchan, for advocating action against climate change during the weekend gala. &quot;Change in the climate system of the world is unequivocal,&quot; he said after accepting the award. &quot;We rapidly have to bring about the stabilisation of Earth&apos;s climate.&quot; He also delivered a presentation highlighting the science behind his panel&apos;s forecast for the world.", "sentences": ["The inaugural ceremony was held in London and in past years has been to Amsterdam, South Africa and, in recognition of the British diaspora&apos;s contribution, Yorkshire."], "title": "Bollywood stars out in force for film industry awards in Bangkok", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/09/news.india", "tags": ["Film", "India", "World news", "Thailand", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-09T23:01:00Z", "article": "&apos;Is this your first time on the sleeper?&quot; says the middle-aged woman in charge of my coach as she shows me to my tiny compartment. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;OK, I&apos;ll give you a quick run-through.&quot; She shows me how the sink unfolds, the blind pulls up, the door latch works, and where to find the hammer you need to break the window in the event of an emergency, or extreme claustrophobia. I&apos;ve been allocated the top bunk; the bottom is marked &quot;NRS&quot; on matron&apos;s sheet. &quot;That&apos;s a new one on me,&quot; she says. This is slightly worrying, as the compartment is barely big enough for me, let alone Mr NRS as well. I am taking the train from Euston to Fort William, the longest sleeper journey you can make on our tight little island at just over 12 hours. You settle down in damp, gloomy London in the evening and wake up, assuming you have managed to get some sleep, amid the beauty and serenity of the Scottish Highlands. &quot;Nice assignment,&quot; a fellow passenger tells me later, failing to appreciate the tensions of the creative process. Sleepers are in the spotlight because First Great Western has announced that it will no longer put strangers together on the sleeper from London to Cornwall. &quot;It is considered more appropriate in the modern age to allow people their privacy,&quot; says a spokesman. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t expect to share a hotel room with a stranger and nor should you expect to share a sleeper carriage with someone you don&apos;t know.&quot; Sharing on the London-Cornwall service has, in the past, saved you a tenner, which does indeed seem an economy too far, though if you&apos;re doing it every week maybe you&apos;re prepared to put up with close proximity to a stranger to save \u00a3500 a year. A friend who makes the journey regularly says the compartment is too small - and far too intimate - for both occupants to change into their nightclothes at the same time. A diplomatic absence is necessary. He also complains of the drunks who stumble back to the shared compartment in the early hours of the morning and try to get into the wrong bunk. I pray that Mr NRS does not make a late appearance. First also runs the sleeper service to Scotland, and says it is considering whether to end sharing by strangers on this line, too. Ellen Wacher, who I meet in the restaurant car soon after we&apos;ve pulled out of Euston, reckons that&apos;s &quot;ridiculous&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve travelled widely on sleepers in south-east Asia and I don&apos;t see any problem with sharing,&quot; she says. &quot;Is this aversion to sharing a peculiarly British thing, part of our insular, island mentality?&quot; Her question is rhetorical; she clearly thinks it is. Ellen and husband Tim are going to Fort William for a couple of days for Tim&apos;s birthday. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t consider ourselves train anoraks, but we do enjoy travelling by train,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s the only civilised way to travel,&quot; adds Ellen.  Tim has a question, too - and a theory. &quot;Is stopping sharing being used as an excuse to close the service down?&quot; he wonders. &quot;As I understand it, the Cornish service has been under threat. I used to work for the railways back in the 60s, and the great way to close them was to somehow get the traffic down and then they could turn around and say, &apos;We can&apos;t justify running it&apos;.&quot;  I&apos;ve settled into the restaurant car with Ellen, Tim and half a dozen other passengers to enjoy the poetry of the journey. The poetry is not helped by the fact that the train makes an early stop at Watford Junction and then glides through Hemel Hempstead, but somehow the spirit still soars. Ellen says her dream is to travel on the Trans-Siberian Express, but this is enough to be going on with. I admire her defence of sharing with strangers, but I&apos;m secretly rather glad that Mr NRS hasn&apos;t shown up. That compartment really is too small: what if his feet smelled, or he snored, or he was planning to re-enact the murder on the Orient Express as we passed through Preston? In any case, I&apos;ve decided Mr NRS is a Gogol-esque joke on the part of the rail company. They&apos;ve probably rumbled the fact that I&apos;m a journalist and are anxious for me to avoid the excessive intimacy of the shared experience. I&apos;ve shared sleepers abroad and the experiences have been mixed. Once I hopped on a train in Paris at the last minute and got the last berth on the sleeper to Venice. My three companions in the compartment were all women, and they looked horrified when I sweatily joined them. I had the top bunk, didn&apos;t get a moment&apos;s sleep, and had a smelly pair of shoes that I tried to lock inside a cupboard next to my pillow. It was 14 hours of hell - for all of us. I also took a sleeper once from Delhi to Kolkata and that was fun, sharing with two middle-aged businessmen who regaled me with tales of life in India and insisted on sharing their tiffin, too. Here was an experience that added to one&apos;s pleasure and understanding, but somehow I couldn&apos;t see that being replicated en route to Crewe.  While not exotic - all the meals come out of tins - the restaurant car on the Caledonian Sleeper is pleasant enough. Cheap, too: salmon p\u00e2t\u00e9 is \u00a33, a plate of haggis, neeps and tatties \u00a34, half a litre of Tennent&apos;s lager \u00a31.80. It is said that the service is protected by the phalanx of Scottish MPs who rely on its comforts, and they appear to have preserved their subsidised food and drink as well. The haggis, in redcurrant and whisky sauce, is excellent. The Tennent&apos;s is pretty good, too. &quot;The bar will be closing at 1.30am,&quot; matron tells me. &quot;We want to make sure you get some sleep.&quot; Paul Donaldson, a regular on the Fort William service, is sitting in the restaurant car with his laptop. He says he gets to the Highlands as often as he can to clear his head. &quot;There&apos;s something quite magical about leaving a metropolis at quarter past nine, going to bed and then waking up and finding yourself suddenly transported into the west Scottish mountains,&quot; he says. &quot;Once we get past Glasgow and go up towards Loch Lomond, the scenery will open out. Today is an impulse for me: I wasn&apos;t planning to take the sleeper today - I&apos;ve got something on elsewhere later in the week - but I thought, &apos;Sod it, I&apos;m going to take a couple of days and go up there.&apos;&quot; Donaldson has no problems with sharing. &quot;If I share, I share; if I don&apos;t share, I don&apos;t share,&quot; he says philosophically. &quot;It doesn&apos;t bother me that a complete stranger is in the compartment. In fact, sometimes it makes it a more interesting experience. It&apos;s a very intimate space and trying to jostle each other to use the basin can be a challenge, but it&apos;s part and parcel of the whole thing. To tell you the truth, I think it might lose part of its appeal to people who are trying to find a tiny bit of adventure in a society which is becoming full of bubblegum. We live in a nanny state and, in deciding that they don&apos;t want strangers sharing, First Great Western are probably thinking in terms of liability issues.&quot; He sees the move away from sharing with strangers as part of a societal change. &quot;We have become a more private nation. We&apos;ve started to value our space and privacy more. I think that&apos;s probably a reflection of the intrusion that people feel they are having in their daily lives. They see their home space as theirs, and in an age of more and more intrusion they don&apos;t want their own sleeping habits invaded. You&apos;ve also got sexuality to worry about these days ...&quot; This last phrase is unfortunate, and Ellen is on to it in a flash. &quot;Excuse me, is that something new? Is sexuality something that&apos;s just happened?&quot; she demands. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s new, but there is more awareness of it now,&quot; replies Donaldson. &quot;I think the train company are covering their backs, so to speak, from allegations of improper behaviour.&quot; This is getting out of hand, and it&apos;s definitely time for another Tennent&apos;s. The waitress in the restaurant car is Suzie Kane. She has worked on the sleeper for seven years - one week on, one week off - and loves it. &quot;It&apos;s really interesting; you meet so many different kinds of people: lots of climbers and hill walkers going to Fort William, business travellers, lots of regulars who work in London and go back home for the weekend. We get to know them by name. It&apos;s a real family atmosphere.&quot; Though they do stop serving Tennent&apos;s in the wee small hours, the restaurant car is open all night for tea and coffee, so Suzie never gets to sleep. &quot;Normally after midnight most people are away to their beds,&quot; she says. &quot;I read my book and pass the time. I found it disorientating at first, but you get used to it.&quot; Matron, AKA my &quot;sleeper host&quot;, AKA Kate Parkington, is also taken with the camaraderie of the service. She&apos;s been going back and forth from Euston to Fort William for 16 years, having originally done it on as a summer relief job. &quot;You do get the odd obnoxious person,&quot; she says, &quot;but on the whole everyone is so friendly. There are some real regulars. We&apos;d had a landslip once and the service was cancelled for a couple of weeks. Then when I came back to work, coming out of London one of my regulars said, &apos;Oh Kate, it&apos;s lovely to see you,&apos; and gave me a big hug. That&apos;s nice. You&apos;ll not get that in Tesco&apos;s.&quot; Are people generally happy to share? &quot;On the whole we don&apos;t have any problems,&quot; she says. &quot;People accept the fact that they might be sharing. It&apos;s normally one of the first questions you get: &apos;Will I have somebody with me?&apos;&quot; Kate says she uses her discretion when it comes to allocating berths, and moves people around if she thinks someone will have trouble negotiating an upper bunk, or if two large people are down to share together.  &quot;Take tonight,&quot; she says. &quot;There were two gentlemen travelling separately but booked into the same compartment, and I&apos;ve moved one of them because he had quite a bit of luggage and he&apos;s a really big bloke. I try to be helpful if I can. If I can&apos;t I can&apos;t, and most people are prepared to accept that and will squeeze in together, but I thought this was going to be uncomfortable for them and I had an extra berth.&quot; Does she have problems with drunks? &quot;Stag parties can be interesting. As you can imagine, eight or 10 blokes, all giving it what for. Most of them are fine; they get a bit boozy, but you growl at them and they usually quieten down. If they are totally drunk, you have to say &apos;bed now, or off&apos;. We don&apos;t get too many of those. Male bonding parties are good, too. That&apos;s when you get the real drunks. I had a coach load of them one night and they were loud. They had been doing their bonding in the Highlands, and this was them coming back. You just have to be tough with them. Act tough.&quot; Lucky I didn&apos;t have that fourth can of Tennent&apos;s. By 1am the restaurant car is more or less empty. Suzie has settled into a corner with a thick thriller; Kate is learning Spanish with the help of a pocket dictionary; Ellen and Tim have gone to bed; Paul, though, is accessing Facebook on his computer and evidently has no intention of retiring. But I do and, shortly after a brief stop at Crewe, I head for my small but gloriously unoccupied compartment.  I get changed - it&apos;s a tight squeeze, even for one - and clamber unsteadily on to the top bunk, showing slavish devotion to what it says on my ticket. (Do I think Mr NRS will suddenly materialise in the middle of the night?) Miraculously, unlike continental sleepers, the bed can accommodate my 6ft 4in frame, though I find it more comfortable if I put my feet in the luggage rack. Crewe has been left far behind; Garelochhead, Crianlarich and Upper Tyndrum beckon. Who needs the Trans-Siberian Express? Lights out, I dream of the Scottish Highlands - and haggis in redcurrant and whisky sauce. I&apos;m not sure, however, that &quot;sleeper&quot; is the best term. &quot;Dozer&quot; might be more appropriate, as I don&apos;t think I&apos;m deeply asleep for the entire seven hours I spend in my bunk. The motion of the train takes some getting used to, and you&apos;re aware of every gear change. At 4am the train reaches Edinburgh, where it divides into three parts, with six carriages heading to Inverness, four to Aberdeen, and our intrepid two to Fort William. I&apos;d intended to get up at first light to see the sun rising over the highland peaks. Needless to say, I was still dozing - which was just as well as, according to the fools who did get up, there was no sun and the highland peaks were shrouded in mist. I never do manage to get the blind up, and it&apos;s still dark in my compartment when Kate calls me at 7.30am with a cup of tea and a plasticised croissant. Paul, the technophile, is already in the restaurant car, looking bouncy, carrying a large camera, and talking non-stop. He tells me we are about to pass through the highest station in Britain, which somehow fails to electrify me at 8.30 in the morning. The sheer emptiness of the moors is impressive, though: just heather, streams, lochs, randomly distributed rocks, small groups of deer and the occasional ruined house. Paul also tells me the trains on this line use a unique signalling system, though the precise nature of its uniqueness eludes me. We have now been travelling for 12 hours, but because of the seven-hour doze and my haggis-inflected dreams I have no sense of exhaustion. Nor have I experienced boredom, apart from during Paul&apos;s explanation of the unique signalling system. The seats in the restaurant car are large and well padded - which is handy because Paul and I are large and well padded, too.  This is proper, old-fashioned train travel, not the modern, battery-hen variety. The journey is an escape from life, not the sort of intensification of its worst features that commuting tends to be. No one is using a mobile, or listening to rap music, or even obsessing over sudoku. This is travel that permits self-reflection. &quot;And the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first time,&quot; as T S Eliot had it. Eliot, though, may never have visited Fort William, for here, as the town looms through the mist, reality intrudes. The first thing you see as the train lurches into the station is a branch of Lidl. The dreamy state of sleeperdom is over. But at least the gents in the station has a shower, and I only have 11 hours to kill before I take the sleeper back. I wonder if Lidl sells haggis. Sleeper etiquette Choosing a bunkSome train companies pre-allocate your bunk, but those that don&apos;t present an immediate issue: should you opt for the top or bottom bunk? Top tip: if you want more privacy, but don&apos;t mind hauling yourself up a ladder (carpeted, mind), head for the top bunk. It also means you don&apos;t have to unlock the door in the morning when the guard loudly knocks on the door with his key to herald what must rank - whatever train company you&apos;re travelling with - as the world&apos;s most disappointing breakfast. ConversationBe honest: you both wish the other wasn&apos;t there. So why bother with conversation? Do you really want to hear about how badly their regional sales team is performing this month? Exchange some pleasantries if you wish, but best to get tucked up and off to sleep as soon as possible. The only need-to-know is what time you both have to get up. Getting undressedAlways offer to leave the berth to allow the other passenger to disrobe in privacy. Being in very close proximity to a stranger half stepping into a pair of pyjamas when the train suddenly jerks violently is, as I can testify, an experience that will indelibly stain your brain. Preferably, the passenger using the top bunk gets undressed first so that they can then safely turn their back on the other passenger without fear of catching a Freudian slip in the shaving mirror. The reading lightYou may well have bought along a copy of Murder on the Orient Express to add a frisson of excitement, but staying up until midnight reading is sure to irritate your fellow passenger. Lights out at 11pm, please. Ear plugsYes. Unless you like to be kept awake by the snoring, flatulence and sleeptalking. The barDon&apos;t. Yes, sipping whisky until the wee hours has a James Bond-like appeal, but the reality is that bars on sleeper trains are a magnet for some of life&apos;s less appealing characters. Try to imagine an incoherent barfly from a Tom Waits song shooting the breeze with David Brent. All that&apos;s served up is a cocktail of melancholy, self-doubt and longing for a less transitory life.  The sinkThe squeamish - and women - should look away now. Sinks on sleepers are not just used for brushing teeth. They are there for the lazy and coarse among us -namely men - to relieve themselves. A guard I spoke to once said this is why they get people to share berths: the presence of another passenger helps with &quot;potty training&quot;. Brush your teeth before you set off. Leo Hickman   Great sleeper journeys of the world St Petersburg to Moscow on the Red ArrowThe Krasnaya Streyla (Red Arrow) has been the premier link between Moscow and St Petersburg since communist times, for party officials and well-heeled tourists alike. With lacy curtains at each window and immaculately dressed conductors in charge of each car, it departs at five minutes to midnight every day. It&apos;s no longer the only prestige option between these cities: the Nikolaevsky Express and the luxurious privately run Grand Express now give the Red Arrow a run for its money. Paris to Barcelona by TrainhotelThe Spanish know the value of a good sleeper train, and their unique &quot;trainhotels&quot; link Madrid with Paris and Lisbon, Barcelona with Paris, Zurich, Malaga and Milan, with elegant restaurant cars, a vibrant cafe-bar and cosy sleepers, including some gran clase sleepers with private shower and toilet. There&apos;s nothing better than travelling gran clase to Spain, a three-course meal in the restaurant rounded off with coffee and liqueurs, retiring to bed in a private room, then waking to coffee, croissants and wild Spanish scenery. Central Europe by City Night Line The Germans also know a thing or two about sleeper trains, and have invested in new air-conditioned sleeping-cars for their City Night Line overnight trains, some of them double-deck. If you&apos;re in the money you can book a deluxe compartment with private shower and toilet. The sleepers have made something of a comeback, and since December last year you can once again board an evening sleeper in Amsterdam and end up in Prague, Vienna, Copenhagen or Milan next morning, with breakfast included in the fare. Or how about Zurich to Berlin or Paris to Munich? The softly lit bistro car makes the perfect place for a drink or late dinner before heading off to bed. Paris to the Riviera on the Train BleuOfficially now just another Corail Lun\u00e9a overnight train (how the French Railways love their brand names), the staff at the Gare d&apos;Austerlitz know the true identity of this train full well, and still show it on the departure indicator as the celebrated Train Bleu. Once the only way for civilised travellers to reach the French Riviera, it now lacks proper wagons-lits, but its couchettes and reclining seats still link Paris with Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo every night. When you awake in your couchette and lift the blind, you&apos;ll find the train running along the fabulous C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur coastline, past millionaires&apos; villas and yacht-filled harbours. Along the Nile from Cairo to LuxorEvery night, two air-conditioned sleeper trains head up the Nile from Cairo to Luxor and Aswan. Well-used by tourists to this day, they offer private one- and two-bed compartments with comfortable upper and lower berths and a washbasin. There&apos;s also a club car for that welcome nightcap. Fall asleep as the train leaves the Cairo metropolis, wake with all the sights of the Nile valley outside your bedroom window, from dhows and cruise boats on the river to fellahin toiling in the fields among the palm trees. Delhi to Kolkata by Rajdhani ExpressThe most prestigious trains in India, the Rajdhani Expresses link Delhi with major cities such as Kolkata or Mumbai, overnight. They&apos;re fully air-conditioned, with a veg or non-veg curry included in the fare and served at your seat. At night, berths fold out and bedding is distributed by the attendant, as the train speeds across the subcontinent at up to 100mph. Today&apos;s Rajdhani may be fast and electric, but you will still wake to the tea vendor&apos;s cry of &quot;Chai, chai, garam chai&quot; as he walks the coaches selling his hot sweet tea. Beijing to Shanghai overnightEvery night, a fleet of modern air-conditioned sleeper trains whisk travellers from the Chinese capital to Shanghai at up to 125mph while they sleep. The four-berth &quot;soft sleeper&quot; compartments come with lace curtains, thickly padded berths and a traditional flask of hot water (for tea) wedged under the table. Your berth may even feature a personal TV screen. Why I hate sleepers I have only done it once, and it was miserable. The compartment was cramped but, I thought, sufficient. That was before I realised I would be sharing it with a student. Forget about personal space. If you are standing in a sleeping compartmentwith someone else you are, by definition, standing too close to them. So, for the nonsleeping portion of the journey, only one of you will be in there. I was happy to award temporary custody to the student, but that was before I saw the bar. Far from being a romantic mode of transport, the Inverness sleeper appeared to be a convenient way for alcoholics to travel in the company of other alcoholics. The bar car was packed and everyone, apart from a pairof bewildered American tourists, was plastered. I drank one beer in the corridor and read standing up for an hour. When I went back for a second, they were out of beer. At ten o&apos;clock I gave up and went to bed. I had the lower bunk. Every time you get out of the lower bunk and stand up, you are nose to nose with the person in the upper bunk, so I decided that once I had settled in for the night I would not move . But whenever the student in the upper bunk had business elsewhere \u2014 which he did, often \u2014 Ibecame convinced that he was going to step on my face. So I couldn&apos;t sleep. I finished my book, and then started it again. Eventually I drifted off , only to be woken at 7am by a purser who handed me a waffle and told me we were in a siding. If we&apos;re standing still, I thought, then this is no longer an unpleasant mode of transport. This is just jail. The train finally arrived seven hours late. On the way back I paid double for the same compartment, but without the student and, to be fair, it was still miserable.Tim Dowling", "sentences": ["The sleepers have made something of a comeback, and since December last year you can once again board an evening sleeper in Amsterdam and end up in Prague, Vienna, Copenhagen or Milan next morning, with breakfast included in the fare."], "title": "Stephen Moss travels on the sleeper service", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jun/10/railtravel.transport1", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Travel", "Transport", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-11T15:00:00Z", "article": "A watchtower at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Photograph: Tomas van Houtryve/AP The scandal of the US internment camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay continues to be a subject for film-makers. Alex Gibney&apos;s Oscar-winning documentary Taxi to the Dark Side, out this week, suggests that the place is not merely home to a new generation of torturers, but that the whole place is a giant theatre of cruelty with no intelligence value, a PR spectacle set up to persuade the public that something is being done about the &quot;war on terror&quot;.  For a while, we have been wondering what would be the first straight fiction feature solely about Guant\u00e1namo - and now we know. That honour goes to the stoner comedy Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay. The two dopehead idiots, played by John Cho and Kal Penn - already known to their fans for an epic journey to the nearest White Castle burger joint, after a spliff-induced attack of the munchies - find themselves mistaken for terrorists and imprisoned in Guant\u00e1namo. From here they make a sensational escape and embark on a terrifying cross-country journey across the US to Texas, where they hope to use an acquaintance&apos;s contacts with the Bush White House to secure a pardon. There was no press screening for this film for critics, and it appears mysteriously to have vanished from the complete list of movie releases issued to the media by the Film Distributors Association. Perhaps the distributors were nervous that it would provoke unhelpful press complaint. It is certainly crass and gross and adolescent and fantastically, unremittingly, confrontationally offensive. There is hardly anyone, from left or right, man or woman, religious or non-religious, who could not find themselves offended, although the movie shrinks from mentioning the word &quot;Islam&quot;. It is also often hilarious and brilliant. And it might even prove to be more important in cultural history than any of the impeccably serious documentaries. It marks the moment at which Hollywood could laugh at the &quot;war on terror&quot;. Is this a healthy new development, or an insidious way of making a joke of the whole thing? I&apos;m not sure. Is this a movie to be compared with Jerry Lewis&apos;s suppressed second world war comedy The Day the Clown Cried? Or is it the bastard great-grandson of Ernest Lubitsch&apos;s To Be or Not to Be in which Jack Benny laughs, &quot;We do the concentrating and the Poles do the camping&quot;? Again, I&apos;m not sure. But for liberals and non-liberals, Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is the most pleasurable guilty pleasure of the year. Harold and Kumar get on a plane bound for Amsterdam, keen to sample the drug culture. Impatient, Kumar gets into the lavatory and fires up a hi-tech bong of his own invention, which with its weird gas seepage, flashing blue lights, and crude black duct-tape, does look worryingly like a bomb. The toilet door crashes open and the passengers scream at the sight of it. &quot;It&apos;s a bong! It&apos;s a bong!&quot; shouts the dark-skinned Kumar, and amid the screams it sounds like he&apos;s shouting triumphantly: &quot;It&apos;s a bomb!&quot; They are taken for questioning by the Homeland Security chief, a paranoid anti-Semitic racist incompetent who doesn&apos;t like the look of Harold: &quot;What&apos;s up with his eyes?&quot; &quot;He&apos;s of Korean extraction, sir.&quot; &quot;Oh my God, North Korea has teamed up with al-Qaida. This thing is bigger than I thought.&quot; It is when Harold and Kumar are kitted out in their orange jumpsuits and find themselves in the Guant\u00e1namo cage that the film attains a kind of Zen level of offensiveness. Defiantly clinging to their injured patriotism, Harold and Kumar speak to the prisoners in the next cell, who so far from being innocent, or even ambiguous, are gloating Middle Eastern terrorists straight out of central casting. &quot;Some would call us &apos;heroes&apos;!&quot; jeers one, and claims that he wouldn&apos;t need to do what he does were it not for the hateful Americans, always eating doughnuts. Harold explodes with righteous anger: &quot;Fuck you, man, doughnuts are awesome!&quot; Later, when the guards come round to sexually abuse the prisoners, a disturbance enables Harold and Kumar to join in a general breakout and climb over the razor-wire fence by treading on the impaled corpse of a fellow escaper - one of the unrepentant terrorists, of course. The sheer bad taste of everything is, in its way, magnificent. As a fully paid-up liberal, I guess I was getting the finger right in my face, but then so were the neocons. For many, doing this kind of comedy material on this subject will be unforgivable.

They are less than loved in Brussels and avoided where possible. But national plebiscites are loved by eurosceptics parading as fighters for democracy and exploiting the populist potential of a simple yes-no vote to damn Brussels. Masterminding the new treaty last year, the German government structured the whole deal to avoid any popular votes. Ireland is the sole exception, being required to stage popular votes on EU treaties. The history of the referendum in the EU is very mixed. Countries generally have referendums on joining and vote yes. Only Norway has rejected membership by plebiscite (twice). Along with the Irish, the Danes have been an awkward squad, voting down the Maastricht treaty in 1992 and rejecting the single currency in 2000. The big shifts in the running of the EU were brought in with the 1987 single European act creating a single market, the Maastricht treaty creating the modern union and paving the way for the euro, and the Amsterdam treaty of 1999 consolidating the border-free continental Europe. Nice in 2001 changed the arrangements to accommodate the joining of eastern Europe. Ireland and Denmark held votes, both positive, on the single European act. The Danes triggered a rumpus by rejecting Maastricht in a referendum, before endorsing it when they were allowed to opt out of four policy areas. French Maastricht supporters scraped through on 51%. The Irish sparked another crisis by voting against Nice in 2001, endorsing it a year later when they obtained pledges on Irish neutrality. In 2005, the Lisbon treaty&apos;s precursor, the draft constitution, was killed off by Dutch and French referendums. Both EU founder members shocked Brussels by saying no, the French by almost 55%, the Dutch by 61%. Europe&apos;s future, being decided today, may hinge on such happenstance as the Irish weather.

Areas targeted in south London included Grove Park, Orpington and Croydon Tramlink depots and Dartford sidings. British Transport estimated the cost of the crimes to the rail industry to be at least \u00a3600,000.  Nine men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit criminal damage at Southwark Crown Court following a seven month investigation by British Transport Police, named Operation Shuttle. Four of the men were caught red handed through covert surveillance.  One of the gang, Andrew Gillman, 25, from Battersea, sprayed the outdoor set of the TV programme EastEnders while working for the BBC&apos;s art department. He had used a false name to get the job while on bail in late 2007.

Surely they were looking for someone else, someone who hadn&apos;t once dismissed Graduate Fashion Week in print as &quot;three-legged trousers on parade&quot;. George Monbiot, for example, who probably would have had a more sympathetic response to the student who described his collection as &quot;a response to the environment&quot; than &quot;But do you honestly think anyone will ever wear it?&quot; Perhaps it&apos;s because I&apos;m American. While I try not to play the national divide card too often (mainly because, for the past eight years, it really hasn&apos;t worked in my favour), I do think there is a different attitude between the British and American fashion worlds: the former sees its industry as an art, the latter as a business. Good things have emerged from both approaches: from the Americans, you get people such as Diane von Furstenberg coining the supremely functional wrap dress, or Gap with its pleasing basics. Over here you get Alexander McQueen with his dramatic and rather morbid dresses that may not be much good for wearing to Sainsbury&apos;s but are undeniably beautiful, and Topshop, with its cheerful, um, &quot;homages&quot; to patterned vintage clothes. But there are downsides to both, too, and while I fully concede that American fashion can err on the safe and dull side (too many jeans, too many khakis, too many T-shirts), I find the problems with the British approach more grating. Maybe it&apos;s because so many of the major fashion courses are run at art colleges in this country - Central St Martins, most famously - but there really is an overwhelming belief that art should take precedence over all other considerations, and that includes cost and wearability. Which is fine, I guess, but then designers don&apos;t really have too much room to complain when they don&apos;t make money from it: people will spend money on things they want to wear, not on expressions of a designer&apos;s self. Hence the annual articles bemoaning the depleted state of London Fashion Week, with more and more designers struggling financially or leaving the country. And, in my limited experience of fashion student shows, the worst examples of this are found in graduate shows. I think my favourite was a show that involved beleaguered male models in rubber catsuits and even more beleaguered female models near naked in what was allegedly the designer&apos;s &quot;comment on the Holocaust&quot;, a subject on which there truly has been insufficient comment, at least involving catsuits. Yes, I know I sound like the tyrannical father in some coming-of-age movie, shouting at his teenage son that he won&apos;t make any money playing in a band but should settle down and take a soul-destroying job in a bank instead. But, dammit, that father has a point: how many people do you know who have made money by playing a guitar? Food doesn&apos;t grow on trees, you know (well, not the good stuff, anyway.) So I was, all in all, a little surprised to be asked to be on the panel of judges that recommends to tutors which of their students should be put forward in the annual end-of-year gala to compete for the River Island Gold award, otherwise known as a \u00a320,000 cash prize, along with other accolades, for various categories, including womenswear, patterns and knitwear. This would involve spending one day watching graduate shows for eight solid hours. I was even more surprised that I said yes, but maybe they caught me in a rare good mood. I was less surprised, though, when in the first hour it looked like all my worst fears were about to be confirmed. As I took my seat next to my fellow judge, Christopher Brooke, one half of the decidedly artistic British label Basso &amp; Brooke and a former fashion graduate, I asked him if he ever thought about commercial concerns when he was a student. He looked a little nonplussed. &quot;Not really,&quot; he replied. I just thought, why can&apos;t I create things and get them in a magazine?&quot; There is something about the word &quot;create&quot; that always sets my teeth on edge. But then, something rather weird happened. I actually enjoyed myself. It helped that the majority of the collections were relatively wearable - the first outfit of the day was a tight red dress with bow detailing that I can easily imagine my friends wearing. But something else clicked within me, something verging on tolerance. &quot;Nice patterns,&quot; I wrote of an outfit that involved a bumble bee-like black and yellow stripe vest, metallic turquoise leggings and a bunched carpet where a skirt should be. Admittedly, patience did run out with an outfit that involves transparent dresses with padded hips. But just when I began to worry that I&apos;m too mean and mainstream, I saw that my far cooler neighbour had written down &quot;humpy prozzies&quot;. Much of my goodwill undoubtedly came from the students themselves, who were all so excited, so filled with hope and beans, as to make a sharp change from the usual fashion show audience which is so often blase, bored and filled with something else. It&apos;s not all good, of course. My biggest complaint is the degree of inspiration taken from designers, which is a polite way of saying &quot;copying&quot;. But even this is interesting. The most popular sources of inspiration are not the big-name superbrands such as Calvin Klein and Versace, but rather the smaller, quirkier ones such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Saunders and Sophia Kokosalaki. That brings us back to the question of why British students favour the artistic over the commercial. Marian McLaughlin, head of the international office of the Amsterdam Fashion Institute, is attending the London shows and agrees that undoubtedly British fashion students favour &quot;quirkier designs&quot;. &quot;You can really see the difference between them and other nationalities,&quot; she says. &quot;Probably it&apos;s because of the art-school influence. It does produce interesting clothes, but I don&apos;t know whether they get jobs afterwards. All of our students definitely do.&quot; But Marten Andreasson, fashion tutor at the University of Middlesex, disagrees. &quot;I think that, for the students, it is definitely more important to emphasise the creative because this is the time when they have the freedom to experiment and express themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;By the time they get to their graduate show, then they should have decided whether they want to go commercial or be more experimental.&quot; But what happens to the ones who want to make collections based on the Holocaust? He makes a tactful shrug. &quot;They probably go off and do MAs ...&quot; This is another thing that puzzles me. Fashion students say that their work is about &quot;self-expression&quot;, but what they make always seems to be an awfully long way away from what they actually wear. There are a lot of pretty printed dresses and German tourist-esque shoes in the audience - almost none on the runways. Sharon Dewar, 29, a student at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, agrees that the delicate, multi-layered black dress she has designed doesn&apos;t seem to have much in common with the jeans-and-grey-cardigan combo she is wearing. &quot;That&apos;s true. But I design things I aspire to, as opposed to things I actually wear, and it&apos;s a designer market I&apos;m aspiring to.&quot; So what does she think is more important - being commercial or being experimental? &quot;It&apos;s a balance really, isn&apos;t it? You want to enjoy making the clothes and other people to enjoy wearing them.&quot; In the end the winners were ... absolutely none of the students that I picked. In fact, one of the major winners was one I strongly advised against. Ho hum. So I still haven&apos;t quite got the knack of this yet. But I have just written over 1,000 words on graduate fashion without making a single joke about three-legged trousers, so I think we can say that the experience was beneficial to my own humbled self and, perhaps more importantly, the students.", "sentences": ["Marian McLaughlin, head of the international office of the Amsterdam Fashion Institute, is attending the London shows and agrees that undoubtedly British fashion students favour &quot;quirkier designs&quot;."], "title": "All rise for the judge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/13/fashion.hadleyfreeman", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-13T23:00:00Z", "article": "What&apos;s going for it?

Lewis&apos;s The Honoured Society (Eland) is a classic account of the Sicilian mafia, that murderous exploiter initially formed to protect the exploited. One of its grimmer side-stories has a queasy contemporary parallel: in 1943 the Americans, to speed their invasion of the island, reinstalled and relegitimised the criminal gangs that had been more or less broken by Mussolini in the late 1920s. Easy conquest, disastrous reconstruction: the echos of Iraq are thunderous. Dibdin&apos;s Blood Rain (Faber) feels indebted in part to Lewis for its historical background. There is a suspicion in the first half of the book that Dibdin is getting a little weary of his Inspector Zen, and an even bigger suspicion at the end (no, I&apos;d better not spoil it); but the action and sense of place are as satisfyingly rich as in any of the series with which the author anatomised modern Italy. It was odd to turn to Goethe&apos;s Italian Journey (Penguin Classics) almost for light relief - or at least a change of mood. And if some of the silent, scrutinising faces glimpsed in narrow village streets could have come straight from Lewis&apos;s illustrations, or Dibdin&apos;s text, the landscapes between the villages were still very much as Goethe had described them: groves of head-high wild fennel, aloes, asphodels, amaranthine clover, orchids, wild peonies. Goethe was a tourist as we were (he had a memorably bad time in Enna), but his engagement with every aspect of life - from the high aesthetics of accurately rendering maritime moonscapes to the daily practicalities of macaroni-twisting - is simply inspiring. As is one of his conclusions: &quot;To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is not to have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.&quot; William BoydLos Angeles I used to go regularly to Los Angeles to work, but I always thought (as I joylessly travelled across the vast city from meeting to meeting) that it would be a great place to go on holiday. There are many classic novels that capture the atmosphere and character of the place, but the books that follow are more neglected classics. So, for once, don&apos;t read Raymond Chandler for those LA mean streets (or James Ellroy), try John Fante&apos;s melancholic Bunker Hill lowlifes in Ask the Dust (Canongate). And for a more contemporary view of the LA underbelly, there is nothing more disturbing than Craig Nova&apos;s bleakly excoriating Turkey Hash (Delacorte). When it comes to the movie business, pass on F Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s The Last Tycoon and Nathanael West&apos;s The Day of the Locust and check out instead Budd Schulberg&apos;s brutal satire What Makes Sammy Run? (Vintage). Its ruthlessly amoral protagonist, Sammy Glick, will linger in your mind: the Sammy Glicks of this world still flourish in Hollywood and elsewhere - they are legion. Robert Towne&apos;s screenplay of Chinatown (Faber) reads like a great short story (it&apos;s the best film about Los Angeles ever made) and Michael Tolkin&apos;s novel The Player (Avalon) is still on the nail. Two enduring and illuminating works of non-fiction place the city in its sociocultural context: Reyner Banham&apos;s Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (Penguin) will guide you through the fascinating cityscape, and Mike Davis&apos;s prescient City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles (Verso) will inform you about its denizens. William DalrympleIndia Travelling in India provides great opportunities for reading: even if you are not subjecting yourself to week-long train journeys or long cross-country bus rides, there will still be the inevitable hours in departure lounges waiting for delayed planes, and at the end of it, hopefully, many horizontal hours of reading on the beaches of Goa or the houseboats of the Kerala backwaters. Most travellers tend to pack with them some of the recent star turns of Indian or diaspora fiction that have for good reason filled the prize shortlists over the past two decades. Good places to start might be a couple of Rushdies - perhaps Midnight&apos;s Children and The Moor&apos;s Last Sigh (both Vintage) - A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth (Harper Perennial), The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy (Flamingo), Sea of Poppies by Amitav Ghosh (John Murray), The Death of Vishnu by Manil Suri (Bloomsbury), The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri (Harper Perennial), The Impressionist by Hari Kunzru (Penguin), Love and Longing in Bombay by Vikram Chandra (Faber), A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry (Faber), and one each from the Desais: maybe In Custody by Anita (Vintage) and The Inheritance of Loss by her daughter Kiran (Penguin). Much less well known in Britain are some of the masterpieces of Indian writing from the early part of the 20th century: Twilight in Delhi by Ahmed Ali (WW Norton), arguably the great Indo-Islamic novel, Saadat Hasan Manto&apos;s Selected Stories (Penguin Modern Classics) and All About H Hatterr by GV Desani (NYRB Classics). Then there are the great Malgudi stories of RK Narayan (Penguin Classics), which slip down as easily as a glass of sweet lassi. Narayan also produced two excellent short versions of the great Indian epics, The Mahabharata and The Ramayana (both Penguin Classics), which give a wonderful taste of Hindu mythology. Less well known is the most popular epic of the Indo-Islamic world, The Adventures of Hamza, a rollicking, magic-filled heroic saga; remarkably, the translation that has just been published by Random House Modern Library is the first edition of the epic in English. These great epics could be read alongside some of the masterpieces of ancient Indian love poetry, much of which is extremely beautiful. The various reworkings of classical Indian poetry produced by the late AK Ramanujan are fabulous: Poems of Love and War (OUP) and The Interior Landscape (OUP India) bring together his finest work: Her arms have the beauty Of a gently moving bamboo. Her eyes are full of peace. She is far away, Her place not easy to reach. My heart is frantic With haste A ploughman with a single ox On land all wet And ready for seed. For travel writing, try VS Naipaul&apos;s India: A Million Mutinies Now (Viking) or Suketu Mehta&apos;s Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found (Headline). For the British investigation of India&apos;s ancient past, try John Keay&apos;s India Discovered (HarperCollins) and, for the end of the Raj, Alex Von Tunzelmann&apos;s Indian Summer (Pocket Books), by a long way the most amusing account of the Mountbattens and their strange m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Nehru. For sophisticated takes on modern south Asia, try Edward Luce&apos;s In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India (Abacus), Pankaj Mishra&apos;s Temptations of the West (Picador), Amartya Sen&apos;s The Argumentative Indian (Penguin) and Ahmed Rashid&apos;s Descent into Chaos (Allen Lane). Dave EggersChicago The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow (Penguin Modern Classics) is probably the ultimate Chicago book, charting the course of a young man making his way out of poverty, into the depression, into the second world war and with a bunch of adventures in between and after. It incorporates just about everything you could imagine - the American dream, distinctions of class and race, the chaos of immigration, ideas of Utopia, the &quot;special destiny&quot; Augie assumes awaits him . . . It&apos;s big, crazy, relentless, very funny and holds up as if it were written yesterday. Bellow is one of two Chicagoans, the other being Hemingway, who won the Nobel prize. Savage Inequalities by Jonathan Kozol (HarperCollins) isn&apos;t about Chicago only, but it&apos;s a riveting indictment of the public schools in some major American cities, and two Illinois systems, Chicago&apos;s and East St Louis&apos;s, are covered with incredible clarity and moral outrage. Stephen Elliott&apos;s novel Happy Baby (Picador) is set in the 70s and 80s in Chicago. The protagonist, Theo, grows up on the streets, homeless, in juvenile homes, and is raped by a male counsellor. Told in reverse, a grown man looks back at the injustices that made him the almost-broken (but functioning, sensitive and even hopeful) person he is today. Elliott is one of the best contemporary writers about Chicago, unflinching but not unromantic. Gwendolyn Brooks won a Pulitzer for her poetry and was the beloved-by-all poet laureate of Illinois for many years. Maud Martha (Third World Press) was her only novel for adults, and has the precision and economy that poets-turned-novelists so often display. It&apos;s about a woman, Maud Martha Brown, who grows up on Chicago&apos;s South Side. The book renders the incredible segregation of the city - Chicago has always been one of the most polarised cities in America - by simply showing that for some residents of the overwhelmingly black South Side, the white North Side barely existed; the worlds seldom intersected. The book is set in the 1930s and 40s and is, despite the tension underpinning it, really a quiet meditation on childhood, girlhood, self-awareness and perceptions of self-beauty. It&apos;s a perfect book, perfect in scope and execution. Isabel FonsecaUruguay I recommend three marvellous Uruguayan writers. First, Horacio Quiroga (1878-1931). Despite a life - and body of work - engulfed by violent death (his father was shot; he accidently killed his own friend; his stepfather, one of his wives, he himself and then both his children all committed suicide), Quiroga is most widely read in Uruguay by children - especially his Cuentos de la Selva, or jungle tales. He is one of the greatest animal writers ever. His creatures are weird, savage and utterly inexpungeable from the mind. Quiroga&apos;s grown-up stories are often compared to those of Poe (see &quot;The Decapitated Chicken&quot; and &quot;The Feather Pillow&quot;, published in The Decapitated Chicken and Other Stories, University of Wisconsin Press). They are also a bit like Roald Dahl&apos;s macabre tales for adults; the writing is ruthlessly crisp and concrete. Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez, born in 1902, was a plumber&apos;s son and a mama&apos;s boy (he had four wives and many lovers besides, but always went back to his mother, sometimes in the middle of the night). He died in penury in 1964 - though he managed for many years by playing the piano in local cinemas: &quot;musical illustration&quot; for silent films. He is a writer&apos;s writer, not bothered by the need to create convincing plot, character, suspense or intrigue; an early story has among its characters an infinite horizontal line and a circumference that rolls along it. Among his ardent admirers he counts Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Julio Cort\u00e1zar and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Hern\u00e1ndez published 10 short books (his first was only 21 paragraphs long). He spent years creating his own system of shorthand, with the result that some of his work - and this would have delighted him - has never been deciphered. Juan Carlos Onetti (1909-94) is considered by many to be Uruguay&apos;s finest writer. A solid modernist, he rejected the folksy and sentimental culture that romanticised nature and the gaucho, and his eloquent brand of urban despair is so well turned that it remains vibrant and readable - see The Pit (Quartet), The Shipyard and A Brief Life (both Serpent&apos;s Tail). He was an editor of Marcha, the great literary magazine dissolved by Uruguay&apos;s military regime in the 1970s. Despite his huge reputation, Onetti was imprisoned in a mental institution, and as soon as he was able he decamped for Spain. Like Borges the chicken inspector, or like the Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas exiled in New York, this most distinguished citizen and former director of the national library worked in a lowly capacity in his adopted country - as a doorman and a waiter. Though he lived for a decade after the end of military rule, Onetti never returned to Montevideo. Maureen FreelyTurkey Some books are so famous they need no introduction. But have you ever read Yashar Kemal? His first novel, Memed, My Hawk (NYRB Classics), set in the south-east of Turkey and about a young man at war with feudal authority, was published in the 1950s and brought him international fame. It is still greatly loved in Turkey, and with good reason. If you are after something urban and contemporary, Elif Shafak&apos;s The Flea Palace (Marion Boyars) is an excellent place to start. Set in a building that has seen better days, it is a quirky and exuberant portrait of an Istanbul that defies categorisation. Moris Farhi&apos;s novel Young Turk (Telegram) is a beautiful account of the same secretly multicultural city during the middle years of the 20th century, while Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar&apos;s The Bridge of the Golden Horn (Serpent&apos;s Tail) tells the story of a young woman who goes to Germany as a guest-worker in the late 1960s and returns to Istanbul just in time for a coup. It is one of the funniest and most original books you&apos;ll ever read. If you&apos;re after superior mysteries, try Mehmet Murat Somer&apos;s The Prophet Murders (Serpent&apos;s Tail). Set in contemporary Istanbul, it stars a transvestite detective. There is a whole series in Turkish. Jason Goodwin has two utterly delicious mysteries set in 19th-century Istanbul - The Janissary Tree and The Snake Stone (both Faber) - and in these the detective is a (dead sexy) eunuch. If your taste runs to quality historical romances, Katie Hickman&apos;s The Aviary Gate (Bloomsbury) takes you into the Harem to follow the fortunes of an Englishwoman who becomes the Sultan&apos;s slave in 1599. In the early years of the 20th century (the last years of the Ottoman empire), there was a fashion for memoirs by women from this part of the world, and the renewed interest in things Turkish has led to many being republished. The best one to read first is The Memoirs of Halide Edip (Turkey&apos;s first feminist and, for a time, one of Atat\u00fcrk&apos;s closest associates), and if you like that, check out the catalogue of Gorgias Press for others covering the same period. Eland Press, which is based in London, publishes two classic memoirs by Irfan Orga. Portrait of a Turkish Family is a harrowing tale of a wealthy family left destitute by the first world war. But what I like even more is the same author&apos;s menacingly seductive account of a year he spent with a nomadic tribe in the south-east of Turkey during the 1950s (The Caravan Moves On). Or did he? There is one other memoir I feel I must recommend - though I should warn you that I am biased, because I translated it. It is by the human rights lawyer Fethiye Cetin, who was in her 20s when she discovered that the good Muslim grandmother who had brought her up was really Armenian - she&apos;d been pulled from her mother&apos;s arms off a death march in 1915. The thing I most admire about My Grandmother (Verso) is that it refuses to be sidetracked by the issues it raises: it is a tribute to the woman, an expression of shared pain, and a plea for reconciliation. That it was a bestseller in Turkey should tell you something. Finally, no one should go to Turkey without reading at least a few issues of Cornucopia (cornucopia.net), which has to be one of the most beautiful magazines in the world. Published here, its remit is Turkey - not its sordid politics, but its art, architecture, history and antiquities. David MitchellJapan Tokyo, where the neon is brightest and airfares are cheapest, is home to Haruki Murakami and many of his withdrawn protagonists: A Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Norwegian Wood and a rich collection of stories, The Elephant Vanishes (all Vintage), are perhaps his finest hours so far. Taichi Yamada&apos;s Strangers (Faber) is a twisting ghost story set in any of the city&apos;s endlessly repeated high-rise &quot;mansions&quot;. Early 20th-century Tokyo hatched the &quot;modernist gothic&quot; imagination of Ryunosuke Akutagawa, well represented in Rashomon and Seventeen Other Stories (Penguin Classics). A throttlingly good fictional account of the city&apos;s postwar turbulence, Tokyo Year Zero (Faber) is by the British Tokyoite David Peace. Junichiro Tanizaki is an adopted son of Japan&apos;s courtliest city, Kyoto. His masterpiece is The Makioka Sisters (Vintage Classics), a family drama set during the 1930s and 40s. No tricks here, just exquisite craftsmanship. Murasaki Shikibu traversed the same streets of Kyoto in her palanquin a thousand years ago: her proto-novel The Tale of Genji (Penguin) is more for Sherpas of world literature than for ramblers, but The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon (Penguin Classics) by her catty rival is a lighter sampler of Heian-period sensibilities. Off the beaten track, Kobo Abe&apos;s perfectly executed The Woman in the Dunes (Penguin Modern Classics) will teach you to watch your step in the dunes near Matsue, one-time home to the folklorist Lafcadio Hearn, whose anthology of folk tales, Kwaidan (Stone Bridge Press), is dated but still worth a look. Shusaku Endo&apos;s masterly Silence (Peter Owen) will enrich a trip to Nagasaki or the rugged Goto Islands with its account of a Portuguese Jesuit who defies the bans on foreigners and Christianity in the &quot;Closed Country&quot; era. Visitors to northern backwaters may find space for early itinerant poet Matsuo Basho&apos;s slim The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Penguin Classics), to see how much Japan has changed, and what recesses of it have not. Lastly, an idiosyncratic travelling companion - especially in little-visited Shikoku - is Saiichi Maruya&apos;s erudite, entangling Rain in the Wind (Kodansha International Ltd), about the last vagrant poet, Taneda Santoka: well worth tracking down. Caryl PhillipsThe Caribbean Anybody travelling to the Caribbean this year should tuck into their bag VS Naipaul&apos;s Miguel Street (Heinemann), which is a wonderful collection of his early short stories. These almost cinematic snapshots of the social and cultural chaos of Caribbean life are not only hilarious, but also sing with the inventive cadences of the region. In the later part of his career, Naipaul&apos;s attitude to the world that produced him seems to have darkened considerably. However, in these stories there is warmth and affection, and an intimacy that suggests a man who is sharing a part of himself with us. Selected Poems by Derek Walcott (Faber) spans 50 years of his writing, with extracts from the longer narrative poems, and a stunning assemblage of his shorter lyric engagements with the history, the flora, the fauna and the people of the Caribbean. Walcott is not only the most important poet that the Caribbean has produced; he is one of the great writers in the English language. This is an essential collection for anybody visiting the region. Patrick Leigh Fermor&apos;s The Traveller&apos;s Tree (John Murray) was first published in 1950. Although the islands have changed dramatically and become both politically independent of Britain and, to some extent, uncomfortably dependent on the United States, this book remains relevant. It is as much a personal odyssey as it is a guide to the islands of the Antilles. Finally, the Guyanese writer Roy Heath died earlier this year. His memoir Shadows Round the Moon (Flamingo) evokes a Caribbean childhood that is by turns humorous and painful. The book is blessed with fine portraits of family, friends and neighbours, all of whom conspire to remind the reader on the move that while the landscape may change, the topography of the human heart remains the same. Jonathan RabanPacific Northwest My first introduction to the Pacific Northwest was in 1964, long before I visited the United States. It was at a motorway service area on the newly built M1, where, looking for something to read over my coffee and ham sandwich, I found Bernard Malamud&apos;s A New Life (Penguin) on a carousel of mass-market paperbacks. I knew Malamud from his exquisitely turned short stories of poor New York Jews in The Magic Barrel (Vintage Classics). This was clearly something different: A New Life had a lurid jacket and bore the legend, &quot;He found strange refuge - love with another man&apos;s wife.&quot; I spent a long time over that miserable sandwich. Malamud&apos;s story, or fable, of Seymour Levin, an indigent English instructor from New York, &quot;formerly a drunkard&quot;, who finds himself in exile at a &quot;cow college&quot; in Oregon, teaching freshmen composition, kept me spellbound. Written when Malamud himself was in exile, in the English department of Oregon State University at Corvallis (then known as Oregon State Agricultural College), it brilliantly captures the shock of the far, mountainous Northwest as seen by a bewildered newcomer from the urban East Coast. The wild grandeur of the landscape is set against the narrow social and political conformity of its inhabitants, at a time when America was in the throes of McCarthyism. Levin is last seen in his rattletrap car, heading back East, too &quot;unAmerican&quot; in every way for straight-laced Oregon in the 1950s. Malamud&apos;s star has dimmed since his death in 1986, and many readers know him best as the model for the great Jewish-American writer EI Lonoff in Philip Roth&apos;s Zuckerman series. A New Life appears to be out of print, though it is easily available over the internet, with prices starting at 1p. For a beautifully written, acid comedy, the best novel ever to come out of the Pacific Northwest, that is a shameful and utterly undeserved fate. Living now in the general landscape of the book, I read it at least once a year, always with laughter, recognition and gratitude to Malamud as one of the finest American writers of the last century. Ahdaf SoueifEgypt Something by Naguib Mahfouz is a really good idea. My preferred Mahfouz in English is Miramar (Anchor Books). Published during the critical year of 1967 and set in Alexandria, it captures something very close to the heart of Egyptian life of the period. I&apos;ll come clean and admit to being biased towards the translation of this particular novel; it was done by my mother. The other Egyptian novel that I love (in English) is Beer in the Snooker Club by Waguih Ghali (New Amsterdam Books). Again, this was published in the 60s, but deals more with the 50s, and with the young Egyptian&apos;s life in England. But I would still recommend it to an English-language reader who wants to read about Egypt. It is intelligent, authentic and very funny. Adam ThirlwellFrance The problem is that there is no such thing as France. There are infinite Frances - because there are infinite places, and infinite times. So the happy summer reader needs to choose both a place and a time. For the Paris of the 19th century, there is the spiky novel by Guy de Maupassant, Bel-Ami (Penguin Classics), with its lovely comic structure, based on exponentially increasing, unassailable good luck. Which makes it the opposite of much sadder summer reading: the Normandy of the 19th century which Maupassant describes in his novel Une Vie (Wildeside Press), with its structure of exponentially increasing, unassailable bad luck. If you want to holiday in the Paris of the 20th century, then there is George Perec&apos;s novel Life A User&apos;s Manual (Vintage), set just after 8pm on June 23 1975 in a Parisian apartment block. This has its own twin: Emile Zola&apos;s 19th-century Parisian apartment block novel, Pot-Bouille (Everyman). For a book that moves between the 19th and 20th century, from Paris to the south, there is Jean Renoir&apos;s wonderful memoir of his father, transparently titled Renoir, My Father (NYRB Classics), with its gorgeous descriptions of painting and Renoir&apos;s domesticity, alongside many usefully cookable recipes. This can be accompanied by another literary work, which masquerades as a cookbook: The Alice B Toklas Cookbook (The Lyons Press), which contains recipes supplied by modernist exiles such as Picasso. And since everything has its twin, maybe this should be read beside another masterpiece from the interwar France of international exiles: The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, written not by Toklas, but by her lover, Gertrude Stein (Penguin Modern Classics). But perhaps two of the best swimming-pool books take place in the vanished Paris before Haussmann and the serious 19th century. The first is The Princess of Cleves by Madame de Lafayette, translated by Nancy Mitford (New Directions), which is one of the cleverest novels about passion and its repression. And the second is The Three Musketeers (Penguin) by Alexandre Dumas, which evokes an imaginary France, delicious, uninhabitable and impossible. But then, every France is impossible. Because France is infinite. Colin ThubronChina China is many countries, and recent novels by two giants of the nation&apos;s literature evoke contrasting facets of its character. Gao Xingjian&apos;s Soul Mountain (Harper Perennial), finely translated by Mabel Lee, reads like an autobiographical journey through the country&apos;s hinterland, filled with haunting encounters, landscapes and legends. This is the timeless China that only the adventurous will ever see, pervaded by its own raw sensibility: the masterwork of China&apos;s Nobel laureate. By contrast, Ma Jian&apos;s Beijing Coma (Chatto), translated by Flora Drew, makes for grim summer reading. It is centred brutally on the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, about which the current regime is still silent. This is a big novel, whose paralysed protagonist looks back on his fragmented past over 30 years - mirroring the history of modern China itself. Ma Jian writes less with psychological depth (westerners typically find this lacking in Chinese fiction) than with an earthy practicality, but the book&apos;s drama mounts almost unbearably through Tiananmen&apos;s confusion into epic tragedy. Colm T\u00f3ib\u00ednSouth America Elizabeth Bishop&apos;s Poems, Prose and Letters has just come out from the Library of America and is probably the best record of half a lifetime&apos;s encounter with Brazil. It includes translations of many important Brazilian poets, plus three stories by the strange Brazilian genius Clarice Lispector (check out her book The Hour of the Star, Carcanet), as well as poems and letters by Bishop about the glories and mysteries of Brazilian life. For an account of Brazilian history, Euclides da Cunha&apos;s Rebellion in the Backlands (University of Chicago Press) is a fascinating account of a 19th-century revolt that, in turn, became the inspiration for Mario Vargas Llosa&apos;s The War of the End of the World (Faber), which is one of the greatest novels written in the 20th century. Mario Andrade&apos;s Macunaima (Quartet) is one of the masterpieces of Brazilian literature, mixing the mock-heroic and the mythological. Machado de Assis is another Brazilian genius whose work deserves to be better known, especially The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (OUP). The books of Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa, which have been translated into English, are also wonderful, as rich and complex and modern as Brazil itself. For Argentina, the stories and poems of Jorge Luis Borges are essential reading, especially the ones that manage not to mention his native country at all. (There are no camels mentioned in the Qur&apos;an, as Borges liked to remind us.) Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez&apos;s long poem The Gaucho Martin Fierro (State University of New York Press), which has been superbly translated into English, is worth learning off by heart before setting foot on the pampas. Anyone going to Chile should be steeped in the work of Roberto Bola\u00f1o. Best to start with the best, which is The Savage Detectives (Picador). For anyone who has read the entire works of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and is in search of a new Colombian novelist, then Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez&apos;s The Informers (Bloomsbury) is a thrilling new discovery. \u00b7 The illustrator Quinton Winter&apos;s exhibition of paintings is at Horsebridge Arts Centre, Whitstable, Kent until Tuesday (www.quintonwinter.com).", "sentences": ["The other Egyptian novel that I love (in English) is Beer in the Snooker Club by Waguih Ghali (New Amsterdam Books)."], "title": "Writers recommend the perfect literary travelling companions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/14/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview", "tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "Summer reading", "Summer reading 2008", "Michael Dibdin", "Elizabeth Bishop"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-14T14:22:28Z", "article": "Four British rowers were rescued today after their boat capsized as they attempted to cross the Atlantic ocean for charity. Chris Jenkins, 43, Tim Garrent, 26, Wayne Davey, 30, and Joby Newton, 19, were two weeks into their journey from New York to their native Isles of Scilly when their craft tipped over in heavy seas 420 miles east of Cape Cod. The rowers, who called themselves the Scilly Boys, managed to contact Falmouth coastguard via satellite phone at 1am BST and said they had capsized and were in the two cabins of the 29ft boat. The US coastguard was alerted and coordinated a search for the boat with the help of a merchant vessel, which was diverted to their last known position, and a Hercules aircraft. The plane spotted the crew in a liferaft. They were rescued and taken aboard the merchant ship, the Gulf Grace, this morning. &quot;We understand all four are relatively safe and well - suffering slight hypothermia,&quot; said James Instance, of Falmouth maritime rescue. The adventurers were attempting to row 3,100 nautical miles across the Atlantic to raise money for four charities - the RNLI&apos;s Train One campaign, Breakthrough Breast Cancer, the Cornwall air ambulance and Above and Beyond, a charity supporting hospitals in Bristol. They were around 650 miles into their journey when their boat capsized. The team left Liberty landing marina on June 1 hoping to break the 55-day record for the journey set in 1896 by Harboe and Samuelson of 55 days. Two of the crew - paramedic Davey and Jenkins, who runs his own business - are RNLI volunteers and the crew had undertaken sea survival training before they set off. &quot;[They] have a wealth of knowledge and experience collected during their time with us and I am sure they will have called on all this in the last few hours,&quot; said Simon Pryce, the RNLI south-west divisional inspector. &quot;We are hugely relieved that the guys have been rescued and are safe and well. So many thousands of people from around the world have watched their epic challenge and will share in our sadness that their voyage has been cut short,&quot; said Simon Chalk, from Woodvale Challenge, the trip organiser. Tragedy had previously struck the Scilly Boys team when one of its original members died suddenly during preparations for the voyage. Nathan Woodcock, 23, collapsed in his boat at the end of a race in July last year and medical staff were unable to revive him.

Her father, John, was a barrister, a county court judge and a novelist. The author AS Byatt is her older sister. After university, Drabble started writing a novel, joined the RSC and had a baby. &apos;With babies, writing was more convenient than acting,&apos; she recalls. A Summer Birdcage was published in 1963. Drabble became one of Britain&apos;s most respected novelists and biographers and was awarded a CBE for services to literature in 1980. Over meals in our pink-spotted, suburban Sheffield dining room my father would occasionally screw his silver napkin ring into his eye like an eyeglass, look at us through it quizzically with his clear blue eye and declaim from Keats or Lamartine. This showed that he was in a good mood. He was particularly fond of the &apos;Ode to Melancholy&apos; and of &apos;Souvenir&apos;, poems he had learnt by heart when at Mexborough grammar school, where he was in the same class as my mother. I can see him clearly now, with his fine eyebrows (when young, a sandy Viking red, when older, a distinguished white), his handsome, clear-cut, friendly face, his slightly abstracted gaze. He would break off from his recitations to implore us not to scrape, spill upon or otherwise damage the Hepplewhite dining table he had purchased and of which he was very proud. &apos;It&apos;s lasted without a scratch for 200 years,&apos; he would protest, &apos;and you girls are going to ruin it in five.&apos; He was red-haired and freckled and he always said he longed for a red-haired child. Every Christmas, he would stir the Christmas pudding mixture (this was the only cooking he ever did) and make a ritual wish for red-headed twins. He never got them, but several of his grandchildren have red hair. The recessive gene triumphed in the next generation. He was pleased about that. I did not know him when I was very little, as I was born in 1939, and when war broke out, he went abroad with the RAF. I didn&apos;t recognise him when he came back from Italy, and he had to win me over, which I&apos;m told he did by sitting me on his knee and helping me to learn to read from that well-known primer The Radiant Way I&apos;m not sure if I remember this or not. But I do remember the little red glass mouse he brought for me. He said it was for me because the curl in its glass tail made the letter M - M for Margaret. I felt favoured by the gift of that mouse. His own early years had been difficult: his father, who owned a small confectionery business, didn&apos;t see why he wanted to go to university, as nobody in the Drabble family ever had, so my father worked as a travelling salesman for a while before making his own way to Cambridge, where he read law. (Some still remember the &apos;Drabble&apos;s Sweets&apos; vans in south Yorkshire). He became a barrister and when we were children, he worked nearly every evening, reading his red-ribboned briefs at that same dining-room table, for he had no study. He worked grindingly hard. My parents hardly ever went out and we were always being told to shut up. Yet he was an affectionate father and, in a manner characteristic of many families of that period, he would unbend and give us his full attention when on holiday. We spent our summers in Filey, just south of Scarborough, which, with its bay of yellow sand and fishing boats and its rocky Brig, we rightly thought was the finest resort in the world. There my father taught us to swim, nobly standing as the icy, tampon-bobbing waters of the North Sea lapped round his bottom, supporting each of us in turn as he encouraged us to practise our strokes. He loved the rock pools of the Brig, a promontory which stretched out to sea and was partly submerged at each high tide and about which I still dream frequently. He liked to feed little shreds from his corned beef sandwich to the dark red sea anemones, admiring the graceful and greedy way in which they grasped the morsels with their fronds and drew them in and devoured them. He also enjoyed setting afloat the shells of the hard-boiled eggs of our picnics. He looked back on those happy days with pleasure. When he was in hospital in Amsterdam in his seventies dying of mesothelioma (contracted who knows where or when), I asked him if he remembered Filey and he smiled sadly and wistfully and said: &apos;Oh Maggie, how I loved Filey.&apos; He used it as a setting in his second novel (Scawsby), published in 1977 after he became a county court judge. I reread it recently and was surprised to find it better than I had remembered. It&apos;s a story narrated by a north country solicitor and it takes on with prescience and aplomb the dangerous subjects of multicultural adoption, under-age sex and honour killing (a phrase not then coined), all seen with his humane blend of tolerance and compassion. He was an extraordinarily fair-minded, generous-spirited man. I frequently consulted him about legal details and ethical issues and some of the articles I wrote for the Guardian in the Sixties were directly based on information he relayed to me from the county courts. Once, he asked me to sit on the bench with him in Newcastle, which I thought a very strange thing to be allowed to do. He told me I had to wear a hat, so I did. That was an odd, old-fashioned episode. Perhaps he thought it would be good copy. The subject of adoption interested him both personally and professionally and we talked a lot about nature and nurture and changes in the law. He saw cases from all angles and spoke, it seemed to me, with the wisdom of Solomon and the insight of a good father, weighing up the rights of natural and adoptive parents in ways that sometimes surprised me. He deplored the fact that the system of the court offered no moment of celebration to the happy adoptive parents and the newly adopted children who came before him. He thought there should have been magnums of champagne or bells ringing or ribbons. He was a kind man. At the Quaker memorial service after his death in 1982, one of his young colleagues broke the customary silence to speak in praise of him, as the family sat tongue-tied, and he ended: &apos;What we felt for him was not respect or admiration. The word for what we felt was love.&apos; I have always been grateful to him for that epitaph.", "sentences": ["When he was in hospital in Amsterdam in his seventies dying of mesothelioma (contracted who knows where or when), I asked him if he remembered Filey and he smiled sadly and wistfully and said: &apos;Oh Maggie, how I loved Filey.&apos; He used it as a setting in his second novel (Scawsby), published in 1977 after he became a county court judge."], "title": "My old man: Margaret Drabble", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/15/biography.features5", "tags": ["Margaret Drabble", "Biography", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-15T23:01:00Z", "article": "If we had any sense, we&apos;d stay at home. And if we couldn&apos;t quite manage that, at least we&apos;d limit our mobility to as far as we can walk or cycle - that&apos;s a radius of three to five miles, even for the unfit. But we don&apos;t. So every time we venture further from base, we take risks. Taking the train should remove the strain (although, thanks to the plethora of fares, it&apos;s all too easy to have the wrong type of ticket). But if the train is delayed, you should demand compensation. The delay to trigger a payment varies from one hour on long-distance lines to 15 minutes on the London Tube. Railway companies are good at paying up, although you can&apos;t claim for delays from publicised engineering works or where trains are halted due to a suicide or similar incident outside the railway&apos;s control. Stations should have a supply of complaint forms. Send one in - even if you are doubtful that you&apos;ll win.  Airlines are notoriously bad at dealing with complaints. Under European Union rules, they are supposed to offer help and compensation for delays of more than four hours. But they rarely pay willingly. They plead excuses such as aircraft safety (counter by saying they should maintain planes better) or weather (this can of course be true, but do ask for details).  Also, many rely on an overseas headquarters - outside the reach of the small-claims court, which should be the next port of call after you receive their automated refusal letter. But don&apos;t despair. While, for instance, Ryanair is based in Ireland, it does have a UK subsidiary in Stansted which can be taken to court. Hiring a car should take much of the hassle out of driving. But as my Capital Letters mailbag shows, you can&apos;t rely on the car working, or be sure that the vehicle you booked will be there - or even that the hire depot will be open.  Take the Bristol reader whose Sixt rental car in France failed to start twice in a week last summer, leaving her family in the middle of nowhere and forcing her to take taxis. The car was almost new, yet despite its poor performance, Sixt refused to discuss compensation until Capital Letters intervened. And even then, the compensation was minimal, not magnanimous.  Research last year by the AA showed that if your hire car packs up on a remote European road, there&apos;s a one-in-three chance you&apos;ll have to deal with it alone. So before you hire, have a list of demands. You need to know: \u00b7 What arrangements the company will make if the car breaks down - many car-hire companies fail to provide even a basic breakdown number for emergencies, according to the AA survey. Ask for a 24-hour emergency line.  \u00b7 What compensation will be offered if the car fails you. Most companies try to wriggle, citing the inevitable &quot;terms and conditions&quot;. So add your own \u00a3250-a-day in event of failure clause to the contract. If the hirer refuses, go elsewhere - consumer power means that car-hire companies need you more than you need them. \u00b7 Demand a comprehensive list of bodywork and any other problems before you take the car. Many car-hire companies charge the same imperceptible blemish to customer after customer. \u00b7 Check that all safety equipment required in that country (such as reflective triangles or jackets that glow in the dark) is present and working. Otherwise, you could face a fine. And finally, bicycles. As a regular (if mostly short-distance) cyclist, it&apos;s good to say that Capital Letters has only ever received one cycling complaint: over the failure of Eurolines coach company to carry a folding bike to Amsterdam. Now my reader is happy, and Eurolines has revised its policy: it takes folding bikes.  So my best transport tip is to stick to two wheels - or two feet.", "sentences": ["As a regular (if mostly short-distance) cyclist, it&apos;s good to say that Capital Letters has only ever received one cycling complaint: over the failure of Eurolines coach company to carry a folding bike to Amsterdam."], "title": "How to save money: Tony's tips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jun/16/consumeraffairs", "tags": ["Saving money", "Consumer affairs", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-18T08:45:16Z", "article": "&apos;With two pretty rubbish teams as host nations this year, which host country has fared worst in European Championship history?&apos; wonders Rory Saunders. Belgium&apos;s 2000 benchmark of one win was, before this year&apos;s tournament, the least any host had achieved since the introduction of the group stages in 1980. After their defeat to Germany, however, Austria \u2013 as widely anticipated \u2013 are now officially the worst ever hosts of a European Championships, with just one point to their name. Switzerland, meanwhile, thanks to their 2-0 win over Portugal&apos;s reserves, actually leap above Belgium&apos;s tally of eight years ago courtesy of a superior goal difference. The Yugoslavia side of 1976 also deserve a mention, however, in the eyes of Jostein Nyg\u00e5rd. As hosts of the semi-final stages Yugoslavia lost 4-2 to West Germany in their first game and 4-2 to the Netherlands in the third-place play-off. Since 1980, the record of host nations in the European Championships have been generally excellent. Belgium were, before this year, the only host country not to make at least the semi-finals (In 1980, with group winners contesting the final, Italy lost a third-place play-off to Czechoslovakia). SIZE ISN&apos;T EVERYTHING &quot;Most games at Euro 2008 look like they are taking place at stadiums the size of an average League Two club. Can anyone tell me if this year&apos;s championship has the smallest number of seats available for fans and which had the most?&quot; asks Paul White. Uefa requires host nations to provide eight venues with a capacity of at least 30,000. Admittedly, the hosts haven&apos;t done much more than the minimum on this one, offering six 30,000-capacity tiddlers, a 42,500 effort in Basel and the 53,000 (relative) behemoth Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna, which will host the final. But we shouldn&apos;t be unduly harsh. Historically, the aggregate attendance at European Championships has not varied too much beyond 1.1 million people. In Portugal 2004, there were big, spanking stadiums in Lisbon and Oporto but the other eight arenas held just the requisite 30,000. At Euro 2000 in Belgium, 1.2 million fans attended games at five 30,000-odd capacity stadiums, while the remaining three venues in Amsterdam, Brussels and Rotterdam held a touch over 50,000. Paul asks about available seats \u2013 but plastic vacuum-formed spaces do not always equal perching human bums. Yes, there was a time when a European Championship generated more apathy than ticket touts - Euro 1996 offered significantly bigger stadia across England but, even with the host nation playing five matches at a 76,000-capacity Wembley, the total aggregate attendance only just topped 1.2m. Nor will the last game in Vienna be the most poorly attended final. Only 17,966 turned out to watch the USSR beat Yugoslavia at the Parc des Princes in 1960; 47,864 watched France beat Spain in Paris in 1984; and 47,864 headed to Rome&apos;s Stadio Olympico for West Germany&apos;s 2-1 win over Belgium. The 53,000 due in Vienna on June 29 will be more than respectable. If the sold-out stadia in Austria and Switzerland are taken as a guide, then the total attendance for the tournament will easily surpass 1 million fans. Perhaps those struggling to find tickets shouldn&apos;t blame the size of the venues, but the avarice of the &apos;&apos;sponsors and official commercial partners&apos;&apos;, who have been allocated around 15% of the seats. SHOW ME THE MONEY &quot;How much are players participating in Euro 2008 paid?&quot; muses Wilf Ratzburg. &quot;And who pays them?&quot; Uefa sells the advertising and TV rights for the tournament and distributes some of the revenue to the respective FAs. Each individual FA then determines how much to pass on to its players. For most countries, it is a relatively small amount compared to club salaries. However, many teams are also offering significant bonuses as a reward for progressing. The German Soccer Federation (DFB), for example, will hand over a \u20ac250,000 bonus to each player if they win the tournament - \u20ac50,000 less than if they had won the 2006 World Cup. They will get \u20ac50,000 for reaching the last eight, \u20ac100,000 for the semi-finals, and \u20ac150,000 for getting to the final. Spanish players will each get \u20ac214,000 if they win, but would only have got \u20ac30,000 if they had failed to progress through the group stage. The Romanian Football Federation, meanwhile, turned down the hefty rewards offered by the controversial Steaua Bucharest owner Gigi Becali. He offered \u20ac500,000 for players and staff if Romania reached the quarter-finals and \u20ac5.5m if they won the tournament. Two other local businessmen stepped in and offered \u20ac600,000 each to the players if they fought their way into the last eight, not that they&apos;ll need to empty their wallets now. For what it is worth, England players would have earned \u00a3250,000 each had they won the tournament. Incredibly, they also pocketed six-figure sums for failing to qualify. The FA used money from sponsors to pay the players according to how many qualifying games they featured in. Generously, the England players now donate their \u00a31,500 match fees to charity. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;For some reason, I believe that no bearded player has ever won the World Cup,&quot; claimed Jonathan Taylor in 2006. &quot;Can this be right? And I mean full beards, not stubble, goatees or moustaches - the full works.&quot; Strict guidelines indeed, but Olly Winkles is one of several readers to remember at least one hairy-faced winner. &quot;Step forward Sergio Batista of Argentina,&quot; writes Olly. &quot;He sported a full-on beard in the 1986 final.&quot; Olly adds that, &quot;arguably, West Germany&apos;s Paul Breitner could be described as bearded in 1974 too,&quot; but despite an impressive &apos;tache/sideburns combo, we&apos;re not letting &apos;Der Afro&apos; into the select band. Nor Fabien Barthez&apos;s 1998 goatie effort, or Ricky Villa&apos;s handlebar in 1978, both of which were good, but not good enough. Sadly there&apos;s a distinct lack of bushy facial features on show in Germany this summer, although should Gennaro Gattuso steer clear of a razor and Italy go all the way, then he&apos;ll surely be eligible to join Batista in the pantheon of hirsute legends.

But, while Britain gears up for Glastonbury, I&apos;m more interested in goings on further afield. Cheap flights have liberated clubbers and gig goers. Once festival options were limited to domestic events like Reading and V, now most European music festivals are within cheap and easy reach. They&apos;re keen to attract British music fans, too. All have English language websites and many advertise in the British press. For my part, next month I&apos;m travelling (by train, as it happens, before the eco-warriors start laying into me) to the 10 Days Off (July 18 -28) electronic music festival in Ghent. For me - someone who, essentially, hates the traditional wet, windy, muddy, cruddy, pint-chucking, \u00a3150-a-ticket-costing, obvious-guitar-band-headlining British music festival - the advantages of heading to Belgium are many and varied. For a start, like many of the best European parties - such as Sonar (June 19 - 21) in Barcelona or Exit in Novi Sad (July 10 - 13) - 10DO is city-based, which means no camping and no dancing outdoors. I will be staying in a (hopefully) decent hotel with a comfy bed and a power shower. And if it rains, it won&apos;t make any difference inside the Vooruit Arts Centre. Better still, rather than spending Sunday, as I imagine most people do at British festivals, scouring a site that looks like the Somme for the last three rolls of Andrex, which some enterprising stall holder is knocking out at \u00a32-a-pop, I will be exploring Ghent, eating well, drinking in Soulwax-approved bars and getting to grips with the wider Ghent Festival, of which 10DO is but one strand. Although, as that wider arts festival includes an extensive puppet theatre programme, perhaps I shouldn&apos;t be too smug.  Another obvious draw at 10DO is the quality of the line-up. British dance music festivals, like Creamfields and Global Gathering, may be a lot more radical than they once were, but, in terms of electronic music, and general music festival programming, continental Europe is often far bolder. The line-up at 10DO isn&apos;t huge, but in the likes of James Holden, The Field, Anja Schneider, Jennifer Cardini, Busy P, Feadz, Dr Lectroluv, Richie Hawtin, Juan Maclean, Tiefschwarz and Rex The Dog, it offers a pretty creamy crop of cutting-edge techno/ electro talent. The line-up at its sister festival in Amsterdam, Five Days Off (July - 6) - Peaches, Hercules &amp; Love Affair, Santogold, Supermayer, Lupe Fiasco, Justice, Neon Neon - is, arguably, even better.  All of this comes relatively cheap, too. A 10-day 10DO pass is \u20ac67.5 (\u00a354), and there are plenty of other bargains to be had across Europe. Austria&apos;s Frequency (Aug 14 - 16) features 90 acts, including R.E.M and The Killers, and is only \u20ac99 (\u00a379) for three days, including camping. Another three-dayer, Open&apos;er in Poland (July 4 - 6), headlined by Massive Attack and Jay-Z will cost around \u00a376. The European Creamfields (July 12), held in Breclav in the Czech Republic, is a mere \u20ac35 for a full day&apos;s raving; while the rather fantastic-looking Melt (July 18 - 20) - a Who&apos;s Who of electronic/ indie talent playing amidst the towering cranes of an old open-cast mine near Leipzig - is just \u20ac85 (\u00a367) for three-days. Whatever you want, it&apos;s out there, often in an unusual location. If you want stunning Scandinavian countryside, Hove (June 23 - 27), one of Europe&apos;s first carbon neutral festivals, is held in a forest on the Norwegian coast. Conversely, if you agree that Glastonbury is too old and too middle class these days, Sziget (August 12 - 18), a week-long party on an island in the middle of the Danube, is renowned as one of the Europe&apos;s wildest. &quot;There are none of the niceties of contemporary festivals. It feels lawless,&quot; reckons Franz Ferdinand&apos;s Alex Kapranos.  But is he right? Have you been to Sziget? What are your experiences of other European festivals?

These are a well-kept secret, and they can be cheaper than normal tickets to London, especially if you need to travel at peak times. They also include the Underground to St Pancras. 2. Find the cheapest European train tickets To avoid booking fees and find all the cheapest deals, book online direct with these train operators:  \u00b7 raileurope.co.uk or voyages-sncf.com for trains within France and trains from Paris to Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Germany \u00b7 bahn.de for trains within Germany and sleeper trains from Cologne or Amsterdam to Prague, Vienna, Milan and Copenhagen  \u00b7 trenitalia.com for Italy (although you may need to call your bank to unblock this site if your credit card doesn&apos;t work)  \u00b7 renfe.es for Spain; cp.pt for Portugal; sbb.ch for Switzerland and oebb.at for Austria. Note Paying in euros at voyages-sncf.com can save up to 6% over paying in pounds at raileurope.co.uk, although the Rail Europe site is easier to use and has a UK call centre if you need help. 3. Check out cheap train-and-ferry fares London (or any other station in Britain) to Dublin costs \u00a327 each-way with a combined train-and-ferry ticket. Check out seat61.com/Ireland.htm or call 0845 0755755. There are cheap fares to other stations in Ireland including Belfast, too. London (or any One Railway station in East Anglia) to Amsterdam costs from \u00a329 each-way via Harwich-Hook. Try dutchflyer.co.uk or call 0870-5455455. 4. Treat railpasses with caution For simple A-to-B travel or even short tours, forget rail passes. Inexpensive advance-purchase fares are now both cheaper and easier to buy online than any pass. However, the famous InterRail pass can still be the best and most flexible way to make an extensive tour across Europe by train. A month&apos;s unlimited European train travel costs \u00a3480 if you&apos;re over 26, \u00a3320 if under. There are InterRail passes for shorter periods, too. Just remember to budget for supplements and reservation charges (typically \u20ac3 to \u20ac15 per trip), which passholders now have to pay for many long-distance trains. Book at Interrail.net. 5. Take the sleeper Save a night&apos;s hotel bill and the cost of airport transfers by taking a sleeper train between major European cities. For example, go from Paris to Florence, Venice, Rome, Barcelona or Madrid (raileurope.co.uk, 0844-8485848) or from Amsterdam to Prague, Vienna, Copenhagen or Milan (bahn.de/citynightline, 0871-8808066). There are, of course, many more options. 6. Take trains all over the world Trains can be a cheap, comfortable option for travelling around a country once you get there - and most countries have good train networks, including India, South Africa, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Recently, the rail minister Tom Harris wrote that &quot;increasing the maximum speed of a train from 125mph to 200mph leads to a 90% increase in energy consumption.&quot; So it looks like we&apos;ve got a long time to wait before sub-three-hour rail journeys from London to Scotland are a reality.

Britain will soon boast cities with the facilities to rival Europe&apos;s most cycle-friendly capitals.  That, at least, is the vision of the Department for Transport, which yesterday announced a \u00a3100m investment to turn one city and 11 towns into centres of urban cycling, in an effort to encourage 2.5 million Britons to get pedalling. Chief among the recipients is Bristol, which saw off competition from Manchester and Leicester to be named the country&apos;s first &quot;cycling city&quot;. The city council, in partnership with neighbouring South Gloucestershire council, won the bid promising Britain&apos;s first Paris-style on-street bike rental network, the offer of free bikes to people in deprived communities, state-of-the-art shower and locker facilities in the city centre, dedicated commuter &quot;cycle ways&quot; linking the suburbs and the centre, and an ambitious expansion in training for schoolchildren. It will match its \u00a311.4m grant with the same amount from the two councils and their partners over the next 30 months.  A further 11 towns will receive awards ranging from \u00a3600,000 to \u00a34.8m to become &quot;cycling demonstration&quot; centres, again matched by equivalent funds from local authorities. They are Blackpool, Cambridge, Chester, Colchester, Leighton-Linslade, Shrewsbury, Southend-on-Sea, Southport with Ainsdale, Stoke, Woking and York.  Helen Holland, leader of Bristol city council, described the award as &quot;absolutely fantastic&quot;, outlining plans to develop Bristol&apos;s waterfront cycle route and to improve access and lighting to the extremely popular Bristol to Bath cycle path. Between 3% and 4% of trips in the city are already made by bike, or approximately 12,000 journeys a day, a figure that has increased by 12% in the past year. The city&apos;s target is to increase cycling by 30% by 2011. Ruth Kelly, the transport minister, said high fuel prices were boosting cycling&apos;s popularity compared with driving. She said she expected Bristol and the other cycling towns to generate the kind of enthusiasm seen in cities like Amsterdam - the UK currently ranks 12th out of 15 European nations in terms of average distance cycled each year. &quot;In these towns and cities we expect to reach 20% of journeys by bikes, which is the level of some European cities,&quot; she said.  &quot;I know people are concerned about safety but it&apos;s a misperception that cycling is more dangerous. The number of cyclists getting killed or seriously injured has fallen by a third since the 1990s. We are also investing in infrastructure to make cycling safer, as well as high-quality cycle training for children.&quot; The government has already announced plans to extend its Bikeability cycle proficiency training to half a million children by 2012 and build 250 new Safe Links to School. At the Cycle Life shop in central Bristol yesterday, business was brisk on &quot;urban&quot; bikes, a hybrid of fat-tyred mountain bicycles and more town-friendly road bikes, while Simon Frost, a mechanic, said the shop had been buzzing with talk of the investment.  &quot;The traffic here is worse than London. The roads were made for horses and carts, not for cars, and the bus service is absolutely lousy. We are a small city here and so most things are reasonably cycle-able. So this sort of thing is exactly what we need.&quot;  Louise Neale, transport policy officer for Darlington, one of six towns named cycling demonstration centres in 2005, said Bristol and the other towns could expect to see significant increases in bike usage, comparable to Darlington&apos;s 20% increase in the year to May 2007. Cycling to school in the town, too, has increased from 0.9% in 2005 to 4.4% at the start of this school year. &quot;The funding means that people can provide the information and the infrastructure to make a change. I would say that most towns should be able to see an increase in their cycling levels.&quot;", "sentences": ["Move over Amsterdam and Paris; on your bike Copenhagen.", "She said she expected Bristol and the other cycling towns to generate the kind of enthusiasm seen in cities like Amsterdam - the UK currently ranks 12th out of 15 European nations in terms of average distance cycled each year."], "title": "Bristol wins first cycling city title in \u00a3100m plan to get Britons pedalling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/20/travelandtransport.ethicalliving", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "UK news", "Local government", "Society", "Travel", "United Kingdom holidays", "Transport", "Road transport", "Cities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-19T23:01:00Z", "article": "It feels faintly sacrilegious to say it, but InterRailing really isn&apos;t worth it. I don&apos;t mean in experience terms, of course - a month travelling around the continent by train is a superb way to pass your time. But at the end of the month, you might feel a little short-changed.  Let&apos;s break this down. The average one-month InterRail Pass (not first-class, and not with a young person&apos;s discount) costs \u00a3480. Which is rather a lot. And if you want to travel overnight - the way to make the most of your travelling time - you&apos;ll have to pay sleeper supplements. If you want to use high-speed trains, such as the TGV in France or the Thalys services between Paris, Amsterdam, and Brussels, again there is extra dosh to pay. Eurostar isn&apos;t included at all, and the same applies for certain scenic lines such as the gorgeous Flam railway in Norway, and the Circumetnea in Catania that plods around the base of Mount Etna. In fact, of the 30 countries included on an InterRail pass, only nine are totally covered. And one of them is Luxembourg. Furthermore, the more astute among you may have noticed there are more than 30 countries in Europe. There are 50. OK, most of the big hitters are on InterRail&apos;s list, and a fair few of the omissions are islands (Cyprus, Malta, Iceland etc), but some of Europe&apos;s lesser-visited, land-accessed gems don&apos;t make the cut. If you want to visit the historic centre of Vilnius, Lithuania&apos;s capital, well, you can&apos;t. Same goes for Latvia. In fact, a lot of ex-Soviet countries get relatively short shrift. Trying to get to the infamous kaZantip festival on the shores of the Ukrainian Black Sea this summer? Can&apos;t. Belarus, Moldova, or Estonia? Nope ...  So let&apos;s consider the alternatives. InterRail encourages its users to whizz from country to country in order to get their money&apos;s worth over the month. Instead, pick five destinations, spend as much time as you want in them, and pay the individual fares. If you&apos;re not in a rush, take the bus. If you&apos;re on a coach courtesy of Eurolines (eurolines.com), covering 32 countries as part of Europe&apos;s biggest coach network, you&apos;ll be treated to large picture windows and the kind of leg-room that makes train-goers cry with envy. Individual journeys on a coach will cost a hell of a lot less than the train, but if you still want to bundle it up, a 30-day bus pass with Eurolines costs from \u00a3205, less than half the cost of the rail equivalent.  Without a rail pass, you&apos;ll realise travel&apos;s biggest truism: there are considerably more roads than train tracks. Huge swathes of Europe, inaccessible by train, are suddenly yours to explore. Make your way to the treehouse city of Olympos on Turkey&apos;s Mediterranean coast via Gallipoli and Fethiye. Ramble into the wooded national parks of north-east Estonia. Backpack down the Albanian Riviera, one of Europe&apos;s most beautiful and undiscovered coastlines that no train could conquer. And without a train pass, you aren&apos;t landlocked. Catch a ferry to Sicily, or a hovercraft to Gotland, Sweden&apos;s party island in the Baltic. Rather than doing a three-point turn around the Adriatic from Italy to Croatia, catch an overnight ferry from Ancona to Split. With buses (and boats), the possibilities are endless. \u00b7 Benji Lanyado is the Guardian&apos;s budget travel columnist (theguardian.com/travel)", "sentences": ["If you want to use high-speed trains, such as the TGV in France or the Thalys services between Paris, Amsterdam, and Brussels, again there is extra dosh to pay."], "title": "How to save money: The pluses of buses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jun/20/consumeraffairs2", "tags": ["Saving money", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-19T23:01:00Z", "article": "Couchsurfing Adam Schofield Adam is on a mission: to visit every country in the world without paying for a hotel room. As a member of Couchsurfing.com, he utilises an ever-expanding online directory of people offering travellers a free place to stay.  Since its foundation in 2004, the site has accrued more than 500,000 users, based across the world from the South Pole to Iraq. Over the past 18 months Adam, a 29-year-old from Bolton who goes by the online moniker &quot;DJ Ajam&quot;, has couchsurfed his way through 11 countries, staying in 69 homes. Having started in the US and made his way through central America, he is currently in Ecuador.  The idea for the trip came after the death of his parents; his father from an accident on holiday in Spain, his mother from throat cancer three years later. &quot;I was left with a choice,&quot; he says. &quot;Get a mortgage and take full-ownership of the house, or sell everything that I own to follow my dreams and travel the world.&quot; The Couchsurfing process is simple: you click on your destination via the website&apos;s map-illustrated menu and a list of local members appears. Members&apos; profiles give you an idea of their personality, interests and objectives for using the site. Travellers can then email whoever they like to request a place to stay, and the host decides to agree or not. Those that can&apos;t offer a couch may offer to meet for dinner, a drink or a day out instead.  Adam has budgeted \u00a3100 a week for his five-year trip. &quot;Sometimes I may need extra for excursions or travel but, if that&apos;s the case, I try to spend the next weeks relaxing and spending very little to balance out the budget.&quot;  He saves additional money by preparing meals in his hosts&apos; kitchens instead of eating out. His online profile tells prospective hosts he is a keen cook, and that they should expect to have dinner waiting for them &quot;when they come home from a busy day at work&quot;.  Hospitality tourism is a growing global trend and is particularly popular with those travelling on a tight budget. Second to Couchsurfing.com is German-born HospitalityClub.org (approaching 400,000 members), while similar sites include BeWelcome.org, Stay4free.com and Globalfreeloaders.com. Most users view the concept as more than simple freeloading. Users are advised not to treat homes as hotels, and to follow any house rules the host may have. However, not all hosts have the same expectations. While most view it as a cultural exchange and will expect the guest to spend time with them, others leave visitors to their own devices and may even give them a key to come and go.  When it comes to safety, Couchsurfing has the most advanced precautions, allowing users to verify their identity through a small credit card payment or to be &quot;vouched for&quot; by established members. Hospitality Club advises members to exchange passport numbers, and almost all sites have a reference system where hosts and guests post short reviews of their experiences.  Adam has racked up numerous glowing references and nearly 500 Couchsurfing &quot;friends&quot;. Whether he completes his mission remains to be seen, but he&apos;s certainly not lacking enthusiasm - and urges wannabe Couchsurfers to get involved: &quot;Even if you can&apos;t host, try to attend local meetings or organise events. It&apos;s much more than a free couch.&quot; Vicky Baker  \u00b7 Vicky Baker is currently trialling hospitality sites on her trip across South America.

Flashpacking The Villa Saint Exupery (vsaint.com) is sculpted from an old Carmelite monastery, perched on a hill overlooking the French city of Nice. The stained-glass windows in the old chapel remain, as do the olive, pine and carob trees dotted across a landscaped garden once intended for monastic reflection. For a cruddy, characterless hotel down the road, you&apos;ll pay \u20ac100 a night - yet at the Villa Saint Exupery, an ensuite twin costs a maximum of \u20ac40 a night. That&apos;s because it&apos;s a hostel. &quot;Hostel&quot; is a loaded word. So much so that hostelworld.comwebsites, is currently campaigning for dictionaries worldwide to change its definition. Generally, people subscribe to the dictionary descriptions - something between a doss house and a squat. They don&apos;t expect city-centre locations, fresh mango breakfasts, or lush double-beds in individually designed rooms. It&apos;s their loss. Sure, there are plenty of grotty dives out there, but there is as much difference between a good hostel and a bad hostel as there is between a one-star and a five-star hotel. The increasing number of top-notch hostels has even spawned an industry buzzword - &quot;flashpacking&quot;. And it&apos;s catching on.  In Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, the Celica hostel  (souhostel.com) has won design awards, having taken an old Yugoslav-era prison and converted it into an art enthusiast&apos;s dream where each double-room is individually designed by local artists. Yours from \u20ac36 a night. The Gershwin (gershwinhotel.com) in New York - a pop art-themed hotel in the excellently located Manhattan district of Flatiron, where each floor is decorated with prints by Warhol&apos;s contemporaries - has designated its basement as an &quot;auberge&quot; floor. Which is posh for hostel. If you are travelling as four friends, you can bag a well-appointed four-bed dorm for $40 each.  For many, privacy is the issue. You don&apos;t want to be snuggling up on your romantic break accompanied by 12 Aussies and a bloke murdering Dylan on the guitar. But most hostels have double rooms, and some of them lick anything you&apos;ll find at a hotel. When perusing through hostel websites, there are always images with each description: keep an eye out for the pretty ones. At the Backpack Guesthouse in Budapest (backpackbudapest.hu), the \u20ac34 downstairs double is lit by a dim antique light, backing on to a beautiful garden where the employees practise pilates in the morning. In Valencia, Rooms Deluxe (roomsdeluxe.com) offers some of the best-looking doubles in the city, including one themed as a Buddhist temple and another as a &quot;flamenco suite&quot;, for an admittedly top-end \u20ac70 a night. Some backpacking &quot;purists&quot; will argue that when the frills come, the character goes. Perhaps. But no one could argue that after a night at Tucano House (tucanohouse.com) on the breathtaking island of Florianopolis in Brazil. The rooms, including two doubles, are airy, pinned by wooden ceilings and floors, and, of course, cheap as chips. But your hosts Lilla and Ciao Capela - with their unnerving knack of recommending the best beaches, organising barbecues and rustling up mango and melon breakfasts - are priceless. Benji Lanyado House-swapping The Gibson family After 10 successful house exchanges, Nicola Gibson is something of a veteran. She and her husband Giulio have taken their family all over the UK, in each case swapping their three-bedroom terraced home in the Queen&apos;s Park area of Brighton. Last August they spent a week at the Edinburgh Festival, staying in a smart flat in Morningside. This summer they are off to Amsterdam, their first foreign trip. House-swaps have been such a success that they wouldn&apos;t now consider going on holiday any other way. &quot;Living on a single, modest income, we initially started swapping because we simply couldn&apos;t afford to pay for hotels or B&amp;Bs,&quot; Nicola says. &quot;Also, since we don&apos;t have a car, house-swaps are perfect because when you travel by train, you are limited in what you can carry. Camping is simply out of the question.&quot; She initially organised all the family&apos;s swaps through the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). But to extend their horizons abroad, they have since signed up with the Guardian&apos;s own home-swapping website, guardianhomeexchange.co.uk.  &quot;We have been all over the UK and haven&apos;t had a bad experience. One of the great things about swapping houses with other couples who are at a similar stage is that they have lots of toys for the kids to play with. And it&apos;s great being given the inside tips on a place, and still having money to spend on going out. &quot;The only bad thing is having to make your home spick-and-span for the people coming to stay in your place!

Known as a &quot;419&quot; after the section in the Nigerian legal code that forbids them, it is one of the oldest scams around. Some claim it originated hundreds of years ago. Most people send the emails straight to trash, asking how anyone could be daft enough to fall for the promise of easy riches. But not everyone. A Yorkshireman believed his email in 2004. And in chasing his dream - in this case \u00a34m - his life has descended into a situation where relationships are threatened, his children have disowned him and his one-time financial comfort blanket has disintegrated. Along with his partner, he has become involved in cloak-and-dagger operations in an Amsterdam car park, long-distance phone calls - apparently to South Africa - and secret meetings on Dutch industrial estates with a man who describes himself as a &quot;barrister&quot; and calls himself Frank Owen. Once he was escorted by men carrying guns. But, despite spending tens of thousands on his financial quest, the scammers keep demanding more cash to meet &quot;unforeseen expenses,&quot; just as he thinks he is near to getting his hands on the money. He is now no nearer to the promised fortune than when he started out four years ago. Guardian Money this week talked to John Watts and his partner Gloria Neil, who live in Yorkshire. The couple describe how the scam started, how it continues and its effect on their lives. The story begins in 2004 after Watts had faced personal difficulties, including the death of his wife and a work partner stealing money. &quot;Shortly after, I met John through a lonely hearts column,&quot; says Neil. &quot;I saw him as a really nice guy who had run into bad things. He told me he was very wealthy. I knew he owned a house and had a good income but he meant &apos;very, very wealthy&apos; - to be counted in millions.&quot; Neil, a former bank employee, says wealth was not important. &quot;I had been out with a few men at that time - John was by far the most pleasant.&quot; But she was soon to discover that this wealth was based on a promise in an email from Owen to deliver money that did not, and does not, exist. The Owen email is now deleted; it involved moving money garnered by a former Congolese dictator. But &quot;Frank Owen&quot; is such a prolific emailer that it is very probable that several &quot;419&quot; scammers use the same name. In 2006, &quot;Owen&quot; claimed he was a manager at Standard Chartered Bank and he just happened to find an unclaimed account with $8m (it belonged, he said, to a family who all died in the same fire) which he was prepared to share. A few months after their relationship started, Watts told Neil about the email and how he was &quot;so close&quot; to getting his hands on the money. &quot;It&apos;s been like that ever since. He&apos;s always just about to get the cash when Frank Owen asks for more to - as Owen says - clear final hurdles.&quot; There have been several phone conversations with someone called Owen apparently based in South Africa, even though his phone is a mobile from Guinea-Bissau in western Africa, one of the world&apos;s poorest countries. Watts will not say how much he has paid out, but it is at least \u00a350,000 and could be as much as \u00a3200,000. He sold his car for \u00a36,000 - he could have got \u00a314,000 if he had been able to wait. And his luxury home has gone. The payments are in cash via Western Union - transactions that are virtually impossible to trace. But the only cash he has ever had is $500 (\u00a3260). Last year he went to Amsterdam - favoured by many &quot;419&quot; scammers - to see Owen. He was met at the station, driven for 30 minutes in a blacked-out car to an edge-of-town location and shown a suitcase which was, he was told, full of the cash. The case was guarded by men with guns. &quot;The money was sealed in black wrappers but I was allowed to look at them and choose one. It had some money in it which I kept,&quot; he says. On another visit to Amsterdam, when he believed he was very close to the money, he was told the Dutch government and treasury officials had intervened and it would need more cash from him to bribe officials. Neil accompanied Watts on one trip to the Netherlands. &quot;We drove to a central Amsterdam car park and spent two hours there, only to discover Owen had decided not to appear. It might have been because I was there,&quot; says Neil. &quot;So we drove straight back. Before, there was still a tiny element in me that wanted to believe in the money. Now I knew it was nonsense. John is vulnerable and they are playing with him.&quot; She has tried reporting the scam but, beyond taking basic details, neither the Dutch nor the UK police seem interested. Police sources say this is because the crime does not involve violence, the scam crosses borders and, perhaps most importantly, the victim seems to be a willing participant. But few victims complain - to do so would be to admit complicity in attempted money laundering, even if there is no money. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to tell John to stop this,&quot; Neil says. &quot;But he won&apos;t. He believes that one more payment will get the gold at the end of the rainbow. It&apos;s been very destructive of our relationship.&quot; Watts replies: &quot;This is my money and my business. I did see some cash, although I suppose it could be false. I did ask questions and I checked it through Reuters [Reuters, of course, has nothing to do with this]. &quot;I know I have made mistakes in life but this search after the money is now all past tense. I don&apos;t give a damn what anyone says. Nothing on this earth bothers me. But I am resolved to stopping this altogether and trying to get my life back on track.&quot; Whether he does, remains to be seen. \u00b7 The victims&apos; names have been changedt.levene@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["Along with his partner, he has become involved in cloak-and-dagger operations in an Amsterdam car park, long-distance phone calls - apparently to South Africa - and secret meetings on Dutch industrial estates with a man who describes himself as a &quot;barrister&quot; and calls himself Frank Owen.", "Last year he went to Amsterdam - favoured by many &quot;419&quot; scammers - to see Owen.", "On another visit to Amsterdam, when he believed he was very close to the money, he was told the Dutch government and treasury officials had intervened and it would need more cash from him to bribe officials.", "&quot;We drove to a central Amsterdam car park and spent two hours there, only to discover Owen had decided not to appear."], "title": "Risking all for a \u00a34m email con", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jun/21/scamsandfraud.consumeraffairs", "tags": ["Scams", "Consumer affairs", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-23T23:01:00Z", "article": "The world&apos;s largest oilseed processor, Bunge, is paying $4.4bn (\u00a32.2bn) for a leading maker of food sweeteners, Corn Products, as the agricultural industry wallows in cash generated by soaring food prices.

Its roots lie in a Dutch commodities trader, Bunge &amp; Co, founded in Amsterdam in 1818. The United Nations&apos; World Food Programme has raised concern about the rocketing price of basics such as wheat and rice, fuelled by a combination of turbulent weather, poor harvests, rising demand from emerging economies and speculation. Leaders of the G8 industrial powers will discuss food inflation in Japan next month, alarmed by food riots in countries including Egypt and Haiti. In the US, warehouse retailers have rationed sales of rice to cope with hoarding. Rising prices have benefited large-scale agricultural corporations. Bunge&apos;s shares have soared 46% over the past 12 months and it yesterday raised earnings guidance for 2008 by nearly 30% to between $7.10 and $7.40 a share - equivalent to profits of $1.3bn, against $778m in 2007. &quot;We continue to benefit from good fundamentals in core markets,&quot; said Bunge&apos;s chief financial officer, Jacqualyn Fouse.  Corn Products has a 10% share of the US market for high-fructose corn sweeteners, used in fizzy drinks and processed foods. It was established in 1906 and is particularly strong in South America.

She remembered the boy&apos;s death that had sent her spiralling from Pulitzer prize-winning journalist to washed-up alcoholic on the obituaries page. A tragedy was always a good substitute for depth of character, she thought, as she looked out of her Scottish hotel window. Anna Fischer, the world&apos;s most beautiful and intelligent woman, said &quot;Yes&quot; in all the 9,000 languages in which she was fluent, as Shaw proposed. &quot;But please tell me your first name,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I&apos;m far too tough to have one,&quot; he grunted. Frank Wells shook his head. &quot;You haven&apos;t even told Anna what you do,&quot; he said. &quot;So let me remind you that you&apos;re never going to stop working for this top-secret but basically good maverick law enforcement agency. Now go and kill 521 drug dealers in Scotland.&quot; Katie stumbled on 521 drug dealers. Shaw jumped in front of her, taking a full Uzi magazine in the chest, before killing the last 128 dealers. He wiped away the blood and left. I bet he&apos;s got a beautiful girlfriend called Anna who works for Phoenix, the world&apos;s most respected thinktank, Katie reckoned. I&apos;ll make friends with her. Creel was pleased with life. The perception management campaign was going well. The Russians had just killed 15,002 Taliban extremists. Now for his final coup. He alone knew that Phoenix was actually owned by the Chinese. Anna suspected she was the only person in the world to suspect the Russians were being set up. This was the last thought she ever had as men dressed as Russian soldiers gunned down the entire Phoenix staff in their London office before escaping unnoticed. &quot;We need Shaw,&quot; Frank said to Royce, the M15 agent. Shaw howled with grief in intensive care after his run-in with 21,784 French neo-Nazis. &quot;Let&apos;s get the bastards,&quot; he spat, pulling out the life-support tubes. &quot;I can manage with a ruptured aorta, but I can&apos;t manage without Anna.&quot; &quot;I think you&apos;ll find you can,&quot; Katie muttered, sensing she could be the new love interest. Creel rubbed his hands on his 23,019-metre yacht as a border skirmish broke out between Russian and Chinese troops. Oil was up to $130 a barrel. The world was in crisis.

Katie eyed up her third Pulitzer prize as she filed her inside story of the Phoenix massacre. &quot;You&apos;ve been set up,&quot; grunted Shaw. &quot;Then only you can save the world,&quot; she sobbed. Shaw watched as the tracking device hidden in Katie&apos;s brain led him to Creel&apos;s yacht. &quot;It must be a surprise that I&apos;m Creel&apos;s stooge and have kidnapped Katie,&quot; Royce sneered. &quot;Not really,&quot; said Shaw as he garrotted him, before breaking the necks of 17,852 other henchmen and gratuitously ripping open his own abdomen to pull out a phosphor bomb he had unnecessarily had implanted there.

The girl and two friends detach themselves from the others and scramble over to Lawler, whose skinny frame and halo of curls say &quot;pop star&quot; as surely as if he were toting around a platinum disc. &quot;Jon, can you do us a favour?&quot; When Lawler nods indulgently, she continues: &quot;Could you send the support band out?&quot; After an instant&apos;s bemused silence, he echoes: &quot;The support band?&quot; &quot;We really want to meet them,&quot; she explains. &quot;I&apos;ll see what I can do,&quot; he tells her and walks off, shaking his head as if he can&apos;t believe it. This must be one of the times when Lawler wonders whether selling 1.5m copies of the Fratellis&apos; debut album, Costello Music, actually means anything. For every true believer who sings their songs at football matches and crams into venues to see them, there seems to be someone else who would rather meet the support band. Or, worse, is a critic who regards the group as beery louts. There are reams of reviews, both for Costello Music and their new album, Here We Stand, that portray the Glasgow band as yobs making music for yobs. Like it or not (and they don&apos;t), the Fratellis have been designated this era&apos;s custodians of the oik-rock tradition. So Lawler and his bandmates, bassist Barry Wallace and drummer Gordon &quot;Mince&quot; McRory, are in an odd position. On the one hand, they&apos;re a proper pop phenomenon: Scotland&apos;s biggest group, winners of the 2007 Brit award for British Breakthrough Act, inescapable to anyone who watches football (Chelsea Dagger has become the nation&apos;s terrace chant of choice) and all-round band of the people. But on the other, they&apos;re reviled by many for the very reasons others love them. And that greatly annoys Lawler, who, as the middle-class son of two teachers, probably has more in common with the Fratellis&apos; critics than with the people who buy their records. &quot;You can&apos;t pick your fans, can you?&quot; he asks, having settled himself at an outdoor table overlooking the canal that runs behind the Paradiso. &quot;But we&apos;re grateful to have fans. And I think when people describe us as a band to get drunk to, or a party band, it shows you how out of fashion rock&apos;n&apos;roll is. We get described as a pub band, but that&apos;s what rock&apos;n&apos;roll is. Twist and Shout was three chords and &apos;C&apos;mon, c&apos;mon, c&apos;mon&apos; - it was nonsensical. But that was why it was effective.&quot; Lawler&apos;s passion is melody; he wants to write songs that postmen whistle and football crowds chant and radio stations keep on rotation. &quot;People don&apos;t trust melody,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve always been a huge fan of the Beatles and Pink Floyd, people who use melody. I don&apos;t understand dance music. Melody, a tune - it&apos;s primal.&quot; Is that what accounts for those 1.5m sales? He laughs softly. &quot;I don&apos;t know the complex answer, but the simple answer is that a good band will get an audience. I knew as soon as we started to play together that we had it, &apos;cos I&apos;d listened to the radio and it was all Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party, and I knew from the first minute that this was the one that was going to work. There was a click, and I knew.&quot; His instincts were spot-on. Brought together in 2004 by an ad posted in a Glasgow music shop, the trio played their first gig early in 2005. By the end of 2006, they had a No 2 album. Lawler was then 27 and had been around the block several times, working by day at a Ministry of Defence call centre - most of his wages went to his ex-wife, who he&apos;d married as a teenager, and their son - and writing songs at night. Wallace and McRory were similarly dividing their lives between day jobs and nighttime music &quot;careers&quot; (the new song Shameless draws attention to the fact that many of their competitors are &quot;half as old as I am&quot; and seem &quot;younger every night&quot;, though Lawler claims to be unfazed by the prospect of turning 30 next year). The initial media coverage was adulatory, but the Fratellis reacted as if the media were a particularly pesky fly. In early interviews, they sulked, fabricated stories (their Wikipedia entry still lists Fratelli as their common surname, as per their lie that they&apos;d all dropped their real names and adopted it) and failed to charm. &quot;[The press] did dance around us for the first few months,&quot; Lawler acknowledges, making it clear that he hadn&apos;t been happy about it. Eventually, though, the press got the message: the Fratellis didn&apos;t like them. They responded in kind. &quot;Lots of the bands we love, like Zeppelin and Floyd, were also hated by the press,&quot; Lawler says with an air of quiet vindication. &quot;We did two cardinal sins with the press: we took the piss, then stopped talking to them.&quot; Despite the chippiness, Lawler is very likable. He&apos;s articulate and introspective - in contrast to colleague Barry, who whiles away the pre-soundcheck minutes by showing a group of roadies that he can insert a lit cigarette into his belly-button and &quot;smoke&quot; it - and admits he&apos;s not a natural frontman. &quot;I&apos;m introverted by nature. I&apos;d give it to Mince in a flash, &apos;cos he&apos;s got that exuberance.&quot; Well, there&apos;s a revelation, since Mince doesn&apos;t do interviews or photos, and today is out visiting Amsterdam&apos;s famous coffee shops. Seeing himself as a lyrics-and-tunes man rather than a performer, Lawler now confesses that he doesn&apos;t think much of Costello Music. &quot;I agreed with some critics about it. There was a decent percentage of it that I didn&apos;t like. It has a pop sheen, and we don&apos;t want to be a pop band.&quot; He&apos;s much happier with Here We Stand, which the band insisted on producing themselves. &quot;The only reference people had for us was the first album, and that really bugged me. That&apos;s why we didn&apos;t use a producer on this, &apos;cos we didn&apos;t want anybody else getting their hands on it. It was the album I was desperate to make, and I think it&apos;ll change a lot of opinions.&quot; A tiny spider chooses this moment to appear on the table. When he sees it, he blanches and hastily moves to another seat. &quot;I&apos;m scared of spiders,&quot; he says, mildly embarrassed, which leads to an anecdote about his wife phoning him on tour in Munich a few days ago to announce timorously that she had found a spider in their house, and what should she do? Mrs Lawler is a key character in the Fratellis&apos; story, a burlesque dancer whose stage name was Chelsea Dagger, she was the inspiration for the band&apos;s signature hit. &quot;Her name was a play on Britney Spears. I remember the night I wrote it - I found the notebook with the lyrics the other night. It came to me really quickly. I was going [sings the familiar refrain] &apos;Do-do-do-do-do-do&apos; and it was so easy to write that I couldn&apos;t believe nobody had ever used [the melody] before.&quot; He is, however, much more satisfied with the music on Here We Stand, which, unlike most second albums, is not much concerned with the experience of suddenly being famous. &quot;I don&apos;t like to reveal too much or pour out my heart and soul, but I&apos;m really proud of the lyrics on this album. When I hear them, I smile to myself and think I&apos;ve done some good work. I&apos;m really proud of a line in Shameless: &apos;Won&apos;t you make sure my mother gets half my weight in gold/ Tell her I just did what I was told.&apos;&quot; He sits back and waits for my reaction. &quot;Hmm,&quot; I say. He goes on: &quot;If someone else had written that, I&apos;d have been really jealous.&quot; But is he as pleased with Here We Stand&apos;s first single, Mistress Mabel, which is a load of rhyming gibberish (&quot;Headline ratbag, so they told her/ Last night&apos;s nametag across her shoulder&quot;) set to mid-tempo pub-rock? He isn&apos;t. &quot;Mistress Mabel is absolutely the worst lyrics I&apos;ve ever written. I&apos;d had the song for ages and just couldn&apos;t think of lyrics that meant anything to me.&quot; Later, the Fratellis provoke the same reaction from their Dutch audience as they would from a British crowd: it&apos;s all unbridled dancing, singalongs and a sweaty sense of fraternity. The band&apos;s manager, Tony McGill, watches with me. Chelsea Dagger, of course, spurs the place into a frenzy of churning hands and feet, and McGill is shouting. It&apos;s hard to hear him, but he&apos;s saying something about the tune having been used as the theme to a Dutch TV show. Which seems about right. Pop like this is universal, and the Fratellis have earned their place in the pantheon of British groups who move crowds by hitting them with songs that they&apos;ll be singing all the way home.  \u00b7 Here We Stand is out now.

We&apos;re coming up to the international festival season, with the Proms and Edinburgh on the horizon, which makes me all the more aware of the gaping hole at the heart of new music in the capital. Sure, we&apos;ve had some fantastic individual events this year - the South Bank&apos;s Luigi Nono concerts foremost among them - but the time is surely ripe for London to have its chance to showcase the newest musical culture with the focus and adventure that a festival provides. In Britain, the best - and really the only - place to get a fix of new music is at Huddersfield in November, and having been the guest artistic director there in 2005, I know just how crucial those ten days of experimentation and avant-garde immersion are to the UK&apos;s new music calendar. But the capital is lamentably under-served by its promoters and cultural impresarios for contemporary music: Irvine Arditti told me in our interview a couple of weeks ago that the Arditti Quartet still play the overwhelming majority of their gigs abroad, which means we&apos;re mostly denied the chance to hear these presiding geniuses of the string quartet in concert in Irvine&apos;s home city. There&apos;s always the London Sinfonietta. But wonderful and essential as they are, no single ensemble can bear the responsibility of playing the whole gamut of contemporary compositional creativity to the capital. What we need is the regular chance to see the other greats of new music - Frankfurt&apos;s Ensemble Modern, Paris&apos;s Ensemble Intercontemporain, Klangforum Wien, Amsterdam&apos;s Ives Ensemble, Australia&apos;s ELISION Ensemble - to experience other ways of interpreting the greats of the 20th and 21st centuries, and to hear their unique performance practices at the cutting edge music from Europe and the rest of the world that we simply never get the chance to hear live otherwise. There are whole worlds of musical invention and possibility that we - ok, I admit this is London-centric but, Huddersfield aside, the point stands for whole country - are missing out on. Valiant attempts in the past, like John Woolrich&apos;s much-lamented Hoxton New Music Days, have foundered thanks to lack of sponsorship and institutional support. My challenge is for one of the big organisations to put their weight behind a dedicated new music festival, to inspire, enthuse, and catalyse a new generation of listeners.

In an interview with Will Buckley, Andy Murray explained that he felt more relaxed at Wimbledon this year. One of the reasons is that he has a better understanding of his responsibilities and the media&apos;s. &apos;You can&apos;t take the things said about you to heart,&apos; Murray said. &apos;You have to understand that these things happen, it&apos;s people&apos;s jobs.&apos; Should Murray, Heaven forbid, find himself at an unscheduled loose end during the next few days, he could do a disappointed nation a favour by nipping up to Silverstone and having a quiet word with the next in line for the onerous role of Britain&apos;s &apos;Favourite Sporting Person of the Week&apos;. Hamilton faces a personal crossroads and the Englishman is showing worrying signs of taking a wrong turning long before next Sunday&apos;s British Grand Prix gets under way. Hamilton could do with someone&apos;s help in ensuring he does not enter a dark cul-de-sac rather than steaming straight on towards the sunshine that his talent deserves to reflect. The first evidence that Hamilton might be unnecessarily applying the brakes to his relationship with the media came a few days before last Sunday&apos;s French Grand Prix. Hamilton had barely sat down for his customary Thursday briefing when he said: &apos;I hear you guys have been writing nasty things.&apos; Although no one could be entirely certain, this was probably a reference to comment on his collision with Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s Ferrari in the pit lane at the previous race in Montreal. It was an accident that had the misfortune to possess such connotations with the everyday motorist and traffic lights that even the most serious journalist was hard-pressed to avoid making a wry remark in print.  In a less serious incident, but one with similar humorous implications for a driver of a 200mph F1 car, Hamilton&apos;s misfortunes continued yesterday when a yacht he was crewing in the Round the Island Race off the Isle of Wight collided with and dismasted another competitor. Hamilton was an innocent party on board the yacht supported by McLaren sponsor, Hugo Boss, but there was no question that the Canadian incident was his mistake and one which the media had been entitled to comment on. This was new territory for Hamilton. In a 15-month Formula One career that, until recent weeks, has been largely error-free, Hamilton has enjoyed positive support from a national media that, truth be told, need their man to enjoy every bit as much success as he would wish upon himself. Judging by his comments, however, Hamilton has yet to come to terms with the thought that the media are also at liberty to report failure just as readily as they trumpet success. Having read - or heard about - the glowing headlines last year, Hamilton would appear to have fallen into the trap of believing that the media are there solely for his greater good, a damaging misjudgment made on many occasions by Ron Dennis, Hamilton&apos;s former mentor and the boss of McLaren. Matters were not helped last Sunday when Hamilton&apos;s struggle to overcome a 10-place penalty on the starting grid resulted in driving into trouble as he ran wide while attempted to fight his way through the field; again, unfamiliar ground for a championship contender who, until then, had rarely needed to deal with the rougher element of the grid. Whether or not the drive-through penalty was fair does not matter now. The punishment dropped him out of contention and straight into further difficulties with the media. By refusing at first to speak to journalists and then giving clipped answers when forced to do so, Hamilton, rightly or wrongly, gave the impression that he is suffering from the pressure of his own expectations, never mind those of 90,000 eager supporters waiting at Silverstone next weekend. That may be an uncharitable interpretation, but it is one that even Hamilton&apos;s strongest supporters in the Fifth Estate felt inclined to embrace after the driver had made ill-informed remarks about the media as a whole during a typically cloying pre-race interview by ITV. Either way, it is not what Hamilton needs at a time when he should be concentrating totally on his driving rather than worrying unnecessarily about words that appear to be doing more damage than the best efforts of the three drivers ahead of him in the championship. Hamilton was his own worst enemy when he said, pre-season, that the only thing left to do after narrowly failing to take the title in 2007 was to win it in 2008. Anything less would be considered a failure. Motor racing is not that simple but, unfortunately, Hamilton&apos;s own words have condemned him to the role of loser when he remains potentially one of the best drivers Britain has ever produced. Having won six grands prix, Hamilton is on his way to matching the 22 victories scored by Damon Hill during his seven seasons in F1. Hill knows all about the latent menace associated with the media. In 1994 he quickly became a national hero after taking the championship fight to Michael Schumacher and failing to win it thanks to the dastardly German driving into the Englishman&apos;s Williams at the last round in Australia. Hill had won the British Grand Prix that year, an occasion he described as &apos;a day made in heaven&apos;. Twelve months later, he suffered a day from hell at the same circuit after crashing into the back of Schumacher and being described on the back page of one British tabloid as a &apos;prat&apos;. &apos;It&apos;s a bit like a cat with a mouse, isn&apos;t it?&apos; Hill says in an exclusive interview in Wednesday&apos;s Autocar. &apos;I&apos;m not saying that the cat wants to kill the mouse, but it&apos;s a test they put you through. It starts with fulsome praise, and before you know it, you&apos;ve suddenly changed into a national embarrassment.&apos; Having been voted 1994 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, Hill became almost desperate to prove that he should have won the title (echoes, in some ways, of Hamilton&apos;s response to failure last year). At the end of a miserable 1995 season riddled with inconsistent driving, Hill sat down, gave himself a good talking-to and emerged the rounded and calm performer capable of winning the championship in 1996. &apos;The real competitor motivates himself,&apos; Hill says. &apos;All I wanted to do was achieve the results and you need to ride out what the media is saying about you. That&apos;s what Lewis has to do. You just have to keep a sense of humour about it, although I must admit I had sense-of-humour failure on many occasions. &apos;I think Lewis is fully prepared for success and he has that slightly messianic focus in his psychology which spells out that motor racing is his life and what his life means. The only potential danger is that he expects there will be nothing but praise. That&apos;s just not going to happen, and that&apos;s quite difficult when one day you&apos;re being hailed as the star who can deliver what Britain wants in sporting terms, and the next day people are saying it was all an illusion.&apos; There is nothing false about Hamilton&apos;s potential. He remains in contention for the championship despite having dropped to the back of the quartet of favourites. But he needs to come to terms with how his life has changed since his home event in 2007. Last year, Hamilton arrived at Silverstone on the crest of a wave, having won twice and finished on the podium in every race since his debut four months before in Melbourne. He could do no wrong and, even if he did, it was easily forgiven during this glorious honeymoon. It was an extraordinary record of achievement for a novice, one that is unlikely to be matched. It is also a rod hovering across his back as Hamilton experiences the inevitable vagaries of F1 and, worse still, appears in the eyes of an expectant media to be handling them badly. Hamilton should be given room to manoeuvre and mature. He is only 23 and next Sunday&apos;s grand prix will be his 26th. It took Michael Schumacher 18 races before he won his first; 52 grands prix before he was in a position to clinch the title at the age of 25. Hamilton scarcely has time to call his own. In a week packed with appointments, he will spend part of Tuesday at a press conference in Amsterdam; hardly ideal preparation for the many demands of Silverstone. Hamilton needs to be ready for the inevitable questions that he may consider personal, irrelevant or unfair. It is true that certain sections of the media need to understand how F1 works, but Hamilton also requires gentle tutelage in dealing with those whom he is in danger of considering his enemy. More than that, he simply needs to focus - and be allowed to focus - on what he does so brilliantly while avoiding the temptation to nip down a nasty cul-de-sac to read the newspapers.", "sentences": ["In a week packed with appointments, he will spend part of Tuesday at a press conference in Amsterdam; hardly ideal preparation for the many demands of Silverstone."], "title": "Lewis feels the strain as success makes him ill-equipped to deal with failure", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/29/formulaone.lewishamilton", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-28T23:01:00Z", "article": "If you suffer from epilepsy and you live in Athens you are less likely to receive the vital drugs you need for treatment than if you live in London, Berlin or Amsterdam. And, says Konstantinos Lourantos, president of the Association of Pharmacies of Attica, the fact that they are freely available in other parts of Europe contributes to their shortage in his country. The reason? Lourantos, whose organisation represents some 3,500 pharmacists in and around Athens, blames companies that buy up medicines in Greece and export them to other EU countries, exploiting the price differences for drugs across the EU. The UK is one of the largest markets for these companies, known as the parallel pharmaceutical traders (PPTs), along with Germany, Holland and Denmark. Lourantos says: &apos;For example, there is a medicine called Lamictal for epilepsy which is imported to Greece but it is re-exported in such a huge quantity that there is very little left.&apos; He says the problem affects supplies of a number of drugs, including Astra Zeneca&apos;s Seroqual for treating bipolar disorder and Risperdal, an anti-psychotic treatment. The APA tried using the Greek courts to stop this re-export trade, but its action was thrown out because the movement of drugs in the EU, like that of jeans or cars, is legal under the Treaty of Rome. The parallel pharmaceutical trade started in Holland in the seventies and is now estimated to be worth between 2 and 3 per cent of total European drug sales. According to the British Association of European Pharmaceutical Distributors (BAEPD), which represents British parallel traders, it is worth 13 per cent of total UK drug sales of \u00a39-10bn. The trade is an arbitrage between patent medicine prices in different countries which are negotiated between governments and the pharmaceutical industry. Prices are generally set lower in, for example, Greece, Spain and France than in the UK, Germany and Holland. Traders buy &apos;low&apos; in these countries, transport the products, repackage them in the language of the importing state, and sell them there at a higher price. Parallel trading is highly controversial, not only because of the reported shortages of medicine in countries such as Greece, but also because international pharmaceutical giants such as Eli Lilly and Pfizer claim that the trade threatens patient safety and compromises the security of drugs supply. Parallel traders deny this and argue that it provides the only competition in the supply of patented treatments, so reducing prices.  UK pharmacists are encouraged to source drugs at the lowest price while maintaining safety. They can go to one of around a dozen &apos;full line&apos; wholesalers (the biggest include Alliance Boots, Phoenix and AAH) which supply a wide range of approved drugs, or to one of 1,700 &apos;short line&apos; suppliers (including some 70 parallel traders) which have a more limited list, usually cheaper.  UK wholesalers typically get a discount from manufacturers on the price agreed with the government (the reimbursement price), of around 12.5 per cent. They pass between 10 to 11 per cent to pharmacists. Parallel importers can offer larger discounts (15-18 per cent) on the reimbursement price because they source products at below this level.  &apos;This is the reason that pharmacists are in favour of PPT,&apos; says Richard Freudenberg, secretary-general of the BAEPD. He argues that on legal and economic grounds, as well as ethical ones, the trade is justified. On the legal front, it is regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is the licensing authority for UK parallel importers and Freudenberg points to several studies that attempt to quantify the economic benefit. A study by the University of York in 2003 found PPT generated savings - eventually to state health budgets - of \u20ac342m in the UK in 2002, and \u20ac631m across the EU. A study by the University of Southern Denmark found the saving to be \u20ac237m in the UK in 2004. Peter West, the co-author of the York study, says: &apos;The parallel trade allows the NHS to get some medicines at a cheaper price and it is making savings from that. If you think that governments are quite weak at keeping prices down then a bit of parallel trade does not hurt.&apos; Colette McReedy, chief pharmacist at the National Pharmacy Association, says: &apos;As a rule, what we are trying to do is source products at the best value for the taxpayer. Parallel trade plays a part.&apos; Both the York and USD papers claim a further but unquantifiable saving from the competitive effects of PPT: UK distributors may lower their prices in products where there is competition from PPT in order to protect sales volumes. Those opposed to PPT say it is impossible to prove that market prices would be higher without it. As for direct savings, they point to research from the London School of Economics which estimates savings at a lower level and concludes that there are no direct benefits to patients. The difficulty with these reports is that they are funded by opposing sides (York and USD by the BAEPD, LSE by the drugs companies). Jim Thompson, chairman of the European Alliance for Access to Safe Medicines, a group (funded by drugs companies) which recently published a report into the safety of the supply chain, says: &apos;The saving [made by PPT] is infinitesimally small. You are talking about \u00a34 a head per person in the UK assuming an average drugs bill of \u00a39bn [\u00a3150 a head].&apos; Even Freudenberg concedes that the direct saving &apos;is quite small&apos;. The big companies go further. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry argues that PPT takes \u00a31.2bn from their revenues, money that goes to a middle man instead of being put to constructive use. Andrew Hotchkiss, managing director of US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in the UK, says: &apos;The issue for us is that we end up losing potential margin that could be invested back in research and development.&apos; The view is shared by Pfizer, another US company operating in the UK. Julian Mount, vice-president of European Trade, says: &apos;\u00a31.2bn is an enormous amount in terms of what Pfizer loses in UK revenue. [It affects] R&amp;D and our ability to reinvest.&apos; However, companies say their major concern is the impact of PPT on the drugs supply chain and safety. Mount says: &apos;We have seen a rise in the incidence of counterfeit medicines in the UK. That is why we need to ask whether this system is safe and whether our efforts to protect it are adequate.&apos;  According to the EU, counterfeiting has increased dramatically since evidence first arose of it in Europe in 1998. The MHRA says there have been nine recalls of counterfeits in the UK in the past three years and a further five cases caught at wholesaler level before they reached the market. Until last year, PPT traders dismissed the companies&apos; concerns as without evidence. But last summer there were several recalls of counterfeit medicines that had entered the UK supply chain via a parallel trader.  These involved Lilley&apos;s anti-psychotic treatment Zyprexa, Sanofi-Aventis&apos;s blood-clot treatment Plavix, and Astra Zeneca&apos;s cancer treatment Casodex. Some 40,000 packs of tablets were seized by the MHRA and up to a further 10,000 were recalled.  The fakes, packaged in French, were made in China and shipped to Singapore. They were bought by a wholesaler in Luxembourg who sold them on to a Belgian wholesaler and another based in Liverpool, who in turn sold them to UK parallel importers. One of these, OPD, noticed mistakes on the packaging when it was preparing to rebox Zyprexa in English and reported back to Lilly, which informed the MHRA.  Andrew Hotchkiss says: &apos;This is a very serious problem. These are serious medicines for patients who are very unwell. The reality is that the patient will not recognise that the product is counterfeit.&apos; He believes PPT represents too great a risk to be tolerated. &apos;These cases are due to people entering the supply chain using parallel trade. If it did not exist we would not have them.&apos; Julian Mount says: &apos;The fact is that medicines should not be traded around Europe. How many people will have to die before our position is proved correct?&apos; Freudenberg counters that no deaths have been attributed to the PPT imports. He adds that the counterfeits were detected and reported by one of his members. &apos;There has to be a theoretical risk because of the very fact that we are handling, opening and resealing packaging. But what level of risk does that involve? I would say that it is very small because of the procedures under which we operate.&apos; The European Commission, however, launched a consultation on tackling counterfeit medicine in March that included proposals that would effectively prevent repackaging. Freudenberg says big firms are finding ways of making it more difficult for PPT. In Spain, for example, several have introduced a system of &apos;differential pricing&apos;. They charge wholesalers a full price and later offer a discount if it can be demonstrated that all products have been sold within Spain, discouraging re-export. Another technique has been to strike exclusive distribution deals with wholesalers. Last year Pfizer made such an agreement with Unichem (now part of Alliance Boots), arguing that a single distributor limits the possibility of counterfeits entering the supply chain and strengthens the relationship with pharmacists. Freudenberg says that these moves have been effective. &apos;It is now very difficult for traders to get hold of some Pfizer drugs, and impossible in Spain.&apos; And he adds that Glaxo&apos;s imposition of quotas in Greece may well be the reason that Lourantos and his members find it difficult to get access to Lamictal. Lourantos, however, is not persuaded. &apos;It has to stop,&apos; he says.", "sentences": ["If you suffer from epilepsy and you live in Athens you are less likely to receive the vital drugs you need for treatment than if you live in London, Berlin or Amsterdam."], "title": "Parallel trade in drugs puts EU patients at risk", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/29/pharmaceuticals", "tags": ["Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "Health", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-28T23:01:00Z", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday July 6 2008  In the article below, we described the national athletics stadium in New Delhi as having &apos;been built as the venue for the inaugural Asian Games in 1951&apos;. Although used for these games, it was constructed in the 1930s and originally called the Irwin Amphitheatre, becoming the National Stadium after partition. In honour of the celebrated hockey player, it was renamed the Dhyan Chand National Stadium and is set to be the field hockey venue of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.    In 1962 the male athletes of East and West Germany toured Asia. At the Rome Olympics two years earlier the united team had won six track medals, including gold in the 4x100m and silver in the 4x400m relays. Now the Teutonic superstars travelled the East, displaying their prowess to one undeveloped sporting nation after another. India was one of those nations. India sent few athletes to the Olympics. They only ever won one medal per Games - although it was generally gold - in the men&apos;s hockey. The Germans arrived in Delhi, for a two-day competition, and found to their surprise that the Indians were not the humble, easygoing athletes they had expected, but tenacious competitors who matched them in event after event, and particularly the relays. At the end of the second day the Germans, to their disbelief, had been beaten. The other thing that puzzled them was that the Indians were trained by a haggard, 62-year-old German, unknown to most of the visitors&apos; entourage. One or two of its older members did recognise him: journalist Adolf Metzner published an article in Die Zeit called &apos;Yogi with Prussian Eagle&apos;. &apos;Today the former German champion runner lives in the New Delhi stadium and exists on handouts from his charges. All his possessions are in a small suitcase. He suffers from the terrible heat in summer, and is bothered by mosquitoes and dogs. As possessed as ever, he gives advice to anyone who seeks it. When the Indian government gave him an honorarium of 1,000 rupees after the Rome Olympics, he gave it to the victims of a flood. The Indians venerate him like one of their wise men.&apos; During the Weimar era, Otto Peltzer had been Germany&apos;s pre-eminent sportsman. At his peak he held the national record in eight different events, and was world-record holder at three middle distances. Captain of the 1928 and 1932 Olympic teams, Otto was a driven, disputatious man, as unpopular with officialdom as he was popular with his fellow athletes and with the public. Peltzer also happened to be homosexual, a &apos;crime&apos; for which he would pay, under the Nazis, a terrible price. He was borne up and then ground under the wheels of European history in the 20th century, at whose beginning he was born. And yet he would survive, and find in India an extraordinary valediction. Part 1: Glory Otto was born on 8 March 1900 to a bourgeois family in the hamlet of Ellernbrook-Drage, Holstein, in the north of Germany. A sickly child, a &apos;half-haemophiliac&apos;, he was diagnosed with a heart defect, suffered frequent infections, and spent much of his childhood in confinement, with no company beyond books, and his own thoughts. As he came through adolescence, however, Otto discovered that he possessed, despite his frailty, natural athletic talent. A skinny beanpole, he surprised running opponents with his speed; despite a weedy upper body, he even won discus and javelin events. The solitary, somewhat furtive boy began to develop an obsession with his physical improvement through sport. It was one, moreover, conducted in secret. One day Otto was caught mimicking his teacher: his father furiously, and publicly, upbraided him. Otto responded by resolving to keep his running a secret from his family. So successfully would he do this that they would know nothing of his sporting life until long after he had left home, and, at the age of 22, won his first German championship. During the dying weeks of the First World War, in 1918, Otto went to university in Munich. He studied economics, law and social politics, and later stayed on as a postgraduate. In Munich, Otto joined the TSV 1860 club, where he met people who shared his devotion to sport. Before long he began to coach his fellow athletes, and soon developed his own, eccentric ideas. He believed that all-important schnellkraft, speed strength, depended on elasticity and softness of muscles, to be gained by regular hot baths, pre-race rubdowns with oil, and post-run massages. He subjected his charges to rigorous indoor training sessions - rope skipping, hopping with your partner on your back - and introduced handball games played at high speed, with frequent twisting and turning, to develop the &apos;inner organs&apos;.  Each session ended with an 8km run, whatever the weather. Only those who took part in the run could have a warm shower, although Otto himself always chose a cold one, &apos;to close the pores and avoid catching cold&apos;, he said, as well as to have &apos;the most wonderful after-feeling&apos;. Peltzer also paid scrupulous attention to weight, diet and precise times of eating. He made diary entries about each race (including weather and track conditions) and even training session. In 1925, shortly after receiving his doctorate in Munich, Peltzer travelled to Helsinki to visit the great Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi, &apos;the iron man of the cinder paths&apos;. Peerless Paavo welcomed Peltzer and the two ran together and discussed training methods - strictly timed runs, hard Finnish massages, but most of all the importance of willpower. &apos;Forget your opponents,&apos; Nurmi told Peltzer. &apos;Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.&apos; Otto returned to Germany and began to consider his future. He loved coaching, but could not take payment without forfeiting his amateur status and thus his own running career. He began to consider a job in teaching.  The 1920s saw a ferment of radical ideas about youth and education in Germany. These included bodies such as the Wandervogel, an umbrella organisation of independent groups moved by the spirit of Romanticism to seek brotherhood and adventure in unspoiled nature, and the Free School movement, led by Gustav Wyneken.  Wyneken&apos;s Wickersdorf Free School Community was based on certain precepts, among them two that were particularly influential. The first was Jugendkultur, the belief that adults should refrain from overtly leading youth groups, who should find leadership from their own ranks. The second was P\u00e4dagogischer Eros, a blend of Greek Platonic ideals and high German philosophical ideas, which exalted the erotic attraction between a teacher and a pupil. This relationship tended to be openly homoerotic yet chaste. Although Otto did not have a teaching qualification, it might be possible to find work as an erzieher (youth worker), so he began to apply for jobs. For the moment, though, nothing distracted him from his sport. He developed the habit of causing a false start, not to upset his opponents but to settle his nerves. He taught himself the skill of dozing off, at any time, even for a few minutes just before a race. He discovered the efficacy of nude sunbathing, particularly at high altitude, to &apos;help blood circulation in the skin&apos;. Otto also advocated jumping exercises to develop leg muscles and enjoyed entertaining friends when he visited them by leaping halfway up the stairs. He even redesigned the strip for his home club, Preussen Stettin (in what is now Szczecin in Poland), which included a black stylised eagle on the white vest and a lapel badge hailed as &apos;the most beautiful of all club badges&apos;. Otto Peltzer earned his nickname Otto the Strange in 1925 from his clubmate, hurdler Heiner Trossbach, after Peltzer turned down an invitation to a prestigious international race in Berlin because he had already given his commitment to a small club event in Hamburg. Many thought Otto an oddball, and the nickname stuck. 1926 saw the peak of his career. In July, in the AAA Championships at Stamford Bridge in London (to which a group of German athletes had been invited), Peltzer beat Great Britain&apos;s reigning Olympic 800m champion Douglas Lowe, breaking the world record for the distance. On their return to Germany (which had been barred from the first two postwar Olympics, in Antwerp in 1920 and Paris in 1924) the team were treated as heroes, with Peltzer the star among them. One aspect of the fanfare, however, annoyed him. &apos;To whom does German sport owe the rise of its athletes? Not the sport&apos;s functionaries, but the young leaders and coaches in the clubs, who do it for nothing. Yet the big-time officials puff themselves up as if it&apos;s down to them that we&apos;ve caught up with the best in the world again.&apos; On 11 September 1926, Peltzer took part in a historic race, a specially set up 1500m in Berlin with Paavo Nurmi, Swede Edvin Wide and a young German, Herbert B\u00f6cher.  Nurmi was the world&apos;s finest middle- and long-distance runner: at the Paris Olympics he had won gold at 1500m and 5,000m, in two cross-country races and in the team 3,000m. Sweden&apos;s Wide, known as &apos;The Flying Schoolteacher&apos;, had won silver at 10,000m and bronze at 5,000m, but like Nurmi had designs on the 1500m - the blue-riband Olympic distance. The two had met before, with the same result: Nurmi set a pace Wide could not keep up with, but then Wide almost caught the Finn in the dash for the line. It was generally felt that Wide was now ready to take Nurmi&apos;s mantle and that one, possibly both of them, would break the world record. B\u00f6cher, a 23-year-old from Berlin, was the most promising young German runner over 1500m and was thought by some to have the potential to cause an upset. Peltzer accepted an invitation to take part, although he was principally an 800m runner. Friends advised him not to, particularly after he ran just three days before, in a 2,000m race, which he won in the sprint. Why risk humiliation, Otto&apos;s friends argued, not only by the two northern stars but even more so by his young German rival? Why not stick to 800m, and even retire, now, as a great champion? Otto laughed them off. &apos;A champion should never retire at his peak,&apos; he argued, &apos;but should give his successor the honour of starting off with a glorious victory.&apos; Trying to retire as a champion showed that a runner ran out of ambition and egotism, he said, not inner passion and love of the sport. The race that day was one of the greatest of the 20th century, watched by a crowd of 30,000 around the cinder track and on the overlooking railway embankment. There were local races for the first hour, but many of the spectators preferred to mill behind the stands to watch Nurmi, Wide, Peltzer and B\u00f6cher warm up. When, finally, they entered the stadium, there were loud shouts of &apos;Heja!&apos; (&apos;Go for it!&apos;) from the Swedes who had travelled to Berlin to support Wide, and even greater welcomes for both Nurmi and Peltzer. They lined up with B\u00f6cher on the inside, then Nurmi, then Wide, with Peltzer on the outside. Once Peltzer had made his usual early false start to calm himself, the four men were set to go. The gun went off and Wide stormed into pole position. Peltzer snuck in behind him, with B\u00f6cher next and Nurmi untroubled at the back: he always ran his own race, according to his own time. Towards the end of the first lap, as Wide let the pace slacken, Nurmi steadily drew to the front. Peltzer overtook Wide to keep on Nurmi&apos;s shoulder. As he ran, he heard a spectator shout: &apos;Look at that. Old Peltzer&apos;s having a go.&apos; Perhaps encouraged by Peltzer, Wide refused to let Nurmi open up a gap, and the three of them sped in close formation right through to the final lap. B\u00f6cher, unable to stand the pace, fell away. The bell rang and still they ran together, Nurmi at his powerful, even pace, knowing at every moment where he was in his own mental schedule of the race. But this time Wide had stayed with him. As they entered the first bend of the final lap Wide made his move, according to a contemporary newspaper report, &apos;storming past Nurmi and Peltzer in the blink of an eye, and moving metres ahead. Paavo Nurmi does not allow his rhythm to be upset by this unexpected attack. Otto Peltzer hangs on behind him. The spectators at this great event suddenly veer in their sympathies, from Nurmi to this bold Swede trying to run away from him. Mixed with the &quot;Heja!&quot; shouts, all you can hear is people yelling &quot;Wide! Wide!&quot;&apos; Two hundred metres from the line Wide had opened up a 20-pace lead. The gap was growing and Nurmi was surely leaving it too late. &apos;But what&apos;s this?&apos; the report continued. &apos;Peltzer goes into the outside lane on the bend. A cry of delight. Peltzer passes Nurmi. Not Nurmi but Peltzer intends to thwart the Swede&apos;s victory. The noise in the stadium swells. Peltzer seems to get enormous power from his long legs. He sweeps round the last part of the bend, eating up the ground, and the unimaginable becomes reality: he catches Wide 50 metres from the line and cruises towards it, completely relaxed. All eyes are on him - few see Nurmi almost catch his great Swedish rival in the sprint. &apos;The cheering... has hardly died down when the announcer declares that Germany&apos;s great middle-distance runner has broken Nurmi&apos;s world record, with a time of 3 minutes 51 seconds. The spectators are so overcome that many have tears in their eyes. This 11 September 1926 will be entered in golden letters in the history of German sport. Even an Olympic victory could not have this significance, for here three great masters of the track measured themselves against each other at the zenith of their abilities.&apos; After lengthy celebrations, Peltzer returned to his hotel, to telegrams of congratulations from around the world. Also waiting in the hotel were two American sports impresarios, boxing manager Ted Richards and agent Jack Dixon. They told Peltzer that now everyone would want to see the three of them running, and they offered him a contract of $250,000 for a year to run against Wide and Nurmi at sports meetings around America. They promised a similar contract would be on offer the following year, as well as lucrative advertising deals. Peltzer told them they could tear it up. &apos;I want to run in the Olympic Games,&apos; he said. &apos;And I&apos;ll always remain amateur.&apos; The Americans argued that a financial opportunity like this was unheard of for a European athlete, but Peltzer told them they were wasting their time. As it happened, the trainer of the German amateur athletics team, Josef Waitzer, was in the hotel lobby, and saw what was happening. &apos;Don&apos;t be a fool,&apos; he told Otto. &apos;You can set yourself up for life with this deal. You&apos;ll get no thanks for remaining amateur. Of course we want you in the Olympic team in Amsterdam, but if you&apos;re not there, we&apos;ll manage.&apos; But Peltzer was unmoved. &apos;A sportsman does not need financial compensation, since the act carries its own reward,&apos; he wrote. &apos;You can&apos;t turn it into a job without taking away its ideal root, and the inner joy in doing it... If we want to support amateur over professional sport we can&apos;t do it by cleverly worked-out rules but by cultivating a correct sporting consciousness, by a new deepening of the whole attitude to life in our times.&apos; Instead of signing with the Americans, the next morning Peltzer went to the nearest post office and sent a telegram to the writer (later Berthold Brecht&apos;s publisher) Peter Suhrkamp, pedagogical head of the Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf, based in a mountain village in the central German state of Thuringia, accepting an offer to teach geography, history and biology.  &apos;The die was cast, not by others but by me,&apos; he said later. &apos;I determined my future myself. A new life stood before me, tempting and beautiful - teaching young people, promoting sport with high ideals and struggling against the mechanisation of human life. This was my future.&apos; In July 1927 Peltzer set a world record for the 1,000m in Paris. Afterwards a French cultural critic, Jacques Mortane, met him for a book he was writing about the new Germany. &apos;Tall, slim, blond with grey eyes, that&apos;s how I saw Dr Peltzer, the victor over Nurmi and Wide, Germany&apos;s best-known sportsman, who runs like an artist, not a machine.&apos;  Peltzer told Mortane: &apos;I never know in advance which tactic I will pursue. I change my approach every time. Anyone who becomes a slave of a system is in my view not a true champion. On the contrary, he will find his master.&apos; By the end of 1927 Peltzer held the German record at 500m, 600m, 800m, 1,000m, 1500m, 2,000m, 880yards, and 400m hurdles. He had run five world-record times. Visiting America in 1927 with the German team, Peltzer was the one athlete invited to the White House to meet President Calvin Coolidge. Soon, however, he came into conflict with the German athletics authorities. Elected team leader by his fellow Olympic athletes, he became involved in early 1928 in a series of disputes with officials who treated the athletes like &apos;military recruits&apos;. Peltzer was thrown out of the team, only for the other athletes to tell the director: &apos;If he goes, we all go.&apos; Otto was reinstated. After the great race in Berlin, both Nurmi and Wide decided to revert in the Olympics to the longer distances. In the 5,000m Nurmi would take silver, Wide bronze; in the 10,000 Nurmi won gold, Wide another bronze. Peltzer was now the favourite for the 800m. Not long before the Games began in Amsterdam, however, disaster struck. During a game of field handball at the Wickersdorf school, another player stepped on and fractured Peltzer&apos;s foot. He was unable to train and, although a Finnish masseur helped him recover in time to take part and he progressed through the 800m heats, in the semis he failed by centimetres to qualify for the final. Douglas Lowe retained the 800m title, while another German, Hermann Engelhard, claimed bronze. After the final, Lowe told Peltzer he should have won, and gave him a letter signed by all the British middle-distance runners expressing regret over his injury. Four years later, in 1932, in the German Olympic team bound for Los Angeles, Peltzer was once again elected team captain. Barely had the ship set sail before he began arguing with the team officials: the athletes had inside cabins without portholes next to the engine rooms, while officials were in the outer cabins. He demanded they swap places. His request was refused. They arrived in New York, to make their way across country by train in an itinerary that demanded the athletes&apos; presence at one formal reception after another but left them no time for training. Again Peltzer complained, without success. The trip, and the athletes&apos; ambitions, were consumed in a bonfire of such petty arguments. When they reached LA they found that the Olympic track was hard as asphalt, for which the long spikes they had brought were quite unsuitable. Other teams had already arrived and bought up all the stocks of short-spiked running shoes in Los Angeles. The Finns obtained small grinding machines with electric motors with which they patiently ground down their spikes. Peltzer asked the German officials to buy similar machines. They gave him a set of handfiles for the team. This continuing series of conflicts was largely to blame for Germany failing to win a single medal on the track. Peltzer ran the 800m final with only half the spikes of one of his running shoes filed down, so wobbly that he could hardly stand up. His Olympic dream was over. &apos;On the way back to the Olympic village, talking with [journalist] Adolf Metzner,&apos; he said later, &apos;the pain overwhelmed me, and tears came to my eyes.&apos; Part 2: Suffering President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. In the following months the National Socialists eliminated all rival political parties: by the summer Germany had become a one-party state. Soon there were just two significant areas of German society that remained outside Hitler&apos;s direct control: one was the army, whose Prussian officer class prized its independence, although its size remained limited under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles to 100,000 men. The other was the Sturmabteilung [SA], the Nazi paramilitary organisation. Its stormtroopers had spent the previous few years intimidating rivals: smashing up meetings and fighting street battles with Social Democrats and Communists. With membership approaching three million in 1934, the SA became ever more militarily powerful. After nights of heavy drinking its stormtroopers would run riot in the streets, attacking first passersby, then the police sent to arrest them. The SA was a peculiar combination of mass membership of young men, many unemployed and criminals, and ideological leaders committed to the socialism inherent in the Nazi party&apos;s name. The head of the SA, Ernst R\u00f6hm, was an old colleague of Hitler from the 1923 Munich Beer Hall Putsch. The two had shared prison time. R\u00f6hm described Hitler&apos;s rise to power as merely a &apos;half-revolution&apos; and called for the &apos;second revolution&apos;: nationalisation of large firms, profit-sharing for employees and appropriation of the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. Army and business leaders implored the F\u00fchrer to deal with R\u00f6hm. They were joined by the racial purists of the Nazi party: it was an open secret that R\u00f6hm, his deputy Edmund Heines and Berlin Sturmabteilung leader Karl Ernst, like others in the SA hierarchy, were homosexual. The Night of the Long Knives took place between 30 June and 2 July 1934. Hundreds of senior SA officers were arrested and summarily executed, as well as numerous other opponents in the settling of old scores, including Hitler&apos;s predecessor as Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, who was assassinated along with his wife at their country home. This violent purge was presented as the response to a plot led by R\u00f6hm and von Schleicher to overthrow the government. On 13 July Hitler gave a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag in which he said: &apos;In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people.&apos; Retrospective legalisation of the extra-judicial killings met with no opposition in the Reichstag. Hitler also referred in his speech to &apos;a sinister group of elements which were held together through a like disposition&apos;. Most of the listening public understood what he meant. Enshrined in German law since 1870 was a statute against sodomy: Paragraph 175 of the criminal code. In 1935 the Nazis revised and strengthened Paragraph 175, making the mere suggestion of homosexual intent grounds for arrest: kissing or embracing another man, gossip spread by neighbours, even receiving a letter from a gay friend were adequate evidence. From the end of 1934 - even before the revised law was ratified - police raids and mass arrests of homosexual men became common. In March 1935 Otto Peltzer was arrested and accused of homosexual relations with young runners. His interrogators at Gestapo headquarters included Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, who regarded homosexuality as a particularly abhorrent threat to the Aryan race and took personal responsibility for stamping it out. After the intervention of a medical friend highly placed in the National Socialists - Dr Martin Brustmann, who had helped him as a young runner - Peltzer was released from custody. He made the mistake, however, of immediately writing to friends at home and abroad, urging them to help him get the charges dropped. Douglas Lowe was among those who sent personal appeals to Hitler. Peltzer was swiftly rearrested and in June 1935 was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Homosexual prisoners&apos; uniforms often bore the letter A, signifying the German word for &apos;arse-fucker&apos;. This mark would later be replaced, in the concentration camps, by the pink triangle (homosexual Jews had to wear two triangles, one imposed, upside down, on top of the other, creating the shape of the Star of David). According to Arnd Kr\u00fcger, in The International Politics of Sport in the 20th Century: &apos;The Nazis persecuted former members of the German youth movement, much as they did Catholic priests: as much for their non-conformism as for their homosexuality.&apos; Peltzer was released from prison early, two days before the 1936 Olympics began in Berlin, after signing a declaration that he would do and say nothing about his case, and keep out of sport. After the Games, Peltzer moved from Berlin back to Stettin, where he worked as unofficial trainer to his old club, whose athletes began to improve dramatically. He would later claim to have delayed the exclusion of &apos;non-Aryans&apos; from his club, echoing the fact that Gustav Wyneken&apos;s Wickersdorf school had always accepted a large proportion of Jewish pupils. In 1937 Peltzer was rearrested for failing to keep away from sport. After three weeks in Gestapo HQ in Prinz-Albrecht Strasse in Berlin he was released, thanks again to Dr Brustmann, and told that he should leave the country. He was warned that if he tried to oppose the government from abroad, then his family would be imprisoned. Peltzer went to Denmark, where he found temporary work as a travelling carpet salesman. He moved on to Finland, where he stayed on a German steamship in Helsinki harbour, until thrown off for supposedly making advances to a crew member, after which he slept on a park bench, and contracted bronchitis. When the war started, Peltzer made his penniless way to Sweden, where an old friend helped him first to hospital, then into work writing sports articles and training at clubs, including the Jewish Sports Club of Stockholm. In early 1941, after receiving assurances that old charges against him would be dropped, he returned to Germany. He was met off the ferry at the docks in Sassnitz by the Gestapo, who told him that, as an incorrigible enemy of the Reich, he could not be left free. After some weeks in various jails in Berlin he was sent for three months &apos;re-education&apos; to a camp in Austria. This turned out to be KZ Mauthausen. It would come to be known as Mordhausen, &apos;the Murder Houses&apos;. Peltzer was greeted by a camp officer. &apos;Ha, we&apos;ve been waiting for you. Your English friends won&apos;t get you out this time, not like in 1936. So, you&apos;ve been working against us abroad, you scoundrel.&apos; Peltzer denied this, and got a front tooth knocked out. &apos;This bloke&apos;s getting cheeky,&apos; yelled the officer. Then the commandant, Franz Ziereis, appeared. &apos;So, the fast runner&apos;s here. He can show us his tricks. Run to that fence and back. Come on!&apos; Peltzer ran as ordered. &apos;Pity you didn&apos;t use the fence to turn,&apos; Ziereis declared. &apos;Did you know it was electric?&apos; Peltzer said that the people in Berlin had told him he was here for three months&apos; re-education. The officers burst out laughing. &apos;You&apos;ll be out in less, probably,&apos; Ziereis told him. He pointed to a chimney. &apos;There&apos;s the way out of this camp.&apos; (Among other practices that would make Ziereis notorious, he allowed his 11-year-old son to shoot prisoners with a rifle from the family&apos;s porch.) Mauthausen was part of a series of camps, initially for those incarcerated under the &apos;protective custody&apos; laws: communists, anarchists, homosexuals and Roma. It was a labour camp, practising Vernichtung durch Arbeit (extermination through labour), working the intelligentsia of Germany and occupied countries to death, in granite quarries. The SS guards called the sides of the Mauthausen quarry the Parachutists&apos; Wall, from which weak prisoners were thrown to their deaths, &apos;parachutists without a parachute&apos;. Otto Peltzer survived in Mauthausen until the camp was liberated by forces of the US 11th Armoured Division on 5 May 1945. It was the last camp freed. Peltzer had two-and-a-half litres of water drained from his lungs by doctors, the result of untreated pleurisy. All his relatives died in the war and its immediate aftermath. He found some work as a coach and in sports journalism. For a brief period he taught in the Free School of Montana in Zug, Switzerland, but had to return to Germany when his residence permit was not renewed. Many athletics officials from the Nazi years remained in place. Karl Ritter von Halt, Hitler&apos;s last Reichssportf\u00fchrer, and a Nazi party member from 1933, was elected president of the German Olympic Committee in 1950 and honorary president of the athletics federation in 1949. Otto Peltzer&apos;s was the most prominent voice among those calling for the denazification of German athletics, but, as before and after, Otto the Strange&apos;s homosexuality was used against him. The postwar German government failed to acknowledge as victims of the Nazi regime, nor give compensation to, those who had been made to wear the pink triangle: they had been incarcerated for a criminal offence and no restitution was granted to &apos;criminal&apos; concentration camp victims. Indeed, homosexuals&apos; concentration-camp imprisonment became a part of their police record; it increased their vulnerability to police raids. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, German courts convicted homosexual men at a rate as high as they had under the Nazi regime. &apos;Still seen as criminals and perverts,&apos; according to Dr Klaus M\u00fcller, historian and consultant for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, writing of the men with the pink triangle, &apos;they never had an opportunity to regain their dignity in postwar society. They survived, but they were denied their place in the community of survivors.&apos; In 1950, having moved to Krefeld in western Germany, where he was a coach at the athletics club, Peltzer was suspended from athletics activity for two years for allegedly poaching a young runner from another club. He claimed that his former adversaries among the prewar blazerati (among them Dr Carl Diem, founder and rector of the sports academy in Cologne, an enemy from the 1920s onwards) were on the German Athletics Association (DLV) committee, and wished to stop him coaching because his athletes did better than those at officially sanctioned clubs. The suspension, however, was upheld. Furthermore, Otto found his articles refused by sporting magazines, who did not wish to upset the DLV. Peltzer was once more persona non grata, betrayed by people who might have been expected to be proud of his achievements. He got a job in a chemical firm in Frankfurt. In 1956 homosexuality was still a crime and the new public prosecutor in Frankfurt was known to be particularly keen to prosecute offenders. Peltzer got wind that he was on a list of targets for arrest. He obtained a commission to report on the Melbourne Olympics for a German newspaper and left West Germany. Once again, the runner was on the run. After the Games, Peltzer stayed on in the southern hemisphere, trying to get work as a coach with national athletics organisations, from China to Iran, Iraq to Japan. He found it impossible: the German Foreign Office, prompted by Carl Diem and his friends, sent a letter to 12 embassies, six consulates, and the general consulates in 19 Asian and African countries, three pages long, stating that Dr Peltzer had communist affiliations on top of his homosexual tendencies. He should receive no money, and they should react cautiously to any requests for work references.  Part 3: Poverty In dire straits, Peltzer reached India, where he took various short-term jobs, until in May 1959 he was given permanent work on a tiny salary of 533 rupees a month. He worked alone out of a wooden shack inside the national athletics stadium in New Delhi - which had been built as the venue for the inaugural Asian Games in 1951, then neglected - training budding Indian athletes. Peltzer&apos;s star had fast faded, rather like that of Bill Tilden, the finest tennis player of the first half of the 20th century, who was also gay. But now began the third, and perhaps most remarkable, phase of his life.  Doc Peltzer, as the Indians called him, lived in the Marina Hotel and came to the stadium each day. &apos;He never missed training, not once,&apos; said Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, who came fifth in the Olympic 110m hurdles final in Tokyo in 1964, and is now chairman of the Athletics Federation of India. &apos;Always he was there, spurring us on, to make of ourselves the best that we could.&apos; Through the Sixties, Peltzer put a generation of the best Indian athletes through a rigorous training programme, raising the level and the expectations of the sport. PK Mahanand, a discus thrower and shot putter, and national weightlifting champion, describes Peltzer as &apos;very strong-willed, a very dedicated man. He couldn&apos;t tolerate people who didn&apos;t train properly, who puffed themselves up. And he was so poor. His students used to bring a bottle of milk and some bread for him.&apos; Peltzer created a system for talented juniors to develop, overcoming indifference and opposition to set up Olympic Youth Delhi. True to form, he had battles with the authorities, who disliked Peltzer demanding the right to accept anyone with talent and character, including street children. Perhaps he recognised fellow untouchables. Peltzer&apos;s motto was &apos;Play and Study&apos;. The youngsters, he told parents, would study better if they did sport. He understood how to develop grassroots youth athletics. Soon he had 50 elite juniors, known as the &apos;Peltzer boys&apos;, although some were girls. Eventually the Delhi Sport Council started giving grants to junior medal winners, most of which they used to keep their families fed. But Peltzer was developing heart problems, brought on perhaps partly by smoking as well as by his maltreatment in Mauthausen. He complained he had to chase the Indian athletes to train hard - even the best wanted his exclusive attention, so that after training it took him two hours to recover from the intense effort. On 11 September 1967 Otto Peltzer suffered a heart attack. He was persuaded to go back to Germany. He left on 14 December saying: &apos;I&apos;ll be back.&apos; He was treated in Malente, in Holstein. On his 70th birthday he asked for no flowers or presents, but contributions to Indian charity.  Happy Sikand, an Indian junior champion, hoped to compete in the Olympic pentathlon in Munich, in 1972. Peltzer invited him to Holstein. There Sikand, running barefoot as he did at home, won the local championships. On 11 August 1970 Happy ran an evening competition 1500m on the Waldeck track in Eutin, with Doc Peltzer shouting out the lap times. Afterwards, while Happy got changed, Otto Peltzer headed towards the car park. He was found on a field path, dead, with the stopwatch still around his neck. &apos;In 1996, at the cross-country championships of Schleswig-Holstein in Eutin,&apos; wrote Volker Kluge in his fine biography of Otto Peltzer, &apos;the course led exactly over the spot where his heart had burst. The idea would certainly have appealed to him.&apos; Back in Delhi, Doc Peltzer&apos;s athletes began the tradition of the Otto Peltzer Memorial Road Races in his honour. Created for juniors in various age groups, they took place every Sunday throughout the year, at distances ranging from 800m to 2,500m, and they continue to this day. The Olympic Youth Delhi was renamed &apos;Otto Peltzer Memorial Athletic Club&apos;. Since 1970 there has been an annual national event, the Dr Otto Peltzer Cross Country Hill Race.  As recently as 2005 The Hindu newspaper ran a profile of Doc Peltzer, &apos;a true friend of India&apos;. &apos;His English, punctuated with German, tended to be incomprehensible... he survived on toast and soup...  &apos;One can still picture in the mind&apos;s eye his gaunt, lanky figure, in jogging suit and cap, walking with hasty strides from Barakhamba Road towards Connaught Circus, a sheaf of papers in his hand and muttering to himself. Where would one meet the likes of him again?&apos; Epilogue In the introduction to Kluge&apos;s biography, Walter Jens, professor of rhetoric at the University of T\u00fcbingen, called on the Deutscher Leichtathletik Verband to honour Peltzer. &apos;The DLV should bring him home, this admirable heretic in its ranks, this dreamer who at that moment of deep humiliation refused to abandon the thought that, after the National Socialist tyranny had been overcome, athletics would rise like a phoenix from the ashes. Yes, the DLV should commemorate him.&apos; On 4 December 1999 the DLV established a new prize: the Otto Peltzer Medal. It was to be awarded, occasionally, &apos;to athletes who have distinguished themselves through critical solidarity with German athletics, outstanding performances, and courageously responsible actions&apos;.

Mirrors on the walls multiply observed reality, windows open on to an exterior we cannot see and the curved surfaces of a wine glass or a water pitcher reflect objects outside the painting&apos;s proper scope. If you look at it closely enough, the earring worn by one of his subjects turns into a microcosm: a pearl, like the Earth explored and exploited by 17th-century cartographers and merchants, is a globe. Canadian Sinologist Timothy Brook discovered Vermeer when he fell off his bicycle in Delft during a university vacation. He paid homage at a slab on the floor of the Old Church, beneath which the painter is supposedly buried; to see the 35 extant paintings, however, he had to travel to galleries dispersed between Berlin and Manhattan. Now he has assembled half-a-dozen favourites and used them as a pretext for his own allusive, exploratory forays to the ends of the Earth. In Brook&apos;s view, the globe that shimmers on the reflexive surface of Vermeer&apos;s pearls is a model of the new world that opened up in the 17th century - &apos;an unbroken surface on which there was no place that could not be reached, no place that was not implied by every other place&apos;. Electronic communication has accustomed us to living on a planet where events happen everywhere simultaneously. That global consciousness began, Brook argues, with the voyaging of Dutch traders in the 17th century and its restlessness, its accumulated loot and the casual violence with which it trampled the ancient, idiosyncratic sense of locality are all on display in Vermeer&apos;s sedate scenes of people flirting, playing music or reading confidential letters. Brook&apos;s eye soon strays beyond the pictorial frame or conjures up the invisible vistas through Vermeer&apos;s open windows. The floppy hat worn by a visiting cavalier in one painting prompts him to think about the beavers that were skinned to make felt, which leads to an account of the fur trade in eastern Canada. Another painting shows a woman weighing unstandardised coins in a balance; this is Brook&apos;s cue for an essay on the &apos;global life&apos; of silver, a new commodity that obsessed the century. Because space on the globe is circular, all these associative routes lead to China, which is Brook&apos;s academic speciality. A porcelain dish in another of Vermeer&apos;s rooms reminds Brook of &apos;the very thing that was synonymous with China itself - china&apos;. Samuel de Champlain, who stormed across Quebec slaughtering Mohawk warriors and trapping beavers, turns out to be searching for an overland route to China and its fabled wealth. Once Western trade opened up that closed realm, merchants found ingenious ways to despoil it: the English encouraged the Chinese addiction to opium, which helped reverse the deficit racked up by their bulk-buying of tea. This sordid episode inevitably conjures up the poppy fields of contemporary Afghanistan, miraculously unmolested by the US marines who roam through them. Now, as in the 17th century, a global world is a scene of collusion and seamy complicity, a place where greed and guilt are democratically shared. The woman who weighs silver does so in front of a painting that shows the Last Judgment, a preview of God&apos;s strict accountancy in the next life. The allegories that interest Brook, however, are economic, not moral: the people in the paintings he examines exhibit possessions that testify to their status - a Turkish rug (used as a tablecloth because it was too valuable to be trodden on) or a black slave boy whose role in the household is more decorative than functional. Descartes, exiled in Amsterdam in the 1630s, described the city as &apos;an inventory of the possible&apos;, storing &apos;all the commodities and curiosities one could wish for&apos;. Imagination was coming to mean the capacity to fantasise about instant riches; realism, in painting as in literature, is acquisition by other means. But do the objects Vermeer painted retain their ostentatious price tags? Brook is so intent on cost and the grim injustice of expropriation that he can seem crassly unresponsive, indifferent to the almost beatific peace of the paintings. Vermeer&apos;s View of Delft is a solemn idyll that captures the mood of all our becalmed afternoons; a cloud overshadows the town, threatening a downpour that is mercifully postponed. Here is a thing of beauty that keeps its promise to be a joy for ever. But Brook ignores the charmed stasis of the image and is content to point out the future headquarters of the Dutch East India Company and the boats of the local fishermen, who profited from the &apos;global cooling&apos; that drove herrings south from Scandinavia into Dutch waters. His chapter on the painting in which a woman reads her mysterious letter, Young Woman Reading a Letter at an Open Window, glances at the blank space behind her, which he calls &apos;one of the most richly textured empty walls in Western art&apos;. Since no economic signs are inscribed on the wall, he says no more. But its rich texture makes it a symbol of painting, a text compiled from strokes and scratches that are as eloquent as words. Leonardo said that the crumbly surface of an old wall could suggest all the images an artist needed. There is just such a patch of apparently insignificant wall to the left of the View of Delft: a meagre slice of yellow, fondly warmed by the sun. This scrap of masonry so transfixes the writer Bergotte in Proust&apos;s Remembrance of Things Past that he dies babbling its praises, as if it were the single memory that he most wished to salvage from a life that has suddenly concluded. &apos;Little patch of yellow wall,&apos; he murmurs as he expires, &apos;little patch of yellow wall.&apos; That is a true appreciation of art. Brook knows everything about price, but rather less about value.", "sentences": ["Descartes, exiled in Amsterdam in the 1630s, described the city as &apos;an inventory of the possible&apos;, storing &apos;all the commodities and curiosities one could wish for&apos;."], "title": "Review: Vermeer's Hat by Timothy Brook", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/29/review.features1", "tags": ["Art and design", "Books", "Culture", "Johannes Vermeer"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-06-30T11:45:53Z", "article": "Dutch police suspect that a giraffe was responsible for a herd of animals escaping from a travelling circus in Amsterdam today.

The feelings inspired by the latter are by far the stronger. Koestler himself, a proud and loyal British citizen, remained a lifelong Hungarian soccer nationalist.  It is hard for Americans, whose &quot;world series&quot; are essentially domestic affairs, to understand the emotions engendered in European citizens when their nations compete for the European football championship every four years. For several weeks this summer, the stadiums in Austria and Switzerland, not to mention the streets of European capitals from Madrid to Moscow, were given to an orgy of flag-waving, anthem-singing, drum-beating patriotism. Spain&apos;s victory was one of the rare occasions that Catalonians, Castillians, Basques, and Andalusians erupted together in an explosion of patriotic delight.  Football, more than most sports, lends itself to tribal feelings: the collective effort, the team colours, the speed, the physical aggression. As a famous Dutch football coach once said, not in jest: &quot;Soccer is war.&quot;  It was not supposed to be like this. After two world wars, displays of national fervor became more or less taboo in Europe. Nationalism was blamed for almost destroying the old continent twice in the 20th century. The kind of exalted patriotism, especially when combined with warrior pride, that is still entirely normal in the United States, was for a long time associated with mass slaughter. The English, who escaped occupation by a hostile power, and still believe they won the second world war alone (well, with a little help from the Yanks), still have a militaristic streak. They are exceptional. Hence, perhaps, the notorious belligerence of English football fans.  And yet, even as nationalistic emotions were suppressed in polite society all over Europe, the football stadiums remained stubbornly in the pre-first world war world. Just as killing continues to be celebrated in ritualised form in Spanish bull rings, illicit tribal feelings are given full vent in the football arenas.  These feelings can be festive, even carnival-like, as they were in Euro 2008. But they can contain something darker and more aggressive too, especially when sporting combat is loaded with historical memory. Games between Holland and Germany, for example, or Germany and Poland, tended, until very recently, to be reenactments of the war; either \u2013 and most commonly \u2013 as melancholy replays of wartime defeat, or as sweet revenge.  When Holland beat Germany in the semi-finals of the 1988 European championship, it was as though justice finally had been done. More Dutch people turned out in the streets of Amsterdam for a night and day of celebration than when the country was actually liberated in May, 1945. (Sometimes football history gets mixed up with &quot;real&quot; history; the defeat of a superior Dutch team by Germany in the world cup final of 1974 also needed to be redressed.)  The tribal feelings of Germans were considered, for obvious reasons, to be particularly toxic after Hitler&apos;s Reich, which is why German flag-waving, until recently, was exercised with a slight air of shame-faced restraint that was entirely absent in surrounding countries. Yet Germans, too, are unable to suppress such feelings. Older Germans can still remember their famous victory over a superb Hungarian team in 1954. It was the first time since their ruinous wartime defeat that Germans were able to feel proud of themselves. Here was a victory they could celebrate. After years of guilt and deprivation, the Germans were back, as it were.  Like everything else, forms of patriotism change over time. Reasons for national pride are varied. When France won the world cup in 1998, the French liked to point out the ethnic diversity of their team. Their main star, Zinedine Zidane, was of Algerian stock. Others had ancestral roots in various parts of Africa. The multi-ethnic nature of the 1998 champion was widely touted as a mark, not of a long and often bloody colonial past, but of national superiority born from the tolerance of the French enlightenment and the fraternity of the French revolution.  In fact, the French were harbingers of a kind. For something profound is changing in Europe, slowly, painfully, but surely. If ethnic diversity is more and more common in national sides, it is even more marked in clubs. Clubs, too, often used to command tribal loyalty along ethnic or religious lines, depending on their location in large industrial cities: Irish clubs versus Jewish clubs in London, for example, or Protestants versus Catholics in Glasgow. Who would have predicted 30 years ago that British football fans would have cheered for a London team of Africans, Latin Americans, and Spaniards, coached by a Frenchman? Or that the national English team would be managed by an Italian?  But ethnic and cultural diversity is not all that has changed the face of European football. I have never seen such harmony between the supporters of different nations as in this year&apos;s championship. Perhaps it was due to the absence of England, whose fans include the last bands of amateur warriors. But the peaceful, carnival spirit that prevailed, the flying of Turkish and German flags side by side in German streets, when the two nations met in the semi-finals, the joint Spanish-German celebrations after the final, all this suggests something fresh.  Not that national feeling is dying, even as a new European spirit is being born. But at the very least national identities in Europe are no longer quite so coloured by memories of war. No one much minds any more when Germany wins, as it so often does. The Germans are now much too nice for that. Yet I have to admit that I still could not suppress a tiny, keenly felt pleasure when Germany lost to Spain. Perhaps because Spain played more beautiful football. Or perhaps it just shows my age.

The owners claim the law, which will allow customers to light up potent tobacco-free pure cannabis joints but ban milder spliffs in which tobacco is mixed with cannabis, threatens to put hundreds of them out of business. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like saying to someone you can go into a cafe and you can buy a beer, but you can&apos;t drink it there - you&apos;ll have to stick to whisky, rum and vodka,&quot; said Paul Wilhelm, owner of De Tweede Kamer, a popular Amsterdam coffee shop. As most patrons prefer milder joints in which cannabis is mixed with tobacco, and only 18% favour much stronger, pure cannabis spliffs, the fear is that the days of the coffee shops could be numbered.  The catering industry said 1,600 coffee shops across the country were up for sale because their owners were convinced their businesses were doomed. Wilhelm, who has run his cafe since 1985, said the law was in danger of &quot;tearing the heart out&quot; of Amsterdam&apos;s social life. &quot;The focus of the De Tweede Kamer has always been social contact,&quot; he added. &quot;They&apos;ll destroy that with what I see as a ridiculous law.&quot; Mark Jacobsen, chairman of the BCD, a nationwide association of coffee shop owners, said proper implementation of the law would require inspectors to check each cannabis joint for tobacco content.  &quot;It&apos;s absurd. In other countries they look to see whether you have marijuana in your cigarette, here they&apos;ll look to see if you&apos;ve got cigarette in your marijuana.&quot; The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, which is responsible for enforcing the ban, said it had trained around 200 inspectors. &quot;They can tell the difference between a mix or a pure joint from its smell and appearance,&quot; said a spokesman. Some coffee shop owners have sought alternative ways to deal with the conundrum and allow their clientele to still enjoy a tobacco-free cannabis spliff without it being too strong.  One inventor, who calls himself Evert, is doing a roaring trade in \u00a3400 vapourisers - in which hashish or cannabis is heated to 180C and the resulting steam is directed into a balloon from which smokers inhale. The vapouriser is claimed to be the mildest way to consume pure cannabis. While some cafes have said they will simply lay on more pure cannabis brownies or &quot;space cakes&quot;, others have built smoking chambers within their premises which are off-limits to staff. Some are also providing alternatives to tobacco, such as the herb coltsfoot. Martial von Beenkom, owner of Boerejongens (Young Farmers) on the outskirts of Amsterdam, has turned his cafe into a smoke-free tea salon where he will sell cannabis on a takeaway basis. &quot;Most people come here to buy their grass which they then smoke elsewhere,&quot; he said. The health minister, Ab Klink, said the law would stay, arguing that as well as helping to improve people&apos;s health it might help to stamp out idleness. &quot;Consumers who spend the whole day hanging out in coffee shops will find other things to do,&quot; he said. Back story The tradition of the Dutch coffee shop goes back to the 1970s, following the pragmatic policy of non-enforcement of laws on the consumption and possession of cannabis that was introduced in 1976.

The promoters&apos; events will take their toll on the 23-year-old, say the critics, and if he is to sustain his focus on winning this year&apos;s world championship he should seriously consider rationing his time away from the cockpit. Having been given exceptional access to Hamilton&apos;s diary for the four days of the British grand prix meeting at Silverstone, the details of which are reproduced below, it certainly appears to be a punishing schedule for a young driver - though in reality it is an all too typical programme of events that are part and parcel of the life of any contemporary formula one driver. The sponsors behind the team make sure the men behind the wheel sing for their expensive suppers. Hamilton himself is confident his mind will be fresh and focused this weekend. &quot;I&apos;m very, very relaxed,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very important you don&apos;t worry about things so you try to keep your mind very clear. I might talk to my brother or watch some comedy, whatever it takes to take my mind off the actual race. &quot;If you think about the race you think about the first corner, you think about the start, the possibilities of people crashing in to you - all these different things. It&apos;s better you don&apos;t think about that and just go out there. I know how to drive and you&apos;ve got to hope for the best.&quot; Hamilton has been managed throughout his career by his father, Anthony, whose opinions and judgment are highly valued by his son. Last year he impressed the paddock by negotiating a reputed \u00a31m fee for Lewis&apos;s official - if somewhat premature - memoirs and the youngster will probably earn 10 times that amount under the terms of his new deal with Reebok sportswear, which was announced in Amsterdam earlier this week. There may, though, come a time when father and son need outside help to deal with the explosion of commercial interest in Lewis&apos;s career. Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s chief operating officer, is adamant that all the drivers&apos; sponsorship commitments are carefully built around their racing activities over a grand prix weekend and that none is allowed to impinge on the main business at hand, seeking to win the race. &quot;I think it is very clear that we have a good sense of balance in the team,&quot; said Whitmarsh. &quot;Everything is done to keep the drivers&apos; minds clear from any extraneous distractions. In that respect I believe we managed things rather well.&quot; It was not always thus. Niki Lauda recalled that Nelson Piquet, his fellow triple world champion and a team-mate in the early 1980s, would turn his back on a fat cheque from BMW for a personal appearance, preferring to stay in bed for as long as it took his fancy. &quot;Racing drivers are independent-minded souls,&quot; said Lauda, &quot;and I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll get them to do anything they set their mind against at the end of the day. In that respect Lewis just needs to get on with things, as I&apos;ve said before, and not worry what anybody outside McLaren says or thinks.&quot; After winning in Monaco in May, Hamilton is eager to conquer Silverstone - a circuit he describes as &quot;a British phenomenon&quot;- and complete a personal hat-trick after his season-opening triumph in Australia. &quot;Winning your home race is something that every driver wants to achieve,&quot; said Hamilton, who is 10 points adrift of Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa in the drivers&apos; championship. &quot;People talk of winning the big four - Silverstone, Monaco, Monza and Spa - but it&apos;s more straightforward for me. I want to win the first race of the season, I want to win Monte Carlo - both of which I did for the first time this year - and I want to win my home grand prix. &quot;Those are my goals and I&apos;m ready for the challenge at Silverstone this weekend.&quot; Race weekend schedule Today 10.30am Arrives at the McLaren brand centre in the Silverstone paddock  2pm Walks across the paddock to the engineers&apos; office, situated in one of the articulated transporter trailers parked behind the pits, for a technical pre-brief with his race engineer, Phil Prew 4.15 Briefing with UK print media 6.30 Sponsorship appearance for the team&apos;s major investor, Vodafone 7pm Brief filming session with Johnnie Walker whisky for a &quot;Responsible Drinking&quot; campaign 8pm Boards chartered helicopter for 20min flight to team&apos;s hotel, Le Manoir aux Quatre Saisons, near Oxford Tomorrow  7.30am Arrives by helicopter at the circuit.

I can roughly tell the time of day from the shadow of a stick in the sand, but there is no easy way of telling the day of the week other than by keeping a record. This morning there are no new human footprints on the beach, but a cat has added my tent to its silent nightly round. A naked old man with an impossibly long white beard dances along the shoreline, greeting the sunrise. He looks like the &quot;It&apos;s . . .&quot; man from Monty Python but he moves with improbable fluency for someone of his age. He can sing well too, mostly snatches from old Beatles songs. His name is Wolfgang and his philosophy of life is very simple: &quot;Everything is easy,&quot; he says. If you are eating, he has the initially disconcerting habit of helping himself uninvited to your food, but after a few days you cease to notice. I have some new friends who live in the woods and I cannot walk past their camp without being offered tea or beer or food, which is almost embarrassing until I realise that this is how life ought to be. Gavdos is one of the places that claims to be the island of Ogygia where the goddess Calypso kept Odysseus prisoner, although the supporting evidence is slight: in terms of flora, fauna and geography, it fails to tick almost any of the right boxes, but then neither do any of the other possible claimants. Ogygia is surely as unreal as the island of T\u00edr na nOg in Celtic mythology where the hero Ois\u00edn discovered to his cost that for every day he spent there a year had gone by at home. But I like to think of Gavdos as Ogygia because it is, perhaps more than any place I have ever been to, enchanted. And it is certainly difficult to escape from: ferry connections are unreliable and you can be marooned here for days, sometimes weeks, if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction. Gavdos is a small dot on the map 50km south of Crete; it is the southernmost of all the Greek islands and possibly the southernmost point of Europe if you don&apos;t count the Canaries. Its permanent indigenous population is around 35 with a similar number of &quot;outsiders&quot; from the rest of Greece and Europe. It has no hotels and fewer than 100 apartment beds for tourists, so most of the 1,000 or so summer migrants sleep on the beaches or under the trees, which was usual on Greek islands 30 years ago but is now usually frowned upon, not to say actively discouraged by the police. The island is inevitably changing, but only slowly and not necessarily for the worse. The road has been paved in the past year, the harbour at Karave enlarged; there could even be proper electricity soon. New houses are being built on the road to Agios Ioannis, but the road stops at Sophia&apos;s taverna, from where it is a half-mile walk over the rocks, through the trees and far away from the 21st century to the beach where I live under a juniper tree.     Ben takes to his hammock on Potamos Beach    Pines and tamarisks are fine and good, and palm trees, nodding or otherwise, can be found on half the world&apos;s best beaches, but the sea juniper, Juniperus oxycedrus macrocarpa, is the ultimate beach tree, and the tiny island of Gavdos has possibly more of them than anywhere in the world. The mummies of Egypt were probably embalmed with juniper oil from Gavdos; the scent mingles with the wild thyme which grows everywhere, prostrate on the rocks and in dense hummocks on the sand. Sea junipers grow incredibly slowly. Branches often die back for years then for no obvious reason spring back to life. No other trees, not even yews or olives, look so old, with twisted limbs bleached like bone. They look as though they have suddenly frozen in the middle of some extravagant activity to which they will return as soon as your back is turned, like a game of grandmother&apos;s footsteps. Mosquito nets and hammocks are strung between the branches like cobwebs or moths&apos; nests and decorated with flotsam and jetsam like Derek Jarman&apos;s garden at Dungeness, treading the thin line between art and litter. The people have blended into the landscape to become almost invisible, with lean bodies the colour of the sand. Close to, they look like ancient Greeks but with longer dreadlocks and that rather disconcerting &quot;18 going on 800&quot; look, prematurely aged by the sun and wind but kept permanently young by the simple life, living close to nature if not to what most people would call reality. In Homer, glittering eyes were a sign of a god in human form. Now they are a sign of a misspent youth. At midday I sit outside Sophia&apos;s taverna in the shade and catch the breeze which blows a siren-like note across the top of my beer bottle. Sophia&apos;s is one of the new buildings but it sells old-fashioned Cretan food, a choice of only two hot dishes - meat or vegetable - baked in the oven in the morning and kept warm on a hot plate until evening. One of the taverna locals is Anthony Bijnen. He used to be a Dutch software developer who painted in his spare time and spent his holidays on Gavdos. Six years ago, Bijnen painted a portrait of a taverna owner in the village of Sarakiniko who liked it so much he gave him a house, saying: &quot;Every island should have a painter.&quot; He has been here ever since, at first painting taverna signs for a living, but now making an international reputation as an artist with exhibitions in Athens, Amsterdam and Vienna. This summer, he is building a geodesic &quot;egg&quot; which will become the island&apos;s arts centre with facilities for anyone who wants to use them. The island also has a small group of Russian philosophers doing whatever it is that Russian philosophers do, and possibly a journalist: a copy of the island&apos;s newspaper is dated &quot;Sometime in November&quot;; the front, and only, page is covered with doodles and at the bottom is written &quot;Sorry, there is no news today&quot;. I sometimes wish all newspapers could be like that. Today is Monday. Maria is Greek with a very Minoan beauty; she studies modern dance in Paris and spends her summers on Gavdos with a little dog with large ears, like a bat with four legs. Walking round the headland to Lavrakas beach, I see her standing up to her waist in the sea, bending forward and dipping her hair in the water then slowly swinging her head and body round to make catherine wheels of water in the air. It could be a scene from a Minoan fresco. She is one of the group who meet on a sand dune to watch the sunset. We drink ginger tea and someone plays a musical instrument with a series of metal blades like a jew&apos;s harp attached to a wooden sound box, twanging the keys and drumming with his fingers. The island is full of noises; sounds and sweet airs. Gavdos is 200 miles from Athens - it is closer to Africa in fact - and at night there is no light pollution; the sky is heavy with stars like the Blake engraving from the Book of Job, I Am Young and Ye Are Very Old. In the starlight, Maria dances a mesmerising slow duet with her favourite tree. Today is Tuesday. Lili and Sara are Spanish students who live under the tree next door and separately remind me of two friends from when I was travelling 30 years ago. In the morning, we go for a walk guided by a gentle young Greek with long black hair and beard; we would never have found the path without him, a very hard climb under a hot sun and a 200m scramble down the side of a ravine. Journey&apos;s end is Potamos, surely one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, with half a mile of the best golden sand gently shelving into safe, clear water. Apart from us, it is entirely deserted. After one of the best and most refreshing swims of my life, I sling a hammock between the branches of a sea juniper and fall asleep listening to the waves, the cicadas, the bees in the thyme, the occasional bleat and tonk of a goat, and Lili and Sara laughing in the sea.

A dismayed Ferguson has not given up hope of persuading him to change his mind but there is now a general acceptance at Old Trafford that they are about to lose the services of a man Cristiano Ronaldo has described as &quot;like a father&quot;. Losing Queiroz will certainly be a significant setback to Ferguson&apos;s hopes of convincing Ronaldo to resist Real Madrid&apos;s advances. High-ranking officials from the Spanish club are planning to approach David Gill, United&apos;s chief executive, at the European Club Association&apos;s general assembly in Nyon today although, at this early stage, they are likely to be given short shrift. Gill has been incensed by Madrid&apos;s conduct, as well as that of Ronaldo, during an increasingly acrimonious and strategic process and will refuse to enter into negotiations in what one associate has described as a &quot;point of principle&quot;. The talks with the Portuguese Football Federation have been a lot more cordial and, if Queiroz gets his way, he will be confirmed as Luiz Felipe Scolari&apos;s successor this week. Queiroz, who coached Portugal between 1991 and 1993, has provisionally agreed a \u00a31.1m deal, similar to his salary at Old Trafford, and has got his way after asking for a four-year contract, having initially been offered a package only until the World Cup in 2010. &quot;I cannot say much,&quot; he said when Portuguese journalists stopped him at Lisbon airport yesterday. &quot;At this moment it is out of my hands. It needs to be resolved between the federation and Manchester United and until then we have to wait calmly. I have spoken to both parties and now I am waiting for some kind of movement.&quot; That was the first time Queiroz has spoken about the matter since holding talks with Gilberto Madail, the federation president, last Tuesday. Madail is expecting to speak to Gill in Nyon today and hopes to have the deal wrapped up within 48 hours. Queiroz informed United of his decision over the weekend and the negotiations are now so advanced Ferguson is already understood to be considering a replacement for him. It will not be easy, however, given Queiroz&apos;s influence on the training ground and, when it comes to Ronaldo, Ferguson will inevitably feel that United&apos;s position is in danger of being substantially weakened. Queiroz, who joined United for the first time in 2002, coached the national team of the United Arab Emirates in 1999 and South Africa from 2000 to 2002. He also had a spell as head coach of Real Madrid in 2003-04 but returned to Old Trafford after a trophy-less 10 months in charge. The Madrid president, Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n, was at Wimbledon yesterday and seemed unconcerned by United&apos;s blunt refusal to negotiate over Ronaldo. &quot;We still have time,&quot; he said. &quot;There are two months before the end of the transfer window in August. Ron says he wants to play here and that it&apos;s a dream. But that is a desire of the player that can&apos;t be realised without the agreement of his club.&quot; The Ajax and Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has claimed United are &quot;very interested&quot; in signing him. The 24-year-old&apos;s failure to agree a new contract at the Amsterdam ArenA has led to speculation he could be sold in the summer. &quot;I know certain English clubs are following me, like Manchester United, who are very interested in me,&quot; he said. &quot;I love clubs with great history like Ajax, I also love United.

The one-minute test is to be carried out alongside standard IVF treatment and could be approved for use in fertility clinics from late next year.  Trials of the test, which helps doctors select the healthiest embryos, showed that the method boosts the chances of embryos implanting. Doctors who developed the technique say it could improve pregnancy rates by 10-15%. Large-scale trials at hospitals in Amsterdam and Gothenburg will begin in October.  In British fertility clinics the overall average pregnancy rate is 21.6% per cycle of treatment, though this rises to 29.6% for women younger than 35. Speaking at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona yesterday, Denny Sakkas, professor at Yale University school of medicine, said: &quot;We fail to get patients pregnant about two-thirds of the time we transfer an embryo, and one of the reasons is we are not very good at picking the best ones from those available.&quot;  In IVF treatment, eggs collected from a woman are fertilised and grown in a culture medium. Typically about eight embryos grow each time. Traditionally doctors decide which are the best embryos by looking through a microscope to see how well they are growing, a process some claim is more of an art than science.  In the new &quot;fitness&quot; test, which measures embryo metabolism, doctors remove fluid from the embryo&apos;s culture medium and shine infrared light through it. This produces a biological &quot;fingerprint&quot; which reveals levels of compounds, such as glucose, in the growth medium, which have been either used by the embryo or excreted. Sakkas&apos;s team tested the culture media of more than 1,000 embryos after they had been implanted in women. They found that those with the highest fitness scores were far more likely to have brought about pregnancy, with implantation rates rising from 26% to 39%. Sakkas said the method took the accuracy in picking suitable embryos from 40% to up to 70%.  The equipment for the tests costs about \u00a310,000, although the cost for a single test is expected to be considerably cheaper.

Still, got there in the end, so if you missed any Chatterbox fun this week, here&apos;s the best of what the readers had to say. This week: tragic romance, facial hair and why you should never walk out of a film (especially not Don&apos;t Look Now, you muppet). Okay, brace yourselves. Here goes... Friday saw a smattering of talk about PS3&apos;s new trophy system, reined in slightly by the fact that only Super Stardust was compatible at the time. This inexplicably gave way to a short Manic Miner vs Jet Set Willy face-off, into which Lazybones lobbed the tangential, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen Monty was a peak in gaming&quot;. There was talk of game trade-ins too, specifically, what you could hope to get for titles like GTA IV and CoD IV - it seems to vary from chain to chain, and even from store to store. It&apos;s topical stuff, of course, what with HMV&apos;s decision to star dealing in pre-owned games. Monday began with an explosion of questions - what are everyone&apos;s favourite GTA moments? What does the Xbox 360 look like through a CRT TV? Was Andy Cole a good signing? OfficePest&apos;s &apos;best musical score&apos; topic received lots of replies, with plenty of Japanese RPG classics cropping up. Briefly, the subject of girls and FPS games emerged prompting LarryLoxley&apos;s recollection of a familiar theory:    Someone was doing a piece on this before. They argued that the reason why most &apos;blokes&apos; like games is because men are all about the visual and the spatial (think of mens ability to read maps and enjoy p0rn) wheras girls are all about the emotional and the abstract. Hence a game about your &apos;feelings&apos; and &apos;empathy&apos; may switch around the roles of running around in circles whilst looking up at the ceiling.    Continuing the feminine theme, a conversation developed about office crushes (or &quot;workplace trouble&quot;, as they became known). This was instigated by DanBob&apos;s Morrissey-esque post about unrequited love amid the 9-5 routine (see below). What a sensitive bunch. From there, literature, specifically everyone&apos;s top five favourite books - Alan Moore, Joseph Conrad, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Raymond Chandler all cropped up. Is this a videogame site or just about the best darn book club on the web? (For the record mine are Catch 22, Treasure Island, Lord of the Flies, Great Expectations and Blue Afternoon by William Boyd). Tuesday felt like D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - More warhawk, Silvefox having router problems, someone asking if Ferrari Challenge is any good (It&apos;s okay! If you really like Ferraris!), lots of book chatter... Then a discussion about the differences between music festivals in the north and south: north = punk and nasty, south = cider and chilled. And chilled cider. The first mention of E3 took place on Wednesday morning. Then Roarrr picked up on something I meant to blog about but didn&apos;t get time - Sony&apos;s fascinating Zombie game, Last Guy, which uses Goggle Earth to create battle locations. With my typing &apos;skills&apos; I&apos;ll have to be careful writing about that game in the future - how long before I inevitably get the vowels mixed up and create my own Google Earth/videogame lifestyle sensation? And then, somehow, shaving took over... Today. More football, more Linux, the rain, the rain... the rain it raineth everyday.

My friend Lucy and I had gone to check out the campsite&apos;s shower block. When we got back to our campervan, there was a strange man lying underneath it, transfixed. But, then, this was no ordinary campervan. This was a Tonke Camper.  Part monster truck, part Little House on the Prairie, Tonke Campers are the creation of Dutch documentary film-maker Maarten Van Soest. Hand-built in the village of Wagenberg in the south of the Netherlands, they combine a traditional wooden caravan with a modern truck. &apos;Compared with normal campers there&apos;s something like beauty involved,&apos; Maarten told us, when we arrived to pick up our Tonke.  Named after Maarten&apos;s daughter, the vehicles combine two of his passions, cars and wood (his father had a company making exclusive wooden toys). But the idea of creating a plaything for adults came to Maarten after he offered to transport a friend&apos;s gypsy caravan on his lorry. &apos;My wife and I decided to make a holiday of it,&apos; he said. &apos;It was so different from normal camping, where everything is lightweight and plastic. There was a granite kitchen top, oak chairs, a cast-iron stove. It was beautiful. I said to my wife, &quot;Someone should make such a stylish and cosy van to work with a modern car.&quot;&apos; In the end, he did it himself, selling his first Tonke Camper two years ago. While the business mainly makes them to sell, this summer Maarten has started renting out Tonkes by the week. Reaching Wagenberg to pick up you van is straightforward - you take the train from Amsterdam to Breda, in an hour and 40 minutes, and Maarten will pick you up from the station for the short drive to his village. Better still, if you&apos;re flying, head for Eindhoven or Rotterdam, both of which are just 30 minutes from Breda by train.  So where should Lucy and I go? &apos;Most of my customers don&apos;t stay in Holland,&apos; said Maarten, explaining that, with a shower, toilet and kitchenette on board, the Tonke is really designed for wild camping, which is not officially allowed in the Netherlands. Instead, most campers head for France.  There must be something worth seeing in the Netherlands, though, we insisted. Pressed, Maarten suggested Friesland. &apos;I&apos;m from the south, so the north is for me more interesting. Friesland is truly Holland. It&apos;s below the water level. They still put cows in boats to transport them.&apos;  &apos;And once we&apos;re there,&apos; I asked, climbing into the driver&apos;s seat, &apos;what do the Dutch do on holiday?&apos; &apos;We go to the beach, read Jamie Oliver&apos;s books and cook. We eat stampot, a kind of mashed potato with vegetables, served with sausage. Most Dutch people say it&apos;s their favourite food - it&apos;s the diesel of this country, what people run on.&apos; Another thing the Dutch do a lot of is cycling (Tonke Campers come with an on-board bike cupboard). Sounds great, but alarming in practice if you&apos;re suddenly in charge of the biggest vehicle you&apos;ve ever driven. It didn&apos;t help that the tourist board&apos;s advice is that anyone who hits a cyclist is &apos;automatically assumed to be guilty (until proven innocent)&apos;. &apos;You look nervous,&apos; said Maarten, handing over the keys. &apos;It&apos;s meant to be fun.&apos; You could have fooled me, I thought, as I put the Tonke into gear for the first time. It was like one of those documentaries in which Canadians (it always seems to be Canadians) move a three-storey house from one end of the country to the other on a giant transporter. Except that Canada has rather more open road than the Netherlands. This is how trainee supertanker pilots feel, I thought, as I tried my first turn, swinging out right to go left (&apos;Yes, Lucy, I am turning left!&apos;).  We trundled through Noord Holland from the town of Zaanstad along lanes sandwiched between canals. Herons and cormorants sliced the water&apos;s edge beside a patchwork of blue and green. Soon this gave way to a tourist-board fantasy of thatched windmills and fields of peonies and football-sized alliums. I was starting to relax but then we came to De Rijp, a model village with the proportions of, well, a scale model. After squeezing over the narrowest of bridges, we entered this immaculate Toytown. The houses were made from neat little bricks or chocolate-painted wood. Their handkerchief-sized gardens were bursting with rambling roses and geraniums, which would have been lovely to look at if I hadn&apos;t been so focused on the road. As we snaked through the cobbled main street, I caught myself breathing in. That night we stayed near Castricum aan Zee. Divided into woody glades rather than being one large field, Bakkum campsite is the oldest in the Netherlands. Old doesn&apos;t mean shabby, though, and they&apos;ve recently added luxury safari tents and beach huts. A 1km walk across dunes brings you to a long, white-sand beach. We parked the Tonke in a shady spot, grabbed a couple of beers from the mini-market and set off along the apparently deserted shore. A little way down the beach, it came as a surprise to find a bar-restaurant by a row of little yellow cabins. With its white wooden floors, brightly cushioned benches and steel counter, Deining looked as if it should have been in Ibiza, not on the North Sea. Too tired to discover how the Tonke&apos;s stove worked, we tucked into gourmet burgers and watched two people on horseback gallop along the sand. Each Tonke is custom-designed. Ours was the smallest version, but still felt about three times as big as your classic VW campervan, with so much headroom that only the tallest Tonke-user would need to duck. At one end was a full-size double bed, at the other a wooden table and chairs that could pop down into a third bed. Between them was a pretty comprehensive kitchen (complete with fridge, double gas burner, oven and porcelain sink) and a shower and toilet compartment. What there wasn&apos;t was any hint of kitsch. Instead the snug interior was all clean lines, bold red and blue furnishings and lots of dark wood. &apos;Holland has a tradition of classic yachts from the 1920s and 1930s that&apos;s definitely visible in the Tonke interiors,&apos; Maarten explained. &apos;Gypsy caravans are often ornate, but I prefer the plainer yacht style - lots of mahogany and gloss.&apos; Next day we headed towards Friesland via the 32km Afsluit dyke, an extraordinary feat of early 20th-century engineering. Zipping past yachts on either side, you have to remind yourself that you are driving on what was once open water.  This elemental confusion continues when you reach Workum, where the main road used to be a canal, now filled in with concrete and cobbles. Near the picture-postcard main square, we sat at the vegetarian cafe, It Pottebakkershus, where pots of lavender decorate each table. Tucking into home-made quiche and drinking tea served in handmade pottery (you can buy it inside), we listened to singing from the church opposite. After browsing in Workum&apos;s antiques and interiors shops, we pushed on in the late afternoon sunshine, passing cheese farms, little houses by canals with boats tied up at the bottom of their gardens and even an old man cycling along in clogs (a tourist board stooge, surely?). The only classic Dutch scene we failed to tick off was those cows being transported around in boats.  Later that evening, we pulled onto a grassy pitch at Camping Rijsterbos, in the village of Rijs, opened the back doors and sat at the kitchen table, toasting the scenery. Our home from home had won us over during the weekend, we admitted. Manoeuvring with such a large backside isn&apos;t so hard once you get the hang of it and it had definitely been an easier - and quieter - ride than we would have had in a classic camper.  We even discussed how we would customise the Tonkes we planned to order if we had some spare cash. &apos;I&apos;d definitely change to a green interior colour scheme,&apos; said Lucy. Some fluffy duvets wouldn&apos;t go amiss, either, we agreed (at the moment you have to bring your own pillows and sleeping bags).  And perhaps Maarten could design one that came with an electronic field around it to keep uninvited Tonke fans at a respectable distance.

In the Guardian last week, he sounded ready to stop attending contemporary music events altogether. He even attacked audiences for new music, saying they were smug and slaves to intellectual snobbery, incapable of admitting they weren&apos;t enjoying themselves. Yet his piece was canny, and it highlighted some of the perceptions arts administrators struggle with - namely, that new music is &quot;difficult&quot; and hard to sell. After &quot;40 years and 1,500 concerts&quot;, as he put it, he wrote with a degree of knowledge, and I know his response will resonate with many people. Compared with many European cities - Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin - London is seen as having quite a conservative contemporary music scene. This, combined with the depressing tendency of some critics to be dismissive of new work, can discourage even established composers from premiering their work here. Building audiences for contemporary work does not happen overnight. It has taken Pierre Audi years to build a strong and loyal contemporary music audience at the Netherlands Opera. In this he has been helped by the Dutch funding system, which invests huge financial support in the arts, including new commissions for Dutch composers. With no such funding in the UK, an ambitious commissioning programme is only possible because we rely heavily on financial support from other international houses. And, of course, there are alternatives to commissioning new work: we already have many good-quality pieces that are crying out for a new reading, one example being ENO&apos;s forthcoming L&apos;Amour de Loin by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho. In recent years, my experience of going to hear new music has been focused more on staged performances than on concerts. Some of these have been poorly conceived; they lacked imagination as theatrical events and, frankly, seemed pointless. Others, such as James MacMillan&apos;s The Sacrifice at Welsh National Opera in Cardiff last year, were very successful. You cannot prescribe for success, and composing a new piece of music for any genre remains, like a new film or play, risky. You can have all the elements in place, and still a piece may not catch fire or connect with an audience. Reaching out to wider audiences requires an innovative approach: it means pricing an event appropriately, and occasionally engaging artists from the multidisciplinary arts in order to create a &quot;must-see&quot; event. The recent ENO/Young Vic season was radical in its choice of material, including Olga Neuwirth&apos;s Lost Highway, and it sold out to a mainly new, young, enthusiastic audience. ENO&apos;s collaboration with Philip Glass and the Improbable theatre group on Satyagraha, at the Coliseum last year, attracted more than 21,000 people, including 78% first-time visitors. It recently finished a sell-out run at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Luckily, there are organisations in the UK that are prepared to take risks, confident that an audience exists with an appetite for something new. Artangel&apos;s Stifter&apos;s Dinge, an inspired work by Heiner Goebbels that featured five grand pianos gliding over a lagoon, was a hot ticket earlier this year. Meanwhile, Glyndebourne&apos;s new opera, Love and Other Demons, by the Hungarian composer Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, receives its world premiere this summer. I believe the contemporary music audience is far bigger than the popular perception of it. These audiences are more intelligent than writers like Queenan would have us believe, and they insist on expressing themselves through blogs and other means on the internet (look at last week&apos;s impassioned response to Guardian critic Tom Service&apos;s blog in defence of new music, on blogs.theguardian.com/music). I still think critics have an important place when it comes to writing about the arts. It would be a disaster if the worrying trend in the US media to dispense with a wide range of critics were to spread here; we need a critical response based on knowledge. I don&apos;t believe people go to hear contemporary work because they feel under some kind of intellectual pressure to do so, and I don&apos;t accept that a single bad experience alienates them for ever. Sadly for Joe Queenan, he appears to have missed out on some of the big - and hugely popular - contemporary music events in London in recent years. John Adams&apos; Nixon in China at ENO attracted a very large audience, both at its London premiere and in a subsequent revival. The UK premiere of John Adams&apos; Doctor Atomic, directed by the award-winning film director Penny Woolcock, will be staged by ENO in February 2009, and I am confident the Nixon audience will come back for more. A great director and designer working in tandem with a composer, and a libretto that connects with today&apos;s audience, can result in something thrilling. There are many composers now emerging from a multimedia-savvy generation who are crossing genres and bringing together new languages of composition. We need to give these artists space to create new work, and find ways to fund and develop new compositions. Most importantly, we need to have faith in our audience, and give contemporary music a chance.", "sentences": ["Compared with many European cities - Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin - London is seen as having quite a conservative contemporary music scene."], "title": "John Berry says if classical music is torture, sign me up!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/15/classicalmusicandopera.culture", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-07-15T07:00:00Z", "article": "If John Sutherland laments the wobbly status of newspaper-hosted lit-crit, Victoria Glendinning has just taken a club to the last legs it stands on. &quot;Why should five people sit there and decide the best novel each year,&quot; says biographer and novelist Glendinning, who chaired the panel that culled the list of 41 winners to a shortlist of six, in the recent Booker of Bookers contest. &quot;After all, the true constituency is the readers.&quot; But popularity is no gauge of greatness. If the Man Booker organization is content to relinquish its role as arbiter of the &quot;best&quot; in literary excellence, then they are of course free to do so.

As one of their duties, judges typically have to read more than 100 books during the course of about eight months in order to render their decision. How on earth after zombie-ing through tens of thousands of pages, are they supposed to determine relative merit? Plots and characters and places must surely get twisted up in their minds to a point where deciphering Delhi from Dover, or their bottoms from Baghdad, must undoubtedly seem a lofty challenge, to say nothing of judging literary excellence. Not so, says Portillo: &quot;The only thing we judges need to decide right now is whether we think a book should be on the longlist. Is it in the top 10%? There is no doubt that some titles just stand out. You could discuss criteria and put ticks in boxes against &apos;plot&apos;, &apos;characterisation&apos; etc. but it would miss the point. Some books have a combination of qualities that make them special and that is evident.&quot; But is Portillo missing the point himself? Without articulated evaluative criteria isn&apos;t the process just a black box, open to accusations that all sorts of sinister extra-literary determinants may be at play? The jaded view is that literary prizes are simply marketing machines for big name publishers to sell more books, and for the establishment to slap itself on the back; tinsel awarded for popularity and salability, with notice of originality and literary excellence just fortuitous happenstance, if or when it occurs. Prizes step straight into this soil whenever winners of &quot;perceived&quot; lower quality are chosen over more &quot;deserving&quot; titles. Just look at the chorus of disapproval which greeted Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam, or John Banville&apos;s The Sea. Here in Canada the choice of Vincent Lam&apos;s Bloodletting &amp; Miraculous Cures as Scotiabank Giller prize-winner over Rawi Hage&apos;s IMPAC award-winning De Niro&apos;s Game continues to weather storms of derisive, accusatory commentary. If the Man Booker wants to strengthen its role as arbiter of greatness, the worst thing it can do is follow Glendinning&apos;s advice. Rather it can do us all a great service, by using the prize to reintroduce a commitment to the kind of literary criticism John Sutherland claims is all but gone from the pages of today&apos;s printed media. If the Booker prize seriously wants to find the best writing and provoke debate then it should dispense with the fiction that judges can give their full attention to every submission, and employ a set of qualified readers to arrive at a longlist. It should publicly articulate an agreed upon set of criteria against which judges must evaluate submissions, and require that judges present a written justification for their choices. Sure there would be all sorts of rows over what criteria should be used; over how they have been applied, and perhaps authors would even be tempted to tailor their work to fit this criteria. But at least the discussions would be focused on literature, and not on the distractions that surround this and so many other literary prizes.", "sentences": ["Just look at the chorus of disapproval which greeted Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam, or John Banville&apos;s The Sea."], "title": "Let's not reduce the Booker to a popularity contest", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jul/15/letsnotreducethebookerto", "tags": ["Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-07-18T00:17:27Z", "article": "Sir Alex Ferguson has met Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time in six weeks in an attempt to persuade the winger to forgo his &quot;dream&quot; move to Real Madrid and remain at Manchester United. It is understood the United manager flew to Lisbon for talks with the 23-year-old on Monday, the first face-to-face encounter between the pair since a party at Old Trafford in the days after the club&apos;s Champions League final triumph over Chelsea in May. Ronaldo, on crutches as he recovers from ankle surgery in Amsterdam last week which will sideline him for almost three months, has reiterated in the past seven days his desire to leave United for the Bernab\u00e9u. &quot;I know what I want and what I would like,&quot; he said in a television interview. &quot;We have to see what happens. I do not know where I will begin next season.&quot; Ferguson had a similar meeting during the summer with Ronaldo two years ago to persuade the Portuguese he belonged at Old Trafford in the aftermath of his confrontation with Wayne Rooney at the World Cup, where he effectively had the England striker sent off during a quarter-final. At the time Ronaldo had indicated his desire to depart for La Liga and said, &quot;After what happened with Rooney I can&apos;t remain there,&quot; but Ferguson was able to persuade the then 21-year-old not to leave. The manager also had close-season summits with Eric Cantona on the continent when it appeared the France international had his eye on a move. Meanwhile the Madrid president, Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n, has indicated he expects Ronaldo&apos;s arrival to be imminent. According to the Spanish sports daily AS, an unnamed player jokingly asked Calder\u00f3n when Ronaldo would be arriving, to which he smiled and said: &quot;Don&apos;t worry, he&apos;ll be here soon.&quot; The Madrid midfielder Wesley Sneijder had made it clear this week that Ronaldo&apos;s signing would not necessarily be welcome among the squad if he were to arrive on greatly elevated wages. &quot;It&apos;s not important to me but I know other team-mates would not like that at all,&quot; the Dutchman said. Ronaldo, in Los Angeles for the ESPY awards, was among several first-team players missing from the plane to Cape Town as United yesterday embarked on a four-match tour of Africa.

The hall, on London&apos;s South Bank, is one of six buildings in the running for the Stirling prize, which is awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects and honours the project &quot;that has made the greatest contribution to British architecture in the past year&quot;. Designed along elegant modernist lines by a triumvirate of brilliant young architects, Leslie Martin, Peter Moro and Robert Matthew in 1951, the hall is one of postwar Britain&apos;s most iconic buildings, a flagship of the Festival of Britain. Last summer it was sensitively restored by the Allies and Morrison firm, who improved the concert hall&apos;s acoustics and returned much of the structure to its original condition - a project that included sweeping out much internal clutter and creating a new parade of restaurants and shops outside. Although the other buildings in contention for the \u00a320,000 prize are new, they too are public projects: the housing development Accordia in Cambridge, the Westminster Academy school at the Naim Dangoor Centre in London, and the Manchester Civil Justice centre. Two overseas commissions also made the list, the Bijlmer Arena railway station in Amsterdam and Zaha Hadid&apos;s Nord Park cable railway, which runs through the Alps. Buildings that didn&apos;t make the shortlist include several major UK projects, among them Heathrow&apos;s Terminal Five, by Richard Rogers, and the new Wembley stadium, by Foster + Partners and HOK Sport. Recent winners of the Stirling prize include David Chipperfield&apos;s Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach am Neckar (2007), Enric Miralles&apos; Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh (2005) and Norman Foster&apos;s Gherkin in the city of London (2004).

Photograph: Tim Griffith This year&apos;s Stirling prize, an award made by the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Architects&apos; Journal, and turned into a TV makeover show by Channel 4, has gone all very Nordic this year. The shortlist of six announced last night for the building that has made the &quot;greatest contribution to British architecture this year&quot; is made up entirely of designs that have something of the North Sea, the Baltic and ice and snow about them. They are all, if not exactly hip, rather cool. The restoration of the Royal Festival Hall by Allies and Morrison on London&apos;s South Bank is one of the six. Here is a much respected public building that has always felt more than a little Scandinavian, a building echoing something of the design ethos of the famous Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 yet formed on the banks of the Thames by the architects of the London County Council in time for the 1951 Festival of Britain. From the inside, the RFH feels rather like a stylish 1950s cruise ship, and if the view from its great north-facing windows was of Stockholm, the Norwegian fjords or of the harbour at Helsinki, where similar buildings, like the Palace Hotel dating from much the same time, can be found, it wouldn&apos;t come as such a very big surprise. The Allies and Morrison renovation is generally very good, although the South Bank Centre really does need to remove the distracting and demeaning row of temporary shops and chain cafes shoved up at the base of this handsome, ship-like building before it can be considered worthy of a national award. The Manchester Civil Justice Centre, another of the six shortlisted designs, is by the Australian architects Denton, Corker and Marshall from sunny Sydney. Their super-cool and inventive high-rise law courts feels anything but Sydney and &quot;sunny&quot;, although in the context of the mostly dreary new buildings around it, it&apos;s certainly a breath of fresh architectural air. The Westminster Academy, set alongside London&apos;s elevated A40(M) Westway, by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris has something of the same cool, rational look about it; again, it would be just as happy in a Scandinavian city as it is in London. So, too, would the Accordia housing development on the fringe of Cambridge, where new, high-density homes designed by Alison Brooks Architects, Feilden Clegg Bradley and Macreanor Lavington have been built; if I had never seen this scheme and someone had told me Accordia was in Denmark or Sweden, I think I would have believed them. Nicholas Grimshaw&apos;s lively Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena railway station is quite at home with all that low-key, if often colourful modern Dutch architecture, currently spreading like a rash across England as well as the Netherlands, while Zaha Hadid&apos;s glorious Nord Park Cable Railway stations and bridges connecting Innsbruck with the mountain village, and Alpine views, of Hungerburg, exist in a world covered by snow for a goodly part of the year. You can stop off on the way to visit Europe&apos;s highest zoo and its enthralling collection of arctic and other habitually northern animals. At its best, modern British architecture has been much influenced by the intelligent humanism of the most gently articulate and highly persuasive Scandinavian design. It was Alvar Aalto, the inspired Finnish architect, who brought subtle curves, craftsmanship and nature in touch with the right-angled strictures of modern architecture and design from the mid-1930s; his is a lesson that still needs learning in so many British towns and cities. The Stirling shortlist, an interesting one, offers some hope; here, for the most part, are buildings that play down the current obsession with &quot;iconic&quot; design (for which read: over-the-top, theatrical, histrionic) and offer us something of the humane grace of Nordic modernism. As for the award ceremony itself, a cringe-making, slap-up awards dinner broadcast from Liverpool?

The most successful of these endeavours colonise the word for the author&apos;s purposes. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, both professors at the University of Chicago, have done it again with Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness Nudge has become the &apos;it&apos; book for politicos. Thaler is in the middle of a fortnight in the UK and is being courted and feted by the chattering, thinking, wonking classes. Everyone who is anyone has been nudged by the amiable prof (I bought him dinner). The Conservatives moved quickly to stake their claim to his brand of &apos;libertarian paternalism&apos;, seeing in it a way for the state to act non-coercively for the greater good. The Tory embrace of Nudge shows how far the party has moved in its approach to free markets: Thaler and Sunstein are a long way from the old Chicago School inspired and led by their most famous predecessor, Milton Friedman. Nudge portrays the Rational Economic Man who shops and trades in Friedman&apos;s free markets as a myth. &apos;If you look at economics textbooks,&apos; its authors write, &apos;you will learn that homo economicus can think like Albert Einstein, store as much memory as IBM&apos;s Big Blue and exercise the willpower of Mahatma Gandhi.&apos; Real men and women are inconsistent, ill-informed, weak-willed and lazy. We can&apos;t be bothered to fill out the form that would get us in the company pension plan, we forget to cancel subscriptions and we slump on the sofa eating doughnuts when we should be doing yoga. We are virtually incapable of balancing the temptations of today with the rewards of tomorrow; for some of us, even instant gratification isn&apos;t quite quick enough. Thaler and Sunstein want to help real, fallible people make better choices without removing their right to choose. In many cases, the nudge required is to remove the need for people to do anything at all, on the grounds that inertia and bone idleness are fixed components of human psychology. Occupational pension schemes, for example, can be established either on an opt-in basis - meaning employees have to make a positive decision to join - or as an opt-out, with workers automatically enrolled in the fund unless they choose to get out. For Rational Economic Man, there&apos;s no difference. He carefully weighs up the pros and cons of the scheme and makes his decision. But a real person, afflicted by both a &apos;status quo bias&apos; and what Thaler and Sunstein dub the &apos;yeah, whatever&apos; heuristic, the differences are pronounced. Opt-in schemes have participation rates of around 60 per cent, while otherwise identical opt-out funds retain between 90 and 95 per cent of employees. It is no wonder that Adair Turner, in his report on pensions, urged legislation to push pension schemes to an opt-in default position and that policy is moving in this direction. Irrational humans also tend to follow the crowd, which means that peer comparisons form an important part of the &apos;choice architecture&apos;. Showing people how much energy they are consuming compared with their neighbours can reduce energy use. It also helps to put a smiley face on the bills of those consuming less than the average and a sad face on those consuming more. There&apos;s something slightly absurd and infantalising about such strategies, but Thaler and Sunstein have good data to support their claim that &apos;everything matters&apos; when it comes to choice environments. Some of Thaler and Sunstein&apos;s examples of choice architecture are trivial and can be used to trivialise their argument. One policy problem used to exemplify the approach is the failure of men to pee into urinals with precision. The bosses at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, fed up with urine all over their floors, painted black flies in the centre of the urinals. By giving men something to aim at, accuracy was dramatically improved. Nudge remains true to its promise to preserve freedom of choice, hence the apparently oxymoronic description of its authors&apos; approach as libertarian paternalism, but it is unashamedly interventionist in framing those choices. This is not libertarian by any sensible use of that term and actually not even very liberal. The most honest description offered by the authors of their approach is &apos;a relatively weak, soft and non-intrusive type of paternalism&apos;. A strictly liberal approach to pensions would require people actively to choose to opt in. Liberals know that people are very often their own worst enemy, but, unlike nudgers, they do not feel compelled to intervene and act as peacemaker. Yet thoughtful liberals, unlike libertarians, will always be open to persuasion away from a purist application of their principles and Nudge offers a persuasive argument in policy areas like pensions and credit card regulation. It is harder to go along with the nudgers&apos; enthusiasm to act in other areas where people foul up. Thaler and Sunstein float the idea of a mandatory waiting period before allowing people to marry, an indication, I think, that their paternalism runs a little deeper than they protest. Some people will indeed have too many mojitos and get married in a drunken haze in Vegas and then regret it. It is hard to see why this is any business of the state. Our frailties may often be irrational, but they remain ours. These are fairly minor quibbles. Nudge distils a scholarly and timely argument into a highly accessible book. There&apos;s definitely a publishing opportunity with these single-word theses. I am going to write a book called Wink: How Small Signals Transmit Big Messages. It&apos;s a winner; I can feel it. Except I can&apos;t be bothered. I need a nudge. Or maybe a smack. \u00b7 Richard Reeves has just been appointed director of Demos.

Much of the damage is thought to have occurred when it was rolled up for journeys around the world - having been shown in London, Paris, Milan, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne, Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm, as well as Sao Paulo and New York, its home for many years during the Franco dictatorship. Guernica&apos;s globetrotting was mostly done in the 1950s but famous art does more air miles than ever these days. Stories of accidental damage include an Andy Warhol self-portrait ripped by a gust of wind as it was hauled from gallery to removal van, a Howard Hodgkin broken in half by a collapsing storeroom cupboard and a Rembrandt etching posted in a glazed frame with only bubble wrap and a padded envelope for protection.  Even respected galleries can damage work. Two American pieces fell from their hangings and broke during an exhibition of modern art from Los Angeles at the Pompidou Centre in Paris two years ago. One had survived several earthquakes during its time in LA and the Pompidou was criticised by US artists and galleries for its apparent carelessness. A spokesman for the National Gallery says it won&apos;t automatically refuse requests from other galleries to show its most precious works but its conservation team and curators assess each inquiry. Two years ago, The Ambassadors, one of the National&apos;s most famous works by Holbein, could not be sent one-and-a-half miles to Tate Britain for a major Holbein exhibition, because its wooden panels were judged too delicate to move. Galleries will sometimes go to great lengths not to disturb fragile works. A huge canvas by Luca Giordano has been kept at the Herbert in Coventry during the art gallery and museum&apos;s \u00a320m refurbishment.

I&apos;d been doing a little blogging on the side, for the Guardian, for a while. I was even rather an early adopter, as the paper&apos;s erstwhile Backrow Blogger, reporting on those aspects of the arts that don&apos;t exactly qualify as news, from irritating conductors&apos; tics to overcrowded art galleries. But this spring I set myself the challenge of blogging my way through all of Shakespeare&apos;s history plays, 24 whole hours of them, from the RSC&apos;s productions at the Roundhouse in London. During each interval, and in every break between plays, I sat hunched over my laptop, writing about what I&apos;d just seen. I would never pretend that what I was doing was criticism; but, it was an honest, enthusiastic, instant response to what was happening on stage. And it was a hoot. Live blogging from a theatre production is not, let it be said, anything like live-blogging a television show. Earlier this year Anna Pickard&apos;s blogs about The Apprentice for the Guardian drew a deservedly huge audience of people who were, like her, simultaneously watching TV and writing about it. But theatre-goers are, well, at the theatre. On an average night there are far fewer of them than there are people at home watching TV. Nonetheless, the responses sprang up. I heard from people who had seen the history plays back in 1963, the epoch-making Wars of the Roses cycle directed by Peter Hall with John Barton. Someone calling him or herself Athelard, a student who had watched the entire cycle at Stratford-upon-Avon some weeks earlier, weighed in with a number of incisive observations. Ian Shuttleworth, a theatre critic for the Financial Times, even brought his expertise to bear on the conversation. And, while I was sitting on the Roundhouse terrace, tapping away, a member of the cast came up and introduced himself - was I the woman from the Guardian doing the blog? Some of the actors in the show, it turned out, had been following my (or, rather, their own) progress online. That was slightly disconcerting, as well as flattering - but entirely appropriate to a grand-scale piece of theatre-making that seemed to draw both performers and audience into a single community as the eight plays unfolded. So after four years as this paper&apos;s arts correspondent, a reporter who tried to fit blogging in around the edges of my life, I&apos;m about to move online. From this week, blogging will take its place at the heart of what I do. Why, apart from all of the above? Well, as a form, the blog is fantastically elastic - a quality that cannot fail to be seductive to a writer. Everything is up for grabs. A blog can be everyday, whimsical, deeply serious or all three; it can be published instantly (clearly a boon to journalists); it can be experimental.  Alex Ross, the classical music critic of the New Yorker who blogs at therestisnoise.com, has described his own gradual discovery, some years back, of blogs that weren&apos;t just repositories for trivia about Star Wars (not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that), but which contained serious writing about music. There was Jeremy Denk, for example, a professional pianist who, aside from posting hilariously eccentric pieces about yoghurt or waiting in airport queues, also offered in-depth musicological analyses of work he was approaching as a performer, alongside musical quotations and sound files. Ross has said he found the tide of these blogs by performers particularly intriguing, as potentially distant figures were gradually demystified through their presence online. When I wrote about the RSC&apos;s history plays, I was a greenhorn; RSC actor Nick Asbury had long been keeping a spirited online account of the ups and downs of being a cast member, another way in which the history plays - the very directorial conception of which involved breaking down barriers between actors and audience - created a community around its productions. The internet has proved a particularly rich and rewarding forum for less mainstream culture, or at least those aspects of our culture whose fans and practitioners are sufficiently thinly spread as to preclude large amounts of space in newspapers. Classical music is a good example: the internet has meant that devoted fans of composer Brian Ferneyhough, let&apos;s say, can communicate cheaply, easily and in depth, whether they are in Alaska or Amsterdam. Classics - another discipline whose devotees are sprinkled across the globe - is another, with historian Mary Beard&apos;s blog, A Don&apos;s Life, attracting a lively following. As a journalist covering the arts, the possibilities are endless - and still relatively untapped. If I want to break a story, I can break a story. If I want to write about, say, a Bayreuth Ring cycle as it unfolds, then there&apos;s nothing to stop me. If I&apos;ve a niggle to air, or an argument to develop, or some random enthusiasm to share - then why not? If I want to point to pictures, or play some music, or point to some film footage, all this can be done. If I want to venture outside the office, outside London - and I do - then all I need is me, my laptop and a broadband connection. I&apos;ll be building a home for the stuff a newspaper can&apos;t always accommodate - the gossip, the heard-on-the-street snippets, the recommendations, the more specialist information, the flotsam and jetsam that often reveal more about the worlds I encounter than the longest, most considered article. Needless to say, suggestions are very welcome - please post them on my blog. That&apos;s another thing. This new journey is not one that will be undertaken in isolation, but in the company of you, the readers. I don&apos;t expect this to be a comfortable ride. For a long time, journalists have been largely insulated from the direct reactions of readers, and to find your loose arguments or baggy thinking being painfully held to account can be a shock to the system. On the whole, I&apos;ve found this part of the experience a rewarding one. Who wouldn&apos;t want a stream of ideas and arguments to come their way? The benefits of conversation and community outweigh any demerits; I&apos;d rather be in the thick of things than loftily dispensing words into an apparent vacuum. My blog is, of course, a small and extremely insignificant part of a revolution in the arts, and in the way newspapers now cover them. One consequence has been the ongoing debate about the status of &quot;amateur&quot; bloggers compared with the work of &quot;professional&quot; critics: will bloggers make critics redundant? Will critics increasingly fetch up as bloggers? In the US, this debate has been accompanied by the sacking of an enormous number of arts reviewers from newspapers. But I don&apos;t think the two are polar opposites. For a start, many bloggers are professional critics, not least Ross and his colleague at the New Yorker, pop critic Sasha Frere-Jones; and not all professional critics offer uniformly excellent criticism. When I wrote about the RSC shows, one of the cast said: &quot;It&apos;s like being reviewed as we go through.&quot; I was shocked: I felt I was offering a response, as valid as anyone else&apos;s - but, bluntly, not as a reviewer. Everyone can offer a response to an artwork; real criticism requires knowledge, experience, time, literary skill and insight. I see no signs that criticism is under threat in the UK, and if ever it were I would be the first to the battle line. For now, though, I am very happy to be breaking down boundaries, stepping on toes, genre-bending and throwing everything up in the air - all in a blog. \u00b7 theguardian.com/charlottehiggins  \u00b7 This article was amended on Friday July 25 2008.

Wim Vansevenant (BEL) SIL + 3hr 45min 48sec* * 150 riders remain from 180 starters  Stage 19: Roanne to Monlucan (165.5km)  Yesterday&apos;s stage from Bourg d&apos;Oisans to St-Etienne was a transitional one and, as expected, there were no changes in the top 10 in the general classification. Barring accidents, there are unlikely to be any today either and the outcome of this year&apos;s Tour will in all likelihood be decided in tomorrow&apos;s time trial.  CSC rider Carlos Sastre zips up the maillot jaune for a second successive day with a lead of 1min 24sec over his team-mate Frank Schleck. Gerolsteiner&apos;s Bernhard Kohl is in third place, 1min 33sec behind the Spaniard and only needs to finish the race to win the polka-dot jersey for king of the mountains. Australian Silence-Lotto rider Cadel Evans is one second behind Kohl, but his skills as a time-triallist make him favourite to win the yellow ersey in Paris on Sunday. The itinerary for today&apos;s includes climbs: the category-three La Croix-du-Sud (at 17.5km) and the category-four cote de la Croix-Rouge (42km). There are also two intermediate sprints: Chantelle (at 102.5km) and Commentry (143.5km). Guardian chief sportswriter Richard Williams&apos; report on yesterday&apos;s stage is here. To virtually ride the route yourself without any of the effort, why not have a go on this fantastic Google Streetmap gizmo. For our route map and interactive guide, plus all the news, features and comment on this year&apos;s Tour, you could do worse than pay a visit to our special report.  1.30pm: Good afternoon everybody. With 117km to go in the third-last stage of this year&apos;s Tour, Egoi Martinez (EUS), Stefan Schumacher (GST), Pierrick Fedrigo (BTL) and Alessandro Ballan (LAM) are 4 seconds clear of the peloton. &quot;This is very much a day for the purists,&quot; says the Eurosport presenter. (Tanslation: it&apos;ll be even more boring than yesterday.) Never mind, there are worse ways of killing the last few hours of the week before the few Friday night pints than peddling this pedaling nonsense on t&apos;Interweb. I have an action-packed weekend in store, with visits to the gym (to win \u00a350 from a friend who thinks he can run 1.5miles in 11min 55sec, despite not having taken exercise of any kind for 15 years), the pool hall and the supermarket planned. If anyone can top that for hi-octane thrills, I&apos;d love to hear from you.  1.35pm: &quot;Can you please explain what is considered whatever the French for &apos;cricket&apos; is when it comes to challenging the yellow jersey on the final ride to Paris?&quot; asks Patrick O&apos;Brien.  I have no idea Patrick. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen anyone challenge for it in an ordinary stage on the last day, so all the incumbent has to do is stay in the saddle and he&apos;s home and hosed.  1.40pm: I haven&apos;t watched this yet, but apparently it&apos;s magnificently entertaining. Why? The question &quot;Darren, according to the internet, you scored the greatest goal ever. Tell us about it&quot; and the news ticker at 1min 30sec.  1.50pm: &quot;I will be watching the tour on the weekend on Ireland&apos;s TG4 channel,&quot; writes Kieran Burns. &quot;It is broadcast in Irish which, being a language I don&apos;t understand, makes the racing more interesting as I have to work out what they are talking about. Perhaps you could do the minute-by-minute in Irish to liven up proceedings.&quot; I could try, Kieran, but it certainly wouldn&apos;t liven up proceedings. Having spent a year in an Irish college as a lad, I used to be fluent in Irish. Sadly, I haven&apos;t spoken a word of it since I left school so I&apos;ve forgotten most of it. However, I do remember it started coming back to me when I was watching the Galway Races on the same channel a couple of years ago when I was at home. If it&apos;s any help, I can tell you that the Irish for &quot;bicycle&quot; is &quot;rothar&quot; and the Irish for &quot;fast&quot; is &quot;tapaidh&quot;. For example: &quot;Beidh Cadel Evans ag rothaiocht go tapaidh in eadan an chlog amarach&quot; means &quot;Cadel Evans will be cycling fast against the clock tomorrow&quot;.  1.55pm: The escape party is being reeled in by the peloton, which has narrowed the gap to 19 seconds. Liquigas and Quick Step are leading the chase at a good clip.  2pm: Amateur bike-racer of minute-by-minutes passim, James Cavell writes, so that I can go downstairs for a sandwich.  &quot;I saw today that the riders begun their day with 9 km of &apos;neutralisation&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;This is an unusually long way for the neutral start. Basically, if you are unfamiliar, the neutral start is when the peloton leaves the start city, and racing is not yet permitted, either for safety reasons (lots of roundabouts, road furniture) and/or to give all the assambled fans a chance to see the riders at a slow pace. To ensure people like Voigt and Gilbert don&apos;t immediately sprint off into the distance there are cars and motorbikes in front of the peloton riding at 30km/h, effectively blocking their path. When the neutral zone is over, the race director waves a flag, the cars zoom off and the race is officially begun. &quot;When I see pros riding neutralisations I am always very jealous, as they ride easy, seeing it as a pleasant start to the day. Chatting, waving to fans, often deliberately riding at the back with a big smile. &quot;In the amateur classics, especially in the windswept low countries, neutralisation is as mad as a bucket. As soon as the flag is waved the guys in front hit 60km/h, string the peloton out in a long line, and if it is windy, the peloton normally breaks up into echelons within 5-10 minutes when riders down the line &apos;crack&apos; under the high speed. The strongest riders are usually in the first echelon and they are often not seen again, and juries have a habit of pulling all but the first 2/3 groups out of the race after an hour or so. The last group, where I unfortunately have plenty of experience is known as the &apos;Mongol Echelon&apos;. &quot;The only way one can guarantee being in the first/second group is to be at the front at the moment the neutralisation ends. Unfortunately, all 180 riders are trying to do this and the few km of &apos;neutral&apos; start is basically &apos;everybody trying to ride in front of everyone else all the time&apos; or &apos;let&apos;s see if all 180 of us can ride on an area of road the size of half a tennis court&apos;. With it getting so crowded, the only way to move up from the back is often to jump onto the pavement, ride over the middle of a roundabout, zip up a bike lane, push other riders out the way, shout etc.  &quot;Twice this year I have been involved in mass pile-ups in the first 2km of a 180km classic, and have even had the luxury of viewing myself bouncing over a parked car on local television.&quot; Brilliant stuff, James. Thanks for allowing our readers just another quick peek into the glamourous world of the mediocre-at-best amateur cyclist. You should write a book about your experiences, because I&apos;ve certainly found parts of your occasional dispatches very funny; none more so than the expression &quot;Mongol echelon&quot;.  Is that wrong?  2.15pm: With an emphatic stop put to the gallop of the four-man peloton-break, Sylvain Chavenal has attacked and is about 10 seconds clear of a chasing bunch of 18 riders, all of whom want to make the most of their last realistic chance of securing a stage win in this year&apos;s Tour, what with tomorrow being a day for time-triallists and Sunday&apos;s almost certain to be won by a sprinter.  2.20pm: &quot;The Tour de France coverage on TG4 is pants,&quot; writes Harry Coen. &quot;Two loons sitting in a studio in Indreabh\u00e1n watching Phil &apos;n&apos; Paul and talking an awful lot about Alberto Contador. Watching Wednesday they were a right laugh. Going up the Croix de Fer it was all &quot;C\u00e1 bhfuil Cadel?!? C\u00e1 bhfuil Cadel?!?&quot; (Where is Cadel?) and he was right there in front of them, but with his jersey unzipped they didn&apos;t recongise him. And up the Alpe it was all &quot;C\u00e1 bhfuil Kohl! C\u00e1 bhfuil Kohl?!?&quot; You&apos;d have thought the polka dots on the jersey would have helped them identify him.&quot;  2.23pm: With 80km to go, the 148-strong peloton has eased off the gas and let Frenchmen Sylvain Chavenal (COF) and Jeremy Roy (FDJ) open a gap of 2min 12sec. The pair pass through the feed station but don&apos;t take any grub on board, choosing instead to concentrate on building their lead and dine from their team cars later.  2.25pm: &quot;The Tour is rating very highly in Australia and grows in popularity each year - particularly when Australian riders are doing so well,&quot; g&apos;days Christopher Larwood from Adelaide. &quot;Hard to believe a Brit has actually done better than our blokes in terms of stage wins this year.The dramatic French Alpine landscapes in bright sunlight takes me away from the coldness of mid-winter in Adelaide and has me staying up too late for 3 weeks. Our coverage on TV starts about 2130 hrs each night and runs through to about 0130 hrs. Keep a look out for CSC rider Stuart O&apos;Grady - he is the local Adelaide boy - a great pro rider and in off season always up for a beer around town.&quot;  2.26pm: Never mind the off season, if Stuart O&apos;Grady is anything like most Australians I know, I&apos;d say the chaps in his team car probably fill his bidons from a barrel of draught Cooper&apos;s on the back seat.  2.30pm: James Cavell is back with more fascinating insights into peloton life. &quot;The term &apos;Mongol Echelon&apos; actually sounds even better in Dutch: &apos;Mongol Waaier&apos;. There is an unofficial hierarchy of competence and respect in the peloton ...  1. At the bottom is &apos;First Class Mongol&apos;  This is either a newcomer, or just one of those individuals who no matter how much experience they gather, can&apos;t seem to steer properly, allows gaps to open up in front of him when the bunch is strung out, forcing riders behind him to dig deep to close the gap. These guys have a tendency to cause crashes too, often doing something stupid, like doing calf stretches on the bike. First Class Mongols usually ride at the back, and get dropped very quickly and spend many an afternoon trying to find their way back to the start of the race. Some of these guys have excellent condition and train hard, but are just dumb, whilst others are not only stupid but also crap too. I have seen guys literally sit up looking bewildered at the first moment the race accelerates, not having either the ability or the balls to ride faster than 55km/h. Incompetence as liability = First Class Mongol.  2. Then there is just an ordinary Mongol, who is a slightly diluted version of his first class colleague.  3. Moving upwards from the mongols, one finds the &quot;Pancakes&quot; both first class and regular  These guys started out as Mongols, but have learned a little, and can just about get by if the race isn&apos;t too hard. Still prone to unpredictable errors and getting dropped, but on a good day they can pass as a bike racer. It&apos;s funny, as some succesful guys will always be seen as pancakes, no matter how well they do, whereas some less successful riders are considered experts (perhaps just by themselves, though) despite regularly showing Pancake characteristics. For example, the loudest voice in the Dutch amateur peloton, Amsterdam&apos;s Pieter Scheerens, provides a constant stream of on-bike critical commentary on other riders, usually berating them for being Mongols and Pancakes, but then he is always at the back, in the thick of the Mongol chaos, and usually joins them for the humiliating ride back to the changing rooms after just half an hour.  4. And the rest ...  There unfortunately aren&apos;t any amusing terms for the better riders. Just something along the lines of &quot;strong/trustworthy&quot; or &quot;strong/doping&quot;.  So where does our font of all knowledge, James Cavell, fit into this hierarchy?  &quot;I am fairly sure I am a pancake nowadays,&quot; he says proudly. &quot;In fact my team captain called me so. But I suspect behind my back I might be called a Mongol. I would be disappointed if I was still a Mongol - First Class though. &quot;The pros have a similar system. I understand Mauricio Soler is a First Class Mongol as he can&apos;t steer. When he came to Holland to ride the lucrative post-Tour criteriums it was difficult for the others to allow him to podium (these races are pre-determined on status) as he was such a first class mongol on all the corners.&quot; And there was me thinking the Barloworld rider who pulled out after a few stages couldn&apos;t steer because he had two injured wrists, when it seems he had two injured wrists because he couldn&apos;t steer!  2.42pm: With 63km to go, Chavenal and Roy are 4min 34sec clear of the chasing Mongol hordes.  2.45pm: &quot;I empathise with Christopher Larwood&apos;s tiredness over the past three weeks,&quot; yawns Patrick O&apos;Brien in Australia. &quot;It&apos;s a tough effort with the time difference, but worth it. It&apos;s funny finding out that more and more people are watching it. When the Tour starts it can feel like you&apos;re the only one watching, but gradually you notice more and more people with dark circles appearing under their eyes as the weeks progress. Then you start to overhear snatches of conversations on the trams about pelotons, time trials and natural breaks.&quot;  2.48pm: The Liquigas and Milram teams are at the front of the peloton, dragging it along in a bid to close the 4min 17sec gap between it and the breakaway duo. On Eurosport, they&apos;re wondering if the legitimacy of a Cadel Evans Tour win could be called into question if he ends the race in yellow without winning a stage. David Harmon reckons it could not, Sean Kelly thinks it could ... a bit.  2.50pm: Harry Coen&apos;s back: |There was a great piece on an Aussie site* yesterday describing one journalist&apos;s experience in a VIP car this Tour: &apos;We were driven up there [the Alpe] by a former professional cyclist who had nearly given us heart attacks an hour earlier as he made the long and winding descent down the Galibier at breakneck speed - while simultaneously watching the race on TV and taking phone calls. Sensing our unease, he lightened the tension by jovially relating how he had to stop the car the previous day so his Italian passengers could bring up their breakfast. Oh, and before we set off after the modest lunch he noticed that the single bottle of champagne provided for four of us and another group of four had not quite been finished - so he had a swig from the bottle.&apos;  &quot;Given that Fr\u00e4nk and Andy Schleck&apos;s da is driving VIP guests,&quot; continues Harry. &quot;I wonder if this article might have prompted the rozzers to pull him over yesterday? It was clearly a part of a crack-down on champagne-swilling VIP drivers.&quot;  * Reading Australian newspaper websites makes you go blind.  3pm: Chavenal and Roy ... 3min 50sec worth of road ... peloton. Will they hold on? Won&apos;t they? Does anyone actually care?  3.11pm: 46.8km to go, Chavenal and Roy are 4min 23sec and I can feel my will to live slowly slipping away. Oh look ... a nice castle in the middle of a forest. Or &quot;a spectacle&quot;, as Eurosport&apos;s David Harmon calls it. He says it&apos;s one of the oldest castles in the region. I wonder does Dave know this to be a fact, or is he just guessing?  3.15pm: &quot;Everyone seems to be predicting a Cadel Evans win,&quot; writes Rupert Wolheim. This is calculated on the basis of his faster time in the Cholet time trial, the margin of which is then multiplied by the increased distance (53km against 29.5 km). But is this fair? Sastre, as a climber, must have better stamina so the extra distance may reduce Evans&apos; superiority. Also, the stage is definitely hillier.&quot;  Good points and well made, Rupert. I don&apos;t think Evans is the shoo-in some think he is either, but if somebody put a gun to my head and forced me to pick an alternative winner of this year&apos;s Tour, I&apos;d probably go for Denis Menchov.  3.20pm: James &quot;The pancake&quot; Cavell is back. Hurrah! &quot;I may have painted a rather bleak picture of life as a mongol/pancake in the amateur peloton, with all the crashes, getting dropped, expensive repair bills etc.&quot; he writes. |But it&apos;s a nice life too. Working part-time is great whatever you do and being outdoors in the sun while all your mates are stuck in the office looking at spreadsheets never stops being exciting. &quot;The worst thing ever about it is during the TdF lots of middle-aged, overweight, new-to-cycling, pro team replica jersey wearing &quot;Freds&quot; write colums describing their 10hr Etape du Tour rides in which they are referred to as &apos;amateur cyclists&apos;. This represents a humilation for those of us who train and live like pros, but just don&apos;t get paid a salary for our equally hardman/pancake/mongol exploits. &quot;Yes, I know they are &apos;amateur&apos; in the sense that they don&apos;t get paid either, but there is a world of difference between a &apos;recreational&apos; cyclist and an elite category racer.&quot; Is there, James? The way you tell it, both cycle long distances slowly for no reward. What exactly is the difference? I only ask because I&apos;m fat and middle-aged and was about to regale everyone with the exciting tale of my 15km on a stationary bike (set to a gradient/resistence of 13) in the gym last night in under 30 minutes. I thought that was Cadel Evans-esque.  3.27pm: A lot of readers have written in to as ... well, one reader, Sacha Villeneuve in Quebec has written in to ask &quot;why none of the top pretenders are trying something today? They know Cadel will beat them tomorrow at the time trial, so why not try something today? Why is Sastre, Shleck, Menchov, Khol aren&apos;t trying to escape, to provoke something? They&apos;re all following Cadel like sheeps going to the slaughterhouse. Ridiculous.&quot;  I don&apos;t know, Sacha. They probably know there&apos;s no point in doing so on what is a farily straightforward stage. Perhaps James Cavell can shed some light on the subject ...  3.33pm:  &quot;Re: the castles (ou chateuax, n&apos;est-ce-pas?),&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;Dave Harmon won&apos;t be guessing: he&apos;ll be using Dave Duffield&apos;s notes from 10 or so years ago. Unlike Duffers, he will stop before naming all the owners since 1682, discussing its interior design and remarking on the resident chef&apos;s specialities. More&apos;s the pity.&quot;  3.35pm: Sylvain Chavenal and Jeremy Roy have 30km to go and are 4min 40sec ahead of the peltoton, which is being led by the last remnants of the Barloworld team, who probably want to tee up a sprint finish for South Africa&apos;s Robbie Hunter to contest. You can read Hunter&apos;s Tour diary here.  3.40pm: &quot;15km in 30 minutes with the gradient set at 13, Barry?&quot; writes Rendell Harris. &quot;Considering the Alpe d&apos;Huez is 13.8km and only has an average gradient of around nine, and the best professionals take around 45-50 minutes to complete it, you should be out of the office and on to the road! Or is it possible your gym&apos;s fixed bikes are ever so slightly flattering?&quot;  3.42pm: James Cavell is back and he&apos;s throwing metaphorical bidons at me, then leaning his head into my chest and attempting to butt my chin. &quot;I&apos;ll have you know that lots of amateur races have equally fast average speeds as the pro races ... just the races are usually 20-50km shorter. There are a number of well known Olympic Gold medal track riders who remain amateur on the road, and when guys like Wim Stroetinga here in Holland start feeling frisky at the front in a criterium the speed can be enough to put pros in a world of pain. Mauricio &quot;steering&quot; Soler would be dropped! Thank God he&apos;s off to Milram next year to lead Zabel out! &quot;I&apos;ve had the pleasure twice this year of hanging on as last wheel in a crit while some Olympic medal candidate has a workout on the front, and the experience crams all the pain of a 10hr Etape de Tour into 10 minutes of lactic acid maximum heart rate hell. &quot;Some of the better amateur teams (with UCI continental licenses) are allowed to take part in smaller pro races, and they often account valiantly for themselves.&quot; Yes, but can they cycle the equivalent of L&apos;Alpe d&apos;Huez on a stationary bike in less than 30 minutes? What? Oh.  4.46pm: With 20km to go, the gap between Chavenal and Roy and the peloton has been whittled down to 3min 24sec. It&apos;s touch and go whether they&apos;ll manage to hold on to the finish line or not.  3.48pm: This is marvellous. Paul &quot;Toobz&quot; Tooby has written in to tell me that the James Cavell who&apos;s been doing my job for me today was once dumped by Rosie Williams-Aulden at the beginning of the film&quot; (presumably on a first date) and once landed Paul&apos;s cousin Pete Round in the soup by &quot;squaring up to some bloke at Bromsgrove fair and, when he accepted your offer of a fight, pointed at Pete, shouted &apos;Fight him then!&apos; and ran off.&quot;  If James or Rosie Williams-Aulden would like to elaborate on this intriguing story, they only have 14km to do so.  3.56pm: With 10km to go, Chavenal and Roy&apos;s lead has been slashed to 2min 56sec. Meanwhile, James Cavell is back with an answer to Sacha Villeneuve&apos;s question.  &quot;Convention has it that the GC contenders only race each other on &apos;proper&apos; mountain stages, or in TT&apos;s,&quot; he explains. &quot;There have also been a few instances of using crosswinds or cobblestones to sow mayhem, but generally things are quiet on days such as today. &apos;One other factor is that these guys are all virtually as good as each other, and also, as the terrain is not difficult each GC rider would have teammates able to cover the moves. Even lanterne rouge Wim Vansevenant would be able to (or would be shouted at until he did) mix it up if CSC, Rabo started launching attacks. &quot;If it became a free-for-all among the top riders, all that would happen is that the speed would go right up as teams countered each other and all the really tired guys would get really annoyed. There would then be all sorts of shouting and gesticulating, with Italian riders getting exceptionally dramatic, and then a patron would ride up front and wave a ceasefire.&quot;  4pm: With 6.7km to go, Chavenal and Roy have a 2min 51sec lead over the peloton, which should suffice unless they start fannying around playing cat and mouse. Of the pair, Chavenal is the hot favourite to win the stage.  4.05pm: &quot;I&apos;m pleased to see in the photo that Carlos Sastre isn&apos;t going for the all over - helmet, shorts, gloves, bike etc in yellow like some others - a little bit OTT, like Kohl&apos;s spotty helmet,&quot; writes Matthew Clarke. &quot;Harmon prob has a guide with all the local landmarks the Tour passes on it. Sherwen has the same on ITV, which he blatantly reads verbatim, after which Liggett always praises his &apos;knowledge&apos;.&quot;  4.07pm: Just 3.2km to go and no word from James Cavell or Rosie Williams-Auden about that pre-movie break-up. Yet. Chavenal and Roy are still pelting along with a 2min 11sec gap between them and the peloton. Sean Kelly reckons that Roy&apos;s only chance of winning the stage is to get on Chavenal&apos;s wheel and stay on it for as long as he can, then win with a kick in the sprint.  4.10pm: The gap is 1min 58sec. Chavenal leads with Roy on his wheel and 1km to go. They haven&apos;t started looking at each other suspiciously yet.  4.10pm: With Roy on his wheel, Chavenal slows things down, looks behind him and grins at his compatriot. Roy attacks him, but Chavenal is well able for him and wins the sprint for the line. There&apos;s not much in it, but he was never in any danger. The presentation should be interesting, as Bernard Hinault, who presides over these matters, is not a fan of Chavenal&apos;s work and has been highly critical of his work ethic in the past. Frosty handshake ahoy!  4.15pm: Sod the cycling, this is far more entertaining. &quot;Paul Tooby needs to get his facts right,&quot; writes James Cavell. &quot;I&apos;ll admit to the Rose Williams-Alden business, but the film in question was Sister Act, so the evening wasn&apos;t a complete loss as far as pain and humiliation are concerned. &quot;The Bromsgrove fair incident is wide of the mark. It was in fact Mike Flynn (now an industry colleague of yours) who copped an unfortunate one from some &apos;fairgound type&apos;, and the words &apos;fight him&apos; were never spoken by my lips. &apos;Run!&apos; well might have been. Now that I&apos;ve lived in Holland for a decade, I forget the delights of England, where talking to a girl or looking at someone can get you a kicking which most people seem to see as well earned. &quot;By the way I was on the phone to my family, telling them to log on to see my comments, and also mailed some friends, and then moments later the Rosie WA/Bromsgrove Fair incidents pop up like a turd in the waterpipe.&quot; Sorry about that, James. But if it&apos;s any consolation, I think your heroic tales of life at the sharp end of the peloton were far more undignified.  Top 10 in stage 19 1. Sylvain Chavanel (FRA) COF2.

More incredible to those crowded into the room was the identity of the men who stood next to him on the platform as newly anointed partners. BP had only just settled a long-running dispute with the same four oligarchs, led by Mikhail Fridman, over another oil joint-venture which had gone sour. But this time, Browne declared, it would be different, although he did concede later to journalists when pressed: &apos;In business, trust is never 100 per cent.&apos; Fast forward almost five years, and the two sides are at war, one which is both highly public and personal. BP&apos;s outgoing chairman Peter Sutherland has branded AAR a &apos;corporate raider&apos;. Fridman, cofounder of the Alfa Group conglomerate, hit back by likening Sutherland to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.  The dispute escalated last Thursday when Robert Dudley, the BP-nominated chief executive of the venture, was forced to leave the country, complaining of &apos;sustained harassment&apos;. Ostensibly the reason was that his visa had expired, with AAR refusing to extend his contract.  BP insists Dudley will continue to run the business from a secret location abroad. AAR, made up of the Russian conglomerates Alfa Group, Access Industries and Renova, says it will not recognise his authority. It is extraordinary that no one knows who is running Russia&apos;s third-largest oil company, with a market value of $32bn.  Each side has instructed lawyers to initiate myriad proceedings against the other, so much so that every lawyer in Moscow seems to be involved. It would be fair to say that trust between the two sides is zero per cent.  This month, BP withdrew the last of its 148 expatriate specialists assigned to TNK-BP following visa restrictions. Police have also raided TNK-BP&apos;s Moscow offices, and have hauled Dudley in for questioning. And last week, BP for the first time publicly accused the Russian authorities of colluding with its partners. Sutherland said: &apos;It saddens me to say that nowhere in our recent history have we been treated as we are currently being treated in Russia where our fellow shareholders - called AAR - have been orchestrating a campaign of harassment in order to gain control of our joint-venture TNK-BP. There has even been manipulation of elements of the Russian state as part of this campaign.&apos; The four oligarchs behind AAR are among the most powerful - and rich - businessmen in Russia, who came to prominence in the wake of the chaotic privatisations of the oil and metals industries in the Nineties. Fridman&apos;s fortune is estimated at more than $20bn, making him the 28th richest person in the world. Born in Ukraine, his first foray into business was to set up a student co-operative of window cleaners.  Viktor Vekselberg, a fellow Ukrainian, who heads up Renova group, is worth over $10bn and owns about a fifth of Rusal, the world&apos;s largest aluminium company. Famously, he paid the Forbes publishing family about $90m for a collection of Faberg\u00e9 Easter eggs that once belonged to the Russian Tsar Alexander III. Len Blavatnik, founder of Access Industries who went to school with Vekselberg, is the third oligarch behind AAR and is worth about $7bn; the quartet is completed by Fridman&apos;s right-hand man and old college friend German Khan, worth $13.9bn.  The crisis is a heavy blow to BP chief executive Tony Hayward, who is still working to assert his authority after he succeeded Browne a year ago. TNK-BP is central to BP&apos;s fortunes. BP&apos;s share of TNK-BP&apos;s production represents a quarter of the group&apos;s total output. More importantly, in a world where it is becoming difficult to find new oil, the venture also provides about a third of BP&apos;s total reserves. BP is expected to report record second-quarter profits this week on the back of soaring oil prices. But the dispute in Russia will dominate proceedings. Put simply, the battle is over control of TNK-BP. AAR complains that BP is running the venture as its own subsidiary, rather than for the benefit of all shareholders. BP has blocked plans for TNK-BP to expand overseas, AAR says, instead using the venture primarily to bolster BP&apos;s flagging reserves portfolio. Although TNK-BP has increased production by a quarter since 2003, growth has flattened out recently.  AAR also complains that the share prices of rival Russian oil companies have increased by a much larger amount. The Russian shareholders want TNK-BP to become a global oil major, independent of BP. They also want a full stock market listing, most likely in London, to make it easier for the venture to buy other companies using its shares.  By contrast, BP wants to use TNK-BP to expand its presence in Russia and has no interest in creating a company that would compete with it globally. These positions seem diametrically opposed and, so far, neither side has shown any sign of giving way. But why is AAR now portraying itself as the downtrodden shareholder in a venture it was perfectly happy to sign up to back in 2003? It is unlikely to be a coincidence that the &apos;lock-in period&apos; which AAR signed to prevent it selling its stake in the venture expired at the end of last year. Analysts have long suspected AAR wants to cash in and sell up to Gazprom or Rosneft. This may yet happen, but the dispute is more complicated than that.  Alexander Burgansky, analyst from Renaissance Capital, says that since the joint-venture was formed, the AAR shareholders have become more ambitious and are looking to expand internationally all their businesses, including TNK-BP. Another reason, he says, is that AAR knows that in Russia, priority will always be given to state-owned companies such as Gazprom or Rosneft, meaning that for the company to grow, it must look overseas. But the spat has become much more than a conventional dispute between two shareholder groups. As is so often the case in Russia, the rule of law has been wielded by one group against the other. Technically, AAR is right when it says that Dudley&apos;s work contract has expired; a law passed last year requires all directors to have their contracts renewed each year. But the reason it has expired is because AAR has refused to renew it. Because the Russian legal system has so many rules, so much bureaucracy and, often, corruption, the law becomes a useful proxy weapon. Bob Amsterdam, a lawyer who specialises in Russia, says the dispute is a &apos;very regressive step&apos; for Russia. &apos;I don&apos;t know how many conferences on corporate governance have to be held in Russia before people realise this idea of a rule of law is a myth.&apos;  Browne knew, of course, that going into Russia was far from risk-free. For oil companies operating in such places as the Middle East and Africa, risk is an occupational hazard. And, in many ways, the deal has been a huge success: in 2004, the year after the venture was formed, TNK-BP generated income of almost $5bn, going a long way to paying off BP&apos;s original outlay.  Amsterdam claims that BP has also profited from other instances of &apos;corporate raiding&apos;, so cannot claim to be blameless. In 2006, it took a $1bn stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft after it inherited the lucrative assets of Yukos, which was destroyed by a state-orchestrated tax evasion campaign. Neither side looks ready to back down or talk about compromise. Both insist that the day-to-day operations of TNK-BP are not affected but if the dispute goes on much longer, this is unlikely to remain the case.  Last week, unveiling results for the first half of the year, chief operating officer Tim Summers - Dudley was no longer in the country - finished his presentation with an ominous understatement: &apos;Shareholder issues may impact performance during 2009.&apos; It is in neither side&apos;s interests for profits to suffer, which may be one factor that will force a truce. The Kremlin, headed by President Dmitry Medvedev, made a point of praising BP as the dispute developed, yet it insists it will not intervene. But with Gazprom and Rosneft keen to work with BP in Russia, the Kremlin may have to step in to prevent BP from being stripped of its interests there. Burgansky from Renaissance Capital says: &apos;It&apos;s hard to see how BP will not be looked after when a solution is found.&apos;  But it&apos;s too early to say what that solution will be, and when it will come. Britain versus Russia: The main players in the TN-BP row The beginning TNK-BP was created in September 2003, when BP and a consortium of Russian shareholder groups - Alfa Group, Access Industries and Renova (AAR) - pooled their Russian oil assets.  BP ploughed $8bn into the venture, representing the largest-ever foreign investment in Russia. AAR and BP each own 50 per cent, but BP nominates the chief executive to run it.  TNK-BP is the third-largest oil company in Russia. Almost a third of BP&apos;s reserves are held by its TNK-BP stake. About a quarter of BP&apos;s total production also comes from the venture.  The players Alfa Group, one of Russia&apos;s largest conglomerates, is run by Mikhail Fridman. It also has interests in telecoms, vodka and banking. The other three oligarchs who make up AAR are Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Blavatnik and German Khan.  BP had a separate long-running dispute with AAR before the TNK-BP deal was struck, over the British company&apos;s investment in another venture. Referring to this dispute, when the TNK-BP venture was unveiled the then chief executive, Lord Browne, declared: &apos;We continue to build trust and less and less view each other&apos;s motives with suspicion.&apos; The dispute AAR complains that BP treats the venture as its subsidiary, running the company for its benefit rather than that of all shareholders. The Russians claim that BP has blocked international expansion of TNK-BP.  A &apos;lock-in&apos; period preventing AAR from selling its stake expired at the end of last year. This has prompted some analysts to speculate that AAR is angling to sell to Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom.  Last month, BP branded its Russian partners as &apos;corporate raiders&apos;. Last week, TNK-BP chief executive Robert Dudley was forced to leave Russia after his visa had run out, following other BP appointees who have left the country.  The future No one knows what will happen next. BP says Dudley will continue to run the country from abroad, but with the two sides at war, it won&apos;t be easy. The Russian government, which has insisted it will not intervene, could yet step in to broker a deal.

New stock will be issued on the New York Stock Exchange - though sources close to the firm said KKR&apos;s founders will not be selling any of their personally held shares. One of the biggest private equity firms, KKR is run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, who founded the business in 1976. They have built fortunes estimated by Forbes magazine at $5.5bn each. KKR&apos;s aggressive approach was immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate, which told of its $31bn takeover of the food and tobacco firm RJR Nabisco in 1989. A year ago, KKR filed documents indicating its intent to pursue a flotation but the move was shelved as the credit crunch paralysed financial markets and caused the flow of private equity deals to slow. Sources close to KKR say the firm has been unhappy with the valuation put on its Amsterdam-listed offshoot and sees an opportunity to take advantage of this. The Euronext-quoted fund has a market capitalisation of $1.2bn and its shareholders are likely to have about 20% of the combined public entity. Kravis and Roberts, who are 64, have shown no sign of retiring and will have a long-term ability to draw down some of their wealth if the stock is publicly traded. Although KKR has no immediate need for funds, a listing provides a form of &quot;evergreen&quot; access to capital when needed.

Nevertheless his latest move places him under a uniquely intense spotlight. Liverpool spent \u00a320.3m to bring Keane to Anfield and the implication is clear: Rafael Ben\u00edtez views him as the difference between another fourth-place finish and a serious tilt at the title. Liverpool fans will be optimistic that Keane can form a prolific partnership with Fernando Torres - the Irishman has scored at least 16 goals for Tottenham in each of the last five seasons and managed 23 in all competitions last year, while Torres hit 33 in his first season at Anfield. Indeed, Torres and Keane&apos;s combined 39 league goals last term would have been better than any pairing outside of Manchester United, where Cristiano Ronaldo alone had 31. Given that Liverpool&apos;s second-highest league scorer was Steven Gerrard, with 12 goals, and that Andriy Voronin and Peter Crouch were joint third on five, there&apos;s no doubting that Keane fills a significant need. But will his presence really be enough to put Liverpool on a level footing with Manchester United and Chelsea? The Inter owner Massimo Moratti once said that Keane has the &quot;perfect game&quot;, but former Liverpool player Mark Lawrenson was sceptical, accusing him of being &quot;streaky&quot; and only scoring goals in patches. Is Keane prolific enough to take up the slack if Torres were to get injured? Ben\u00edtez may force Keane to play out wide in his preferred 4-2-3-1, rather than playing off a target man as he did at Tottenham. If so, can he be as effective from such a position? Tottenham, for their part, have expressed their frustration at having to give up Keane, a move described by their chairman Daniel Levy as an &quot;enforced sale&quot;. Darren Bent was quick to stake his claim to replace Keane by scoring four goals in a friendly against Norwich yesterday, but is he an adequate replacement?

Try not to panic. Infidelity can take many forms, and everyone has a different way of defining what it is. Many couples make the mistake of not discussing what they expect of one another, so people often make assumptions about what is OK and what&apos;s not, without checking this with their partners.  This is especially problematic in grey areas such as virtual sex.

Others seek to restrict their partner&apos;s sexual interests, including masturbation or online activity.  Have a calm discussion with your wife. Begin your questions with phrases such as: &quot;Please would you help me to understand why you ...&quot; But first, you need to decide what is permissible to you and what is not.

Watch it again. At one point the cameraman has to jerk forwards to keep up with him because he&apos;s about to run off the screen. Frankie Fredericks beat the Olympic record by five hundreths of a second, and he was pipped to gold by a clear 10 yards. Johnson&apos;s time of 19.32 broke his own world record by a third of a second. No other man in history has run below 19.6. It was one of the few redeeming points of the &apos;96 Coca-Cola Olympics. More importantly, it is a record about which we suspend our disbelief. Unlike Flo-Jo, Ben Johnson and Marita Koch, Johnson is untainted by doping accusations. Like Bob Beamon&apos;s 8.90m leap in Mexico City, this was a crystallised moment of brilliance that will linger in the memories of everyone who saw it. Watching it felt like the world had stopped to marvel at a passing comet.  2) Hungary v USSR, Melbourne, 1956 Sport and politics dovetail in the Olympics, and never have they done so more viscerally than in the 1956 water polo semi-final, which was played just 26 days after the Soviet army had put down the Hungarian uprising. More than 2,500 Hungarians died in the conflict, 200,000 fled their homes and 13,000 were imprisoned afterwards. Hungary were gold medalists at three of the previous four Olympics, but were still seen as underdogs by a crowd of 5,500. Having been away from Hungary throughout, the water polo team were keen to exercise their rage. &quot;The pool,&quot; wrote Harry Carpenter, &quot;became a bubbling cauldron of spite&quot;. &quot;There was a lot of fighting, kicking, and grabbing,&quot; said spectator Sonny Tanabe, &quot;I&apos;d never seen anything like it.&quot; The water, Tanabe added, was red with blood. Ervin Zador, who scored twice as Hungary went 4-0 up, was hospitalised by a punch to the face. &quot;It wasn&apos;t water polo&quot;, he said, &quot;it was boxing underwater.&quot; Four players were sent off. When Zador was hauled from the pool, Hungarian fans started to riot, and the match was abandoned and awarded to Hungary. Zador, like 44 of his teammates, defected after the Games were over.  3) Betty Robinson wins gold in the 100 metres, Amsterdam, 1928 Given that it was 1972 before women were allowed to compete over 800m, it is strange that more prominence isn&apos;t given to the struggle for sexual equality in the Olympics. In 1928 the IOC were forced to include women&apos;s athletics in the Games for the first time. Betty Robinson, only 16, became the first female track medalist. She&apos;d been spotted only a year before the final, when a coach had seen her running to catch a train. The 100m final at Amsterdam was only her fifth senior race of her life, the first having been just four months previously. Her run equalled the world record of 12.2 seconds, and she won gold by the narrowest of margins. The result made her a star. When the IOC recanted on the decision and decided to remove women&apos;s athletics from the 1932 Games, it took the threat of a US boycott to get them to reverse the decision. The USA wanted to see Betty Robinson run and win in Los Angeles. But in 1931 she was involved in a plane crash. The man who found her body thought she was dead, put her in his car boot and drove her to a mortician - but she was still alive, in a coma. She woke seven months later, and spent six months in a wheelchair. It took her two years to learn to walk normally again. Incredibly, she eventually returned to racing. Unable to bend her legs fully, she couldn&apos;t adopt a sprinter&apos;s crouch. But she could still run the relay, and in 1936 she won her second gold in the 4x100m.  4) Luz Long tells Jesse Owens where to go, Berlin, 1936 Long, a 19-year-old German, was Jesse Owens&apos; main rival in the long jump in 1936. Owens had already won the 100m, and his legend was in the midst of its creation. Long was tall, blond and well educated. He was so superficially similar to Hitler&apos;s Aryan archetype that he starred in Leni Riefenstahl&apos;s Olympia - Fest Der Volker. He was a national hero. In the qualifying rounds Long equalled the Olympic record while Owens was struggling badly. The judges had counted a practice jump as one of his three official efforts. Disconcerted, Owens overstepped his second jump. He fell down dejected on the trackside. Long, who had never previously spoken to Owens, introduced himself, and suggested that Owens should try taking off from several inches behind the line. He did, and managed to qualify. In the final Long&apos;s fifth jump gave him a tie of third, but Owens&apos; sixth jump, which broke Long&apos;s Olympic record, won him gold. Long and Owens walked arm-in-arm to the dressing room afterwards, posing for press photos. &quot;It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler,&quot; Owens said afterwards &quot;You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn&apos;t be a plating on the 24-carat friendship I felt for Luz Long at that moment. Hitler must have gone crazy watching us embrace.&quot; Long died fighting with the Wehrmacht in Sicily, 1943.  5) Peter Norman wears his badge with pride, Mexico City, 1968 The third man in one of the most famous photographs of the 20th century, Peter Norman was the Australian sprinter who split John Carlos and Tommie Smith in the 1968 200m. Smith and Carlos were pilloried for making the black power salute, suspended by the IOC and given 48 hours to leave Mexico. Both suffered for it when they returned home. History vindicated them, made them heroes even, but that rehabilitation took almost two decades. Norman made his mind up on the spot. Though neither Carlos nor Smith knew him especially, and he had no connection with the Olympic Project for Human Rights, he approached them in the tunnel and said he agreed with what they were doing. Carlos, the more radical of the two Americans, said recently that he&apos;d thought at the time, &quot;Who the hell is this whitey?&quot; and tried to shrug Norman out of the way. Unperturbed, Norman borrowed an OPHR pinbadge from a bystanding American athlete, which he wore to the podium. His actions presaged the attitudes that it would take others years to develop. While the IOC disgraced itself with its attitude, Norman&apos;s unshowy solidarity displayed true Olympian spirit. He said afterwards: &quot;I believe that every man is born equal and should be treated that way.&quot; He, Smith and Carlos became good friends, and the two men were pallbearers at Norman&apos;s funeral in 2006.  6) James B Connolly takes gold in the triple jump, Athens, 1896 Connolly was the first gold medalist in the history of the modern Olympics. His success was a glorious shambles, Connolly&apos;s strength of will helping him overcome all manner of difficulties and prejudices. Having dropped out of school aged 15, Connolly went on to study classics at Harvard. A good athlete but a poor scholar, he was refused two months leave to compete in Athens. Told he would have to resign and then reapply for his place next year, Connolly simply walked out of the Dean&apos;s office and never came back. Other Harvard athletes had been given the time off, but they were all members of the distinguished Boston Athletic Association. Connolly was too poor to make that particular cut. While the BAA athletes had their expenses paid, Connolly had to fund his own trip. He spent his life-savings, $700, on a steamer ticket. On board he was blackballed by other athletes because of his lack of social standing.  After his wallet was stolen en route, Connolly arrived in Athens to find that rather than having 12 days to train, he would in fact be starting his competition the following day (he&apos;d failed to clock the differences between the Greek and Western calendars). Worse, the organisers had decided that the competition would be a hop-hop-jump, rather than the hop-step-jump for which he&apos;d been preparing. In front of a 140,000-strong crowd, Connolly watched the first round jumps of his rivals, then contemptuously tossed his hat to a point a yard beyond the furthest mark. In the event he went well beyond it, and his mark of 13.71m won him gold. Penniless, he duly started hocking Johnson&apos;s Anodyne Linament, before becoming a soldier and then a novelist. In 1949, Harvard tried to apologise for its treatment, and offered him an honourary doctorate. He turned them down.", "sentences": ["3) Betty Robinson wins gold in the 100 metres, Amsterdam, 1928 Given that it was 1972 before women were allowed to compete over 800m, it is strange that more prominence isn&apos;t given to the struggle for sexual equality in the Olympics.", "The 100m final at Amsterdam was only her fifth senior race of her life, the first having been just four months previously."], "title": "Joy of Six: great Olympic moments", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/31/olympicgames2008.athletics", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Athletics", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-01T23:01:00Z", "article": "Dave Roberts, the Lancashire physio who shepherded Andrew Flintoff back to full fitness, admitted for the first time yesterday that he wondered whether the England all-rounder would ever recapture his old swagger following the fourth and most recent operation on his left ankle in Amsterdam last October. Roberts was oozing pride after Flintoff&apos;s hair-raising spell to Jacques Kallis on Thursday evening, a passage of play the physio described as &quot;the culmination of all the hard work we&apos;ve put in over the last few years&quot;. But his pleasure was tinged with anxious memories as he recalled his own uncertainty of 10 months ago. &quot;I&apos;ve never said this to anyone before but after that last operation I did think, &apos;Will he ever be the same again?&apos; I could never share that with Fred because you have to be upbeat. So to see him come in the other night was fantastic and a massive relief.&quot; Roberts has been Flintoff&apos;s physical - and at times mental - guru ever since he underwent his first ankle operation in 2005, although the latest period of rehab began with the less than fearsome sight of Roberts pushing his patient out of Schipol airport in a wheelchair last autumn. But optimism grew when the Dutch ankle specialist Professor Niek van Dijk removed a tiny piece of bone fragment from the troublesome joint, after which it was a case of nursing Flintoff back to health. &quot;Part of the problem was the muscle wasting that went on, so we had to build him up all over again,&quot; said Roberts. &quot;It was really important to get a full six months with him this time rather than just three, but it was still quite a journey. After the operation we went to Florida for eight weeks before Christmas, where he still couldn&apos;t run. That meant a lot of spinning, weights, cross-training and reshaping his body to get more definition in his lower limbs. &quot;By the time we got to Cape Town, where we spent 10 days in January, he was running again but we had to gradually reintegrate him. It was also a question of mentally moving him away from being my patient to being a cricketer. The Lions tour to India in February helped that process, as did Lancashire&apos;s pre-season trip to Dubai. Thursday evening was a moment of huge pride for me but I&apos;ve had great support from the ECB, especially Hugh Morris [the England team&apos;s managing director].&quot; Roberts described the side strain that ruled Flintoff out for six weeks earlier in the summer as &quot;a nightmare&quot; but believes the setback added to his desire to return. &quot;In some ways it got him hungrier and he trained harder again,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m very proud of the fact that he can now bowl like that but I&apos;ll be happier once he&apos;s got through a full series and had no reaction. I am optimistic. He&apos;s fitter and stronger than ever. If he keeps fit, keeps doing his rehab and prehab and looks after the ankle, he can be around for a long time.&quot;", "sentences": ["Dave Roberts, the Lancashire physio who shepherded Andrew Flintoff back to full fitness, admitted for the first time yesterday that he wondered whether the England all-rounder would ever recapture his old swagger following the fourth and most recent operation on his left ankle in Amsterdam last October."], "title": "Cricket: Physio admits he feared for Flintoff future", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/02/englandcricketteam.englandvsouthafrica20081", "tags": ["England cricket team", "England v South Africa 2008", "South Africa cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Andrew Flintoff"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-02T23:01:00Z", "article": "Why go now? There is nothing quite like spending a hot summer&apos;s day in Amsterdam. The moment the first rays of sunshine come out, the locals hit the city&apos;s terraces in droves, take to the canals with their boats or hang out at the travelling theatre festival De Parade (deparade.nl). For the first two weeks of August, this runs in the Martin Luther King park, featuring theatre and musical performances in a setting that is best described as a quirky mix between a circus (the series of performances take place in tents) and an old-fashioned funfair (complete with Ferris wheel). Checking in It&apos;s hard to pick what exactly is B&amp;B Cake under My Pillow&apos;s (00 31 20 751 0936; cakeundermypillow.com) best asset. But it&apos;s a three-way tie between its location (in the seriously hip and ever lively De Pijp area), its decor (all four rooms have a distinct colour-coordinated theme and are filled with thrift-store finds) or the fact that the owners also run the deliciously kitsch cake shop that is conveniently located downstairs.  Hit the streets Amsterdam is a small city and most of the sights are within walking distance of one another. The De Jordaan area, with its cobbled streets and tree-lined canals, is the picture-perfect Amsterdam that both visitors and locals love. Following the canals from Central Station you&apos;re bound to hit the busy Leidsestraat, which ends up in the equally crowded Leidseplein. Too busy for your liking? A mere stone&apos;s throw away is Vondelpark, the lungs of the city, where hippies, dog walkers, joggers, tourists and suits coexist happily.  Coffee break You can easily spend the majority of your day at De Koffie Salon on Utrechtsestraat 130. They open at 7am sharp, when the first people come in - usually with a laptop or the morning paper - for a brew and a quick breakfast. Before you know it, it&apos;s lunchtime and you can nibble on a tramezzino sandwich over yet another cuppa.  Neighbourhood watch  De Baarsjes is on the up. Creatives and young couples are moving to the former immigrant neighbourhood, followed by entrepreneurs who open up cafes and restaurants to cater to the needs of these new urbanites. It is still a bit rough around the edges and is a far cry from the picturesque city centre, but there is an onslaught of art galleries (all conveniently located on Witte de Withstraat) and small boutiques by up-and-coming designers and creatives.  Retail therapy While Kalverstraat is Amsterdam&apos;s Oxford Street, those in the know head for the 9 Streets, nine little streets just off the city centre where there&apos;s an abundance of hip clothes shops and speciality stores. Worked up an appetite Like most big cities, Amsterdam&apos;s shopping streets are lined with Burger King and McDonald&apos;s. Fortunately you have other choices when you&apos;re in need of a burger. De Burgermeester has two restaurants (one at Albert Cuypstraat 48 in De Pijp, the other at Elandsgracht 130 in De Jordaan) and has managed to do the impossible: create healthy and tasty fast food. From the grilled beefburgers to the tuna sandwiches, it&apos;s all freshly made and delicious.  Big night out Brix (00 31 20 639 0351; cafebrix.nl) at Wolvenstraat 16 is a bit of New York cool in the heart of Amsterdam. The menu is great (the desserts alone call for a visit), the decor stylish (including lots of exposed brick) and the clientele consists almost exclusively of cool cats, who come for live music (mostly jazz). Paradiso (00 31 20 626 4521; paradiso.nl) at Weteringschans 6-8 is a mandatory stop. Rightly so, because this church-turned-concert hall is the best place to dance the night away or enjoy a gig. Escape the city Amsterdam has several artificial &apos;urban beaches&apos;. Strand Zuid is a yuppie&apos;s paradise, Strand West is a more laid-back option, but by far the most popular choice is Blijburg. It is a bit of a bike ride, but that doesn&apos;t stop the city&apos;s cool kids and beautiful people flocking here. Prefer feeling a bigger stretch of sand between your toes? Then take the train to the real North Sea beaches of Bloemendaal (the hipster&apos;s hangout) or Zandvoort (good for families).

Fourteen-year-old Robert moves from the rough end of Dublin to the wilds of County Clare with his single mother and four-year-old half-brother Dennis, partly to escape his mother&apos;s mounting debts, but also to get Robert away from the life of joyriding, petty theft and drugs into which he has fallen with a group of older boys.  When he steals a car, the local farmer makes him work as a labourer to pay off the debt and, against his will, Robert begins to gain a little respect for himself and others. But the family is surrounded by sinister myths about fairy caves, murdered children and an unsolved mystery regarding the disappearance of the former occupant of their house.  Thompson&apos;s compassionate but unsentimental eye evokes the grinding hardships of poverty and the characters&apos; voices are pitch-perfect (Robert&apos;s language is authentically frank, so it&apos;s not for younger readers or the squeamish), but she can also spin a dark mystery that reels the reader in. A very different kind of poverty forms the backdrop to Patricia McCormick&apos;s haunting Sold (Walker Books \u00a35.99), the story of a 13-year-old Himalayan girl, Lakshmi, sold into prostitution by her stepfather. McCormick writes in spare chapters, some as brief and impressionistic as poems, capturing Lakshmi&apos;s initial bewilderment, resignation and eventual determination to escape from the painfully misnamed Happiness House. The book offers an unflinching and deeply affecting picture of a life unimaginable to most young adults in the West. Also aiming to educate through fiction is Val\u00e9rie Zenatti&apos;s Message in a Bottle (Bloomsbury \u00a36.99), a vivid, modern-day Romeo and Juliet set in the Gaza Strip. Originally published in France and translated here into punchy prose by Adriana Hunter, this is the account of Israeli teenager Tal Levine, who throws a message in a bottle into the sea and receives an unexpected reply from a Palestinian boy calling himself &apos;Gazaman&apos;. Zenatti&apos;s previous novel, When I Was a Soldier, was based on her experiences of national service in the Israeli army, and her knowledge and love of her adopted country shine through. This poignant and feisty novel will remind readers that even in the midst of unrest and bloodshed, what people have in common can count for more than their differences. History also plays a part in veteran American writer EL Konigsburg&apos;s excellent new novel, The Mysterious Edge of the Heroic World (Walker Books, \u00a35.99), but here it is the murky past of Nazi-occupied Europe that comes to haunt the world of two boys in present-day Florida.

Agatha Christie&apos;s Marple: Towards Zero (ITV1, Sunday) followed the usual pattern: a bunch of very familiar actors, with oil in their hair or wearing pretty dresses, smoke cigarettes furiously while motoring to the seaside in order to get murdered. Or to murder someone else. Or simply to be suspected, on-and-off, of doing so. At home we try to figure it all out: whogetsdunin, whodunit, and whatheybeeninbefore? Isn&apos;t that thingy from whatsit? (I scored double points for spotting Greg Rusedski playing tennis.) And then they&apos;re all gathered together at the end, on a rather splendid motor launch in this one, for smug little Miss Marple to point her bony finger. But then when we know, it feels a bit of a let-down, as it always does. Oh, it was him after all, the tennis player, that bloke who was in Cranford.  Maybe, in this age of scientific CSI slickness, it&apos;s not enough to know simply whodunit. So much of the interest now lies with the process of finding out, in the laboratory, with DNA, and tiny fibres, white coats and forensics, that perhaps an old bat with a hunch is no longer enough. A possible solution would be Sleuth Swap. They&apos;d put a bit of oil in the hair of CSI&apos;s Grissom, add a cricket sweater, and motor him down to Seagull Point to bring the show up to date. He can introduce some modern methods to Superintendent Mallard (Alan Davies from Jonathan Creek) and his bungling local bobbies. Miss Marple, meanwhile, can be jetted off to Vegas, to wander blinking among the bright lights. Accompanied by the Who, obviously, singing, &quot;Whooooo-dun-it? Who who, who who?&quot; There was something of Miss Marple about Jean and Shirley in A WI Lady&apos;s Guide to Brothels (Channel 4, Sunday). And Jean and Shirley do end up blinking in the bright lights of Nevada. At a sex ranch! These two game women from the Hampshire Women&apos;s Institute want to see changes in the law, to make a prostitute&apos;s work less dangerous.  So they&apos;re touring the globe, to see how it&apos;s done elsewhere. Their mission is a deadly serious one, their motives noble, but that doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t room for a bit of comedy. And there are some priceless moments. Browsing in an Amsterdam sex shop, Jean picks out something in a packet that looks like a small plastic man, not so small actually.  &quot;Can you give me some information about the Arse Midget?&quot; she says to the assistant in her clipped Hampshire WI tones. &quot;People stick it in their arse,&quot; says the nice man, apologetically. He has a comedy Dutch accent.  &quot;Stick them in their arse?&quot; &quot;Yes. I&apos;m so sorry.&quot; Jean and Shirley may be puzzled by some of what they find, but they aren&apos;t shocked by anything. And certainly never deterred. Once they&apos;ve gathered all their evidence (the Kiwis run the best brothels, it seems), they return, bearing gifts from that shop in Amsterdam for some of the other ladies of the Hampshire WI (no Arse Midgets, thankfully). And then they set about getting things done, with the help of the equally game Nicky Taylor, whose lovely film this is. Wonderful. Sprint (BBC2, Sunday) followed four young British 100m Olympic hopefuls over several years leading up to this coming Friday. It is an intimate and honest film, at times touching. And the races themselves are not only beautiful but have the power to make the spectator very slightly sick in the pit of the stomach, as only the 100m can do. I know these boys train incredibly hard, they put their bodies through a lot, but for a lot of the time they&apos;re not obviously doing very much at all. They&apos;re a bit like cheetahs - lying around, stretching lazily.  And then, every so often, they run a short distance, very very fast. In order to survive.  The problem with the film is that there&apos;s just a bit too much of the not-doing-very-much. I know it&apos;s about the whole process - the build-up, training, everything - but we follow these very fast lads around so very slowly it&apos;s almost as if it&apos;s in real time. By the end, I feel as if I&apos;ve gone through the training myself. An hour would be fine. But drawing a film about a race that takes 10 seconds out to 90 minutes, that&apos;s too much.", "sentences": ["Browsing in an Amsterdam sex shop, Jean picks out something in a packet that looks like a small plastic man, not so small actually.", "Once they&apos;ve gathered all their evidence (the Kiwis run the best brothels, it seems), they return, bearing gifts from that shop in Amsterdam for some of the other ladies of the Hampshire WI (no Arse Midgets, thankfully)."], "title": "Sam Wollaston on Agatha Christie's Marple: Towards Zero, A WI Lady's Guide to Brothels and Sprint", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/04/television.television", "tags": ["Television", "Media", "Television industry", "Culture", "Television & radio"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-03T23:01:00Z", "article": "This month the officers of Sun Hill station are pioneering an unprecedented twinning experiment with primetime German cop drama SOKO Leipzig, as the two shows jointly film a two-part story to be broadcast in almost identical form on ITV1 and German state broadcaster ZDF.  Leipzig&apos;s Hauptkommissar Hajo Trautzschke travels to London to find his goddaughter - seeking assistance, god bless him, from The Bill&apos;s perennial guv&apos;nor DCI Jack Meadows. DC Mickey Webb joins his boss as they track the kidnappers back to Leipzig, allowing for a few smart cross-cultural gags - such as Teutonic blonde Detective Superintendent Ina Zimmermann shrugging &quot;We Germans have no sense of humour&quot; as she dismisses our boys in blue&apos;s backchat. Online chatter from Bill lovers has expressed regret the show hasn&apos;t twinned with CSI - which, as CSI costs roughly $3m (\u00a31.5m) an hour, suggests the fanbase haven&apos;t quite understood their show&apos;s place in international television&apos;s ecosystem. But you can understand their wishful thinking: although financial co-productions have been a feature of the TV industry&apos;s financing for years, cast- and script-based foreign exchange programmes have not had a glorious past.  In fact, the history of Europe&apos;s jointly produced television has been about as successful as the history of Europe&apos;s jointly produced treaties - with the notable exception/obvious confirmation being the Eurovision Song Contest. So it&apos;s little wonder that the Bill&apos;s producer, Johnathan Young, is keen to distance his co-production from one that preceded it. &quot;This is definitely not Eurocops,&quot; he insists. One would sincerely hope not. Back in 1985, Channel 4 joined the European Co-production Association, designed to foster joint programming by public service broadcasters. And the fruit of this pan-European dream? Two of the strangest programmes ever made - Eurocops and Riviera. Eurocops was funded by Channel 4 (UK), RAI (Italy), ORF (Austria), ZDF (West Germany), Antenne 2 (France), SRG (Switzerland) and latterly RTVE (Spain), and broadcasters took turns to film episodes. The show rated badly - and coined the term Europudding. (Riviera was so woeful it wasn&apos;t even screened in the UK.) Which does make you wonder why pan-European productions tend to go down so badly in the UK. Part of the problem comes down to a difference in TV cultures - foreign languages are subtitled, for instance, which is rarely popular with TV viewers outside late-night Channel 4 film slots.  In most of Europe, actors overdub imported films and TV programmes - and voiceover artists are often paired with particular foreign actors for their entire career. German actor Frank-Otto Schenk, for instance, voices Kelsey Grammer, Eugene Levy, Steve Martin and Peter Firth - who plays Harry Pearce in Spooks. &quot;As I not only work on voiceovers, but am also an actor, I do of course &apos;act&apos; the role, hopefully with the same ardour, the same vocal expression, every little breath and sigh,&quot; Schenk explains. &quot;I have not noticed any cultural differences in Spooks although in German, the MoD is the &apos;Verteidigungsministerium&apos;, and that can lead to challenging situations during synchronisation.&quot;  Where synchronisation is less of a problem is in game show formats such as It&apos;s A Knockout/Jeux Sans Frontieres. Early-90s quiz show Going For Gold, presented by Henry Kelly, was also a hit, even if the winners - who had to speak in English - tended to hail from the Benelux countries rather than the UK.  But drama (and audiences) might have to get used to the idea of European collaboration, thanks to increasing pressure on budgets and the rise of multinational production companies - the Bill/SOKO experiment is being closely examined in the hope it can erase the memory of Europuddings. The signs so far are that the budget twinning worked for the production companies and the broadcasters at least. Young has just secured a commission from the BBC for Alan Bleasdale&apos;s latest script about the sinking of the Laconia during the second world war. The film is jointly funded by German broadcaster ARD, which is also providing German cast members. SOKO Leipzig producer J\u00f6rg Winger is developing a British/German supercop show set in Berlin. And for those involved in producing such foreign-exchange productions? Young has one vital tip: don&apos;t book early flights home - the wrap party will be messy. Seasons in the sun Don&apos;t fancy a co-production, but fancy a bit of sun? British soap characters have regular excursions overseas. Intense plotlines - such as EastEnders&apos; Mitchell brothers finding their sister in bed with David Wicks, or Corrie&apos;s Hayley heading to Amsterdam for a sex change - work better when a small cast is confined in a single location.  &quot;Coronation Street was the first back in the 1970s, when someone won a Spot the Ball contest and a gang headed off to Spain,&quot; says Inside Soap&apos;s editor, Steven Murphy. This led to the shocking sight of Bet, Rita and Hilda sunning themselves away from gloomy Weatherfield for once (above and right).  &quot;Mavis had an affair with a Spanish waiter,&quot; Murphy continues. &quot;But the form really picked up when EastEnders sent Angie and Den to Venice in 1988 for Angie to reveal she wasn&apos;t really about to die.&quot; These week-long specials usually boost ratings, but they can have unintended negative consequences. EastEnders&apos; trip to Ireland in the 1990s portrayed the Irish as such rural simpletons that it practically caused an international incident; while a fear of seeming profligate in these credit crunch times forced the soap&apos;s bosses to switch a proposed Mitchell family Spanish sojourn to Weymouth this spring. Which must have been a blow for the struggling Spanish property market.  After Corrie finished filming in Malta last summer, the property website worldpropertymalta.com predicted a surge of interest in &quot;this beautiful sun-soaked island in the middle of the Mediterranean. Exposure on Coronation Street is sure to highlight the desirability of the island to viewers considering either a holiday or a property purchase.&quot; Perhaps Weymouth will feel a similar benefit.", "sentences": ["Intense plotlines - such as EastEnders&apos; Mitchell brothers finding their sister in bed with David Wicks, or Corrie&apos;s Hayley heading to Amsterdam for a sex change - work better when a small cast is confined in a single location."], "title": "You're nicked, mein Sohn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/itv.television", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-04T12:29:12Z", "article": "Belgian-Dutch banking group Fortis today reported a 41% drop in first-half profits after taking a hit from the ongoing turmoil in credit markets.

While Manchester United&apos;s medical team assess the state of the Portugal international&apos;s right ankle, Sir Alex Ferguson will look him in the eye and test his resolve, attitude and motivation. The answers may determine whether it is the beginning of the end of the tortuous Real Madrid transfer saga or of Ronaldo&apos;s time at Old Trafford. The most coveted player in the world is due to visit his employers one month on from ankle surgery in Amsterdam as United, with whom Ronaldo signed a five-year contract worth \u00a331m in April, inspect his recovery and clarify a timeframe for his return.  That he will be involved in United&apos;s pursuit of a hat-trick of league championships is, according to Ferguson and the club&apos;s chief executive, David Gill, beyond doubt and they can certainly lay claim to being the only party with a consistent line throughout a transfer tale now in its fourth month. But until Ronaldo comes out and confirms he will be staying at an Old Trafford without Carlos Queiroz and that the &quot;dream&quot; of Real Madrid has died for another season, the doubt lingers. Ronaldo&apos;s meeting with his manager may take place today, the second time they have come face-to-face this summer, and it will take an intransigent performance from the 23-year-old, a show that convinces Ferguson he has lost the player&apos;s heart and mind to the Bernab\u00e9u, possibly even a transfer request, for the winger to have any hope of winning the argument. As Ruud van Nistelrooy, himself a prolific goalscorer for United and allowed to join Real Madrid only at Ferguson&apos;s behest, has said: &quot;The meetings can be a bit lively but overall what he [Ferguson] is doing is in the interests of Manchester United and that&apos;s what he always thinks of. In those meetings, if he wants to keep the player, he&apos;ll do everything he can to do so and he&apos;ll probably succeed as well.&quot; Few players have left Old Trafford against the Glaswegian&apos;s wishes and it has aided United&apos;s stance, and caused disquiet in Madrid, that Ronaldo has not thrown any tantrums to leave in public. He may have rekindled Ferguson&apos;s distaste for the cult of celebrity that surrounded David Beckham by partying in his plaster cast in Los Angeles, and retain the unwavering devotion of only those United supporters who have not reached puberty by keeping Real&apos;s interest alive, but he is not entirely lost to the Old Trafford cause yet. With the dubious exception of a quote claiming to reflect what Ronaldo&apos;s agent, Jorge Mendes, thinks his client might say when he returns to Manchester, the player has kept his counsel since his last private encounter with Ferguson - a wise move since the odds against his departure lengthen as the transfer deadline draws nearer and United&apos;s determination to keep him, from the Glazers down, holds firm. In contrast to United&apos;s consistent stance, Real&apos;s tactics - though not their ultimate wish - have changed with the prevailing wind. Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n, the Madrid president, yesterday undermined his argument that Ronaldo represented all-or-nothing for his club in the transfer market this summer when the Spanish champions sealed a \u00a310.3m deal for Rafael van der Vaart. The Dutch international midfielder has harboured an ambition to appear in La Liga on account of his Spanish mother and will be unveiled in the capital today, having agreed a five-year contract.  His arrival from Hamburg provides Real with an immediate remedy to the loss of Wesley Sneijder, another creative Dutchman, who could be out for three months after damaging knee ligaments in the Emirates Cup defeat by Arsenal. A renewed effort from Real to sign Ronaldo for a world-record transfer seemed inevitable the moment Sneijder was carried off on Sunday. Van der Vaart&apos;s arrival suggests not and that even Calder\u00f3n has lost confidence in his pursuit of United&apos;s No7. Not that Real have stopped flirting. As Michel Salgado said yesterday: &quot;We know Cristiano Ronaldo is an incredible player and we don&apos;t have a problem about him coming here. The gal\u00e1cticos are the past. I think the best of Real Madrid now is the group and the dressing room.  &quot;If he comes, he will excite the fans for sure. At the Bernab\u00e9u, the supporters are used to watching all the best players in the world and Cristiano Ronaldo is now one of the best players in the world.&quot;  Even that mantle, however, is no guarantee of success in a spat with Ferguson. Hello, Old Trafford How the returning Ronaldo might greet Sir Alex Ferguson today Ronaldo Hola, mister. I&apos;ve come back to rot in the standsFerguson Say hello to Louis Saha while you&apos;re up there, will youRonaldo Boss, you&apos;ll love this. Rio put me up to it.

The child, who is said to have closely resembled the missing girl, apparently spoke to an Amsterdam shop assistant, who alerted local police. Those officers contacted the Portuguese authorities. The file, made public on Monday, does not explain what action, if any, was taken by Portuguese officers.  Nor does it explain why police decided not to make public two strikingly similar efit images, compiled with the help of two people who were at the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz, from which Madeleine disappeared in May last year. Among the many reported eyewitness sightings from around the world at that time was that of Anna Stam, who gave a statement to Dutch police in which she said that she had spoken to a girl aged three or four who had entered her party shop. She said that the girl came into the shop in early May last year with a man and a woman and two other children. The man - who &quot;did not look like a nice person&quot; - may have been speaking Portuguese but the woman spoke in English and told Stam they had a small circus in France. Stam, 41, said she was at the back of the shop when the girl asked in English: &quot;Do you know where my mummy is?&quot; Stam replied that her mother was a little further back in the store but the child said: &quot;She is not my mummy. She is a stranger, she took me from my mummy.&quot; Stam said that when she asked the girl where she last saw her mother, she said: &quot;They took me from my holiday.&quot; Her statement added: &quot;I asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me. I even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say.&quot;  Stam said she thought the child looked &quot;very much like&quot; Madeleine apart from the colour of her hair, which was dark brown. The report was sent to the Portuguese authorities on June 18 last year but it is not clear from the Portuguese file whether any further action was taken. Stam could not immediately be contacted last night to elaborate on her statement. Clarence Mitchell, the McCanns&apos; spokesman, said the couple had not been made aware of the details of the reported Dutch sighting, nor been told what action, if any, the Portuguese police took. &quot;It is a disgrace that we have been kept in the dark about the details of this sighting, and perhaps many other sightings, for the last 15 months,&quot; he said. He added that the private detectives working for the McCanns will now make more inquiries in Amsterdam. With publication of the police files came disclosure of the existence of two efits, one compiled with the help of a British tourist, the second with the assistance of a British resident. Both men said that they had seen an individual acting suspiciously in the area shortly before Madeleine disappeared. Lawyers for Madeleine&apos;s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, are expected to ask why they were never published.

Shortly after the funeral, Brown started dreaming nightly of a small man with a very large head. Some weeks later, when sorting through his father&apos;s belongings, he discovered a book of songs by George Formby - and the identity of this mysterious nocturnal apparition. It was the beginning of an obsession with the 1930s entertainer that has transformed Brown&apos;s life, inspiring him to give up his day job as a Latin teacher in London, master the banjo ukulele (Formby&apos;s instrument of choice), and now to create a show about Formby for the Edinburgh Fringe. Learn to Play the Ukulele in Under an Hour (How George Formby Saved My Life) isn&apos;t simply a biographical play: it&apos;s also Brown&apos;s evangelical attempt to spread the joy of ukulele-playing. On entering the theatre, every audience member is given a ukulele; within five minutes we&apos;ve learned our first chord and are strumming along to the nursery rhyme Row Your Boat. By the end, everyone can play four chords and we&apos;re giving Britney Spears&apos; ... Baby One More Time everything we&apos;ve got. I&apos;ve played a bit of classical guitar before, and wanted to learn the ukulele for years - ever since I saw Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot at a formative age, shimmying her hips while playing one, apparently without missing a note. So I&apos;m in my element - despite the fact that, during the show, Brown reveals that Marilyn actually mimed the scene. He might have shattered one of my dreams, but he hasn&apos;t dimmed my enthusiasm. Four chords, I&apos;ve decided, are not enough: I want to know more. So it is that, the following morning, I meet with Brown and Donal Coonan, with whom he wrote and performs the show, for some extra tuition. We begin with a test. What do I remember of the chords we learned during the show? There was C, basic and jolly; A minor, which they describe as &quot;the saddest sound in the world&quot;; and two slightly trickier ones, F and G7, the latter dubbed &quot;the chord of perplexity&quot;. I&apos;ve remembered them all, so it&apos;s straight down to playing a breezy rendition of the Beatles&apos; When I&apos;m Sixty-Four.  I&apos;m astounded by how easy it seems - but that&apos;s the ukulele, renowned as the simplest instrument in the world to learn. Not that Coonan found it so: he first bought one six years ago on a whim in Amsterdam, but couldn&apos;t figure out any chords. Brown, who met Coonan in 2001 at auditions for the Oxford Revue (Brown had to play a king, Coonan his subject; neither was successful), has spent the past few months teaching his old university pal the Formby repertoire. Coonan now knows three songs by heart: it&apos;s enough for the show, but Brown says he&apos;s got to learn several more by August 24, when the duo are booked to appear at the birthday party of another Fringe performer and Formby admirer, Jim Bowen.  Brown isn&apos;t sure where his fascination with Formby comes from: he doesn&apos;t, for instance, remember his father being a fan, and thinks the songbook actually belonged to his uncle. And although he&apos;s impressed by Formby&apos;s dedication to entertaining soldiers during the second world war, and determination to perform to black audiences during a tour of segregated South Africa in the 1940s, he also admits that Formby &quot;wasn&apos;t a brilliant actor - he made 23 films, all of which are pretty bad&quot;. He points out that Formby&apos;s wife and manager, Beryl, was the brains of the partnership, while &quot;he was probably quite dim&quot;.  That hasn&apos;t stopped Brown from attempting to follow in Formby&apos;s footsteps, performing his cheeky songs about voyeuristic window-cleaners and naughty lingerie salesmen at charity events and old people&apos;s homes, with varying degrees of success. &quot;The first time Donal and I played together,&quot; he confesses, &quot;we practically got booed off the stage.&quot; There are no boos in Edinburgh: the audience are having too much fun tinkering with their ukuleles. Brown says that at pre-Edinburgh performances, several instruments went missing, as people either failed to realise that they were supposed to return them, or couldn&apos;t bear to part with their temporary toy. The duo have been so inspired by the positive reactions, they&apos;re looking at ways of changing the show to encourage more audience participation. The aim, says Brown, is to eradicate all scenes in which the audience are asked to pipe down, &quot;to get to a point where we never tell them to stop&quot;, so that every show has a unique, spontaneous, simultaneous soundtrack. In the meantime, there&apos;s 10 minutes left of my lesson, and I want to learn a few more ukulele tricks. First, Brown shows me a fancy little trill with which to finish a song, which requires switching rapidly from C to G7 and back to C. It&apos;s quite hard, but eventually I get the hang of it. Next up is a very fiddly chord: F#. I can just about handle that, too. Buoyed by false hope, Brown demonstrates the George Formby strum, something he hasn&apos;t even taught Coonan yet. It requires the rapid movement of fingers on the left hand, an odd rhythm pattern played with the right hand, and has me bamboozled. Still, if I can just learn to shimmy saucily without dropping the ukulele, I&apos;ll be a happy lady.", "sentences": ["Not that Coonan found it so: he first bought one six years ago on a whim in Amsterdam, but couldn&apos;t figure out any chords."], "title": "Edinburgh festival: And now for some Britney Spears!

Tests showed that personal information could be cloned and manipulated within an hour before being inserted into new chips, the Times reported. The paper said it had exposed &quot;security flaws&quot; in the passport system by asking a researcher to clone the chips on two British passports and implant digital images of Osama bin Laden and a suicide bomber. The altered chips were then passed as genuine by reader software used by the UN agency that sets the standards for such e-passports. The tests showed that bogus biometrics could be inserted in fake or blank passports, the Times alleged, saying the flaws also undermined assertions that 3,000 blank passports stolen last week could not be forged. The identity and passport service at the Home Office remained confident, however, that the British biometric passport was &quot;one of the most secure passports available&quot;, saying no one had been able to demonstrate they could modify or change information contained in a chip, and that if they did, it would be obvious to the reader.  A spokesman added: &quot;Continuing investment in biometric technology and enhanced security measures will help ensure that passport security is maintained now and in the future.&quot; The tests for the Times were conducted by Jeroen van Beek, a security researcher at Amsterdam university who can read, clone and alter microchips so they are accepted by the software recommended for use at airports by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Van Beek could not be contacted today, but the Times said he had used his own software, a publicly available programming code, a \u00a340 card reader and two \u00a310 radio frequency chips. Within an hour, he had cloned and altered chips so that they were ready to be planted in stolen or fake passports. A baby boy&apos;s passport chip was altered to contain an image of Bin Laden, and that of a 36-year-old woman was changed to hold a picture of Hiba Darghmeh, a Palestinian suicide bomber who killed three people in 2003. The identities had been chosen deliberately to demonstrate that neither van Beek nor the Times was trying to fake viable travel documents, the newspaper said.  Van Beek was quoted as saying: &quot;We&apos;re not claiming that terrorists will be able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow. But it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way.&quot; The Times said its tests also raised questions about the \u00a34bn identity card scheme, which relied on similar technology. The plan could open more opportunities for criminals to match real information about clients , including fingerprints and pictures, with stolen identity details.  An international system exists under which faked chips could be spotted at border points because they would not match key codes when checked against an international database. However, only 10 of the 45 countries with e-passports have signed up to the system, and only five are using it.  The Home Office says it will use the code directory from the end of this year, but the Times claims fakes from countries that do not share key codes could go undetected.", "sentences": ["A spokesman added: &quot;Continuing investment in biometric technology and enhanced security measures will help ensure that passport security is maintained now and in the future.&quot; The tests for the Times were conducted by Jeroen van Beek, a security researcher at Amsterdam university who can read, clone and alter microchips so they are accepted by the software recommended for use at airports by the International Civil Aviation Organisation."], "title": "Biometric passport chips 'can be cloned in an hour'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/06/news.terrorism", "tags": ["Technology", "Cybercrime", "World news", "Biometrics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-06T13:44:53Z", "article": "A Dutch shopworker who claimed to have seen Madeleine McCann in Amsterdam criticised Portuguese and British police today for failing to act on her information. Speaking in a television interview, Anna Stam accused police of being &quot;neglectful&quot; after she had reported the sighting at a party shop in Amsterdam. &quot;I think it&apos;s stupid \u2026 maybe they could have done something more at that time, and maybe now it&apos;s too late to find any clue,&quot; she said.  &quot;So I think it&apos;s very neglectful by the police - maybe not \u2026 the Dutch police but more the British or Portuguese police, because at that time I remember the police told me they were suspecting the parents themselves. &quot;I thought it was crazy to think that, but that&apos;s maybe why they didn&apos;t do something with it.&quot; The 41-year-old spoke out after it was revealed that after she reported the sighting in June last year, Portuguese detectives immediately filed the information away. The details emerged when Portuguese officials released 20,000 pages of information relating to the investigation. Some of the documents revealed that Stam had reported speaking with a young girl at Dam&apos;s party shop a few days after Madeleine vanished from her family&apos;s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz. The girl entered the shop early last May with a man, a woman and two other children, Stam said. When asked what her name was, the girl said &quot;Maddie&quot; and added: &quot;They took me from my holiday.&quot; The man, who &quot;did not look like a nice person&quot;, seemed to be speaking Portuguese, but the woman spoke English and told the shop worker the pair had a small circus in France. Stam said she had been at the back of the shop when the girl approached her and asked, in unaccented English: &quot;Do you know where my mummy is?&quot; On being told her mother was a little further back in the store, the child replied: &quot;She is not my mummy. She is a stranger \u2026 she took me from my mummy.&quot; Stam said she thought the girl looked &quot;very much like&quot; Madeleine apart from the colour of her hair. Today, in an interview with ITV news, she said it seemed that the girl was &quot;together with the family&quot; and was &quot;not crying or protesting to go with them, so I thought it was normal, that she belonged to the family&quot;. The McCanns have asked their team of private detectives to pursue Stam&apos;s claims. Clarence Mitchell, the family&apos;s spokesman, said it was &quot;tragic&quot; that the information had been released only now. &quot;If it was Madeleine, it was a disgrace that it was not passed on,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to know what happened with this.&quot; It emerged today that the dossier also contained a copy of a letter written by Kate McCann to the head of the Portuguese police team on the Madeleine case in which she asked to be kept informed about the investigation. In the letter, dated December 4 last year, McCann said she felt &quot;indescribable&quot; pain over Madeleine&apos;s disappearance.  It also called for an end to &quot;finger-pointing blame&quot; over Madeleine&apos;s disappearance.  The mother of three wrote that Madeleine was &quot;the most precious thing in our life&quot; and the period since she went missing had been &quot;the most difficult, sad and unbearable time that any parent could possibly imagine&quot;. She said she and her husband, Gerry, felt helpless in the face of accusations against them after they were named as arguidos - formal suspects - in the case in September, adding that the lack of communication between the police and the family was &quot;torture&quot;. &quot;I am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us (if possible include us) and to remember that we are Madeleine&apos;s parents and have needs,&quot; she wrote. Mitchell confirmed that McCann wrote to Paulo Rebelo after he took over the inquiry in October, but had received no response other than a formal notification that the letter would be placed in the police file. Rebelo was made head of the investigation after the removal of Goncalo Amaral, who criticised British police in a newspaper interview. An photograph taken from the air, also in the dossier, showed how two police sniffer dogs had picked up the same scent around the McCanns&apos; apartment block. The scent was picked up close to the tapas bar where they were eating at the time Madeleine went missing.  The photo revealed that both animals followed identical routes from the front of the McCanns&apos; apartment, going through a car park before turning left down a side alley onto a path between the flat and the restaurant.  Both animals then turned right into the main road before losing the scent at another car park a few yards further on.  The police report noted: &quot;The route they followed to the car park \u2026 was carried out without hesitations and in the most convincing way.&quot;  However, experts concluded that it was difficult to make a &quot;precise evaluation&quot; as to whether the dogs had definitely picked up Madeleine&apos;s scent.", "sentences": ["A Dutch shopworker who claimed to have seen Madeleine McCann in Amsterdam criticised Portuguese and British police today for failing to act on her information.", "Speaking in a television interview, Anna Stam accused police of being &quot;neglectful&quot; after she had reported the sighting at a party shop in Amsterdam."], "title": "Dutch shopworker condemns police over response to Madeleine McCann 'sighting'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/06/madeleinemccann.internationalcrime1", "tags": ["Madeleine McCann", "World news", "Portugal", "UK news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-06T23:01:00Z", "article": "A Dutch shopworker who reported a possible sighting of Madeleine McCann shortly after the child disappeared last year yesterday accused police of neglect for failing to follow up the matter.

NXP Semiconductors, the Philips spin-off that makes the system, lost a court battle to prevent the researchers from publishing. People might be able to use this information to ride for free, but the sky won&apos;t be falling. And the publication of this serious vulnerability actually makes us all safer in the long run. Here&apos;s the story. Every Oyster card has a radio-frequency identification chip that communicates with readers mounted on the ticket barrier. That chip, the &quot;Mifare Classic&quot; chip, is used in hundreds of other transport systems as well \u2014 Boston, Los Angeles, Brisbane, Oslo, Amsterdam, Taipei, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro \u2014 and as an access pass in thousands of companies, schools, hospitals, and government buildings around Britain and the rest of the world. The security of Mifare Classic is terrible. This is not an exaggeration; it&apos;s kindergarten cryptography. Anyone with any security experience would be embarrassed to put his name to the design. NXP attempted to deal with this embarrassment by keeping the design secret. The group that broke Mifare Classic is from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands. They demonstrated the attack by riding the Underground for free, and by breaking into a building. Their two papers (one is already online) will be published at two conferences this autumn. The second paper is the one that NXP sued over. They called disclosure of the attack &quot;irresponsible,&quot; warned that it will cause &quot;immense damages,&quot; and claimed that it &quot;will jeopardize the security of assets protected with systems incorporating the Mifare IC.&quot; The Dutch court would have none of it: &quot;Damage to NXP is not the result of the publication of the article but of the production and sale of a chip that appears to have shortcomings.&quot; Exactly right. More generally, the notion that secrecy supports security is inherently flawed. Whenever you see an organization claiming that design secrecy is necessary for security \u2014 in ID cards, in voting machines, in airport security \u2014 it invariably means that its security is lousy and it has no choice but to hide it. Any competent cryptographer would have designed Mifare&apos;s security with an open and public design. Secrecy is fragile. Mifare&apos;s security was based on the belief that no one would discover how it worked; that&apos;s why NXP had to muzzle the Dutch researchers. But that&apos;s just wrong. Reverse-engineering isn&apos;t hard. Other researchers had already exposed Mifare&apos;s lousy security. A Chinese company even sells a compatible chip. Is there any doubt that the bad guys already know about this, or will soon enough? Publication of this attack might be expensive for NXP and its customers, but it&apos;s good for security overall. Companies will only design security as good as their customers know to ask for. NXP&apos;s security was so bad because customers didn&apos;t know how to evaluate security: either they don&apos;t know what questions to ask, or didn&apos;t know enough to distrust the marketing answers they were given. This court ruling encourages companies to build security properly rather than relying on shoddy design and secrecy, and discourages them from promising security based on their ability to threaten researchers. It&apos;s unclear how this break will affect Transport for London. Cloning takes only a few seconds, and the thief only has to brush up against someone carrying a legitimate Oyster card. But it requires an RFID reader and a small piece of software which, while feasible for a techie, are too complicated for the average fare dodger. The police are likely to quickly arrest anyone who tries to sell cloned cards on any scale. TfL promises to turn off any cloned cards within 24 hours, but that will hurt the innocent victim who had his card cloned more than the thief.  The vulnerability is far more serious to the companies that use Mifare Classic as an access pass. It would be very interesting to know how NXP presented the system&apos;s security to them.  And while these attacks only pertain to the Mifare Classic chip, it makes me suspicious of the entire product line. NXP sells a more secure chip and has another on the way, but given the number of basic cryptography mistakes NXP made with Mifare Classic, one has to wonder whether the &quot;more secure&quot; versions will be sufficiently so. \u00b7 Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and author: schneier.com/blog", "sentences": ["That chip, the &quot;Mifare Classic&quot; chip, is used in hundreds of other transport systems as well \u2014 Boston, Los Angeles, Brisbane, Oslo, Amsterdam, Taipei, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro \u2014 and as an access pass in thousands of companies, schools, hospitals, and government buildings around Britain and the rest of the world."], "title": "Why hackers exposing security weaknesses make us safer ultimately", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/07/hacking.security", "tags": ["Hacking", "UK news", "Technology", "Data and computer security"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-07T00:50:05Z", "article": "May 21On the day of the Champions League final, Spanish tabloid Marca trumpets Ronaldo&apos;s impending arrival at Real on its front page May 24Ferguson raises hackles by taunting Real over their associations with former Spanish dictator General Franco. &quot;I read about Calderon making the great statement that slavery was abolished many, many years ago,&quot; says the United manager. &quot;Well, did they tell Franco that?

Taking place on August 9 in the at the catchily titled World Science Fiction Convention, Denvention 3, the prizes are big news in the SF community, but as far as I can make out from my own reading and a hunt through google, has garnered barely a mention in the British mainstream media.  To an extent, the comparative lack of coverage is fair enough. SF is far more of a niche interest - and one that is well able to support itself with its myriad of websites and intelligent fan writers. It still strikes me as a pity though. It&apos;s a shame that so much interesting writing should be so ghettoised and a real oversight to ignore so much native British talent. Most notably, two out of the five shortlisted novels are written by British writers: Charlie Stross&apos;s Halting State and Brasyl by Ian McDonald. Both have plenty to recommend them. Admittedly, a brief pr\u00e9cis of Halting State won&apos;t do much to convince outsiders that SF isn&apos;t primarily the domain of nerds. It&apos;s a 350-page exploration of the economics within the virtual worlds of computer games written in the second person. This interesting narrative device is &quot;a tip of the hat to the old infocom adventure games&quot;, according to the author, who also told me defiantly: &quot;There are a lot of computer-literate geeks out there, and not enough fiction being written for them.&quot; Even so, I enjoyed it. Admittedly, that&apos;s partly because I too am something of a nerd and those text-based role playing computer games blighted many rainy afternoons of my own childhood, invariably crashing just as I had helped Bilbo Baggins escape from a dark place after hours of banging in combinations of &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;NE,&quot; &quot;S&quot;, &quot;SW&quot; while carrying a short sword. Perhaps, therefore, I&apos;m in a dorkish minority in finding chapter openings like the following amusing: &quot;You are standing in the nave of a seventeenth century church, its intricately carved stone surfaces dimly illuminated by candles&quot; ; &quot;By daybreak on Monday you are no longer in Amsterdam or hungover, but you are still unemployed&quot;. But this isn&apos;t just a nerd novel. I&apos;m pretty certain that Stross&apos;s sharp and pleasingly cheeky humour has broader appeal, while the book is as notable for its depiction of Edinburgh as for I.T. matters. That&apos;s partly thanks to a similar facility to Irvine Welsh&apos;s when it comes to emphatic swearing and ripe dialect, but also because of Stross&apos;s ability to bring to life the beauty, brooding menace, and (as he himself puts it) &quot;downright weirdness of the city&quot;. As such Halting State could even be said to fit into the fine tradition of writers like James Hogg, Robert Louis Stevenson and Ian Rankin. It helped me enjoy a recent trip to the Scottish capital, anyway. Sadly, I wasn&apos;t able to enjoy Brasyl in situ, but this too is an effective evocation of place: namely a roughly contemporary approximation of Brasil, alongside future and 18th century versions of the country. It has its fair share of Comic Book Guy pleasing quantum mechanics and parallel universes, but its McDonald&apos;s extreme, psychotic take on reality TV and visionary writing, including most notably a Fitzcarraldo-esque floating of a cathedral down the Amazon that really makes it stand out, even if the prose occasionally gets on the wrong side of impenetrable. Competitive as both books are, they aren&apos;t shoo-ins. They&apos;re up against Michael Chabon&apos;s hugely successful (and already multiply award-winning) The Yiddish Policeman&apos;s Union for a start, as well as Hugo veteran Robert J Sawyer&apos;s Rollback and the immensely popular blogger John Scalzi&apos;s The Last Colony. But they aren&apos;t the only British contenders in the many and various Hugo categories. Other hotly tipped contenders include Ken Macleod in the short story category, Doctor Who script-writer Paul Cornell in the Best Dramatic Presentation category and David Langford for fan writing (alongside my personal favourite Cheryl Morgan). It will be more surprising if the Brits don&apos;t win at least one top prize - and there are few international competitions nowadays about which that can be written. Even if we&apos;re quite likely to perform dreadfully at the tainted Beijing Olympics, there&apos;s a good chance that the UK will take the honours at the admirably democratic Hugos and there&apos;s some pride to be found in that.", "sentences": ["Perhaps, therefore, I&apos;m in a dorkish minority in finding chapter openings like the following amusing: &quot;You are standing in the nave of a seventeenth century church, its intricately carved stone surfaces dimly illuminated by candles&quot; ; &quot;By daybreak on Monday you are no longer in Amsterdam or hungover, but you are still unemployed&quot;."], "title": "An international contest we can win", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/aug/07/aninternationalcontestweca", "tags": ["Books", "Hugo awards"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-07T12:13:01Z", "article": "     Adidas is kicking off the final stage of an international TV and press campaign to support its sponsorship of the Beijing Olympics ahead of tomorrow&apos;s opening ceremony for the 2008 games.

Not exactly brilliant weather for having a laugh. The clouds were still loitering last week as the world&apos;s biggest arts festival moved beyond the preview stage, but there were more than enough bright spells to keep spirits high. This is proving to be an excellent year for emerging comic talent, from stand-ups Josh Howie, Sarah Millican and Gerry Howell (who comperes a free show at the Phoenix) to ambitious young collectives such as Cowards. A few days spent touring the festival&apos;s more intimate spaces confirms the sense that a bold new generation of comedians is already stealing limelight from the more established acts. But it&apos;s a Fringe veteran who has made the strongest bid so far for the coveted if.comedy award. This is Andrew Maxwell&apos;s 14th year at Edinburgh and on the evidence of Supernatural, his brilliant show at the Pleasance, experiencing raw terror is the key to sharpening your comic edge. The title refers to an anecdote about a creepy London venue he visited at which the security guard discussed ghosts as if they were illegal immigrants - &apos;They come through the walls&apos; - but far more terrifying are Maxwell&apos;s encounters with audiences in his native Dublin and on either side of the sectarian divide in Belfast. &apos;You&apos;re a lovely size for a hostage,&apos; an inmate tells the diminutive comic as he gets ready for a gig inside a high-security wing of Dublin&apos;s notorious Mountjoy Prison. Pushing his luck even further, Maxwell goes on to perform for the UDA on the Shankill Road, having previously entertained the IRA on the Falls. He is careful to play down the macho element of these exploits, using them instead to deliver a series of acute social observations and some explosive pay-offs. There isn&apos;t a lazy gag in the entire set and Maxwell, on superb form, commands the audience&apos;s attention from start to finish. Another Irish comedian at the height of his powers is Ed Byrne but the scariest thing he&apos;s had to deal with in the last year was the prospect of getting married. You will see many edgier shows at this festival, but few that are as finely crafted as Different Class (Assembly Hall). Particularly gratifying is the recurring riff on how all of us - comedians included - embellish the stories we tell with the things we wish we&apos;d said in order to make ourselves look wittier than we actually are. Byrne covers a lot of ground with his rapid-fire delivery - class differences, DVD piracy warnings, the inherent non-scariness of Goths - and the results are consistently funny. It&apos;s no wonder this is selling out nightly at the Assembly. One of the most promising newcomers this year is 25-year-old Londoner Tom Allen with A Voyage Around My Mother (Gilded Ballroom Teviot), his first solo Edinburgh outing. The title is something of a shaggy dog, but it&apos;s the only shaggy thing about this immaculately groomed comic whose act is almost, but not quite, as polished as his manners. The show&apos;s centrepiece, the story of an attempted journey into his family&apos;s past, doesn&apos;t deliver the big denouement it promises. This is intentional and Allen weaves humour out of the anticlimax, although he can&apos;t dispel the sense of bathos entirely. There are some great moments, including a very funny reflection on the immortality of Facebook profiles. The standard of sketch-based comedy has been high this year. Audiences have been flocking to see Pappy&apos;s Fun Club and Idiots of Ants at the Pleasance - each of them a fast-moving, mildly surreal vehicle piloted by a quartet of young men - but if the smell of testosterone becomes too much to bear, Watson and Oliver (Pleasance Courtyard) are well worth catching. This is the duo&apos;s third show at Edinburgh and probably their most enjoyable to date, if you can overlook the occasional moments of &apos;out-of-character&apos; banter (an annoying facet of sketch comedy cleverly lampooned by Mould &amp; Arrowsmith in their show, also at the Pleasance). Look out for the inspired fight scene involving celebrated movie composers John Barry and John Williams. Stewart Lee has been taking a battering for his creaky historical comedy, Elizabeth and Raleigh, at Udderbelly&apos;s Pasture. So it&apos;s good to know that the Fringe stalwart, and one of the most vocal opponents of the new Edinburgh Comedy Festival, is on fine form over at The Stand. Scrambled Egg does not claim to be a major show: it is merely a sounding board for six 20-minute routines that Lee is preparing for an upcoming TV programme. The three routines he tested out on Tuesday were brimming with invention and humour, particularly the one in which he pays tribute to a comedian who has inspired him in a very unorthodox way. The absence of segues and a conventional ending is only grist to Lee&apos;s mill, and even the disconcertingly unfunny interlude in the middle of one of the routines - I&apos;m not saying what it is - has an unexpected comic pay-off. Three to see Glenn Wool: Goodbye Scars UnderbellyCanada&apos;s self-styled &apos;rock&apos;n&apos;roll comic&apos; has pieced together a blinder of a show out of the fragments of his recent divorce. Angry, opinionated and very, very funny.

I know it&apos;s very wrong of me, but my god (or whatever) wasn&apos;t it fabulous We&apos;d ostensibly popped round the Prof&apos;s so he could show us his pukka first edition of The Origin of Species (&apos;not just the most precious book in my library, but the most precious book in the library of our species ...&apos;), which was absolutely lovely and everything, but didn&apos;t tickle my selfish genes - my &apos;me-me-me!&apos; memes, even - quite as much as the sight of row upon row of lovely shelves with downlighters, and that gleaming polished wood floor, on to which the sunlight dappled its way through the huge bay window, past the red curtains, bouncing off the round table above which hung a surprisingly funky designer lampshade and ... well, it all had me whimpering with lust. If you missed it, trust me - this was one small piece of a house that is surely part of a proverbial Grand Design.  And while I hope Kevin McCloud may one day be persuaded to host a new C4 show along the lines of Through the Keyhole or MTV&apos;s Cribs, but with fewer soap stars and/or rappers, so that we may feast our green eyes on lots more posh celebrity gaffs to keep us going, albeit enviously, through the looming negative-equity years, it was with regret that we left chez Dawkins to visit the office of Craig Venter, a man who may have mapped the human genome and shored up the theory of evolution but is disappointingly uninterested in making stylish statement with his workplace interiors. And yes, reader, I too am sorry that God made me so incredibly shallow.  On the subject of which, I don&apos;t understand why subscribing to the theory of evolution rules out the existence of a god. Is that so very dim of me? What if the theory of evolution was part of some mischievous Deity&apos;s masterplan? Or am I somehow missing the point? Either way, it&apos;s August and instead of being on Chesil beach searching for a pretty ammonite for my mantelpiece, I&apos;ve been naturally selected to be stuck in front of the telly, therefore it behoves me to ask bloody stupid questions if I want to.  Dawkins topped and tailed the first in this sprauncy three-parter to celebrate the bicentenary of Darwin&apos;s birth by deigning to spend quality time with a classroom of kids who were a bit &apos;like, whatever&apos; about natural selection. Dawkins may have described it as &apos;a fact, backed by undeniable evidence&apos; but since when did the teenage species let a mere fact get in the way of their gut instinct that adults are basically wrong about everything - even, like, science and stuff?  This lot appeared to enjoy their fossil-hunt but it didn&apos;t stop them believing in God - &apos;I&apos;ll still say my prayers,&apos; said one of them, smiling, with a smuggy sort of shrug. I know, I know, that Dawkins - such a know-all, eh? Mind you, I can see why he might be slightly worked up about God stuff - try googling the words &apos;Origin of mankind&apos; and you&apos;ll find yourself sent straight to bonkers Creationist Hell, which is depressing.  However, some things don&apos;t change. The world&apos;s oldest profession, for example, doesn&apos;t appear to have evolved very much over the past four-million odd years, since, presumably, that lady ape in the Garden of Eden first gave it away for an apple. (That&apos;s the story isn&apos;t it? No? Really? Are you sure?) In C4&apos;s cheerful The WI Guide to Brothels the redoubtable Jean and Shirley from the Hampshire branch of the Women&apos;s Institute were looking at ways to improve the lot of &apos;working girls&apos; by exploring global &apos;best practice&apos; with the help of presenter Nicky Taylor, who herself trod a fine line between collusion and exploitation. While Jean and Shirley were hard at work they were also oblivious, I think, to the fact that Nicky was their pimp.  It worked rather brilliantly. Taylor has made a name for herself by being exceptionally unvain in front of a camera - a few years ago she made a film about being a single mother-of-three looking for love, and has since explored binge-drinking, drug-taking and anti-ageing treatments, always putting herself in the middle of the frame. She&apos;s a refreshingly unusual presence on TV - a middle-aged non-size-zero mum who combines the sisterly warmth of the sofa-bound daytime presenter with a kind of knowing faux-gaucheness that somehow distracts people from the fact that she&apos;s a bit of a Louis(e) Theroux.  When you combined Taylor with the excellent Jean and Shirley, who were delightfully unfazed by (almost) everything they discovered in an Amsterdam brothel and &apos;bunny ranch&apos; in Nevada, then the results were bound to be entertaining. So much so that, in fact, the rather serious message at the heart of the film - which is that decriminalising British brothels is not only desirable but pretty much essential - was in danger of being lost amid such priceless moments as Jean asking a Dutch sex-shop employee if he could &apos;give me some information about the &quot;ass midget&quot;.&apos; (He did, and when Jean adopted a too-much-information expression, he politely apologised).  Anyway, while Jean and Shirley flew long-haul in order to get to grips with their subject, Taylor explored the industry closer to home, working as a maid inside a knocking shop situated in an Essex business park. The hypocrisy of the law was brilliantly demonstrated at the brothel run by a madame known as &apos;Dagenham Donna&apos; whose premises&apos; panic buttons were kindly installed by the local police and who happily pays VAT, but when invited by the Inland revenue to register her business as &apos;a massage parlour&apos; declined on the grounds that, well, it&apos;s a brothel, isn&apos;t it?  This wasn&apos;t a film that concerned itself with the whys and wherefores of prostitution itself, taking the continued existence of the Profession as a given, but it was concerned that a young student who goes on the game to fund her crack habit, like Sarah, whom Nicky Taylor met on the kerb of a Southampton industrial estate, should have somewhere safer and more salubrious in which to earn her living, and that&apos;s just common sense.  Via a consciousness-raising WI-branded mobile brothel (a camper van with a sticker on the side), Jean and Shirley managed to persuade the ladies of the Hampshire WI to sign their petition and delivered it to No 10, where it will presumably remain at the bottom of Gordon Brown&apos;s in-tray for ... ooh, I dunno how long, exactly, though I&apos;m thinking along the lines of &apos;ever&apos;.  The rest of us learned a lot, though, not least from &apos;Airforce Amy&apos;, the top earner at a Nevada brothel whose PG demonstration of her XXX-rated &apos;world-famous upside-down blow-job - it knocks their socks off!&apos; elicited from Jean a fervent &apos;I should think it does! I&apos;ll try that when I get home!&apos;, at which one&apos;s mind, and various other bits, duly boggled.  If there is a god knocking around Manchester&apos;s Moss Side, last week he looked a lot like a young bloke with a beard who drove a Lotus and was accessorised by a very fat chequebook.  C4&apos;s The Secret Millionaire is a format to warm your cockles, tug your heartstrings and leave you snivelling happily over the credits. It&apos;s absolutely shameless (and in this edition, at least, Shameless) in evoking a Pavlov&apos;s Dogs-style emotional response to a set of stimuli: out comes the chequebook, down come the tears, bish-bash-bosh, job done, ta very much. In my more cynical moments I get almost as sneery as I do teary when telly goes all touchy-feely, but I must have been a bit soft this week.  Though his modest suburban kitchen didn&apos;t offer a clue (it was about a quarter of the size of Dawkins&apos;s library), 30-year-old Benamor is worth an alleged \u00a377 million, which he earned by offering loans to people who can&apos;t get them elsewhere. I&apos;m not saying he&apos;s a shark, exactly, but he&apos;s clearly a bit of a business piranha.  So it wasn&apos;t the ritual dishing-of-the-dosh-to-the-undeniably-deserving (but, I suspect, increasingly clued-up) punters that moved me most (50K to the saintly elderly couple who take in troubled young men I&apos;d cross the road to avoid, 36K to a project teaching kids permanently excluded from school, another 50K to a small local charity, Mothers Against Violence) but the fact that James finally located his own unselfish gene, offering work experience to some of the kids he met and setting up a volunteer programme among his employees. His reward will not only be in all his good reviews, but in heaven, obviously. Fuel and his money: Dragons pay up Having all the entrepreneurial nous of, well, a TV critic, I rarely question the Dragons&apos; judgment over potential investments (Dragons&apos; Den, BBC2), but last week I was very surprised by their enthusiasm for a widgety-thing that stops diesel tanks being filled with petrol.  Mike wanted a whopping 250K for his &apos;retro-fitted misfuelling prevention device&apos;, and probably deserved it just for the description, and verily the Dragons coughed up. On a recent holiday in France I hired a car that had been helpfully fitted with its own &apos;retro-fitted misfuelling prevention device&apos; - a sticker on the gas cap printed with the word &apos;diesel&apos;. Not only was it entirely successful but I doubt if it had called for a quarter of a million quid&apos;s worth of investment.  Anyway, Dragons, how about the revolutionary design concept I came up with over a second bottle of wine sometime in 1989 - the &apos;soft bath&apos; that moulds to the shape of your body!

Diaby&apos;s thigh injury is more serious than was first thought and his absence, coupled with Alex Song&apos;s unavailability due to his participation with Cameroon at the Olympic Games, leaves Wenger stretched. He has lost Lassana Diarra, Mathieu Flamini and Gilberto Silva from the squad that started last season and as he prepares for the first leg of the Champions League qualifier against Steve McClaren&apos;s FC Twente in the Netherlands on Wednesday, his established options extend no further than Cesc F\u00e1bregas, who has played only 84 minutes this pre-season, and Denilson. At the Amsterdam tournament over the weekend, when Arsenal beat Ajax 3-2 and drew 1-1 with Sevilla, Wenger gave opportunities in central midfield to the new signing Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere and Mark Randall. There is also concern over Samir Nasri, his other major summer signing, who can play across the midfield. The France international did not travel to Amsterdam because of a knee complaint and is a doubt for Wednesday. Tomas Rosicky completes Wenger&apos;s troubles in midfield. He is a long-term casualty and will not play until next month at the earliest.  &quot;I think Diaby will be out for about a month, so we will have to work on some things which I saw on Friday night, when F\u00e1bregas and Denilson played together against Ajax,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;It worked well with them. You need a run of games to see if the partnership will work, you cannot say after just one match but I am confident that it will.&quot; Diaby has endured wretched luck with injury since his \u00a32m arrival from Auxerre in January 2006. In May of that year he suffered a broken and dislocated ankle against Sunderland and there have been other setbacks. Wenger has said he was planning to start him alongside F\u00e1bregas last season only for injury to intervene. Wenger gave Flamini a chance and he built an irresistible case for continued inclusion.  It is now Denilson who stands to benefit, although great responsibility will fall on F\u00e1bregas, who only returned to the team against Ajax after an extended break following his involvement in Spain&apos;s victorious Euro 2008 campaign.  &quot;You cannot say Cesc will be at his best [on Wednesday] but he will be fit enough because, looking at his reaction [after the Ajax game], he does not look too bad,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;To win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you. At 21, he already has a lot of experience. He is an intelligent boy but I would not like to put too much pressure on him.&quot; Wenger admits his squad is &quot;one body short,&quot; and he says he cannot rule out a move for Aston Villa&apos;s Gareth Barry or Liverpool&apos;s Xabi Alonso because he is not close to signing any one target. He has also inquired about Gokhan Inler, the Udinese and Switzerland midfielder. &quot;I have money to spend,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;My target is always to spend the right money on the right player, therefore the timing on your buy is also important.

I would look ridiculous.&quot; Well, not ridiculous, I counter, but you would certainly look less chic and enviably coiffed than currently. The 39-year-old is angry enough that from the autumn, Parisian cyclists will be required to wear fluorescent jackets. &quot;They only cost a couple of euros but they make anyone who dresses well - such as me - look absurd. That yucky yellow - I&apos;ve got nothing to match it in my wardrobe. What am I going to do?&quot; But what about the danger of your brains spilling out of your head after being knocked over by one of the French capital&apos;s aggressive drivers? Isn&apos;t ridiculousness a small price to pay? I remind Portehault that it was nearly on this spot, outside the BHV department store on the Rue de Rivoli, in 1980 that the life of one of France&apos;s great penseurs, Roland Barthes, was brought to an end when he was run over by a van. &quot;I pay a lot of attention to the traffic,&quot; replies Portehault. &quot;I&apos;m very careful when I cycle. So, no, I don&apos;t think looking ridiculous is worth it.&quot;  It&apos;s worth pointing out that it&apos;s not only Parisian women who worry about their hairdos being mangled by helmets. A young man chaining his bicycle to a lamppost, who declines to give me his name, says: &quot;I&apos;ve spent ages gelling my hair. I&apos;m not going to ruin all that work, thanks very much.&quot; I find Marco Simioni, 45, a Paris-based architect and artist who originally hails from Vicenza, poised to ride off on a hired cycle. &quot;I&apos;ve only been cycling for four months and I try to be very careful, but it&apos;s true I run a risk not using a helmet. It&apos;s a risk I&apos;m prepared to take.&quot; I&apos;ve come to Paris to find out why there is such a difference between French and British cyclists when it comes to wearing helmets. A few years ago, when I worked in Paris for the Guardian, I always wore a helmet when I cycled through the Marais to my office near the Op\u00e9ra Garnier and looked in disdain at the flowing locks of my more hirsute fellow cyclists as they cheated death and looked glamorous. Now, thanks to mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb&apos;s bicycle rental scheme, V\u00e9lib, which was introduced just over a year ago, there are more Parisian locks flying in the wind than ever. In France there is a slang phrase &quot;C&apos;est relou&quot;, which translates as &quot;It&apos;s boring.&quot; &quot;C&apos;est relou de porter un casque,&quot; several cyclists told me. It&apos;s boring to wear a cycle helmet. But not just boring: ugly, unstylish, fundamentally un-French. &quot;There is a great cultural difference between the English and the French,&quot; says Anne Portehault. &quot;We are very, very independent and very rebellious. This is the home of liberty, after all.&quot; Portehault, who rides horses in the morning and works in an American law office in the afternoon, doesn&apos;t use the sturdy V\u00e9lib bikes that can be hired from ranks one finds every 300m in Paris. Instead, she favours a venerable yellow number dating from the 1960s, which used to belong to her sister. &quot;It works but it looks rubbish. So no one&apos;s going to steal it.&quot; I&apos;m not sure that Gallic rebelliousness tells the whole story of why, if you cross the Channel, helmet-wearing cyclists become much rarer. Perhaps, and this is just a theory, the British are more risk-averse than continentals. Indeed, the difference is not just between Britons and continental Europeans, but between many anglophone countries and others. Cycle helmets are common in the UK, the US, New Zealand and Australia. But if you go to some of the cities where cycling has a prouder history than in Britain - cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin or Shanghai - you will find very few cycle helmets.  Of course, it&apos;s unfair to over-generalise. On a nearby side street, I find a Parisian cyclist wearing not only a helmet, but a fluorescent jacket and sensible gloves. Why, I ask 35-year-old Laurent Marin, do you not bend your knee to Paris&apos;s prevailing sartorial strictures for cyclists? &quot;A few years ago I was cycling at the Porte de la Villette when I saw a motorcyclist was run over by a car. It was horrible. I rang my wife and said: &apos;I&apos;m going to be late because I&apos;m going to buy a helmet.&apos; Now I won&apos;t let my wife or my children go cycling without helmets.&quot; Courier Felix Nizard, 20, tells me that he wears a cycle helmet his friend gave him. It seems several sizes too big, I say. &quot;Yes, but it looks kind of cool with the advertising all over it,&quot; he retorts. &quot;I feel happier wearing it now with all the V\u00e9libbers around. They are making the city more dangerous.&quot; The number of cycle journeys has grown exponentially in Paris since the introduction of the V\u00e9lib scheme, and many of the inexperienced users do indeed &quot;cycle like idiots&quot;, as Marin says. That said, there have only been three reported cases of V\u00e9libbers being killed. On France&apos;s bicycling blogs, this is a hot issue. One blogger, a man who styles himself Ludovic Bu, wrote recently: &quot;The figures are clear: three deaths in a year and 24m journeys on V\u00e9lib bicycles. That amounts to a 0.0000125% probability of killing yourself while using a V\u00e9lib bicycle.&quot; But he adds that in Paris last year, 53% of those who died or were injured on Paris streets were motorcyclists, 22% pedestrians, drivers of four-wheeled vehicles 18% and cyclists only 7%. &quot;Thus, one can well see that it is less dangerous to travel on a bicycle than on a motorbike, on foot or by car.&quot; I&apos;m not at all sure these figures warrant the inference that cycling in Paris is safe, but that doesn&apos;t matter: such rhetoric contributes to a blithe attitude on the part of Parisian cyclists towards sustaining death or serious injury. It makes them less likely to even consider whether wearing a helmet would be worthwhile. Delan\u00f6e&apos;s aim, according to many Parisians I spoke to, is to make Paris more like Amsterdam, where cycling is such a venerable and popular mode of transport that cyclists ride without helmets with a confidence that actually has some foundation. One Dutch idea that both the British and French authorities might consider introducing is the law of &quot;strict liability&quot; whereby, in any collision between a cycle and a car, the motorist is deemed to be responsible. This makes motorists much more wary. And what about the woonerf, a street or group of streets where pedestrians and cyclists have legal priority over motorists, and where motorised traffic is restricted to a speed limit of &quot;walking pace&quot;? In Germany, they have similar zones called Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich, where motorised speed limits are restricted to 7km/h. If only Paris&apos;s Rue de Rivoli or, say, London&apos;s Embankment became woonerven or Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich tomorrow, then I might consider leaving my helmet at home. But they aren&apos;t, so I won&apos;t. Matt Seaton, the Guardian&apos;s former cycling columnist and author of On Your Bike!: The Complete Guide to Cycling, distinguishes sharply between cycling in continental northern Europe and elsewhere. &quot;In northern Europe, especially in countries such as Holland and Denmark, there is much more of a consensus that bicycles have priority. In Britain, it&apos;s much more of a war of all against all. France is somewhere in between. In Britain our road environment is much more of a free market and that may make cyclists ride more quickly and aggressively than they do in the rest of Europe.&quot;  It is also worth pointing out that in Britain we tend not to ride the sit-up-and-beg bicycles common in Holland; we ride mountain bikes and racing cycles that, you might well think, facilitate aggressive cycling. I once saw a cyclist respond to being abused by pedestrians for jumping a zebra crossing by leaping off his bike waving a D-lock like a mace. There is a medieval flavour to London&apos;s cycle scene. In that road environment, British cyclists dress up like extras from Rollerball or Blade Runner, almost as if they are going to war and expecting serious injury. The cycle helmet is part of the uniform.  But is wearing a helmet actually going to save one from injury? This is a vexed issue among cyclists. The fact that London&apos;s tousle-haired Tory mayor Boris Johnson now eschews a cycle helmet has focused the debate. &quot;It&apos;s a very bad example for the leader of a capital city to set,&quot; said Simon Turner, a 41-year-old cyclist who suffered permanent brain injuries as a result of falling from his bicycle in Richmond Park. &quot;He&apos;s saying, &apos;Don&apos;t worry, take the risk.&apos;&quot;  &quot;In my efforts to do the right thing,&quot; Johnson replied in a newspaper column, &quot;I have ended up giving offence to both opposing factions. As soon as I started to wear a helmet , I was denounced as a wimp. As soon as I was pictured not wearing a helmet, I was attacked for &apos;sending out the wrong signal&apos;.&quot; Cyclists, he argued, should have the right to choose &quot;hatless, sun-blessed, windswept liberty&quot; or &quot; helmeted security&quot;. What would happen if Boris&apos;s brains were spilled, say, at the cycle lights next to Islington Central Library on Holloway Road near the mayor&apos;s home? Would cyclists pull up to his twitching, prone form, solemnly remove their helmets and say, &quot;Told you so&quot;? The issue was recently aired in the London Evening Standard, where columnist Dr Mark Porter defended Johnson&apos;s decision to cycle helmetless on the grounds that in over 20 years in medicine he had never had to treat a cyclist with a life-threatening head injury. &quot;Indeed, the Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation estimates that the average cyclist would have to pedal the roads for more than 3,000 years to suffer a serious head injury, let alone one that would be mitigated by a cycle helmet,&quot; wrote Porter. &quot;Research suggests that the mere donning of protective gear such as helmets encourages cyclists to take more risks on the road, and therefore, paradoxically, increase their risk of serious injury.&quot; Porter added that he was happy for his children to cycle without helmets. This column provoked a letter from Dr Andrew Curran, consultant paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey hospital. &quot;The probability of having an accident resulting in a serious head injury which could be mitigated by a helmet is mercifully low: there are many kinds of high-impact crashes where a helmet, or any form of body protection, would not save you. But the issue is that if an unhelmeted child is involved in a non-fatal crash resulting in a serious head injury, there is a 50 to 70% chance it will result in a serious cognitive deficit . . . It seems sensible that, just as we immunise children against serious diseases they are very unlikely to catch, we ensure they take precautions against the possibility of head injuries, however rare. The blase attitude of Boris Johnson and cycle campaigners on this point surprises me.&quot; The rise in cycle helmet use in the past quarter of a century suggests that Johnson is swimming against the tide. From the mid-80s onwards, a steadily increasing proportion of cyclists has worn helmets. The Department for Transport found in 2006 that cycle helmet-wearing had risen from 28.2% on major roads in 2004 to 30.7% in 2006, while on minor roads the figures were 9.6% and 13.8%. The total number of deaths of cyclists in the UK has been falling almost steadily since 1934, when there were 1,536 cyclist deaths. In 2007, there were 136. No one, however, has yet demonstrated that the rise in helmet use has made any contribution to that decline. Indeed, there is a statistic that associates a rise in helmet use with an increased risk of cyclists suffering  serious head injuries. When cycle helmets were made compulsory in Australia the number of people cycling fell by a third, and although the number of serious head injuries fell, too, it only fell by 11%. So, despite a large rise in Australia in helmet use, the risk of head injury among those who continued to cycle actually rose. Of course, one can&apos;t infer from this that cycle helmets cause serious head injuries, but the statistical association of a rise in both helmet use and in head injuries is embarrassing for those who advocate helmets. What is a bicycle helmet supposed to do? The short answer is that it is supposed to reduce the risk of both skull and, more importantly, brain injuries caused by the brain jolting around inside the skull as the result of collision. According to the DfT&apos;s paper Bicycle Helmets: A Review of Effectiveness, &quot;While simple fractures to the skull can heal, brain injuries, unlike those to other body regions, do not and can lead to long-term consequences. &quot;A bicycle helmet is supposed to perform three functions, namely: &quot;reduce the deceleration of the skull; spread the area over which the forces of impact apply; and prevent direct impact between the skull and impacting object.&quot; The DfT paper concludes: &quot;There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists.&quot; How are they supposed to do that? According to the DfT: &quot;These three functions can be achieved by combining the properties of the soft, crushable material [usually polystyrene] that is incorporated into helmets, usually referred to as the liner . . . and the outer surface of the helmet, usually called the shell.&quot; Historically, helmets had hard shells but now the tendency is for there to be no shell at all or a very thin shell. The blogosphere, however, seethes with sceptics who argue that bicycle helmets do not work when they are struck by fast-moving vehicles or when a cycle helmet hits a kerb or road at speed. Some argue that they may produce a false sense of security and a cavalier attitude to risk. &quot;Their design-intended strength is equivalent to a impact speed of about 12.5mph,&quot; writes cycling blogger Patrick Herring. &quot;They were never intended for collisions with cars. They&apos;re not a cycle-equivalent of motorbike crash helmets (and you can&apos;t wear one of those because your brain would boil). They work by the outer shell keeping the polystyrene in place whilst it absorbs the deceleration by being crushed. Counter-intuitively, if the shell breaks in the initial contact the total energy absorbed is a lot less: a broken helmet is one that didn&apos;t work.&quot; This, he says, means that above about 12.5mph the helmet has little effect; certainly it won&apos;t make a 30mph crash feel as if it happened at 17.5mph.  One psychological study, meanwhile, suggests that helmets make cyclists more, not less, vulnerable. Two years ago, Dr Ian Walker, a travel psychologist at the University of Bath, had his bicycle fitted with a special sensor and then went off riding, sometimes wearing a helmet, sometimes not, and sometimes wearing a wig intended to make him look like a woman. It is, incidentally, marvellous that a) there is such a thing as a travel psychologist and b) that they get to do such fun-sounding research. The sensor measured the proximity of passing traffic. When Walker rode bareheaded, cars gave him a wider berth than if he was wearing a helmet. They gave, on average, an extra 85mm. Dr Walker concluded that this was because his dearth of proper kit indicated a lack of cycling competence that might result in wobbling, unannounced 45-degree turns, unscheduled wheelies etc. Helmetless, he looked more vulnerable. When he wore a helmet, motorists passed closer. On two occasions they passed so close that they hit him. &quot;One of the main findings,&quot; says Dr Walker, &quot;was that a behaviour intended to reduce risk (putting on a bicycle helmet) might paradoxically increase one&apos;s overall level of risk because drivers react to its presence by changing their behaviour.&quot; But it&apos;s what Dr Walker did next that I find particularly suggestive. He cycled about wearing a black wig that made him look - at least to his satisfaction - like a woman from the rear. He found that motorists gave him a wider berth than normal, which he ascribed to a gender effect: motorists are more considerate of women rather than men cyclists. Of course, there is another possibility, namely that Dr Walker was so poor a female impersonator that motorists, possibly out of solidarity with real women, or conceivably because they thought he looked barmy, steered clear. I haven&apos;t seen the photos of the experiment, so I can&apos;t be sure. What I find interesting is that this research suggests that women cyclists with more hair than is fair (or men cyclists impersonating such women) are less likely to be run over than mugs like me who wear cycle helmets. Which brings us back to Anne Portehault.  I forgot to tell her that there is a new, putatively stylish cycling helmet cover devised to &quot;encourage females to cycle&quot;. The &quot;cycle head dress&quot; is essentially a hat that you can put over your helmet to make yourself look chic. Have a look at their range at hi1-designs.com.  Portehault probably wouldn&apos;t have liked the cycle head dress. After all, Parisiennes like her have no need of helmets or helmet covers, and they have research from Bath University to support their lifestyle choices. There she goes now, cycling down the Rue de Rivoli, one of Paris&apos;s more terrifying one-way boulevards, wind in her hair, as chic as can be as the photographer takes her picture. You&apos;ll have to excuse me for feeling more than a little jealous. If only I had more hair and was a woman, I think as she rides off towards the Palais de Louvre, I might feel safe without a helmet as I cycled. Or maybe I should get a wig.

With poems from the 1960s such as this, Mahmoud Darwish, who has died in a Texas hospital aged 67 of complications following open-heart surgery, did as much as anyone to forge a Palestinian national consciousness, and especially after the six-day war of June 1967. His poems have been taught in schools throughout the Arab world and set to music; some of his lines have become part of the fabric of modern Arabic culture. Darwish was born in the village of Birwa, east of Acre. His parents were from middle-ranking peasant families. Both were preoccupied with work on their land and Mahmoud was effectively brought up by his grandfather. When he was six, Israeli armed forces assaulted the village and Mahmoud fled with his family to Lebanon, living first in Jezzin and then in Damour.  When, the following year, the family returned to their occupied homeland, their village had been obliterated: two settlements had been erected on the land, and they settled in Deir al-Asad in Galilee. There were no books in Darwish&apos;s own home and his first exposure to poetry was through listening to an itinerant singer on the run from the Israeli army. He was encouraged to write poetry by an elder brother. Israeli Arabs lived under military rule from 1948 to 1986. They were curbed in their movements and in any political activity. As a child, Darwish grew up aware that as far as those in control were concerned he, his family and his fellow Palestinians were second-class citizens. Yet they were still expected to join in Israeli state celebrations. While at school, he wrote a poem for an anniversary of the foundation of the state. The poem was an outcry from an Arab boy to a Jewish boy. &quot;I don&apos;t remember the poem,&quot; he recalled many years later, &quot;but I remember the idea of it; you can play in the sun as you please, and have your toys, but I can&apos;t. You have a house, and I have none. You have celebrations, but I have none. Why can&apos;t we play together?&quot; He recalls being summoned to see the military governor, who threatened him: &quot;If you go on writing such poetry, I&apos;ll stop your father working in the quarry.&quot; But relations with individual Jewish Israelis varied. Some he liked, including at least one of his teachers, some he loathed. Relationships with Jewish girls were easier than with girls from the more conservative Arab families. At his school, contemporaries remember him being very good in Hebrew. Israeli Palestinian culture was cut off from mainstream Arab developments. Arab poets who did impress him were the Iraqis Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. Exciting innovations such as the Beirut group that clustered round the magazine al-Shi&apos;r and the prosodic and thematic innovations of the Syrian poets Adonis (Ali Ahmad Said Asbar) and Nizar Kabbani did not reach the beleaguered Palestinians directly. Instead, much of Darwish&apos;s early reading of the poetry of the world outside Palestine was through the medium of Hebrew. Through Hebrew translations he got to know the work of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Pablo Neruda. He also became influenced by Hebrew literature from the Torah to the modern poet Yehuda Amichai. His first poetry symbolised the Palestinian resistance to Israeli rule. His first volumes, Leaves of the Olive Tree (1964), A Lover from Palestine (1966) and End of the Night (1967), were published in Israel. During this time Darwish was a member of the Israeli Communist party, Rakah, and edited the Arabic edition of the party&apos;s newspaper, Al-Ittihad. Israeli Palestinians were restricted in any expression of nationalist feeling. Darwish went to prison several times and was frequently under house arrest. His earliest poetry followed classical forms, but, from the mid-1960s, it became populist and direct. He used imagery that he could relate intimately to Palestinian villagers. He wrote of olive groves and orchards, the rocks and plants, basil and thyme. These early poems have a staccato effect, like verbal hand-grenades. In spite of an apparent simplicity, his short poems have several levels of meaning. There is a sense of anger, outrage and injustice, notably in the celebrated Identity Card, in the voice of an Arab man giving his identity number: Write down at the top of the first page: I do not hate people.I steal from no one.HoweverIf I am hungryI will eat the flesh of my usurper.Beware beware of my hungerAnd of my anger. But his poetry also contained irony and a universal humanity. For Darwish the issue of Palestine became a prism for an internationalist feeling. The land and history of Palestine was a summation of millennia, with influences from Canaanites, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Ottoman Turks and British. Throughout all this has survived a core identity of Palestine. He was able to see the Israeli soldier as a victim of circumstances like himself. He expresses the bureaucratic absurdities of an oppressive military occupation. Darwish left Israel in 1971, to the disappointment of many Palestinians, and studied at Moscow University. After a brief period in Cairo he went to Beirut and held a number of jobs with the Palestine Research Centre. He remained in Beirut during the first part of the civil war and left with Yasser Arafat and the PLO in 1982. He moved on to Tunis and Paris, and became editor-in-chief of the influential literary review Al-Karmel. Although he became a member of the PLO executive committee in 1987 and helped to draft the Palestinian Declaration of Statehood, he tried to keep away from factionalism. &quot;I am a poet with a particular perspective on reality,&quot; he said. His literary work was changing. He wrote short stories and developed a style of writing poems that was a mixture of observation, humanity and irony. He argued that poetry was easier to write than prose. But the poetry continued inspired by incidents or relationships. There is often an optimism against all the odds in his works of the 1980s: Streets encircle usAs we walk among the bombs.Are you used to death?I&apos;m used to life and to endless desire.Do you know the dead?I know the ones in love. During his Paris years Darwish wrote Memory for Forgetfulness, a memoir of Beirut under the saturation Israeli bombing of 1982 which has been translated into English. A poem in prose, it is a medley of wit and rage, with reflections on violence and exile.  His later work became more mystical and less particularly concerned with Palestine. Often it was preoccupied with human mortality. He was careless of his own health and suffered heart attacks in 1984 and in early 1998. Darwish resigned from the PLO executive committee over the 1993 Oslo Agreements between Israel and the PLO, which he saw as a &quot;risky accord&quot;. He was able to return to Israel to see his aged mother in 1995. The Israeli authorities also gave him permission for an unlimited stay in the self-ruling parts of the Palestinian West Bank, and he spent his last years in Ramallah and Amman, the capital of Jordan.  In 2000 the Israeli ministry of education proposed to introduce his works into the school curriculum, but met strong opposition from rightwing protesters. The then prime minister, Ehud Barak, said the country was not ready.  Darwish&apos;s work has been translated into Hebrew and, in July 2007, Darwish returned to Israel on a visit and gave a reading of his poetry to 2,000 people in Haifa. He deplored the Hamas victory in Gaza the previous month. &quot;We have triumphed,&apos; he observed with grim irony. &quot;Gaza has won its independence from the West Bank. One people now have two states, two prisons who don&apos;t greet each other. We are dressed in executioners&apos; clothes.&quot; Over the years Darwish received many honours. He was given the Soviet Union&apos;s Lotus prize in 1969, and the Lenin peace prize in 1983. He was president of the Union of Palestinian Writers. Married and divorced twice, he had no children; his first wife was the Syrian writer Rana Kabbani, who elegantly translated some of his poetry into English. Margaret Obank writes: Mahmoud was a completely secular person, rather philosophical, an avid reader, elegant in his dress, and supremely modest in his opinion of himself. He liked to be alone, but would always be ready to speak on the telephone.  While I had been reading his poems since the early 1970s, I got to know him through my husband, the Iraqi author Samuel Shimon. Mahmoud supported Banipal, the literary magazine we founded in 1998, and took pride both in issues of the journal and the many dialogues we helpled to promote.  It presents work by Arab authors and poets in English for the first time. When we rang Mahmoud three months ago about doing a special issue on him, his reaction was: &quot;Do you think I deserve that? If you think I do, then I like the idea.&quot; Now it will be a tribute to him.  We were with Mahmoud when he was awarded the Prince Claus Fund of principal prize in Amsterdam in 2004, the theme being asylum and migration. His acceptance speech was both powerful and thoughtful: &quot;A person can only be born in one place. However, he may die several times elsewhere: in the exiles and prisons, and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare. Poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion: how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again, and use words to construct a better world, a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace ... with life.&quot; \u00b7 Mahmoud Darwish, poet, born March 15 1941; died August 9 2008", "sentences": ["We were with Mahmoud when he was awarded the Prince Claus Fund of principal prize in Amsterdam in 2004, the theme being asylum and migration."], "title": "Obituary: Mahmoud Darwish", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/11/poetry.israelandthepalestinians", "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Culture", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-11T23:01:00Z", "article": "There was a twinkle in Robin Van Persie&apos;s eye as he considered who might be the English equivalent of FC Twente, the Dutch club that stand between his Arsenal team and the group stage of the Champions League. &quot;Tottenham Hotspur,&quot; he replied with a laugh, following a slight pause. The alarm bells rang in the Arsenal press office, as they began to envisage the worst case scenario headlines. Yet Van Persie recognises a club on the up and while Tottenham&apos;s stated aim of playing in Europe&apos;s elite competition remains as yet unfulfilled, Twente sent shock waves around the continent at the end of last season when they qualified for it for the first time. After a fourth-placed finish in the Eredivisie, they entered the play-offs to determine the Netherlands&apos; second Champions League entrant and having beaten NAC Breda in the semi-finals, they recorded a famous 2-1 aggregate victory over Ajax in the final. The scenes after the 0-0 draw in Amsterdam in the second leg have taken on a timeless quality for their supporters. Few of them would have chosen Arsenal when the draw for the final qualifying round was made. &quot;They were a bit disappointed because of the name of Arsenal,&quot; said Van Persie, ahead of the first leg of the tie, which will be played tomorrow night in Arnhem as Twente&apos;s stadium in Enschede is being enlarged from 13,000 to 24,240 and the work is not quite finished. &quot;I think they would have wanted a team in eastern Europe or something.&quot; Twente, who are now managed by Steve McClaren, lost two of their best players over the summer\u2014 the midfielders Orlando Engelaar to Schalke and Karim El Ahmadi to Feyenoord \u2014 while Blaise Nkufo, their leading scorer for each of the past five seasons, is suspended for both legs of the tie. But Van Persie, the Holland international, has seen enough of Twente to know that Arsenal&apos;s progress cannot be taken for granted. The club, a force in the early 1970s \u2014they lost the 1975 Uefa Cup final to Borussia Monchengladbach \u2014 have come on strongly again, particularly in the last two seasons under the coach Fred Rutten, who has also left for Schalke. The chairman Joop Munsterman predicts that turnover this season will reach 29.5m euros, hardly Premier League level but almost double that of last season while there is ambition and spirit in McClaren&apos;s squad. The new midfield signings Theo Janssen and Cheick Tiote are well while the 19-year-old striker Marko Arnautovic bristles with promise. &quot;I know Twente quite well as I have Dutch satellite TV at home,&quot; said Van Persie. &quot;They had a great year last year and although they&apos;ve lost Engelaar and El Ahmadi, who were the playmakers, they got one good player back from Vitesse Arnhem\u201a \u00c4\u00ec Janssen \u00c4\u00ec, so they are still in good shape with a good team.&quot; McClaren&apos;s arrival is regarded as a coup, and not only in Enschede, which has a population of 160,000 and is located by the border with Germany. &quot;The people in Holland are really happy with McClaren and they are almost proud to have him, because it is quite a strange move to come from England manager to Twente,&quot; said Van Persie. &quot;Holland is very proud, especially Twente and they are all saying that they really like his style of coaching.&quot; The last time that Arsenal faced a McClaren team, they routed Middlesbrough 7-0 in January 2006. &quot;I remember that but normally we had a tough time against his sides,&quot; added Van Persie. &quot;We are ready for this game.

It is one of the many reasons Arsenal have to be grateful to him. The manager&apos;s obstinacy was triumphant in 2004 when the club took the Premiership title with an unbeaten record. &quot;Since I have been in football there has been a basic question,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you pretty or are you efficient? It&apos;s as if you have got to choose.&quot; He had indeed transcended all that but no one rises above the uncooperative realities of football for long. Arsenal&apos;s single trophy since then came from the undeserved win over Manchester United after a shoot-out in the 2005 FA Cup final. Wenger, rightly, is under no pressure at all. Who could have felt disgruntled, for instance, when a preposterously young line-up almost beat Sevilla in the Amsterdam tournament on Saturday? It was fun to see the La Liga team becoming flustered by the indignity of lagging to juvenile opponents until a late equaliser. Factors of that nature, though, will not put Arsenal in contention with Manchester United and Chelsea for the Premier League title. The top four in the table looks predictable and so too does the fact that it is divided into two compartments. The connecting door is locked. Unless something unexpected happens Arsenal and Liverpool will have one another for company. Rafael Ben\u00edtez is more given to rattling the door handle than Wenger and his exasperation is laid bare by the Gareth Barry imbroglio. Liverpool&apos;s owners, having apparently missed the Aston Villa deadline to buy Gareth Barry, seem to be behaving as if that was a lucky escape. Completion of the transfer now will probably depend on raising some of the \u00a318m funds through the sale of, say, Andriy Voronin and Jermaine Pennant.  You can nearly make out the film of sweat on Ben\u00edtez&apos;s brow. He will need to be inspired in his future work in the transfer market. Robbie Keane alone cannot close last season&apos;s 11-point gap on the champions United and the manager will have to pray that a buy such as Andrea Dossena brings impetus. Liverpool&apos;s difficulties are conventional, Arsenal&apos;s are distinctive. They stand fifth in the Deloitte Money League of the world&apos;s richest clubs, with a turnover of \u00a3177m. Wenger himself agrees that Arsenal will be very affluent in due course. First, however, they have to come through the angst of the contemporary property developer. It was inspired of Arsenal to build the \u00a3357m Emirates stadium but the associated move into housebuilding must have been made queasily. In Ars\u00e8nal: the Making of a Modern Superclub, Alex Fynn, with co-author Kevin Whitcher, has produced a shrewd and well-informed book about the challenges and terrors of a club still in the throes of transformation. Arsenal are waiting to see how many people who have put down deposits on the 711 apartments at Highbury Square pull out of completing the purchase. Buyers, of course, are not keen to write off the money they have already spent and the properties continue to have an allure not on offer at orthodox sites. If Arsenal do make a great profit and rid themselves of debt, Wenger may be in a quandary. His record fee, of around \u00a311m for Sylvain Wiltord, was paid eight years ago. While the manager alludes to budgetary constraints at Arsenal, he does not seem incensed by them. His own temperament tends towards meagre outlay. Last summer he even made a profit in the transfer market and no one supposes that a tyrannical board demanded that. There is determination and a magnificent arrogance in Wenger&apos;s belief that Arsenal should prosper only on his own thrifty terms. Last season&apos;s league table suggests they were not very far behind United and Chelsea, but it had been evident from February&apos;s ugly draw with Birmingham, when Eduardo da Silva was so badly injured, that they would fall short. Arsenal, like Liverpool, could contend forcefully for the European Cup. Nonetheless, the financial restrictions make it improbable that Wenger&apos;s team will take the Premier League and if cash ever does flow freely one doubts whether the ascetic Frenchman&apos;s pride will allow him to spend it so gaudily in the transfer market as Manchester United or Chelsea.", "sentences": ["Who could have felt disgruntled, for instance, when a preposterously young line-up almost beat Sevilla in the Amsterdam tournament on Saturday?"], "title": "Why Wenger and Ben\u00edtez no longer pose a threat to top two", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/12/premierleague.arsenal", "tags": ["Premier League", "Arsenal", "Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2008-09"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-11T23:01:00Z", "article": "It came as no surprise to Dick Hobbs, professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, when he made Patsy Kensit cry. An expert on violence and organised crime, he had been asked to contribute to an edition of the BBC programme &quot;Who do You Think You Are?&quot;, due to be broadcast tomorrow, in which the actress explores her family background. (Last night, he appeared on BBC4&apos;s The Real Life on Mars, arguing that 70s cops really were as bad as depicted in the John Simm TV series.) &quot;All I knew about Patsy Kensit&apos;s dad was that he was a grass,&quot; says Hobbs. After some research, including talking to former London gang members &quot;Mad&quot; Frankie Fraser and Eddie Richardson, he knew more, but none of it was likely to please Kensit. The extent of Jimmy &quot;The Dip&quot; Kensit&apos;s involvement in crime was shocking, says Hobbs. Not only was he a well-known pickpocket and close associate of the Krays - indeed he made Reggie Kray his son&apos;s godfather - but he had also been arrested a couple of times simply for being &quot;an incorrigible rogue&quot;. Then there was the fact that he&apos;d given evidence against the Richardson brothers in order to get himself out of prison. Being a grass isn&apos;t quite as big a deal as people like to think, says Hobbs. He claims the idea that some kind of moral code exists among villains, which means they don&apos;t inform on each other, is a myth. In fact, many of the big organised crime cases, from the Brinks Mat gold heist to the activities of the Kray twins, were solved because people were willing to inform. Everyone knew Jimmy Kensit had snitched, but he didn&apos;t suffer any consequences.  The night-time economy Underlying much of Hobbs&apos;s work, which has examined gun crime, bouncers, drug trafficking and the night-time economy, is the view that villainy is not necessarily that big a deal either. Just as villains&apos; approach to informing on their mates has often been based more on practicality than morality, so has their approach to crime. &quot;I want to get away from the idea that crime is an extraordinary activity,&quot; he says. &quot;It is normal, and a part of everyday life.&quot; This is a view formed after a childhood spent in the East End of London, and an academic career dedicated to talking to others about their lives in a big city. Few of us can say we have taken no part in the criminal marketplace, whether buying cheap drink or a knocked-off DVD, he claims, and for most city dwellers, crime is something they take for granted, which they negotiate as victims, perpetrators, and often as both. It comes some way down their list of concerns, below educating their children and keeping their jobs. Where it does worry them, it is usually in terms of vandalism or noise rather than drug-running or guns. And for a significant minority it can offer meaning, status and money in their pockets. &quot;If you are a victim of crime it is a terrible thing,&quot; says Hobbs. &quot;But crime can be quite life enhancing for people. It gives them a buzz. A little bit of the day is theirs. If they have a mundane job and have nicked something from work or taken a packet of drugs, it gives them the feeling they have some control over their lives. They enjoy it; otherwise, they wouldn&apos;t do it.&quot; This is not to say the nature of crime and violence has remained constant. When he began his research 20 years ago, anyone carrying a gun was a specialist. &quot;He was known as a shooter, and these weren&apos;t random acts,&quot; he says. &quot;It was someone who would use weapons as part of their job.&quot; If guns were used in a vendetta, it demonstrated a major step up - a step across the line - whereas now, he says, guns are more likely to be used simply because there are more of them around. The kind of violent feuds once associated only with professional criminals now seem to be taking place between children, he says - something he blames not only on the greater availability of weapons, but on a youth culture, which, dominated by consumerism and by the US, encourages young people to carry them. But, according to Hobbs, what has really transformed the nature of crime since he began studying it is the dominance of drugs and the instant and enormous fortunes they offer. Drugs, he says, have taken away any notion of criminal specialisation. &quot;Anyone can have a whip-round, take a cheap flight to Amsterdam and become an international drugs smuggler. Hijacking a lorry, robbing a bank, breaking a safe, or whatever, is impossible because of the levels of knowledge you&apos;d need. Now, it&apos;s a complete and utter free for all. It&apos;s very democratic.&quot; Where once villains needed to come from the right criminal family and to serve an apprenticeship of several years to learn their safe-breaking or bank-robbing craft, the underworld has become more diffuse, fluid and multicultural, he says. While criminals have always had a streak of entrepreneurialism, crime itself has now gone from a craft to an international business. And just as city analysts seem to take in their stride the risk of getting things wrong, so the smugglers make realistic assessments about the risks of getting caught - which, on the whole, are not that high. Hobbs has just completed a piece of work for the Home Office in which he interviewed 230 drug smugglers in jail. One of the things he found was that prison wasn&apos;t much of a deterrent; they accepted the possibility of going to jail as part of the game. The thing that really worried them was having their assets taken away. &quot;The idea of coming out having spent 10 to 12 years inside - having no car, no money, family gone, back to the bare bones. That seemed to worry them far more.&quot; Messenger boy The business side of crime has always interested Hobbs, although he&apos;s never been anywhere near business himself. The son of a warehouseman and dressmaker, he left school at 17 with two O-levels and started work as a messenger boy for a publishing company, based in the building directly opposite his current office at the LSE. This was in 1968, and he says he used to watch the students preparing for global revolution while he was busy running errands. After getting further qualifications at night school, between clerical and manual jobs, including working as a dustman and roadsweeper, he taught in London primary schools, before taking a masters in sociology at the LSE, where he discovered a fascination for the sociology of crime. This was followed by a PhD at Surrey on the entrepreneurial nature of criminals and police officers in the East End, a study that became a prize-winning book Doing Business. It examined wheeling and dealing in the East End - minor fiddles carried out in warehouses, dodgy early morning deals before a van driver started his day job, CID information trades with villains. &quot;Some of it was legal and some wasn&apos;t and, in the end, it didn&apos;t matter what was and what wasn&apos;t,&quot; he says. The same attitude informs his drug-smuggler research. Carried out in collaboration with economists, it looks at drug dealing as an economic activity, studying questions involving pricing and transport, &quot;trying to break away from all the moral outrage that accompanies so much writing about drugs&quot;. It is not the first time that Hobbs has been consulted by the government, although he is cynical about how much it will listen. As a professor at Durham University in the late 1990s, he carried out an extensive piece of research on alcohol and the night-time economy, which included a couple of his research colleagues working as bouncers. Like many experts, he advised that 24-hour pub opening would not solve Britain&apos;s alcohol problems. &quot;All the civil servants and MPs we spoke to agreed with us, but they went ahead anyway,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it&apos;s for economic reasons. We are so reliant now on pubs and clubs in city centres that if you take that away, what&apos;s going to be there?&quot; Many of the villains who have been Hobbs&apos;s contacts over the years have themselves fallen victim to drink, often bewildered by the changes that have taken place in their world over the past couple of decades - the loss of those armed robber fraternities in which, even if the rules were regularly broken, at least they were rules they understood. But in this nostalgia for their heyday, they differ little from their pensioner contemporaries in the legitimate world, says Hobbs. He also hesitates to say that the younger generation is any more prone to violence than it ever was. When he was growing up, a friend bled to death after being struck with a glass in a pub known as the Stabbers Arms because of the number of stabbings that took place. &quot;Violence was part of our lives and you became quite savvy about dealing with it,&quot; he says.  Yet he concedes that &quot;there are certain communities that are undoubtedly racked with fear concerning children killing children&quot;, and that in these places the issue of escalating violence is a real one. &quot;We need to be very very careful about how we approach it,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of the media approach to both gun and knife crime has been surreptitiously racist.&quot; While the first reaction when a young person is killed is to relate it to gangs, often it has been the result some other kind of feud - to do with family or jealousy, he says. &quot;That&apos;s what we need to be careful about, because the whole gang thing has been turning it into a racist conversation rather than a conversation about changes in youth and changes in the way youth view the world.&quot; Personally, he feels in little danger because he no longer lives in the communities where violence is happening.

In his Daily Telegraph column he bets that Heathrow&apos;s third runway will never get built. It is almost a lament, rather than the cue for a street party involving tens of thousands of west Londoners. Like his backtracking over the dropping of the environmentally disastrous Thames Gateway bridge in east London, Johnson is now making statements which could be interpreted as an indictment of the government for delaying its decision on Heathrow \u2013 somewhat surprising given his promise to lobby against the runway.  The mayor puts forward a case for London needing another airport, seemingly based on the fact that he was delayed in the luggage hall at Gatwick, after his family&apos;s short-haul holiday flight to Europe. Johnson also rails against the &quot;Pyongyang-style&quot; announcements he was forced to endure during the long wait for his bags at a carousel. When he used this expression to refer to Ken Livingstone&apos;s administration, we assumed it was a pseudo-witty comment on the former mayor&apos;s ideological leanings. Unless he feels that the British Airports Authority has become a degenerated workers&apos; state, it now appears that &quot;Pyongyang-style&quot; just means &quot;Boris not like it&quot;. It&apos;s obvious that London&apos;s airports are operating at full capacity during the holiday season, and delays such as the one experienced by Johnson and his family are certainly not uncommon, but the solution lies not in building another airport, but in developing a managed approach to flights. The obvious solution is to have a dramatic reduction in the number of short-haul flights from London&apos;s airports, making extra airport capacity unnecessary. Six of the top 10 destinations flown from London&apos;s airports are short-haul (Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris, Manchester and Frankfurt), and these flights represent 14% of all London airport traffic. All of these places could potentially be accessed using a high-speed rail link, such as those being rapidly expanded across the continent. The mayor, displaying a breathtaking lack of knowledge about flying and its environmental drawbacks, believes the long-term solution is building an &quot;eco-friendly&quot; airport over the bird sanctuaries of the Thames estuary. While this anecdote-turned-policy-paper might be a short-term vote winner with west London residents concerned about aircraft noise, it fails to address the fundamental flaws of the aviation industry or the reality that flying can never be environmentally friendly. It cannot be overlooked that aviation already accounts for 34% of London&apos;s CO2 emissions and is growing faster than any other source. A flight to Paris currently emits around 10 times as much CO2 as a train journey, even without the 25% reductions in emissions promised by Eurostar for 2012.  Back in February, when just a mayoral contender, Johnson joined Ken Livingstone, Brian Paddick and the Greens&apos; Si\u00e2n Berry in a full-page newspaper advert, paid for by Greenpeace, proclaiming his principled opposition to a third runway at Heathrow. Then, less than a week later, Johnson&apos;s concern for the climate change impact of new runways seemed to have disappeared, with a proposal to replace Heathrow with a whole new airport in the Thames estuary. We have already had broken commitments on hydrogen vehicles, so why not airport expansion? It appears that the mayor is no longer &quot;fighting&quot; Heathrow expansion on behalf of Londoners, just betting against it. The air pollution and noise suffered by most of London is a far lower priority than ensuring Boris can jet off and jet back in comfort. If Johnson is serious about being a green mayor he needs to swiftly rethink his policy on aviation and recognise that short-haul flights cannot be made &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; and therefore cannot be justified. I do wonder how many other political figures would respond to a minor personal baggage complication by demanding a whole new airport.

And when Emma Pooley followed up Nicole Cooke&apos;s triumph by becoming the first British woman to take an Olympic time-trial medal on the circuit around the Ju Yong Pass on Wednesday, she was representing a national tradition going back more than a century. Time trialling is the solitary vice, the loneliest of sports. The time triallist is the man or woman glimpsed at seven o&apos;clock on a Sunday morning somewhere in what is left of rural Britain, grinding along a rain-swept dual carriageway, hunched down into a stiff headwind and occasionally drenched by a burst of spray from the wheels of a car passing too close. Glamour has nothing to do with a sport that is all about getting up before dawn and preparing to race against yourself. And, of course, against the unforgiving clock. &quot;I do prefer time trialling,&quot; Pooley said after stepping down from the podium with her silver medal around her neck. &quot;There are fewer uncertainties. You ride your own race, and somehow it&apos;s less aggressive - you can&apos;t affect anyone else&apos;s race and they can&apos;t affect yours. You go into a time trial and you wish the other riders well and you just concentrate on doing the best you can.&quot; Like Lance Armstrong, Pooley started her competitive career as a triathlete, which involves running, swimming and riding a bike similar to the aerodynamic models now used by time triallists. The powers of endurance developed by triathletes can compensate for a lack of the handling skills developed by those who race bikes from an early age. Pooley, for example, is clearly happier riding alone than in a jostling, crowding bunch. For more than half a century, time trialling was the only form of cycle racing permitted on the highways of Britain. While France, Italy, Spain and the other countries of continental Europe were developing a taste for colourful evening races around city streets or epic events that rolled from town to town, British road cyclists were confined, by order of their own governing body, to races against the clock. As long ago as the 1890s, after a horse and carriage had been spooked by a group of cyclists racing up the Great North Road, the National Cyclists&apos; Union - the ancestor of British Cycling - banned the sort of open-road contests in which all the riders start at once, fearing that police disapproval would lead to a ban on all their activities. Even time trialling became a semi-clandestine activity, the courses identified only by codes to evade official scrutiny. Tradition dies so hard that they still are. In the early years of the modern Games, when cycling events were held for men only, the road race was sometimes run as a time trial and produced two silver medals for British riders: the first for Freddie Grubb of Surrey in Stockholm in 1912 and another for Norwood Paragon&apos;s Frank Southall in Amsterdam in 1928. Then the time trial disappeared from the Olympic schedule, and not until 1996 in Atlanta did Britain win another medal against the clock when Chris Boardman took third place in a race won by Miguel Indurain. That was also the year in which a women&apos;s time trial was held for the first time. Had it been included in the Games between the 1950s and the 1970s, there is no knowing how many times it might have been won by Beryl Burton, Pooley&apos;s most illustrious predecessor. A formidable Yorkshirewoman who worked in a market garden and raced as an amateur, Burton was Britain&apos;s best all-round time triallist for 25 years in a row. She died in 1996, during a training ride, aged 58. Pooley studied at Cambridge before embarking on her current doctoral research in Zurich. &quot;You don&apos;t get many professional cyclists who&apos;re studying for PhDs,&quot; Dave Brailsford, British Cycling&apos;s performance director, said yesterday. &quot;She&apos;s one of the nicest girls and she&apos;s also one of the most intelligent, and she&apos;s put that to good use in Beijing.&quot; It was Brailsford who invited Pooley to join the team in time for the world championships in Madrid two years ago, and who told her that the Beijing time-trial course would be made to measure for her climbing skills. &quot;It&apos;s a very peculiar course,&quot; he said. &quot;The climbs aren&apos;t consistent. The gradient changes all the time so you can&apos;t get into one steady rhythm.&quot; He also ensured that she would have the necessary time off for preparation. &quot;I spoke to the tutors on her PhD course and managed to get some time off to really concentrate on her cycling, and her talent&apos;s really shone through since she&apos;s done that. She&apos;s one of the world&apos;s best climbers and she used that to great effect. If you map out her performances, they&apos;ve got closer and closer to world-class level and now she&apos;s one of the best riders in the world, both on the road and in the time trials.&quot; The road leading up to the Great Wall of China is a very long way, in every sense, from those on which British time triallists are accustomed to pursuing their lonely obsession. But as the diminutive Pooley flew up the climbs she had the company of the yanzi, the little swallow-like birds that swoop around these hills.

Their Sketch Show in PowerPoint is full of witty leftfield ideas, such as one of the pair acting a science geek delivering a mute presentation in disco moves. But on the afternoon in question it failed to get many laughs. With five audience members barely cracking a smile, I couldn&apos;t help feeling sorry for the duo, and wondering if the show would have been more enjoyable for all concerned with a full house. Rumour has it that the average audience size on the Fringe is six people, so many acts will be going through this painful experience on a daily basis. Would it be helpful to set an Edinburgh fringe quorum? When should the show not go on? A genre as interactive as comedy, with the ever-present threat of being picked on by the comic, will obviously result in audiences being more comfortable laughing en masse. Fewer than ten people and the room clams up. The flow of many shows is built around audience laughter and interaction; without it, even the funniest material can feel grounded and flat. Often the comic needs to ride that wave for their material to gather pace and momentum. Of course some people won&apos;t laugh even when they are in a packed audience, at a show they find hilarious, something Mark Watson alluded to in his show this year, telling of how people often come up to him, tell him they loved his show, thought it was funny, and then inform him they didn&apos;t actually laugh at it. He went on to intimate that it&apos;s a certain type of person who behaves like this - the inhibited, middle-class Guardian reader. I realised with guilt that he was talking about me. Although I found most of the 20 comedy shows I&apos;ve seen in Edinburgh this year funny, only a couple have had me genuinely laughing out loud. I had all but consigned my black heart to Mark Watson&apos;s band of soulless killjoys when I saw Hans Teeuwen. My colleague Leo Benedictus summed up Teeuwen&apos;s Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective show perfectly when he twittered: &quot;I love it when you don&apos;t know why you are laughing&quot;. On the night I saw Teeuwen, laughter was coming from different areas of the audience at different times. People were laughing individually at whatever tickled them personally. It was the shocked hysterical laughter of surprise that they were even laughing in the first place. The room was peppered with individual giggling fits of indeterminate length, rather than the zombified pack laugh you hear from audiences on TV quiz shows or at more conventional standup shows. So should we cut comics some slack when they have a small audience, or should funny material stand on its own two feet? And how much responsibility do we have as audience members to be open to comedy and let that laughter out, no matter how small our numbers?

He is, arguably, the most influential musician from the region since the second world war, his artistry matched only by his gambling, fighting, carousing, and refusal to recognise any rule or regulation. All of which inflamed his legend. Born in southern Serbia, \u008aaban had his childhood interrupted by the war, in which Nazi and Croatian fascist Ustashe troops massacred many of Yugoslavia&apos;s Gypsies, and \u008aaban&apos;s earliest memories were of fleeing and hiding. His parents&apos; deaths forced him to live on his wits. Conscripted into the postwar Yugoslav army, the illiterate 18-year-old went awol to search for his girlfriend, and was sentenced to five years. He spent a year on Goli Otok (Barren Island), a prison in the Adriatic. It was in jail, he said later, that he learned to read and write.  Once freed, he sang at weddings and bars around Ni\u0161 and, in 1964, released his first record, Pelno Me Sam (I Am Imprisoned). The song&apos;s protagonist begs his mother to get him out of jail so that he can see his daughter marry. His imagination and lyricism immediately established him as a leader in nove Romske pesme (new Romani song). Across the 1960s and 70s \u008aaban&apos;s status to Balkan Roma would be comparable to that of James Brown&apos;s to African-Americans: a musician who gave his community a voice. He would sing in Romani, &quot;hey, another beating from the police,&quot; his superb tenor voice conveying the Gypsy experience like no other. He incorporated diverse influences - including jazz and mariachi - into his music and won popularity across Yugoslavia and beyond, singing for President Tito and Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. Recognition failed to tame \u008aaban - a popular tale has him driving a new Mercedes into Ni\u0161&apos;s mahala (Gypsy ghetto) and taking part in a poker game. The following morning, he leaves having lost car, jewellery and suit. \u008aaban was banned from Yugoslav television in the 1980s for failing to fulfil bookings. Yet his talent never diminished and, in 1987, he acted in the noted Yugoslav film Guardian Angel, and sang the theme song. Serbian film director Emir Kusturica&apos;s Cannes-award-winning films Time of the Gypsies (1988) and Underground (1995) found soundtrack composer Goran Bregovic using \u008aaban compositions, and he sang the theme song to Kusturica&apos;s Black Cat, White Cat (1997). He also acted in the Macedonian film Gipsy Magic (1997). During the civil war, \u008aaban disappeared; rumours suggested he had died in poverty, but he was in Ni\u0161, breeding pigeons, releasing home recordings and avoiding the Milo\u0161evic regime. Bosnian producer Dragi Sestic tracked him down in 2000 and convinced him to record an album, A Gypsy Legend, released on the Dutch label World Connection, that won international acclaim. In 2001, I interviewed him in Amsterdam. The ensuing European tour was cancelled after \u008aaban began missing dates, preferring to sing in German Yugoslav restaurants for tips than at concert halls. In 2003, I travelled to Ni\u0161to interview him again, for my book Princes Amongst Men: Journeys With Gypsy Musicians. Where in Amsterdam he had been restless, at home he was engaging, boasting of releasing 20 albums and writing 760 songs, and claiming he had perfect pitch as a child. &quot;Life inspires me to write songs,&quot; \u008aaban explained, &quot;my inspiration is life because I am a great consumer of life!&quot; While \u008aaban&apos;s face bore knife scars from his wild days, he exuded a warm nature.  \u008aaban&apos;s popularity survived the disintegration of Yugoslavia and he enjoyed a 2005 Balkan-wide hit as guest singer with the Croatian band Cubismo. A Serbian documentary, titled \u008aaban, chronicled his final years. Its soundtrack, again produced by Dragi Sestic, has just been released in Britain. His sole British performance, in May 2006 at London&apos;s Mean Fiddler, enabled German producer Henry Ernst to record \u008aaban as part of his Gypsy Queens and Kings project. I will never forget watching him, seated on the bed of a tiny London hotel room, wreathed in cigarette smoke coughing, but singing beautifully.  He is survived by his wife Misa, four daughters and many grandchildren.  \u00b7 \u008aaban Bajramovi\u0107, singer-songwriter, born April 16 1936; died June 8 2008", "sentences": ["In 2001, I interviewed him in Amsterdam.", "Where in Amsterdam he had been restless, at home he was engaging, boasting of releasing 20 albums and writing 760 songs, and claiming he had perfect pitch as a child."], "title": "Obituary: \u008aaban Bajramovi\u0107", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/15/serbia", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Serbia", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-14T23:01:00Z", "article": "One of the great thrills of any Olympics is learning about other countries&apos; esoteric sporting traditions. The Finns have a cultural affinity with the javelin, the Germans embrace dressage and if you put a pistol in the hand of a Slovak you will never go far wrong. The Mexicans, meanwhile, like nothing better than a good walk. It is fashionable to mock race-walking but those who are tempted should remember that a former International Olympic Committee president, the American Avery Brundage, once claimed that &quot;the heel-and-toe walk is the nearest a man can come to experiencing the pangs of childbirth&quot;. There will now be a short pause while you mutter: &quot;And that&apos;s just when they are watching it.&quot; While we are on the topic of pregnancy and pedestrianism, I should also say that the 1992 20km Olympic gold medallist, Daniel Plaza of Spain, came up with what may be the most bizarre excuse ever for a failed drug test. This is a family newspaper, so I won&apos;t tell you what it was, but if you type &quot;Daniel Plaza nandrolone&quot; into a search engine you will find out soon enough. Twelve years ago it looked like Ecuador might be starting a walking tradition, after Jefferson Perez took gold in the 20km event in Atlanta. It was Ecuador&apos;s first Olympic gold. The government awarded Perez a pension and produced a commemorative stamp in his honour. Ecuadorean businesses queued up to shower gifts upon him. One gave him a car, another a house, and a third a lifetime&apos;s supply of yoghurt. Yet despite the prospect of fame, fortune and unlimited access to soured milk products, no Ecuadoreans have yet followed in Perez&apos;s wiggle-bottomed wake.  The original Ecuadorean hero will compete in his last Olympics tomorrow. He has an outside chance of a medal, but his efforts have yet to create a tradition. For as Ivor Cutler wisely observed: &quot;It takes more than one set of feet to make a footpath.&quot; Even when they are moving as fast as Perez&apos;s.  There has been much talk of tradition from poolside commentators in Beijing. Hungarian women apparently have &quot;a good tradition in the backstroke&quot;, while Japan has a &quot;tradition in the breaststroke that stretches all the way back to 1928 and the city of Amsterdam&quot;. No nation has been revealed to have an historic affiliation with the butterfly. My guess is that this is because doing butterfly is just too horrible a thing for most sane people to contemplate. Even David Icke would probably balk at it. It is hard to imagine how butterfly was invented, really. It seems unlikely to me that anyone who had been plunged unexpectedly into deep water ever thought: &quot;In order to save myself from drowning, I think I&apos;ll press my ankles and knees together and whirr my arms around as if bowling wrist spinners with both hands simultaneously.&quot; Try doing it while sitting in a chair. See, it&apos;s just not comfortable, is it? And now try it while firing a hosepipe up your nose. No wonder that even such masters of the butterfly as Michael &quot;The Albatross&quot; Gross spend the entire event looking like they are locked in a bitter struggle to drown themselves.  I suspect that whoever invented the butterfly had their doubts about it, too. After all, why name a swimming stroke after an insect that can drown in a puddle of spilled lager? It&apos;s like bringing out a new model of car and calling it the Ford Rustbucket. British male swimmers apparently have &quot;a proud tradition in the breaststroke&quot;. Given the past performances of David Wilkie, Duncan Goodhew and Adrian Moorhouse, it is hard to argue with that. However, I am not so sure there is anything in this tradition to be genuinely proud about. Being good at breaststroke seems a poor thing in a man. Admittedly this opinion is largely because for most of my childhood I only ever saw two adults swimming: Tarzan and my mother. Not together, I should hasten to add, as father would never have countenanced it. My mother did the breaststroke, usually without removing her glasses. Tarzan didn&apos;t.  I imagine that the King of the Apes&apos; decision to do front crawl was taken for sound psychological reasons. Imagine the anticlimax: Greystoke delivering his characteristic bestial call from the edge of a jungle cliff and diving 100ft into a crocodile-infested river, and then commencing to do froggy kicks and those circular hand movements that look like Tommy Cooper casting a magic spell. It would have fatally undermined his authority.  You can&apos;t expect an elephant to take orders from a breaststroker. Hollywood knew that. That&apos;s why they cast Johnny Weissmuller, the 100m freestyle gold medallist in 1924 and 1928, as Tarzan. The same clearly applies in outer space, where Buster Crabbe (400m freestyle gold in 1932) got to be Flash Gordon. You don&apos;t take on Emperor Ming the Merciless with breaststroke.  I should say that I am not alone in nurturing this attitude to breaststroke.  I have in front of me the 1950 edition of The Complete Swimmer, by Sid Hedges. Mr Hedges was an author of considerable accomplishment, having written well over 100 titles including a dozen on swimming, diving and water polo and others with titles as diverse as Self Help for the Violinist, See Europe Cheaply, Games for Small Lawns and Knowledge for the Growing Boy. This suggests that Sid Hedges was a ration book-era Renaissance man. Either that or a Scout master.  Whatever. According to the venerable Hedges: &quot;The refusal of the breaststroke to become obsolete is one of the most curious facts of natatory history.&quot; Doubt me if you will, but when a man uses a word like &quot;natatory&quot; you have to sit up and listen. It&apos;s a tradition round our way.", "sentences": ["Hungarian women apparently have &quot;a good tradition in the backstroke&quot;, while Japan has a &quot;tradition in the breaststroke that stretches all the way back to 1928 and the city of Amsterdam&quot;."], "title": "Ask Ming the Merciless: there is nothing flash about Britain's proud breaststroke tradition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics1", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Olympics 2008: Aquatics", "British Olympic team 2008", "Sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-15T23:01:00Z", "article": "&apos;Can you just hold the pose?&quot; grins the photographer. &quot;Sorry, I&apos;m used to trying to make normal people look good.&quot; And it&apos;s true. From the moment Tuuli Shipster stepped in front of the camera which had been set up in Storm Models&apos; glamorous little vestibule, it has been difficult for her to remember she is not at work. Staring directly into the lens, as her little dog Tombi waits patiently on the floor, she composes herself instinctively into confident posture number 48 with half-smile. And when the camera snaps, and its burst of light subsides, there she is again, this time in pouting posture 17. It is the jerky dance of fashion photography, half-ridiculous when seen in the flesh - like someone playing musical statues to a broken record - and yet no one standing here now could be in any doubt that they were watching a professional.  &quot;It&apos;s very hard work,&quot; Shipster agrees. &quot;It takes a long time to get the particular shot that really works ... People perceive it as: you&apos;re pretty enough, you&apos;re tall enough, you&apos;ve got the right figure, you stand in front of the camera, boom, boom, boom. Hooray, you&apos;ve got the shot! But really, it&apos;s actually much harder than that. And that surprised me, I think. It surprises everyone that you really have to give it your all, otherwise you just get really boring, awful photos. And you don&apos;t get booked again.&quot; We leave the vestibule, and make our way towards a small meeting room inside the office, past a row of sofas where a constantly replenished line of beautiful children is waiting, arms around their portfolios, hoping to be picked for stardom. &quot;I got spotted by another agency when I was 16,&quot; Shipster explains. It is a story she sounds accustomed to explaining. &quot;I was quite a nervous, quiet, shy teenager anyway, and I was just standing there in Topshop going, &apos;Oh? What? What are you saying to me?&apos;... I remember being by myself and I felt quite confused, because I&apos;d never really thought about it. They were very nice, but I think I was quite taken aback.&quot; In truth, it had been obvious for some time to Shipster&apos;s family that she might grow up to be model material. &quot;My mother had always said, &apos;Oh, you&apos;ve got cheekbones,&apos;&quot; she remembers, acting out the voice. &quot;And I think even my godfather said that I had a &apos;freakishly long lower leg&apos;. I thought that was quite strange. I was more concerned that I wore glasses, my ears stuck out and I was quite flat-chested when I was younger.&quot; Somewhat stunned by her Topshop experience, Shipster did not take up the scout&apos;s invitation. And yet the idea fermented in her memory until one afternoon, when she had a few hours to spare in London, she dropped into Storm to see what would happen. She had a go in front of the camera, went to a few castings during the holidays, and quickly discovered that she loved it. But what was the &quot;it&quot;? I want to know. What exactly about posing for a photographer did she love? &quot;You get to dress up and be someone else,&quot; she says, smiling. &quot;You play a part in front of the camera. It&apos;s funny: when you see your hair and makeup being done, it directs you as to what kind of person you get to be for the day - I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s just me. It&apos;s like wearing a mask. You get to play a part without the vulnerability, and that&apos;s what I like about it - or liked about it then.&quot; Subsequently, of course, she began to enjoy the model&apos;s life as well. &quot;In my gap year, I really started to work quite a lot,&quot; she explains, &quot;and I found I really enjoyed it. Travelling, meeting everybody - I think that&apos;s why I continued to do it.&quot; The gap year, needless to say, became a gap decade. Nevertheless, from the very beginning, Shipster found that her exciting new career was not always an easy thing to talk about. &quot;People react very differently when you say you are a model,&quot; she says. &quot;I think it&apos;s the same with other jobs that are perceived as being glamorous, or anything like that.&quot; At school, in particular, she recalls encountering hostility from classmates who resented her presumptuousness in believing she was a suitable subject for photographers. &quot;I think people see that as being quite arrogant in a way,&quot; she says. &quot;I remember there was this guy in my maths class who was really down on me for being a model. And at the end of my gap year I was walking into Storm ... and he was there.&quot; Her voice curls delightedly into a squeak. &quot;I was like, &apos;Oh! Er, hi ...&apos; He didn&apos;t get taken on.&quot; Shipster&apos;s career, however, flourished. And her breakthrough came when she won the Pretty Polly underwear campaign. &quot;I think that was the first big thing,&quot; she says, &quot;and [it] taught me that I could do underwear, which I&apos;d never really thought of doing before.&quot; It was also a valuable lesson in the importance, for any successful model, of being versatile. Besides doing underwear jobs for billboards and magazines, Shipster also works on catalogues and television commercials, and currently has a contract with the French leather label Jitrois. She also does &quot;showroom&quot; work, &quot;which is when you go to a designer when they&apos;re selling their collections to various shops, and you&apos;re literally putting on all the clothes&quot;. Comfortable with her body, she also recently posed naked (with thong) for the cover image on the new James Bond novel Devil May Care. &quot;The best bit about the whole job,&quot; she remembers, &quot;was that on the day that they launched it I got to go down the Thames in a red leather catsuit with the first seven copies, with the navy ... and helicopters. Then I got to hand them over and got a Bentley for the day. It was like, &apos;This is a really good job!&apos; The next day I was on the bus going to work, and I was like, &apos;Where&apos;s my Bentley?&apos;&quot; One place where she has not triumphed, however, is on the catwalk. &quot;I&apos;ve done it a couple of times, but I&apos;m not that tall - 5ft 9in,&quot; she explains apologetically, &quot;Girls on the catwalk tend to be 5ft 10in or 5ft 11in.&quot; And I&apos;m just not that good at it, if I&apos;m really brutally honest. My walk isn&apos;t brilliant. I never was completely right for it, I think.&quot; Even so, there have been exceptions. Just the other day, for instance, she did a catwalk show in Vienna for Agent Provocateur - and enjoyed it. &quot;It&apos;s quite liberating when you walk out in front of 45,000 people in your underwear,&quot; she grins. For advertising jobs, Shipster can earn \u00a3500 a day or more. But like all but the most famous models, she also works occasionally for free, or very little, on magazine spreads. &quot;You want different photos,&quot; she explains, &quot;because there&apos;s a limited amount of clients and a limitless amount of models. If I go in and I&apos;ve got the same photos [in my portfolio] that I had last year, then it looks like I haven&apos;t done anything.&quot; After we finish, for instance, she is off to spend several days in Amsterdam being shot by 10 different photographers for a special issue of Blend magazine. &quot;I&apos;m getting paid nothing for it,&quot; she adds with some pride. &quot;But for me it&apos;s a great project, and also I&apos;m getting great photos for my book.&quot; Besides keeping her portfolio looking good, of course, Shipster must also work hard to maintain her main asset - her body. &quot;You have to eat healthily,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s not about weight so much, because you have to fit into a sample size, which is a size 10, and I&apos;m a size 8 to 10. It&apos;s actually that you&apos;ve got to look healthy. If I was eating too much horrible stuff, or not eating anything, then I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have the energy to do what I do. I really do eat what I want, but I do exercise. I think that&apos;s a healthier way round. If you start denying yourself you get miserable.&quot; Ultimately, time - and ageing - will become Shipster&apos;s enemy. Absurd as it may sound, at the age of 25 she is already an industry veteran. &quot;I went to a job,&quot; she tells me, by way of an example, &quot;and this young 18-year-old male model asked me how old I was. I said 25, and he said, &apos;Oh, you&apos;re almost done then?&apos; And I was like, &apos;Really, I&apos;m really not.&apos;&quot; She will be done one day - and long before retiring age. At which point various other careers, including acting, appeal to her. &quot;It&apos;s a complete cliche, model-turned-actress,&quot; she says. &quot;But it&apos;s a cliche for a reason, because you have to have a certain amount of confidence and be very aware of your body.&quot;  Meanwhile, there is work to be done, and she has a plane to catch. She has also been very busy recently with jobs for Macallan and Baileys. &quot;You have to be 25 years old to advertise alcohol,&quot; she says with a grin, as Tombi stirs herself in the corner, &quot;so I&apos;ve got a whole new lease of life.&quot; Curriculum vitae Pay &quot;In a good year, maybe \u00a330,000-40,000.&quot; Hours Very unpredictable. &quot;You can turn up at 10am and be done by 12pm. But when I was shooting a commercial in Argentina, I got up at 4am and shot until midday, then got up at 2am and shot another day like that. There&apos;s no such thing as an average day.&quot; Best thing &quot;The variety and the travelling. The idea that something really interesting can happen today, and you just don&apos;t know.&quot; Worst thing &quot;The unpredictability. I&apos;ll say to my mum, &apos;I&apos;ll come to the theatre with you that night.&apos; And then I won&apos;t because my shoot will overrun. Sometimes you have no control over the hours and therefore let people down.&quot;", "sentences": ["If I go in and I&apos;ve got the same photos [in my portfolio] that I had last year, then it looks like I haven&apos;t done anything.&quot; After we finish, for instance, she is off to spend several days in Amsterdam being shot by 10 different photographers for a special issue of Blend magazine."], "title": "A working life: The model", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/16/workandcareers1", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-16T23:01:00Z", "article": "When I moved from Germany to London four years ago I needed some furniture for my new flat. I thought that some shelves, a small table and a few chairs would do nicely, so off I went to my nearest Ikea. It looked and felt exactly like the one in Essen, my home town. There too you have to fight your way through the whole store, past all those bathrooms, kitchens and living rooms to reach the useful odds and ends just before the check-out. The menu at the restaurant was also identical: the same salmon steaks and K\u00f6ttbullar meatballs with lingonberry sauce. There was only one thing that was strangely unfamiliar: the prices. They were much higher. I quickly bought a packet of my favourite Swedish biscuits, got a copy of the Ikea catalogue and called my friend Jenny. Jenny is not only a great fan of Ikea, she even learns Swedish (I sometimes wonder whether she wants to talk to the Bj\u00f6rkudden, Fj\u00f6rby and Gran\u00e5s furniture). Most importantly, though, she still lives in Germany.  I asked her to take the German Ikea catalogue off her Billy shelf and go through it with me over the phone. It was fascinating. The German and British catalogues had the same products, illustrated with the same pictures on the same pages, but with markedly different prices. The German items were about 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than the same ones in Britain. I realised that it I would have saved a lot of money if I had bought my new furniture back home and then brought it with me to the UK. This was my introduction to the phenomenon commonly known as &apos;Rip-off Britain&apos;. Over the following years my impression of Britain as an expensive place was confirmed, especially when I compared it with Germany and Australia, the two countries where I had previously lived. Unfortunately, the Ikea price hikes were not the worst difference. Train tickets were bad, too: London to Manchester and Cologne to Hanover are about the same distance, yet a standard second class single will set you back \u00a3115 in Britain but only \u00a349 in Germany. A trip from Berlin-Alexanderplatz to Sch\u00f6nefeld airport costs the equivalent of \u00a31.67. A similar journey from central London to Heathrow, however, is \u00a34 on the tube and \u00a314.50 on the Heathrow Express. Movie tickets are just as bad: on Friday evening you can watch Will Smith&apos;s Hancock for \u00a313.45 in London&apos;s Leicester Square or for just \u00a38.40 in Sydney&apos;s George Street. Australians also put cheaper fuel in their cars: it may seem unbelievable to British motorists, but Sydneysiders are currently complaining about record-breaking fuel prices \u2013 at just under 80p a litre. Britain is one of the most expensive countries on the planet and London its rip-off capital. Filling your car, eating out, staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe \u2013 even without taking house prices into account.  International companies know this and pay their staff premium wages when they send them here. Mercer, a human resources consultancy, estimated that London&apos;s cost of living (including housing) was more than a third higher than in cities like Sydney, Amsterdam, Munich or Los Angeles, a difference that would be bearable if there was a corresponding gap in the quality of life. Yet, having thought about it for a long time while my tube train was stuck in a tunnel on Thursday morning, I do not believe this is the case. If anything, life in London is worse than it is in other big, international cities. In a recent worldwide survey, it came 38th on the quality of life score. No company could expect to survive if it offered its customers third world products and services but charged them first world prices, so why should Britain? If the UK continues to be one of the most expensive addresses in the world while it fails to provide the best infrastructure and public services, it should not be surprised if it loses its most qualified people and fails to attract foreign professionals.  There is also another problem: while young professionals can vote with their feet and go to places where life is better and cheaper, many people, like those with families, cannot. Unfortunately, they are the ones that are likely to be hit hardest by our excessive price levels. Rising fuel and food prices make life even more difficult for them. There are some things the government should do to help them, and some that it should not. On the one hand, the government cannot do anything to change international oil or food prices and should not try to control domestic ones. But, on the other hand, it can and should create a business environment in which competition is encouraged and taxes are low. For example, it helps parents if they can buy school uniform skirts for their girls for \u00a32 from Asda or 10 fish fingers from Sainsbury&apos;s for 49p, but opening a new supermarket is a nightmarish process under English planning law. Another example: while we are all complaining about high fuel prices, the state deserves at least half of the blame. At current prices, almost 60 per cent of the price of a litre of petrol is made up of fuel duty and VAT. High taxes and complex regulations have both contributed to the phenomenon of rip-off Britain. In particular, a lack of land supply due to planning constraints has pushed up land prices. But somebody has to pay for this, and in the end it is consumers that are footing the bill for our failed planning policies. If we care about our quality of life and the cost of living taxes and regulation should be tackled. In the meantime, there is only one way to get my favourite Ikea biscuits at a reasonable price: buy them when I next visit Germany. \u00b7 Dr Oliver Marc Hartwich is the chief economist at Policy Exchange", "sentences": ["Mercer, a human resources consultancy, estimated that London&apos;s cost of living (including housing) was more than a third higher than in cities like Sydney, Amsterdam, Munich or Los Angeles, a difference that would be bearable if there was a corresponding gap in the quality of life."], "title": "Policy Exchange's chief economist Oliver Marc Hartwich on 'rip-off Britain'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2008/aug/17/london.communities", "tags": ["London", "UK news", "Communities", "Society", "British identity and society", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-17T23:01:00Z", "article": "BAA could be forced to sell Gatwick airport after the Competition Commission orders the break-up of Britain&apos;s dominant airport operator this week. In what would be the greatest shake-up in British airport ownership since BAA was privatised more than 20 years ago, the commission is expected to indicate that a break-up of the group is in the interests of consumers and airlines. Nine out of 10 airport passengers in south-east England travel through BAA terminals at Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted or Southampton airports, and eight out of 10 passengers in Scotland use BAA airports at Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen. Sir Nigel Rudd, BAA&apos;s chairman, told the BBC this weekend that he expected the commission to order divestments, amid speculation that it may demand that all three London airports end up with separate owners. The group could be forced to sell one of its airports north of the border as well. Rudd said a break-up would not be a &quot;disaster&quot; for the group, which has already had &quot;huge expressions of interest&quot; from potential buyers for Gatwick and Stansted.  He argued that Heathrow competes with airports in Paris, Dubai and Amsterdam rather than ones in the UK. The commission is expected to argue that joint ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted results in slow development of plans to expand those airports, which in turn means passengers suffer overcrowded conditions and regular delays.  Its conclusions in a &quot;provisional findings&quot; document, which could be published as soon as Wednesday, are therefore expected to challenge the government&apos;s 2003 aviation white paper - which prioritises new runways at Heathrow and Stansted over Gatwick. Under the commission&apos;s logic, a new Gatwick owner would work harder to overturn an agreement that prohibits constructing a second runway until 2019 and would at least start planning work sooner. Ryanair, Europe&apos;s largest low-budget carrier, has expressed an interest in acquiring Stansted airport if BAA is forced to sell Britain&apos;s third-biggest airport. However, the chief executive, Michael O&apos;Leary, told the Guardian last week that the airline&apos;s priority was to see BAA reduced to owning just Heathrow and Southampton in southern England. &quot;Unless you get Stansted and Gatwick sold off, the Competition Commission will not make any difference,&quot; he said.  Ryanair and easyJet, Stansted&apos;s biggest customers, are vehement opponents of airport regulation, which they claim allows BAA to charge excessive landing fees for an airport that needs only the most basic facilities to operate low-budget, short-haul flights. If BAA does become a forced seller of Gatwick it is expected to attract interest from a wide variety of international bidders including Germany&apos;s Hochtief, Global Infrastructure Partners, the GE-Credit Suisse Investment fund, Australia&apos;s Macquarie as well as the UK&apos;s Manchester Airport Group. The commission&apos;s provisional findings will be closely watched by lawyers as the watchdog usually demands that assets are sold off during takeovers or mergers not as a result of monopoly inquiries.", "sentences": ["He argued that Heathrow competes with airports in Paris, Dubai and Amsterdam rather than ones in the UK."], "title": "Watchdog expected to order BAA's break-up", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/18/baa.theairlineindustry", "tags": ["Heathrow Airports Authority", "Airline industry", "Travel & leisure", "Business", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-17T23:01:00Z", "article": "The Ballerina Ballroom - its frontage occupied on the left by Nairn Bookshop, on the right by a barber&apos;s - trails silvery streamers from its first-floor windows. A rainbow arcs over the central door, and a flowered banner proclaims: &quot;Welcome&quot;. Inside the improvised cinema, playwright and artist John Byrne has raked the walls with painted thunderbolts and stuck them with mirrored stars. The seats are heaps of beanbags and cushions, or deckchairs. Next to the screening room is a glitterball-illuminated cafe, the sideboard piled high with fairy cakes and other treats (not least my own chocolate crunch) homemade by cinemagoers. This is the Ballerina Ballroom Cinema of Dreams: the cure, perhaps, for film festivals. This eight-and-a-half-day festival, in Nairn on the Moray Firth, is the brainchild of actor and accomplished cupcake-baker Tilda Swinton, and writer and film-maker Mark Cousins. The roots of the idea came when Swinton and her family visited the Screen Machine - a mobile cinema that tours the Highlands and Islands - to watch Hitchcock&apos;s Rebecca some years back. &quot;There were kids running around, and finally they got tired of that and just watched the film - and were completely transfixed,&quot; said Swinton. &quot;I remember thinking, where else are they going to see that? Not on TV. And I thought how easy it would be to infiltrate that kind of stuff into children&apos;s lives.&quot; So she decided to take a year&apos;s rental on a disused ballroom in Nairn High Street, for \u00a325,000. &quot;A week later I got a prize and a bonus from a film studio that exactly covered it,&quot; she said. A chunk of money to help cover costs was contributed by Scottish Screen; but mostly Swinton and Cousins have relied on the generosity of friends: the projection equipment is on loan, for instance, and is being operated, says Swinton, by &quot;two blokes from Berlin&quot;. Local volunteers are manning the ticket desks and making the tea; tickets cost \u00a33 or a tray of cakes. &quot;There&apos;s a combination of town goodwill,&quot; says Swinton, &quot;and attention to the project itself. People are taking it seriously.&quot; As the first screening is about to begin, the lights dim and Somewhere Over the Rainbow is played. A spotlight plays over the audience. Swinton and Cousins climb up stepladders positioned on either side of the screen, and unfurl an immense blue and red banner, with the words &quot;State of Cinema&quot; painted across it. We are suddenly in a breakaway republic, a rogue state. We are certainly not, as they say, in Kansas any more. Cousins urges the audience to &quot;piece out our imperfections ... and make imaginary puissance&quot; - quoting the prologue to Henry V. A good call, since when the titles of the film begin to roll, it looks like we are about to be shown Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s Design For Living, not at all the advertised programme. A hurried adjustment is made, and on comes Henry Hathaway&apos;s haunting Peter Ibbetson (1935), a film about dreams and living in your head. It is one of Swinton&apos;s favourites. &quot;I first saw it in a cinema in Paris,&quot; she says to the crowd. &quot;You can see films like this in Paris - and now you can see them in Nairn.&quot; Swinton keeps coming up with daft ideas: &quot;If you come in a kilt for [Powell and Pressburger&apos;s] I Know Where I&apos;m Going, you can come in free.&quot; There is even talk of a ceilidh. Nearly all the films in the lineup are old, and all are favourites, of Swinton or Cousins or of the others who have helped put together the festival. Joel Coen, in absentia, has chosen some of his most beloved movies, including Ray Enright and Busby Berkeley&apos;s Dames, which brings whoops and cheers from the audience and an encore of the virtuosic and hilarious scene in which a young laundry girl sings a love song to the washing. (&quot;And when I&apos;m off on Sundays/ I miss all his undies,&quot; is a particularly memorable line.)  The following night, Cousins&apos;s choice of Fassbinder&apos;s The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant provokes a more subdued reaction - as well it might, since it is a harrowing tale of twisted sexual power play among women. &quot;Well, it was different, wasn&apos;t it?&quot; said one local. &quot;I would have switched it off if it had been on telly, but actually I quite enjoyed it.&quot; According to Swinton, &quot;usually going to the cinema now is all about guarantees. Did it get good reviews? How is it doing at the box office? Will I get comfortable seats, and be able to buy toxic-waste sweets?&quot; In contrast, the Ballerina Ballroom Cinema of Dreams is like, she says, &quot;going to a restaurant that you trust and saying, &apos;Feed me&apos;. People are coming not because they know all the films we are showing, but out of trust. People have said it&apos;s like going to the pictures as a child - being taken and told, &apos;You are going to love this&apos;. And you know, anyone can do this. All you need is some DVDs and a space.&quot; The audience is certainly in agreement, if sheer numbers are anything to go by: the films are being shown twice to accommodate the demand. There are plenty of local families here; others have come from as far afield as Amsterdam and New York. &quot;I am loving the feeling of collective experience,&quot; said one festival-goer. &quot;For once, you can happily look around and actually make eye contact with people.

Michael Phelps and Johnny Weissmuller. Photograph: David Gray / Reuters and Cinetext / Allstar In past decades, Olympic swimming success entitled the new all-American hero to a shot at Hollywood glory. But a sequence of movie misfires suggests it&apos;s unlikely that Michael Phelps will follow in the slipstream of such pool predecessors as Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe, who form a quartet of Olympic Tarzans with 1928 silver medal-winning shot putter Herman Brix (aka Bruce Bennett) and 1936 decathlon champion, Glenn Morris.  Arriving at Ellis Island aged seven months, J\u00e1nos Weissm\u00fcller denied his Austro-Hungarian origins and claimed to have been born in Pennsylvania to secure his place on the swimming team for Paris 1924. Already the world record holder, he took gold in the 100m and 400m freestyle events, and added gold in the 800m freestyle relay and a water polo bronze for good measure. Four years later in Amsterdam, he triumphed again in the 100m and the relay before retiring undefeated, with 52 domestic titles and 67 world records to his name. Having debuted on screen wearing only a fig leaf as Adonis in the primitive talkie version of the Ziegfeld show Glorifying the American Girl (1929), Weissmuller did modelling and promotions work before signing to MGM for the lead in &quot;One Take Woody&quot; Van Dyke&apos;s Tarzan the Ape Man (1932). The sixth actor to play Edgar Rice Burroughs&apos; jungle superman, Weissmuller teamed effectively with Maureen O&apos;Sullivan as Jane and Cheeta (who is now an amazing 76 years old) as his chimpanzee sidekick in half a dozen pictures before he decamped to RKO for six more. Hanging up his loincloth, Weissmuller starred in 13 &quot;programmers&quot; as Jungle Jim at Columbia (1948-54) and also teamed up with Larry &quot;Buster&quot; Crabbe in Swamp Fire (1946). Raised in Hawaii, Crabbe was no match for Weissmuller as an athlete, taking only a bronze in the 1500m freestyle in Amsterdam and gold in the 400m at the 1932 Los Angeles Games. However, he was a much better actor and racked up over 100 pictures, including several B Westerns as Billy the Kid. His reputation, though, rests on his serial work, where he played the leads in Tarzan the Fearless (1933), Flash Gordon (1936), Flash Gordon&apos;s Trip to Mars (1938). Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940) and Buck Rogers (1939). What&apos;s more, he kept himself in shape and, in 1971, he broke the over-60s record for the 400m freestyle. Among the other swimmers to find film fame are Henri Decoin, who swam in Stockholm 1912 and flew planes in the Great War before making three excellent Simenon adaptations and directing wife Danielle Darrieux in nine box-office hits in their native France, and Carlo Pedersoli, who was the first Italian to swim the 100m freestyle in under a minute. Although Pedersoli competed in Helsinki 1952 and Melbourne 1956, he is much better known as actor Bud Spencer, whose raft of spaghetti westerns alongside Terence Hill included Enzo Barboni&apos;s They Call Me Trinity (1970) and Trinity Is STILL My Name! (1971). The list of iconic Olympians would almost certainly have included Esther Williams had the outbreak of the Second World War not led to the cancellation of Tokyo 1940. Indeed, several stars have similarly been deprived of Games glory, including Hume Cronyn (boxing), Dennis Weaver (decathlon), Tammy Grimes, Thomas Kretschmann (swimming), Strother Martin, Jason Statham (diving), Sonny Chiba (gymnastics) and Geena Davis (archery). Dolph Lundgren, however, made it, as the Swedish-born star of such blockbusters as Rocky IV (1985) and Masters of the Universe (1987) put his screen career on hold to act as leader of the US modern pentathlon team at the LA Games of 1996. Conversely, decades before, Cornel Wilde opted out of fencing for the United States in Berlin in 1936 in order to concentrate on his acting. It proved a wise decision, as he became a durable star in swashbucklers, romances and film noir. An even more accomplished swordsman, Bob Anderson, represented Great Britain in London in 1948 and in Helsinki four years later. He made the transition to cinema when he helped Errol Flynn with the duelling sequences in William Keighley&apos;s Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation, The Master of Ballantrae (1953), and, having coached Sid James and Jim Dale for Carry On Don&apos;t Lose Your Head (1967), he served variously as sword master and fight arranger on such prestigious pictures as Stanley Kubrick&apos;s Barry Lyndon (1975), Russell Mulcahy&apos;s Highlander (1986), Rob Reiner&apos;s The Princess Bride (1987), Steven Herek&apos;s The Three Musketeers (1993) and Martin Campbell&apos;s The Mask of Zorro (1998). He also worked on Peter Jackson&apos;s Lord of the Rings trilogy and Pierce Brosnan&apos;s final 007 outing, Die Another Day (2002). But Anderson&apos;s finest hour remains his uncredited stunt doubling of Darth Vader in the lightsaber showdowns in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), which had to be photographed from a low angle to disguise the fact that he was six inches shorter than the 6&apos;7&quot; Dave Prowse. In more recent years, sporting titans like Muhammad Ali (The Greatest, 1977), Mitch Gaylord (American Anthem, 1986), Rafer Johnson (Licence to Kill, 1989), Michael Jordan (Space Jam, 1996), Greg Louganis (Touch Me, 1997) and Carl Lewis (Alien Hunter, 2003) have all failed to set the screen alight.

The German sportswear company, which is thought to spend about \u00a3100m a year on global advertising, has appointed Iris to be lead creative advertising agency on its global running business. This appointment is a coup for Iris, which already works with Adidas on retail campaigns, but has not been considered a threat for flashier above-the-line work.  Iris can now be viewed as a threat by Adidas lead creative agency 180 Amsterdam. 180 Amsterdam has been working with Adidas since 1998 when its founders broke away from Nike&apos;s agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, to take on part of the ad account for the German rival. In 2002 Adidas parted company with Leagas Delaney and appointed 180 as lead global creative agency, with TBWA tasked to handle the global roll-out of campaigns. This is thought to be the first time in a decade that 180 Amsterdam has been threatened as lead global agency on any piece of Adidas business. &quot;This signals our emergence as a global creative force,&quot; said Iris Worldwide joint creative director Shaun McIlrath. Iris, which is thought to have won the business following a competitive roster pitch, is working on a major Adidas running campaign for 2009. 180 Amsterdam, in which marketing giant and TBWA-parent Omnicom took a stake last year, remains Adidas&apos; lead creative agency across its sports performance business.

The best has to be at the end of a paragraph describing crossing from Malawi into Zimbabwe via Mozambique: &quot;There was nobody at the Mozambican immigration office except a boy with one leg selling roasted birds and a sweaty, chubby man who walked on to the bus and collected our passports together with a fee . . . When he was finished with them, we headed to Zimbabwe where we were greeted by a black-and-white portrait of Robert Mugabe and a notice that read, &apos;If you are not happy with us, wait until you get to Heathrow.&apos;&quot; The poster legend is a typical Mugabe gambit: the wisecrack of the street thug. Kambalu grew up under a more subtly insidious (and far less bloody) dictator, life president of Malawi, Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda. So did I, until I was 14, and it&apos;s a pleasure to have one&apos;s memory sparked by so much well-observed detail. It is rare to see it, and the reason why is intimately bound with the repressive culture Kambalu describes. Malawi seldom features in books. The material covered in The Jive Talker, which charts the ordinary life of a modern Malawian teenager in country and city from his own perspective, has never before been explored. There was a brief efflorescence of Malawian literature in the 1960s through writers such as David Rubadiri, after which genuine culture was smothered by Banda for most of three decades.  The only writer of substance the country has produced is the great Jack Mapanje, but his output was circumscribed by his being imprisoned by Banda for most of the period. Artistic activity was frowned on by the former elder of the Kirk (Banda did his training in Scotland), who only wanted to see graven images of himself, preferably on the printed dresses of the ululating women he liked to have dancing round. Largely because he was courting Britain and (as it often seemed at the time) its proxy, apartheid South Africa, Banda would never have tolerated such bare-faced cheek at the former colonial power as indicated by the Zimbabwean poster. Kambalu sees the consequences of this political and cultural cringe when he gets a scholarship to the prestigious Kamuzu Academy (the so-called Eton of Africa) but he has to fight hard to get there. This is in spite of some advantages. His father is a hospital manager and in some of his posts - the more rural ones, where Kambalu senior, aka the Jive Talker, is in charge - this means the family has plenty of food. The jive he talks is a blend of various philosophers, scientists and classics, as held in a large double-fronted bookshelf christened &quot;The Diptych&quot;. The scholarship winner and future artist will learn much at this shrine, not least self-confidence, since Nietzsche&apos;s collected works bend quite a few shelves of The Diptych. Kambalu needs to be a young Superman, since the path to Parnassus is a thorny one. He struggles with poverty, his father&apos;s drinking, and the rejection of a boy whose main interests are fashion and Michael Jackson, in a country where miniskirts and long hair are banned. His flamboyant attitude and quick tongue lead to difficulties with both boys (not wanted) and girls (wanted but unattainable). Malawi is beset by a triadic scourge of evangelical Christianity, the Hitler Youth-like &quot;young pioneers&quot; of Banda, and worsening poverty - but all these are as nothing to the scourge of Aids. Misunderstood and misdiagnosed, the pestilence sweeps across the country in the mid-1980s, claiming Kambalu&apos;s father, mother and six other family members. The scenes describing the death of his father, the former fount of all knowledge to whom antipathy is later developed, are riven with contradictory passion. This happens while the son is at Kamuzu, learning Latin and imbibing from expatriate teachers a hobbled sort of great education, which his Nietzschean vigour undercuts. It is through Nietzsche that Kambalu develops the art concept of the Holy Ball - an ordinary football, or sometimes a Malawian rag football, stuck over with pages from the Bible - which he associates with sun worship and freedom from oppressive models of thought and being. A sense of cleanly freedom - of &quot;exercise&quot; and &quot;exorcise&quot; - permeates this enjoyable book. Football playing and fun are presented as the necessary correctives to Banda&apos;s Presbyterian gloom and the grimness of disease. The revolving heart of The Jive Talker, the Holy Ball idea will be Kambalu&apos;s passport to Amsterdam and then the London art scene, where he continues to kick charmingly about, the living embodiment of good news from Africa. \u00b7 Giles Foden is working on Turbulence, a novel about the D-Day weather forecast.", "sentences": ["The revolving heart of The Jive Talker, the Holy Ball idea will be Kambalu&apos;s passport to Amsterdam and then the London art scene, where he continues to kick charmingly about, the living embodiment of good news from Africa."], "title": "Review: The Jive Talker by Samson Kambalu", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/biography.society", "tags": ["Biography", "Society", "Society", "Books", "Culture", "Malawi", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-22T23:01:00Z", "article": "Monday February 11 2008  5.30pm: Dad is bent over the toilet bowl with a brush in his hand and a scowl on his face. I walk up to him. &quot;Shall I give you a hand?&quot; Dad begins to snigger, abandoning any attempt to make sense of the situation. We stand shoulder to shoulder with our backs to Mum, who paces around the landing with a newly fitted catheter in her hand.  The catheter has been put in by nurse Marianne to enable our GP, who will be with us in half an hour, to give Mum a lethal injection. But instead of having a moment of peace with us, as Marianne suggested, Mum demands that we clean the toilets. Both upstairs and downstairs.  My brother, Maarten, is sitting on the edge of the bath, staring out of the bathroom window.  &quot;Imagine,&quot; he mutters. &quot;Her last hour, spent like this.&quot;  This is the Netherlands, where voluntary euthanasia is permitted, as well as physician-assisted suicide. This is the day my mother has chosen to die, and the toilets need to be spotless.  Three months earlier I&apos;m on a writer&apos;s retreat in the UK, where I have been living for the past three years. I&apos;m working on my novel when my mobile phone rings. The display shows it&apos;s Maarten, calling from the Netherlands. Mum&apos;s test results have come back.  &quot;It&apos;s secondary cancer in her lungs.&quot; He pauses. &quot;They reckon she&apos;s got two to six months left.&quot; I phone Mum. She talks without interruption, barely taking breath, about quitting her job just two months before her retirement, about what might have happened if she had not had that innocent-looking polyp removed from her womb, about why the doctors had not investigated her lungs earlier.  The prognosis is she could live another year if she undergoes chemotherapy. But she won&apos;t. &quot;I&apos;m not going to go bald,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t want people saying, &apos;How sad, that beautiful hair all gone.&apos; Never.&quot;  When I phone again, she sounds as if she doesn&apos;t have time to talk.  &quot;I&apos;m arranging my cremation.&quot;  &quot;Oh ... &quot; &quot;Yes, the text for the card, the location, the flowers, the coffin ... I&apos;m really busy.&quot;  Dad, Maarten and I do not seem to be part of the equation.  Late January 2008  Dad phones. After two and a half months, Mum is deteriorating rapidly. She suffers from headaches, sickness and loss of coordination. She takes a fall while Dad is having a shower. When she has a shower, half the bathroom floor gets flooded.  Two days later, brain metastasis is confirmed. Mum is hospitalised and given drugs to repress the inflammation, but they will only remain effective for a week or two. Friday January 25  Maarten collects me from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and we drive to meet Dad at the hospital. We all go upstairs together.  Mum is sitting by herself at a table near the window as we enter. She throws us a tearful smile. &quot;My boys,&quot; she says, as Maarten and I give her a hug. &quot;To think that this all started in that bloody womb of mine ... but I am glad I had it, to bear you two.&quot;  The hospital staff all do a great job and Mum seems content with her care. After two hours with us, though, she becomes more demanding. She asks Dad to put things into her bag, then take them out again. She snaps when he can&apos;t find her mobile phone.  When the palliative care coordinator, Carola, comes in to discuss the option of home care, I take Dad outside. &quot;Dad, I&apos;m wondering - here, Mum is in the capable hands of staff whose authority she accepts. At home, she&apos;ll just try to be the boss.&quot;  &quot;Hmm. You may be right,&quot; says Dad. We walk back, just as Mum is asking Carola whether home care really does not include vacuuming.  When I repeat my concerns to Maarten, though, he is adamant: &quot;She ought to come home. It feels more natural if she dies there and I want to be around her for a bit. I don&apos;t want to drive to this depressing hospital every day and leave her alone at night.&quot;  And so the question is settled. The four of us will go home together on Monday.  Saturday January 26  In Dad&apos;s study, I find a draft version of a mourning card saying &quot;dag lief&quot; (&quot;bye dear&quot;). My name is on the card, along with my brother&apos;s and Dad&apos;s. These are meant to be our words, but I have had no part in writing them and I struggle with the bottom line: &quot;We prefer not to receive telephone calls, visitors or flowers.&quot;  Monday January 28  After arriving home with Mum, we struggle to share a harmonious moment. She asks again if we&apos;ve thought about what we are going to say at her funeral. When I answer that I haven&apos;t, Mum insists that time is short. I should look at her &quot;expression of wish&quot; statement - her wish to die. It needs editing. I go upstairs to the study.  The statement begins: &quot;I, Mieneke Weide-Boelkes, am terminally ill.&quot; It ends: &quot;As soon as this medication loses its efficacy I request euthanasia.&quot; Dad joins me and reassures me the text has genuinely been written by Mum.  I start editing. Then Mum calls from downstairs. &quot;Weren&apos;t you going to make dinner?!&quot;  I go downstairs and start cooking with Maarten. Anything for a quiet life ... because that is how it&apos;s always been and now is not the time to change it.  When dinner is ready and I go to fetch Mum and Dad, I find them sitting in our bedroom with a man I have never seen before.  Mum introduces me to the doctor, Martin. He is holding the statement I have just edited, but all I can think is how he got in so quietly and why Mum and Dad have not bothered to let us know he is here. Wednesday January 30 8.15am: Maarten has a run-in with Mum. He asks what on Earth she is doing with the Hoover at &quot;stupid o&apos;clock&quot; in the morning. Mum does not appreciate being spoken to like that.  Things still simmer at breakfast. Mum finds fault with all the shopping we bought the previous day: the gouda cheese is too soft, the bread too sweet and why is there fruit juice in her fridge? Monday February 4 We are just about to have lunch when Mum, who has been complaining about headaches this morning, gets up from the table. Tearfully, she shuffles to the kitchen sink. &quot;I am so sick of it,&quot; she says, &quot;so sick.&quot; She begins to make retching noises.  As Dad gets closer, Mum begins to thrash around. &quot;It&apos;s starting again!&quot; she cries. &quot;Call a doctor, quickly!&quot;  Maarten manages to calm her down a little. Dad picks up the phone to call the doctor. Mum wants to go back to the table, but I take her upstairs to bed.  A moment later we hear feet shuffling down the stairs. The door opens and Mum appears. &quot;I&apos;m sort of OK now,&quot; she says.  She has just sat down when the doctor arrives. As he sticks his head round the dining-room door and sees Mum sipping coffee, his face is all surprise.  So this is the moment Mum has specified: initial symptoms back; medication losing its effect.  The doctor says euthanasia can take place next week. Another doctor first needs to verify, though, that Mum cannot be cured, that her wish to die has been consistent, and that her suffering is unbearable.  Martin is convinced of the first two conditions but not of the third. If Mum is too energetic to stay in bed, then how is her suffering unbearable?  Mum puts her coffee down. &quot;Well, I have to die anyway, don&apos;t I?&quot; Then she asks us what we think.  I interrupt: &quot;It should be your own decision. None of us is to say anything.&quot;  But Mum struggles to say she wants to die. Eventually I say, &quot;I think what she finds unbearable is not so much her pain and sickness, but the fear of it getting worse and of losing control.&quot;  When Martin is finally satisfied that Mum wants to end it, he agrees to contact the second doctor. He leaves with an empathetic nod to us all. Thursday February 7 I wake up in the middle of the night. Mum is standing in our bedroom. She opens a drawer and takes something out. She shuffles items across the desk until she is pleased with their arrangement. Then she leaves, quietly closing the door behind her.  It is at least the third nocturnal bout of tidying up I&apos;ve seen this fortnight. Mum&apos;s youngest sister and her husband are visiting today. Everybody sits at the dining-room table with drinks and nibbles. Mum is giving an animated demonstration on how to polish silverware with her special gloves.  Then the secondary opinion doctor phones to say he will be with us in 10 minutes. There is a brief panic. Mum wants to change into her nightwear and get into bed before the doctor arrives, but we persuade her otherwise.  The doctor speaks privately with Mum in the dining room. After he leaves, Mum looks decisive. She says it was &quot;a very good talk&quot;, but does not give any further details. Later, when the guests have gone, Dad tells me that the doctor asked him to leave the room. &quot;Yes,&quot; Mum interrupts, &quot;the doctor had to ascertain if I was not being forced into euthanasia.&quot; Friday February 8 Doctor Martin is due to come in the afternoon to discuss further plans, but I do not see him. My brother has to fill me in over the phone because I am staying at a friend&apos;s after a fight with Mum.  Over the last week or so, she has been complaining about my shoes and the damage they do to her floor and has been badgering me to buy a new pair at her preferred shop this weekend.  &quot;Mum,&quot; I say, &quot;I was planning to stay with some friends this weekend.&quot;  &quot;Oh, were you!&quot; she snaps. &quot;And who has got more priority then, your friends or your terminally ill mother?&quot;  I decide to go sooner rather than later. But Mum pursues me as I get my things. &quot;Why don&apos;t you stay with your friends next week, when I&apos;m dead? You&apos;ll have all the time in the world then!&quot;  &quot;I was planning to spend time here, with Dad.&quot;  &quot;Oh no you won&apos;t,&quot; she says. &quot;When I&apos;m dead, it&apos;s just going to be your dad and me here. I don&apos;t want you and Maarten around. And anyway, you don&apos;t do diddly squat ... &quot;  I lose my self-control. I shout and swear at her and storm off in a rage.  Later, at my friend Petra&apos;s, I get a phone call from Maarten about the outcome of the doctor&apos;s visit. Mum&apos;s death has been scheduled for Monday February 11, at 6.15pm. Sunday February 10 Mum&apos;s sisters and their husbands are there for a last family dinner, together with Dad, Maarten and me - wearing my expensive new pair of shoes. Mum, even more energetic than the week before, decorates the table lavishly.  My uncles shake their heads with incomprehension. As Mum shows off her china plates, my aunts have distracted looks on their faces.  Whispering to Dad and me in the hallway, they struggle to understand why Mum is choosing to die the next day when she is bouncing around like a 40-year-old instead of a terminally ill 65-year-old. But there is also shock at her fixation on material objects and the little interest she shows in how the people around her actually feel. Monday February 11 Again, I wake up early when Mum comes into the bedroom. It is disturbing to see her take the stones and shells from the windowsill and place them on the desk. She had only moved them on to the windowsill the previous morning.  Mum leaves and comes back again three times. After the last visit, I can hear she is hoisting the vacuum cleaner up to the attic. It is just after 6am.  It is the start of an increasingly mad day, during which Mum hoovers the whole house and does six loads of washing (one of which consists of a single white shirt). She scrapes all the woodwork on the outside of the house clear of moss and cleans the windows.  After breakfast, I find Dad fuming after Mum has given him grief for not ironing fast enough. I ask him if it helps to see her as a mental patient instead of his wife. He grumbles.  I think of what was said the night before, about Mum&apos;s relative physical fitness and her obsession with material objects and cleanliness. I feel an increasing tension as the day progresses and I still don&apos;t know whether it is going to be Mum&apos;s last.  I overhear Mum&apos;s conversation with the flower shop. After the crematorium confirms the date of her funeral, she phones to order flowers for her coffin. It is an hour and a half before the nurse comes to put the catheter into Mum&apos;s hand.  6.15pm: The doctor arrives shortly after the scene with the toilets. Mum greets him, then disappears upstairs, saying, &quot;Best let me potter for a bit.&quot; Nobody sees her for another 20 minutes. &quot;Does it happen at all that people pull out at the last minute?&quot; I ask.  &quot;Yes,&quot; Martin says. &quot;Quite often I go home again and a new appointment is made. But in many cases the patient passes away between visits.&quot;  When Mum comes back, listing things she has put in bags and boxes, Martin gently interrupts her: &quot;Can I just ask you something? Is there still a lot you feel you need to do?&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; she says, &quot;I mean no. I&apos;m just nervous.&quot;  &quot;I can always come back later if you are not ready,&quot; says the doctor.  Mum sits down and listens to the doctor. Then she takes a deep breath and says, &quot;OK. I am ready.&quot;  At 7pm, with my father, brother and me around her bed as well as Martin, who has given her the injection, Mum goes to sleep.  Saturday February 16  People at funerals often say that the deceased would have approved of the ceremony. In my mother&apos;s case, she had literally approved everything - the music, the flowers, the guest list and the restaurant we went to afterwards. My main regret is that there were such clashes between us in the run-up to her death. Perhaps if we had challenged Mum more over the years, keeping her ever-increasing demands in check, we could have been at peace as a family, instead of at war over shoes and toilets, right to the bitter end.", "sentences": ["Friday January 25  Maarten collects me from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and we drive to meet Dad at the hospital."], "title": "Diary of terminally ill woman who chose euthanasia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/23/euthanasia.cancer", "tags": ["Life and style", "Health", "Long-term care", "Society", "Family", "Assisted dying"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-23T23:01:00Z", "article": "The Verve Forth (Parlophone) \u00a311.99 The Verve&apos;s reunion album arrives amid fresh rumours of bad blood between big-lipped singer Richard Ashcroft and highly strung guitarist Nick McCabe. Forth is not the sort of unmitigated triumph that would bury these ancestral tensions. Its taut dance-rock single, &apos;Love Is Pain&apos;, finds the Wigan outfit hungry for a chart placing. The explosive final two minutes of &apos;Noise Epic&apos; just about makes up for the laziness of the title, creating a little storm in heaven, while the gentle soul of &apos;Judas&apos; provides dewy succour.

The more esoteric fringes of this, her second record, force the point; big sis may never have sampled Scottish electronic recluses Boards of Canada but Solange&apos;s bid for ambient kudos (&apos;This Bird&apos;) is slight.

Ally Carnwath The Peth The Golden Mile (Strangetown Records Inc) \u00a311.99 Whatever the Peth is for Rhys Ifans, it&apos;s not a vanity project. The actor fronts this new Cardiff-based band but manages to keep a pretty low profile. At the controls is Super Furry Animals drummer Dafydd Ieuan, who has written 10 unremarkable rock songs with a psychedelic overlay. Ifans contributed some lyrics but most of his vocals are drowned out in a sea of effects. Snippets rise to the surface: &apos;Last Man Standing&apos; celebrates a hedonistic past; &apos;Stonefinger&apos; laments a heart broken - perhaps by Ifans&apos;s ex, Sienna Miller. &apos;Let&apos;s Go Fucking Mental&apos; is mindless chant-along fun, but the rest stimulates little interest. Killian Fox The Automatic This Is a Fix (B-Unique) \u00a312.99 Having traded wacky keyboardist Alex Pennie for Paul Mullen from Yourcodenameis:milo, the Wales-based foursome who had a monster hit with Monster , turn to album two. The Mullen-penned opener &apos;Magazines&apos;, all jagged bass and pumped up indie-pop vocals, suggests he was a wise addition, while the shiny guitar spangle and shouty chorus chant of first single &apos;Steve McQueen&apos; is another success. Yet much of this album flabs out into overblown Eighties stodge. It&apos;s a shame this misguided romance with stadium pomp overshadows the light-hearted pop rock the Automatic do so well. Katie Toms Various Rough Guide to the Klezmer Revolution (World Music Network) \u00a38.99 Once the epitome of Jewish old fogeydom, Klezmer now rallies dissident voices. With New York as the major spawning ground and the Klezmatics as pioneers, its clarinets, accordions and violins have tangled with reggae, jazz and hip-hop, while fun-poking Yiddish cabaret has been redeployed to turn ancient marriage songs into gay anthems. This compilation samples the scene nicely. There&apos;s plenty of uptempo oompah, in which London&apos;s Oi Va Voi do a nice line, lyrical jazz piano from Marilyn Lerner, and some stonking dub from the Amsterdam Klezmer Band. Neil Spencer Ken Peplowski &amp; Jesper Thilo Happy Together (Nagel-Heyer) \u00a313.99 Rarely has an album been more aptly titled. Peplowski (American) and Thilo (Danish) both play tenor saxophone and clarinet, so this could be the set-up for a duel. But they are clearly having so much fun on this live session, recorded in Hamburg last year, that the atmosphere is charged with good feelings. With classic swing out of favour in the US, Europe has become its new home and you are much more likely to encounter music of this quality in London or Hamburg than in New York. The accompanying trio, led by pianist Thilo Wagner, is more than equal to the task.

By half-time, he was already one of the family.  The Amsterdam-born Ghanaian forward, on loan from Spartak Moscow until January with an option to extend for the season, sees this move as a way back to the Premier League, where he played five games for Arsenal as a teenager, and given Birmingham&apos;s start, he might not need to move again to achieve that ambition.  Indeed the Birmingham manager, Alex McLeish, already has an option to complete the purchase of the 22-year-old next summer, the early signs being that he will have no problem pushing through any deal as the chairman, David Gold, contends that the club have not had a player with Owusu-Abeyie&apos;s &quot;verve and skill&quot; since Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez was there in the mid-90s. That view may be news to fans of James McFadden, who missed narrowly with a dipping overhead kick, twice sent angled drives past the far post and also had a volley well saved by Luke Steele, but then again it might not to those who endured Ricky Otto&apos;s attempts to entertain in the same team as the Portuguese winger.  It was Owusu-Abeyie who supplied the first-half cross which allowed a limping Garry O&apos;Connor, once of Lokomotiv Moscow and someone he twice played against in the Russian capital, to head the second goal in injury time, leaving Barnsley, who had hit the bar with a 20-yarder from Diego Le\u00f3n minutes earlier, with too much to do.  &quot;The boys had signalled to me minutes earlier to try and get Garry off before it got any worse,&quot; said McLeish, who has &quot;one or two options&quot; lined up for this final week of the transfer window but also intends to use the loan system in the run-up to the next one. &quot;Fortunately it was only a dead leg and he was able to jump at the back post for the goal. It was a very, very good performance from Quincy and the fans took to him. He&apos;s exciting - he&apos;s not only quick, he does have a wee trick. He doesn&apos;t run up blind alleys, he can see pictures and he can only get better.&quot;  The only disappointment for Birmingham was the attendance, with just 17,413 - almost 7,000 fewer than were present for the opener against Sheffield United and the result of an aggresive season-ticket pricing policy - turning out to see the team go to the top of the table.  The fallout from last season&apos;s relegation still runs deep, with the scars from an angry on-pitch demonstration against the board after the final game barely healed. The new captain, Lee Carsley, feels the team need to win 10 or 15 games in a row to get the fans back onside. Three out of three is a good start, with a trip to Norwich to come on Saturday, and with the 35-year-old Kevin Phillips being used sparingly but scoring in all three games, this one a diving header from Stuart Parnaby&apos;s cross, Carsley&apos;s target appears achievable.  Barnsley&apos;s immediate objective is altogether more prosaic, the FA Cup semi-finalists&apos; third defeat in three sending them to the bottom of the table while facing a visit from struggling Derby County on Saturday. &quot;It&apos;s paramount we get three points against them,&quot; said the manager, Simon Davey. &quot;I know that, the players know that and the fans know that.&quot;  Man of the match Lee Carsley (Birmingham City)", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam-born Ghanaian forward, on loan from Spartak Moscow until January with an option to extend for the season, sees this move as a way back to the Premier League, where he played five games for Arsenal as a teenager, and given Birmingham&apos;s start, he might not need to move again to achieve that ambition."], "title": "Quincy keeps Birmingham in the fast lane", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/25/championship.birminghamcityfc", "tags": ["Championship", "Birmingham City", "Barnsley", "Football", "Sport", "Championship 2008-09"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-25T08:08:46Z", "article": "The Mill is nothing if not patriotic, and after several dark decades wondering if it was in fact nothing, it was grateful to the Olympics to reawaken sentiments of graceless gloating in the face of victory and sanctimonious whinging in the face of def ... brave moral victory.

Since only one of our modest wishes was granted at Euro 2008, we&apos;ll have to derive some satisfaction from our own league this year. Luckily, it looks set to be compelling, not least because only five of 18 teams will be kicking off the season with the same manager that began the last campaign.  Most notably, Marco van Basten will make his debut as a club manager at Ajax while Steve McClaren arrives in Holland, seemingly under the impression that FC Twente are a clever way to rebuild his reputation after botching the England job. As is to be expected, the high turnover of managers led to a flurry of transfers, prudent and otherwise. And, as usual, much more talent flowed out rather than in.  It seems that nobody had told Van Basten that there was a transfer window in the winter too, leading him to buy just about every player he could get his hands on. The prolific Argentine striker Dar\u00edo Cvitanich, the new &apos;&apos;most expensive player in Dutch football&apos;&apos; Miralem Sulejmani, the former PSV midfielder Ismael Aissati and the versatile Evander Sno will all be grazing on the lush Amsterdam Arena pasture this year.  But Van Basten&apos;s most curious signing was the Barcelona defender Oleguer Presas. What&apos;s confusing isn&apos;t so much that Van Basten bought him, but that there was a transfer at all. Oleguer is a staunch socialist who, one might presume, opposes the capitalist jungle of the modern transfer market. Yet Oleguer had been keen on this move. He had meshed well with Frank Rijkaard&apos;s laissez-faire approach in Barcelona but his new manager has a flair for despotism. The two should clash nicely. Presas is the sixth Spaniard to join Ajax over the past three years. Yet the success of the full-back Gabri stands alone among the failures of Alberto Luque, Roger, Ismael Urzaiz and Juanfran. Presas is expected to fill the enormous Jaap Stam-shaped hole that&apos;s been gaping in defence since the latter retired last December - and this makes Ajax keen favorites to win the league. &quot;Ajax will be champions with two fingers up their nose,&quot; said the former player turned television pundit Johan Derksen, his giant nostrils gaping invitingly. Feyenoord have been quiet during the transfer window but should still improve on their sixth-place finish last season. That team, newly padded with a slew of current and former Holland internationals last summer, needed a little time to gel. Still, the new manager Gert-Jan Verbeek soon learned that the squad he inherited from Bert van Marwijk \u2013 who became Holland manager \u2013 was nowhere near as good as he&apos;d expected and that there was no money for new players. He also lost much of the player-power he did have to a series of injuries ahead of last Saturday&apos;s Johan Cruyff Schaal match (the Dutch Community Shield) against PSV. In several cruel twists of fate, knees and ankles, no fewer than 12 of his finest underperformers had to watch the match from the stadium&apos;s wheelchair platform.  Moreover, Feyenoord&apos;s star striker Roy Makaay and the winger Jonathan de Guzman went to the Olympics to play for the Netherlands, although Feyenoord could have lawfully barred them from doing so. They didn&apos;t; and for their generosity they were thanked and told that they could Medivac their players home. De Guzman has a groin injury, while Makaay suffered a broken bone in his rather essential right foot and will be out for at least a month. Doctors had originally misdiagnosed Makaay&apos;s injury, leading him to play in Holland&apos;s group game against the United States and worsening his condition. &quot;The medical staff of the Olympic team had said there was no risk, because nothing was damaged,&quot; Verbeek&apos;s teeth gnashed during an interview. &quot;Now it turns out that they missed this.&quot; After losing friendlies to Real Mallorca, Borussia Dortmund, Celtic and Benfica, Feyenoord thought that they had hit rock-bottom. But still they managed to drill a hole and sink even deeper when they lost 2-1 in a pre-season friendly to the amateur side BVV Barendrecht. This left them little hope against PSV who predictably beat them 2-0 in a drab match.  Afterwards Verbeek took his anger out on the pitch. &quot;A match like this has to be taken seriously, which means that the pitch should be in order,&quot; Verbeek said. &quot;The [FA] can&apos;t accept that the grass is this long.&quot; As for McClaren, nobody seems to understand what he&apos;s doing here. The Voetbal International columnist Taco van den Velde even called his recruitment a &quot;PR stunt&quot;, adding that the ambitious chairman Joop Munsterman had admitted that &apos;&apos;the club had especially wanted to attract a name&quot;.  &quot;In other words, it had to be someone through whom the club could show off,&quot; van den Velde wrote. &quot;Craftsmanship was secondary. If it ends in failure the outcome will be predictable: the English coach will be taken out with the garbage. McClaren won&apos;t be able to help it if he turns out to be the wrong man in the wrong place.&quot; Most of all, this is a lose-lose situation for McClaren. If he does the impossible and comes in fourth and makes the Champions League qualifier, which seems unlikely, he&apos;ll only have done as well as the last guy. If he doesn&apos;t, he&apos;ll return to England in need of a long shower and a new job.  But the potential story of the year is to be found down in the first division, where Marc Overmars will be making his comeback in professional football. Now 35 years old, he played his way to a contract on the strength of his performance in Jaap Stam&apos;s farewell match. Four years ago the bite-sized winger had to retire because of incessant knee trouble. Now he&apos;s back with Go Ahead Eagles, his first club, where he&apos;ll be looking to pick up where he left off \u2013 which is exactly what he did in his first match last week when it took him all of 30 minutes to injure himself. But as Van den Velde proselytised: &quot;If his appearance this season becomes a huge success I&apos;m afraid that&apos;ll say more about the level of our football than about Marc Overmars.&quot;  His dubious sales pitch shouldn&apos;t dissuade anyone from following the Dutch league this year; it should make for quite a spectacle - both on and off the pitch.

He has accidentally killed a little boy on their last job, and, as a not fully lapsed Irish Catholic, is plagued with guilt, so Christmas-tide in the medieval Belgian town their employer Harry (Ralph Fiennes) says is &quot;like a fairy tale&quot; gives him no joy. Being a tourist is like that, a matter of mood and temperament, and of the moment. Already, back in the mid-19th century, the hero of Arthur Hugh Clough&apos;s startlingly modern-feeling poem Amours de Voyage was lamenting that, contrary to expectations, &quot;Rome disappoints me much&quot; \u2013 he even calls it &quot;rubbishy&quot;. Ray&apos;s case-hardened senior partner Ken, however, is delighted to visit the canals, churches and art museums of Bruges. &quot;It&apos;s called sightseeing,&quot; he explains impatiently.     Health and safety might frown on that staircase ... Foreign Correspondent. Photo: Kobal    The cinema has always been drawn to the touristic, as it offers us in our armchairs the chance to see far-flung places and famous sites, and see them in motion. Once they&apos;d got beyond the excitement of filming babies, cyclists, gardeners and factories in 1895, the Lumi\u00e8res sent their new invention the Cinematograph off to Jerusalem or London to photograph another, more exotic reality. It is this travelogue tradition Hitchcock plays with in the way he uses the British Museum (Blackmail), the Statue of Liberty (Saboteur), Mount Rushmore (North by Northwest) or the Golden Gate Bridge (Vertigo) to ginger up the action and accentuate our entertainment \u2013 the settings themselves contribute a frisson. In Bruges honourably picks up this line of approach, using the great tower in the city&apos;s ancient square for a climactic deadly confrontation rather as Hitch used the tower of Westminster Cathedral in Foreign Correspondent.     Julie Christie has a look round lovely Venice in Don't Look Now. Photo: Kobal    But In Bruges also alludes explicitly to Nic Roeg&apos;s Don&apos;t Look Now, a film in a different register from Hitchcock&apos;s, set and shot in a wintry European city, equally full of canals and gloomy churches, that speaks vividly of a pre-cinematic past. Venice in that film dominates proceedings as much as any character \u2013 its chilly, echoing, empty canals and alleys get beyond the world of picture-postcards to become a metaphor for the psychological confusions of Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, the bereaved young parents of a dead girl. Sutherland&apos;s character is actually restoring an old church, getting intimately to grips with the fabric of the history of the place. In their degree, that&apos;s what Ken and Ray do when they go to Bruges&apos;s Groeninge Museum and find themselves faced by The Day of Judgment by Hieronymus Bosch. &quot;What&apos;s it about, then?&quot; asks Ray, puzzled. And the pair, both brought up Catholic, are led to discuss the afterlife. Ray, brooding on his sin, even engages in a touch of theology: &quot;Purgatory&apos;s kind of like the inbetweeny one. You weren&apos;t all that shit, but you&apos;re not great either... Like Tottenham.&quot; McDonagh&apos;s cunning script, in fact, turns Bruges into a Purgatory for the visitors, makes it loom larger than they expect. The superficiality of the usual tourist&apos;s experience \u2013 Tuesday Bruges, Wednesday Brussels, Thursday Amsterdam \u2013 gives way to a darker, fuller, deadlier story. More is at stake \u2013 it&apos;s a matter of life and death, and of redemption \u2013 which is all too appropriate, as among the sites they visit is the Heilig Bloed Basiliek, where a phial of Christ&apos;s Holy Blood is miraculously preserved.     Not looking for a gift shop ... Ingrid Bergman in Journey to Italy. Photo: Kobal    Such charting of a character&apos;s emotions through heightened responsiveness in a succession of apparently clich\u00e9d tourist experiences has a distinguished precedent in what is perhaps the greatest of films on the subject, Roberto Rossellini&apos;s 1953 Journey to Italy (Viaggio in Italia). The deeply unhappy, middle-aged, childless English couple Katherine (Ingrid Bergman, then married to Rossellini) and Alex (George Sanders) come to the romantic South \u2013 but they&apos;ve become strangers to each other, bicker, nurse resentments, flirt with others, agree to divorce. This marital drama \u2013 raw and moving \u2013 is registered in the sights Katherine goes to see, which bring home to her the great abyss of history and the littleness of humanity. In the Naples Archaeological Museum she encounters the eloquent statues of antiquity \u2013 sleek black-stone life-size figures with piercing white eyes, filmed with a mobile, craning camera and to a stirring score that marks her thrill of emotion at feeling suddenly such direct contact with the past. &quot;You feel that they&apos;re just like the men of today,&quot; she says later. Then she goes to the cave of the Cumaean Sibyl \u2013 as quoted in Eliot&apos;s The Waste Land \u2013 an echoing, threatening vacancy. The third touristic set-piece has Katherine and Alex together visiting the dead city of Pompeii and watching as archaeologists find and fill with plaster the hollow shape in the ground left by the vaporized bodies of &quot;two people, just as they were at the moment when they died. A man and a woman&quot;. The scene feels authentic, like documentary, as the dust is brushed away to reveal a cast of the twisted forms of the long-gone lovers. Katherine bursts into tears, and has to leave: the tourist spectacle \u2013 is this all there is to love? \u2013 has penetrated deeply, prompts her to a realization about her own love, her own existence. For her, the clich\u00e9 &quot;See Naples and die&quot; comes to ugly life.     Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint get up close and personal to Mount Rushmore. Photo: Kobal    The fourth visit in the film shows her the Catacombs \u2013 vast stone vaults lined with skulls and bones, a vision of death \u2013 but, paradoxically, also where Italians come to pray for fecundity. &quot;I want so much to have a child,&quot; Katherine&apos;s female Italian companion tells her. It&apos;s what Katherine herself wants, or needs, we see in her troubled reaction. She has been brought face to face by Italy with the realities of the human condition \u2013 its brevity and fragility, and the importance of love and renewed life. This prepares us for the film&apos;s astonishing final scene, in which Katherine and Alex realize how much is at stake for them, as they&apos;re torn apart by surging crowds in the middle of a thronged Catholic street-procession. In Naples, as in Bruges or Venice, the tourist is never really taking a holiday from his or her life. The static, picturesque postcard image can with cinema&apos;s aid become animated, colourful, noisy, thrilling \u2013 but can also turn urgent, even deathly, as it meets our gaze \u2013 a means of transformation, or a bringer of crisis.", "sentences": ["The superficiality of the usual tourist&apos;s experience \u2013 Tuesday Bruges, Wednesday Brussels, Thursday Amsterdam \u2013 gives way to a darker, fuller, deadlier story."], "title": "DVD connections uses In Bruges as its starting point for a tour round the movies' best tourism", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/26/inbruges.holidaysonfilm", "tags": ["Film", "Travel", "Belgium holidays", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-08-25T23:01:00Z", "article": "\u00b7 What is it with Scientologists?

Luckily there is the &quot;anecdotal&quot; evidence. &quot;Actor Stephen Fry is the author of the book The Liar and was an active supporter of the liberal British Labour party, though he did not vote for it in a recent election because it was not leftist enough on the Iraq war,&quot; they tell us. &quot;The 49-year-old actor has been tormented by mental illness for much of his life.

Since Ray Lewis&apos;s enforced departure from Boris Johnson&apos;s administration in London, many complain they have been struggling to identify anything close to a strategy. A launch has been much talked about, but has been delayed and delayed. We counsel patience to those who will listen, but still there are figures previously sympathetic to Boris who wonder if it will take a protest march on City Hall to refocus the mayor&apos;s attention. Some even call for the return of Tim Parker, the most recent of Boris&apos;s deputies to walk the plank. For all his foibles as an avid asset-stripper, he seemed keen to prioritise some form of response and to cut down on the rhetoric. We are missing him already, and we hear we are not the only ones. Who would have thought it?  \u00b7 We bring proof that no group can insulate itself from the soap opera that is Amy Winehouse.

We don&apos;t have to be serious all the time,&quot; protests his friend. &quot;Well I think she should stay in rehab,&quot; interjects a third. &quot;She is cruel to animals, anyway.&quot; And with that he drags them back to more familiar territory, with some rabid stuff about Hitler and a court circular about soccer violence in Amsterdam.

But the plot is still packed: the sunflowers and sweet corn are high and happy, the tagetes are adding vivid splashes of scarlet in every corner, the spinach and chicories are in and the autumn carrots and salsify are coming on stream. We have much to thank Mary for: she&apos;s kindly given us a piece of her plot and we help her with heavy work. 29 June, Sunday lunchtimeWe finally get to finish Mary&apos;s fruit cage. It&apos;s the first proper payment of our debt to her. We had put up support struts and crossbars maybe a month ago, but then the garden centre couldn&apos;t supply the amount of netting we need (a massive 40ft by 15ft). Predictably, Mary finds it on the net. Black and soft, it looks like something more suitable for holding in old ladies&apos; hair, but it will keep out the greedy pigeons and ensure her currants and raspberries go to their rightful owner. 6 July, Sunday afternoonHoward and I stand proud at the unearthing of the prettiest pink potatoes you could hope for. This time last year we&apos;d had to ditch our spuds and tomatoes due to endemic blight on the site and we still shudder at the thought of the slush. We had first thought that we would give them a miss this year but, apart perhaps from peas, nothing honours the effort of growing-your-own like hours-old new potatoes. We rush home to eat ours for Sunday supper, their floury texture perfect for soaking up a pot-roast chicken&apos;s fennelly juice.  19 July, Saturday afternoonDisaster! A rat&apos;s been in the &apos;root&apos; bed. Instead of the shiny, ruby Red Duke of Yorks of only a week ago, the new crop have been stripped of their skin, like an apple that&apos;s been gnawed by an infant. Even worse than blight! Dispirited, we dig up the rest of the potato plants, salvage the spuds left untouched, stuff the holes with holly and pour down stinky comfrey &apos;tea&apos;. Guess there&apos;s always next year ... 23 July, Wednesday eveningHave taken to regularly stopping off at the plot after work. There is something sublime about a summer evening in your vegetable patch: the sun streaming through the emerald leaves and fennel flowers, grazing peas from the pod, admiring the bursting buds. Pottering around an allotment is a perfect antidote to office life. We plant a couple of rows of late salad leaves and cut a buttery lettuce for our BLT.  26 July, Saturday, early morningMy very favourite time at the plot. Close to dawn. The summer sun is more sluggish now. I can smell autumn in the air. The pumpkin flowers glow like faraway lanterns and bright orange calendula shines in the shadows. The fox is asleep on a straw bale. She has been recently hit by a car and lopes off slowly as I arrive. I fiddle about, fill a basket with purple beans, crimson chard and hot peppery rocket, and head down the hill before my wife is awake.  2 August, Saturday afternoon Howard is camping in Cornwall so we draft in the elite reserve. Taylor is happiest digging holes, but we have lots of beans to pick and he likes that. Two of our four wigwams are so heavily overgrown their hazels have snapped in half. The Trail of Tears beans are too strong for the sticks. I punch in emergency posts to hold them up. While I rip out the old peas and replace with another crop - we did well with seed-swap Endeavour and donated Oregon Sugar Pod - Taylor starts filling his tray. An hour later he is still at it and standing on a milk crate. He stops counting beans at 125 (he is only seven), while I plant Piccolo Provenzale and Champion of England. Later, we dig in rotted manure - well, Taylor watches, groans and holds his nose.  9 August, Saturday, early morningThe fox has stolen my shoes. Now I know they are supposed to be sneaky, but she and I are the only ones on the plot. She had even swung by as usual to say hello and - trying not to anthropomorphise here - friends don&apos;t steal each other&apos;s shoes. It started when I missed the camera case. Then I see my shoes have disappeared, too. To explain: I keep spare boots on site and the shoes I&apos;d worn here are missing. Confused (well, it is not yet 6am), I hunt through the shed, looking in corners and under buckets. It doesn&apos;t make sense. Then I spot where she has dropped them in the hedge. I never find the camera case ... 10 August, Sunday afternoonA glorious afternoon of butterflies and bees. There are so many flowers on site this year. Fragrant sweet peas and roses, deep-hued hollyhocks, cascades of nasturtium everywhere. I tidy the Mexican tagetes. They have grown into Leylandii-like hedges, nearly 5ft high and dominating the dividing path, barring Mary from her seedlings. But the bees favour our sunflowers. No flying visits these, they linger for hours at a time. We have lots of sunflowers this year, a brilliantly coloured mix from master breeder Alan Kapuler at Peace Seeds. We have planted them in a run in the middle of the plot, in a clump in a corner and as a border interspersed with three kinds of corn. We have been a bit worried about the white corn. It is scarily huge at more than 3m high, but unlike the Painted Mountain and Baby Blue Jade which have been showing tassel &apos;silks&apos; for weeks, the white has been stubbornly flower-free. At least it was until today.  13 August, Wednesday eveningThere has been monsoon rain and tropical winds this week and I have lain awake worrying about the plot (I know!). I stop in after work to see if any of the sunflowers or sweet corn need staking. Miraculously they are mostly fine, though there is some flower damage. I tie up a couple of sunflowers, pick off stray tomato stems and pull more beetroot to take home. 17 August, Sunday lunchtimeArrive to tomato blight and broken dreams. For our second year, we won&apos;t be picking fruit from the vine and eating it there and then. Dreaded all week that the wet would get to them. Mary is putting her faith in Bordeaux mixture but, for us, for another year, it is over. Rats get the potatoes, blight gets the tomatoes and the fox gets the camera case. But we have learnt a lot, grown a lot and now we can plan for winter.

Check back here throughout the day for all the deals.  9.15am: The phones of managers, agents, chairmen and players are already ringing across the country. Check back here throughout the day for all the deals.  9.26am: A lot of the papers this morning have announced that the Newcastle striker-turned-midfielder-turned-neither Alan Smith has signed for Everton for \u00a33m, although there&apos;s no official confirmation, unless it&apos;s cowering humiliated somewhere on the Everton website. In the meantime, take a quick look at some of the other rumours from the red-tops.  9.32am: The Porto winger Ricardo Quaresma is in Milan to have a medical with Inter, according to, well, Inter. And this story right here. Somewhere near the other end of the spectrum, the Rangers forward Alan Gow has rejected the chance to join Blackpool.  9.35am: Deportivo La Coruna have claimed that Newcastle are in for their Spain U-21 striker Xisco. He&apos;s reportedly on his way to Tyneside for \u00a35.7m, and Villa were apparently sniffing around him too.  9.44am: You&apos;ve probably seen it already, but if not here&apos;s footage of the Newcastle chairman Mike Ashley downing one of several pints during his team&apos;s thrashing at Arsenal on Saturday. This has outraged boozers in this office at least - how come Ashley was allowed to take his pint to his seat at the Emirates?  9.48am: &quot;For me, transfer deadline day is just like Christmas,&quot; says Colin Greer. &quot;To get into the spirit, I&apos;ll warm up some mulled wine and make a turkey sandwich for lunch. Later in the day (after the wine kicks in) I am going to call my parents later and yell at them. &apos;Tis the season!&quot; The seasonal cheer runs out for Orient fans right here: &quot;Oh yeah, I just saw Paul Stalteri driving into the Leyton Orient training ground!&quot;  9.49am: &quot;Does anyone remember that breaking news in at the beginning of last year at this very same spot about Ryan Donk moving from RKC Waalwijk to AZ Alkmaar?&quot; wonders Arno Onink. Not me, but this next bit confirms what I&apos;ve read on the wires: &quot;Well now he&apos;s on his way to West Brom! You lovely Guardian readers surely were among the first UK football lovers to pick up on Ryan&apos;s existence.&quot;  9.54am: Big news right here: Vedran Corluka has agreed to join Spurs from Manchester City. And they&apos;ve already got the picture of him in his Spurs shirt and everything on their website, and a bland quote: &quot;I am delighted to be here because I am coming to a big club with great players, great ambition and also my best friend [Luka Modric] is here so it is a very happy day for me.&quot; No fee mentioned yet. Corluka is 22 and used to play for Dynamo Zagreb. City signed Pablo Zabaleta at the weekend.  10am: &quot;Re your photograph,&quot; starts Gary Naylor, who hasn&apos;t seen my photograph as far as I know. &quot;Who&apos;s signing Alain Delon?&quot; Oh, that photo. &quot;Will David Moyes be bidding for Jean-Paul Belmondo?&quot; Take it up with Rayner Simpson: &quot;It could just be my Monday morning eyes, but I could swear that&apos;s a picture of Andy Garcia.&quot;  10.05am: The prolific &quot;Staff and agencies&quot; is all over the Corluka to Spurs story. Meanwhile, do we believe David Bartram? &quot;I&apos;ve just started a job in Beijing and bumped into none other than Dong Fangzhou during my lunchbreak. Although my Mandarin is limited, from what I gathered he was on his way to the airport having been released by Manchester United the other day to rush through a transfer to Leyton Orient. Apparently Barry Hearn was very keen to push the O&apos;s in the emerging Asian market. Anyway, fingers crossed he makes it to Leyton before midnight.&quot; No. No, we don&apos;t.  10.10am: ..... Investment complete takeover of Manchester City ..... SkySports ...... REPORTS: Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and ......  10.20am: Neil Ingham is not alone to have noticed some vacancies on the Liverpool wings: &quot;Normally I&apos;d be really excited at the propsect of some last minute deals into Anfield but today I&apos;m worried - Rafa could be about to get rid of Pennant, Finnan and Voronin, which is fine by me. Only problem is, it sounds like only Riera will be coming in (again fine by me). We could have a season of hoping El Zhar comes on to &apos;add some creativity&apos;.&quot; How about a season of hoping Ryan Babel comes on? &quot;Make me up a right sided attacking Anfield-bound rumour, just to get me through the day.&quot; I&apos;m not making up anything about Liverpool, I&apos;m afraid Neil. I got in enough trouble yesterday for just reporting the facts about their abject display against Villa.  10.24am: &quot;I live in York and haven&apos;t seen any footballers anywhere this morning,&quot; laments Dan Bear. &quot;Surely this means that Diego Milito will be announced as a Spurs player by lunchtime.&quot; Well, that was mentioned in a couple of papers this morning, Dan, but apparently Ramos doesn&apos;t fancy him, despite the Wikipedia wag who added this to his entry within the past hour: &quot;On September 1st Diego joined English premier league club Tottenham Hotspur for a record fee of \u00a350,000,000 breaking the world transfer record.&quot;  10.26am: &quot;Gary Naylor&apos;s Alain Delon comment reminded me that there&apos;s a Brazilian footballer named Allan Dellon (sic), whose Dad was evidently a Delon fan,&quot; says Jon Hawkins. &quot;Needless to say, he would comfortably step into my Players Named After French Actors and Perfumers XI.&quot;  10.30am: Just 13 hours 30 minutes to go.  10.34am: Hull City are reportedly after Daniel Cousin for a season-long loan from Rangers. He scored and got sent off yesterday in the Old Firm match, which, I thought, secured him a lifetime contract in Glasgow.  10.45am: A temporary lull on transfer deadline day, giving you the perfect chance to spin through:Paul Doyle&apos;s blog about Liverpool&apos;s woesKevin McCarra on the England squadOr tinker with your Fantasy Football squad Full details of this Man City takeover are coming up.  10.50am: So, Manchester City have bought a full-back, sold a full-back and brought a hero back home, but they&apos;ve also been sold lock, stock and barrel to Abu Dhabi.  10.55am: The former Rangers, Coventry, Dundee United, Hearts and Celtic defender Steven Pressley has joined Randers. That&apos;s not a typo: Randers are a Danish Superligaen side.  11am: More details on the Corluka story: ever the dutiful PLC, Spurs have announced details of the deal to the stock exchange. The Croatian defender cost them \u00a38.5m and he&apos;s signed on a six-year contract. &quot;Exactly how many right backs do they need?&quot; wonders Nick Byrne. &quot;Could we see a similar stock piling reminiscent of Martin Jol&apos;s insatiable appetite for centre mids? Come 11.57 tonight expect Glenn Johnson, Danny Simpson, Grame Murty and Michel Salgado to be forming a queue outside White Hart Lane.&quot; I think I&apos;m right in saying that only Alan Hutton is a right-back, and he&apos;s got a stress fracture in the foot. And what with Corluka being able to play at centre back, where King and Woodgate are certain to crumple at some time this season, it seems a surprisingly sensible signing by Tottenham&apos;s usually absurd standards.  11.10am: &quot;Whoa, whoa!!!&quot; bellows Colin Greer, and I wish I could replicate the size of the font he uses to stress his main point. &quot;PAUL STALTERI is a right-back. Until he signs with anyone else, he is a 100% Spur.&quot; True, although he lost his squad number over the summer and has been training with the &quot;development squad&quot; by all accounts, so watch this space.  11.15am: &quot;Can you give us some insight into your working methods today Howard?&quot; says Andrew Darbyshire, who is already massively over-thinking this. &quot;I&apos;d like to think you were juggling five phones as you get exclusive insights from the game&apos;s &apos;super&apos;-agents, but am more inclined to believe you&apos;re sat back watching Sky Sports News and surfing transfer rumour sites?&quot; ONE of these options is right. That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.  11.21am: Not a transfer, but the former Celtic captain Neil Lennon has been treated in hospital after being attacked in a Glasgow street. More to come. &quot;Randers, can we know more about this superbly named team?&quot; asks the equally superbly named Mark Eyeington. &quot;Is it bank-rolled by a South African hotel tycoon with a shady past? Is it supported by Carlsberg-swilling, viking-helmet-wearing supporters prone to rape and pillage opposition fans&apos; female partners on away trips? Randers. It&apos;s got a ring about it. I can think of a few EPL players who should play for Randers.&quot; Let&apos;s leave it there.  11.30am: Round-upManchester City have reportedly been taken over by Abu Dhabi investorsDeportivo de la Coruna have confirmed that the striker Xisco is off to NewcastleTottenham have signed Vedran Corluka for \u00a38.5m from City and confirmed that they paid \u00a314m for Pavulychenko.Dimitar Berbatov looks like Alain Delon, Andy Garcia, David Ginola or &quot;life-long Cure fan Albert Camus&quot;.Chris Gunter is also a Tottenham right back  11.40am: As expected, the rumour mill is churning up some right old bunkum today, but this story from the Manchester Evening News is a good one (thanks to David Hendry for the tip), and I hope that James Hamilton is right about this: &quot;Just heard the news that former Everton and Blackburn star Craig Short has re-signed with his first club Pickering Town, joining Jonathan&apos;s brother Ricky Greening in the Pikes push for promotion to the Unibond First Division. You heard it here first!&quot; An exclusive. At last.  11.45am: &quot;Is this the most boring transfer window ever?&quot; asks Ben Nathan. &quot;Endless speculation with most of them not going through.&quot; True, but it&apos;s not so different from most years; there&apos;s always far more sound and fury than substance.  11.50am: You&apos;ll probably hear this joke a few times between now and forever,  so let&apos;s give Mark Taylor first credit: &quot;I think Newcastle are scrapping the barrel a bit with Xisco, The Thong Song he did a few years back was truly dreadful.&quot;  11.55am: Portsmouth sign Nadir Belhadj&quot;While Tottenham are snapping up every right back in European Football, Pompey are doing the same for left backs,&quot; says Andy Harris, who should be proud to know that he learnt about this before most of the news wires. &quot;Algerian international left back Nadir Belhadj signs on loan from Lens for the season to join Arsenal left back Armand Traore signed on loan a couple of days ago.&quot; It&apos;s true, incidentally.  12.05pm: &quot;Liverpool sign Brazilian superstar!&quot; proclaims Patrick Walsh, who is doing my job for me. &quot;...well, future superstar.you might want to check the Liverpool official site, as we have got 18 year old Vitor Flora on a free from Botafogo. He&apos;s a striker, so you can bet he&apos;ll be playing in a sole-crushing wing role within six months, or is immediately loaned out to Hereford.&quot;  12.15pm: Newcastle land Ignacio Gonzalez on a one-year loan deal. He&apos;s a Uruguayan midfielder, who was signed by Valencia and then immediately loaned to Newcastle. A few people have been emailing about Corluka-gate, referring to the photo on the Spurs website which, apparently, was taken on August 8, when he &quot;originally&quot; signed for Spurs (&quot;with a Nikon camera at 14:29&quot;), before the deal apparently collapsed. &quot;Does this make him an Ince-style Judas or an excellent pro who&apos;s been mucked about?&quot; wonders James Hopkin. Something similar happened with the Pavlyuchenko-in-a-Spurs-shirt pictures, which were on a football forum before he&apos;d been officially signed.  12.20pm: The Manchester City takeover has now been confirmed, according to the club. There&apos;s going to pages and pages written about this, especially since the new investors seem to be the Adu Dhabi royal family, who are richer than Roman Abramovich. All the latest news is behind this (appropriately) blue text.  12.25pm: &quot;Not that it is of any interest, so it will fit perfectly in the Mill,&quot; jibes Pascal Hofmann. &quot;But Ajax are not letting go of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Not that anyone would table an offer, but still.&quot; Meanwhile, John Bains is not a Newcastle fan. &quot;RE: Xisco. How appropriate that the Barcodes should sign a player named after a wild west hero \u2013 when they sign his partner Pancho, it will complete the whole cowboy outfit.&quot;  12.33pm: Jason Shackell moves to Wolves from Norwich. Should that be in bold text? Why not, even though it is subject to a medical. &quot;Have Middlesborough signed any fans yet?&quot; zings Gary Naylor.  12.40pm: &quot;I signed Xisco in Football Manager and he was a very good player,&quot; insists Brendan McCarthy, who goes on to rather undermine his argument. &quot;Until he got upset that I was playing Bobby Zamora ahead of him.&quot; And Stefano Seedorf, baby cousin of big Clarence, has signed for FC Den Bosch, according to Dutch football email correspondent Pascal Hofmann.  12.54pm: Frustrated Guardian.co.uk reporter bids \u00a31.50 for minute-by-minute application that doesn&apos;t break down every five minutesBid is rejected. &quot;Why was the Man City deal done today?&quot; asks James Dann. &quot;Is there a rule that says that club transfers have to be done during the window? Or is Thaksin hoping that by selling today, the Thai police wont notice that he&apos;s left the building to start a peaceful new life as a ditch cleaner named Mitch?&quot; It&apos;s a theory, although it actually started with an article on arabianbusiness.com that came out today. There were even some photos of the investors holding up a Man City shirt with &quot;Abu Dhabi United&quot; written on the back. And this from the one-man Dutch football rumour mill Pascal Hofmann, whose missive is best read in a Steve McClaren accent: &quot;Rosenborg BK have beaten Arsenal and Man United to the signature of Ghanese toptalent Anthony Annan. IK Start is on the receiving end of 1.2 mln Euro for letting go of the 22 year old defensive midfielder. He&apos;s signed up till 2011.&quot;  1pm: Here&apos;s Les Roopanarine to put me out of my misery and to guide you through the afternoon. Thanks for your emails and keep them coming to Les. His address is up there, look.  1.12pm: Greetings all, and welcome to phase two of this tortuous journey through the world of transfer mayhem. Let&apos;s start with Crispin Lake&apos;s admirably thorough response to Mark Eyeington&apos;s enquiry about Randers (11.21am). &quot;Randers are situated on the island of Jutland and have been in the Superliga for a few years now,&quot; says Crispin, who as a Brit living in Danish exile should know. &quot;They are managed by Colin Todd, and his assistant trainer is Stig Tofting (ex-Hamburg and Bolton). Their goalkeeper is Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard (he played a few games for Man City) and other has-beens include Carsten Fredgaard (Sunderland) and Marc Nygaard (QPR).&quot; How the not-so-mighty have fallen.  1.23pm: I can confirm that Howard wasn&apos;t kidding when he said our minute-by-minute application gives up the ghost every few minutes. And Ajax technical manager Danny Blind can confirm Pascal Hofmann&apos;s suspicion (12.25pm) that Ajax striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar, who has been linked with Real Madrid, Arsenal and Tottenham, is going nowhere. &quot;Selling such an important player on the last day of the transfer window is impossible,&quot; said Blind in De Telegraaf. Although clearly less impossible than getting this report to work properly.  1.42pm: Anyone who missed Howard&apos;s earlier reference to Manchester City&apos;s rumoured British transfer record bid for Dimitar Berbatov (11.40am) - yes, Mike Higgins, I&apos;m talking to you - will want to know that Manchester City have apparently made a bid for United target Dimitar Berbatov. It&apos;s rumoured that the bid would be a British transfer record (\u00a337m, since you ask).  1.52pm: Midfielder Blerim Dzemaili, who made just one appearance for Bolton last season, will have to wait awhile before making another. Torino have signed the 22-year-old on a one-year loan deal. Meanwhile, Berbatov apparently legged it from Spurs training this morning - pausing only for a quick fag, one would imagine - to board a plane from Stansted to Manchester. But whereabouts in Manchester? Meanwhile, Arno Onink - who probably has to spell his name to people down the phone as frequently as yours truly - asks: &quot;Is that minute-by-minute application run by BAA?&quot; Very probably.  2.02pm: West Ham defender George McCartney is having a medical at Sunderland. Meanwhile, Spurs boss Juande Ramos says of the Berbatov saga: &quot;One way or another, I hope it&apos;s finalised today.&quot; And so say all of us.  2.06pm: &quot;A big good afternoon and welcome to you too, Les,&quot; says a cheery Hugh Watson. &quot;Or should it be Roop?&quot; No, Hugh, it most certainly should not. &quot;And if so, is that pronounced like Co-op?&quot; I have no idea. &quot;Why can&apos;t David Moyes get anyone to sign for Everton?&quot; asks Hugh, suddenly coming over all sensible. &quot;I mean, he must be a reasonably good manager because they&apos;re always finishing far higher than they deserve to, given their dreadfully thin squad. And they&apos;re not a small club, really \u2013 with a fair bit of tradition. You&apos;d have thought there would be a queue half way up Gwladys Street. It&apos;s a mystery, that&apos;s what it is.&quot; Well Hugh, they signed Lars Christian Jacobsen and Segundo Castillo last week - the real problem seems to be finding quality. How Moyes could do with a marquee player to appease the fans.  2.14pm: &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be delicious,&quot; says Tom Hopkins, &quot;if - after all his whining about going to a bigger, better club in Manchester - Berbatov got shipped out to Man City? God surely does have a sense of humour after all.&quot; I&apos;m saying nothing, Tom.  2.20pm: &quot;Julian Gray is apparently around the Fulham area having gone up for a medical ahead of a move,&quot; writes Donald Cox, kindly pointing me in the direction of this snippet from the Coventry Telegraph. &quot;As a Coventry fan, this makes me love Roy Hodgson even more than before,&quot; says Donald, shattering the fond illusions of Fulham fans everywhere.  2.27pm: &quot;It would be all the more delicious,&quot; says Robert Jones in response to Tom Hopkins (2.14pm), &quot;if in addition to your Berbatov theory Wenger stepped in and took Robinho on loan.&quot; Now you&apos;re talking. Sadly, however, the reality is rather more mundane: Hull are hoping to seal a loan move for Rangers striker Daniel Cousin.  2.32pm: The grinding of the Manchester rumour mill continues unabated. Mark Hughes has reportedly confirmed that City&apos;s bid for Dimitar Berbatov is genuine, and says that he is set to meet the broody Bulgarian for talks later today. What&apos;s more, he might even tear himself away from the golf course to do so.  2.34pm: &quot;Is it me, or does Mark Hughes have a fantastic sense of humour?&quot; asks Gareth Bourne. &quot;His main activity today is scuppering his city rivals from getting the player they have coveted for a year. Berbatov won&apos;t want to go to City, though, because they are not in Big Cup - and Tottenham won&apos;t sell to United for a lesser amount if they have had a higher offer elsewhere.&quot; Fair point.  2.39pm: &quot;Why do these super rich types only buy clubs who play in blue?&quot; muses Simon Martin. &quot;Is it that red was traditionally the colour of communists, and they are concerned that if they bought such a club their money could be used to purchase tractors which are then distributed to the poor of the parish?&quot; Any billionaires contemplating the bucking of that trend should address their enquiries to Mr R. Parry, Chief Executive, Anfield Road, Liverpool L4 0TH ...  2.45pm: While we&apos;re on the subject of Merseyside, Everton fans may be relieved to hear that Louis Saha has signed a two-year deal, with the option of a third, after passing his medical. Or they may not. Meanwhile, Stoke have apparently tabled a \u00a35m bid for Cardiff midfielder Joe Ledley. Tony Pulis also has a beady eye on Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant, who would command a similar price.  2.54pm: &quot;Chelsea defender Paolo Ferreira is currently talking to West Ham about a move down the table but in the starting XI,&quot; writes Pascal Hofmann, thoughtfully saving me the bother.  2.59pm: &quot;Wigan Athletic&apos;s third choice keeper, Carlo Nash, looks set to become Everton&apos;s second choice keeper if the Liverpool Daily Post is to be believed,&quot; points out Adam Leier, continuing the good work begun by Pascal while even going one better by pointing me in the direction of this piece from the Liverpool Daily Post.  3.04pm: If you Google &apos;Victor Nsofor Obinna&apos;, the following Wikipedia link tops the list: &quot;Victor Roger Charlie Zulu Nsofor Obinna (born March 25, 1987 in Jos, Nigeria) is a Nigerian footballer who plays as a striker for Everton.&quot; He doesn&apos;t. And he won&apos;t. Obinna&apos;s work permit application has been declined, scuppering a projected loan move to Goodison Park.  3.08pm: Alex Walsh wins the award for the afternoon&apos;s first Louis Saha gag: &quot;Apparently Saha has broken his wrist signing the Everton contract this afternoon. He is expected to be out for the next four weeks.&quot; If Saha weren&apos;t so injury prone, would United fans - given the speculation surrounding Berbatov - be ruing Fergie&apos;s decision to bundle the French striker off to Goodison?  3.17pm: Unsurprisingly, the transfer antics of a certain Bulgarian are dominating your email contributions right now. A selection: &quot;If Man City are to sign Berbatov, how much of his decision to eschew the bright lights of the other side of Manchester might be attributed to the presence (and presumably persuasion) of Martin Petrov?&quot; (Stewart Airey); &quot;Wouldn&apos;t Spurs be shooting themselves in the foot by selling Berbatov to City? After all, it&apos;s much more likely that City are going to be their closest rivals this year - for UEFA cup, league position etc&quot; (Ben Wilkie); &quot;As a Spurs fan I would like to see Berbs sod off, and it would be funny if he went to Man City. Not only would we get more money, but Man Utd wouldn&apos;t get him. As long as the sulker goes - we&apos;ve all had enough&quot; (Will Bouma - presumably not the Aston Villa model).  3.26pm: Moving lightly on, Giles Page wants to know &quot;if anykind billionaires have decided to take over another club in blue - chiefly, Brighton? Any more transfers?&quot; Sadly for Seagulls fans, no. But watch this space, Giles, because boss Micky Adams had this to say after Saturday&apos;s goalless draw with Leyton Orient: &quot;After performances like that you have to consider every option. Maybe we will sit down and have a little think about things.&quot; Best get a move on, Mr Adams.  3.35pm:  BREAKING NEWS!!!! Manchester City&apos;s bid for Dimitar Berbatov is \u00a334m - not \u00a337m, \u00a330m-plus, or even \u00a37m more than the offer tabled by United. You heard it here first. Meanwhile, Mark Hughes has had this to say: &quot;We&apos;ve made an offer and now it&apos;s about the boy making a decision. We&apos;re very excited about what&apos;s going on.&quot; Well, there&apos;s no accounting for taste.  3.39pm: Stoke have agreed a fee to re-sign Danny Higginbotham, who left the Britannia Stadium for Sunderland last summer. Meanwhile, this tantalising snippet from Stephen Connelly: &quot;My brother-in-law, who works in a supermarket in Airdrie, has just phoned to tell me that Wayne Bridge was in his shop looking for the Hoops. He duly showed him the aisle where the spaghetti hoops are kept, but it was the green and white hoops of Celtic he was after. A one-year loan deal, I&apos;m reliably told by Meat Counter Manager Mick Cronin.&quot; Don&apos;t you just love transfer deadline day?  3.44pm: ... and here&apos;s another transfer gem, this time from Nicholas Cendrowicz: &quot;Apparently Steve Finnan has been transferred to Espanyol. That&apos;s what Marca is saying!&quot; Heady times, Nicholas; heady times.  3.49pm: After making just one appearance for Wigan since his arrival from Sparta Rotterdam last summer, Dutch winger Rachid Bouaouzan if off to warm the bench at Eredivisie side NEC Nijmegen instead. Meanwhile, some well-earned gloating from David Hendry: &quot;Remember at 11.40 when you (your colleague) called my Berbatov to City story &quot;right old Bunkum&quot;? Well look at you all now!!! Ahahahahaaahhhaaahahahaa (Evil Mr Burns-esque crazed laugh of power).&quot; Fair dos, David.  3.55pm: &quot;Hey, Roop,&quot; writes Alan Cooper, continuing a disturbing trend, &quot;how can you have missed the utterly thrilling news that Ipswich have signed Jon Stead on loan from Sheffield Utd? At least it has actually happened (unlike the Berbatov nonsense).&quot; How indeed? For the record, the deal will run until January and a fee has already been agreed should Ipswich boss Jim Magilton see fit to make the move permanent.  4.05pm: Berbatov? Pah! &quot;Miguel \u00c1ngel Llera to the MK Dons - wow!&quot; enthuses Michael Garton. The Spanish defender joins from Spanish Second Division side Hercules CF. At least he will if he can successfully negotiate the 6,497 roundabouts that stand between the M1 and stadium:mk. Meanwhile, Zenit St Petersburg have declared - categorically, finally and irrevocably - that Andrei Arshavin will not be moving in this transfer window. Don&apos;t rejoice too soon, though: it simply means we&apos;ll have to revisit the whole wretched saga again come January.  4.10pm: Steve Finnan&apos;s move to Espanyol has been confirmed. You wonder how that will go down with Liverpool fans - is Arbeloa really a better bet for the right-back slot than the classy Republic of Ireland international?  4.20pm: Interesting question from Liam Walsh, who writes: &quot;I was just wondering if Manchester City can actually make any signings today. Are they not bound by the &apos;due diligence&apos; stuff that happens when someone takes over a club? Or did I miss all of that?&quot; Good point, Liam. City will indeed be bound by due diligence, but presumably there&apos;s nothing to stop the new owners injecting cash into the club up-front should they so wish.  4.22pm: This just in from the increasingly indispensable Pascal Hofmann: &quot;Collins John is joining Bouaouzan in moving to NEC Nijmegen. The 22-year-old is on a free transfer from Fulham, pending a medical.&quot;  4.29pm: Remember Arsenal? Christiaan Hartsuiker does. &quot;So far only uninteresting clubs have signed uninteresting players, and all the hype has made the Berbatov transfer saga equally uninteresting, so all that I can think of being interesting is the potential totally out-of-the-blue signing Arsene Wenger will make today,&quot; writes a clearly uninterested Christian. In more interesting news - well, marginally - Bristol City have signed John Akinde from Ebbsfleet (or Gravesend and Northfleet, as some of us traditionalists still prefer to think of them). Akinde&apos;s switch makes a little piece of transfer history: it&apos;s the first to be decided by a club&apos;s support. 82.3% of Ebbsfleet&apos;s owners, myfootballclub.co.uk, voted in favour of letting the 19-year-old head for Ashton Gate.  4.36pm: Ye gods and little fishes, as my fearsome sixth-form teacher used to say in primary school, what is going on with this Berbatov transfer? Oh, sorry - I&apos;m meant to be telling you, aren&apos;t I? Well, I can tell you this: Berbatov has apparently been spotted at Manchester United&apos;s Carrington training ground. Looks like Mark Hughes can remain focussed on his golf after all.  4.41pm:  Liverpool&apos;s car-boot sale continues as Andriy Voronin packs his lead-lined strikers&apos; boots and heads back to the Bundesliga. Hertha Berlin have agreed to take the Ukrainian on a season-long loan.  4.45pm: &quot;Yes! Great news for Liverpool fans!&quot; purrs Alistair Cubbon, happily conceding that his undisguised delight over Voronin&apos;s departure does &quot;nothing for Anglo-German relations.&quot; Meanwhile, Southampton manager Jan Poortvliet has signed 21-year old attacker Romain Gasmi from RC Strasbourg. &quot;The midfielder currently has a broken foot but should still be more useful than Rudi Skacel,&quot; sighs Tony Lehrle-Fry.  4.50pm: BREAKING NEWS!!! Reports are emerging from Spain that Real Madrid have made a \u00a336.5m bid for - cue drum roll - Dimitar Berbatov.  4.54pm: I&apos;m still trying to get my head round the latest twist in the Berbatov story. Still, let&apos;s be grateful for small mercies: at least this stultifying saga - in it&apos;s latest, three-headed format, at any rate - has been compressed into a few hours. &quot;Howdy The Roop/Rooper/El Rooperino (if you&apos;re not into the whole brevity thing),&quot; writes Michael Friel - who, I would venture, is a good deal less amusing than he might imagine - &quot;with Madrid now sticking their oar in the question has to be asked - is Berbatov that good? I mean, REALLY?&quot;  5.04pm: &quot;This transfer window has been horrendous for us,&quot; writes Liverpool fan Chris Marshall, still reeling from the sale of Steve Finnan. &quot;We&apos;ve wasted weeks chasing a midfielder who isn&apos;t better than we already have, miserably failed to strengthen properly by buying players we actually need - like wingers - spanked \u00a320m on a very over-rated Irishman, and now just got rid of a very under-rated Irishman for sod all. Rafa is really testing our faith.&quot; What is it they say up your way, Chris? In Rafa we trust? For the sake of a competitive league, if nothing else, let&apos;s hope Benitez is a man with a plan.  5.09pm: Tottenham are set to replace Dimitar Berbatov with ... Emile Heskey!!! And in a further twist, Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, the prospective new owner of Manchester City, has apparently revealed that - never mind Berbatov - the club have registered bids for Valencia&apos;s David Villa and Stuttgart&apos;s Mario Gomez.  5.15pm: Goalkeeper Mark Bunn has joined Blackburn from Northampton for an undisclosed fee. Bunn, who has signed a four-year deal, was apparently whisked out of the reckoning for Northampton&apos;s weekend clash with Tranmere Rovers and told to head for Lancashire pronto. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely delighted to be here,&quot; said Bunn. &quot;It is a dream come true really.&quot; Meanwhile, apropos of Berbatov&apos;s alleged presence at Carrington, David Savage wants to know: &quot;Was this just before Elvis arrived, or just after?&quot;  5.25pm: David Hendry, who first opened the can of worms containing a certain Mr Berbatov at 11.40 this morning, has stuck his head gingerly above the parapet to plead for forgiveness. &quot;I agree with Michael,&quot; says David, &quot;he isn&apos;t that good, and I thoroughly regret bringing everyone&apos;s attention to the article in the first place. Apologies.&quot; No need to be sorry, David - particularly given that Tottenham have apparently accepted City&apos;s offer.  5.33pm: &quot;Heskey to replace Berba?&quot; stammers an incredulous Andres Tomlin. &quot;Please say it ain&apos;t so!! Surely with the additional \u00a310m in euros being thrown in our lap we can afford to make Zenit an offer they&apos;d be daft to refuse.&quot; Apparently not, Andres - word is Zenit won&apos;t be allowing Arshavin to move until January at the earliest (see below, 4.05pm).  5.36pm: &quot;Best transfer window news for Southend fans, watch us take League One!&quot; enthuses Paul Napper after learning - from the Croydon Advertiser, no less - that Crystal Palace striker Dougie Freedman is set to sign a two-year deal with the Shrimpers.  5.44pm:  Liverpool have confirmed the signing of winger Albert Riera from Espanyol on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. And Porto winger Ricardo Quaresma is now Inter Milan winger Ricardo Quaresma after signing a five-year deal with the Serie A champions; Pele - no, not that one - has headed in the opposite direction. &quot;Roopster,&quot; writes David Henry - whom I hold personally responsible for the fact that I&apos;ve just received an email from a certain someone containing the words &quot;Roop-di-doo&quot; - &quot;does Mark Hughes know about any of this or is he still playing golf?&quot; Who knows, Henry, who knows?  5.51pm: Liverpool fans may have their reservations about the Riera deal, but they aren&apos;t shared by Rafael Benitez. &quot;&quot;Riera has the qualities we were looking for,&quot; said Benitez following confirmation of the midfielder&apos;s arrival. &quot;He&apos;s a left footer who normally plays on the left wing, he&apos;s good in the air, strong, powerful and a good crosser of the ball. He&apos;s the kind of player we have been talking about. He can beat players and get good deliveries into the area for our strikers.&quot;  5.55pm: West Brom have confirmed the loan signing of Ryan Donk, the AZ Alkmaar defender. Joey Barton is apparently being pursued by a top-10 Premier League club. And Tom Soares, the Crystal Palace midfielder, is on his way to Stoke to discuss personal terms after the two clubs agreed a fee.  6.04pm: Jonathan Grounds, the Middlesbrough defender, has joined Norwich on a three-month loan. Joel Shippey, however, has more pressing matters on his mind. &quot;Is no one else worried by Rafa&apos;s statement that Riera &apos;normally&apos; plays on the left wing?&quot; he wonders. &quot;Given his track record recently, I expect to see Riera at right-back next week.&quot;  6.11pm: Marca claim that Diego Milito has returned to Genoa from Real Zaragoza, who have also reportedly signed Palermo&apos;s Bosko Jankovic on loan. Not that Paul Moser cares. &quot;In the absence of any top rated footballers here in Paris (including all of the PSG team), I&apos;ve been reduced to looking up what &apos;roop&apos; means. It is to make a hoarse sound. And &apos;narine&apos; means nostril in French. Need I go on?&quot; Thanks all the same, Paul, but I think we&apos;d best leave it there.  6.18pm: &quot;For Berbatov, a fitness-test consists of visiting as many teams as possible in one day,&quot; quips Ian Copestake. Latest word is that Berbatov has met with Lord Fergie at Carrington - despite the fact that he doesn&apos;t have permission to do so, Tottenham having only agreed a fee with Man City.  6.25pm: &quot;Liverpool are so desperate for a left-winger I&apos;d be happy if they signed Michael Foot,&quot; sighs Nath Jones. Jonathan Norman, however, is more worried about Andriy Voronin&apos;s departure from Anfield. &quot;I don&apos;t see how getting rid of Voronin is a good thing for Liverpool if he isn&apos;t replaced,&quot; says Jonathan. &quot;He really wasn&apos;t that bad a backup and we now have only a 19-year-old Frenchman, barely out of his football diapers, as replacement for Torres, who is currently injured. I remain unconvinced.&quot;  6.34pm: It&apos;s not just Liverpool fans who are disillusioned with the day&apos;s transfer dealings. &quot;On Saturday&apos;s showing, Dougie Freedman would have to average three to four goals a game for us to stay up,&quot; laments Southend fan Bryan Pugs. &quot;And after the unbearable drabness of the summer transfer window, wouldn&apos;t it be better to condense the whole thing into one day?&quot; It feels like they did, Bryan.  6.41pm: Birmingham midfielder Sone Aluko is heading north after Aberdeen secured a deal to bring the 19-year-old, who spent last season on loan at the club, back to Pittodrie. &quot;Hello there Roop Doggy-dog,&quot; writes Tim Travers, the latest man to push his luck when it comes to naming names. &quot;I see that after the City farce Thaksin Shinawatra is to remain at the club as honorary president. Given his record isn&apos;t that a bit like Newcastle making Joey Barton their goodwill ambassador?&quot;  6.55pm: Arsenal fans desperate for news of a last-minute signing can forget about Gokhan Inler. The Swiss international has signed a contract extension with Udinese that should keep him at the club until the end of the 2012/13 campaign. &quot;I never had any doubts,&quot; said Inler. &quot;From the first day I was certain I would remain at Udinese.&quot; He might have said so sooner.  7.10pm: As the technical gremlins with which we began this epic return, last word goes to Archi Campbell: &quot;We could call you Lord Rhoop, after the crazed Narnian nobleman found by the voyagers of the dawntreader in the land where nightmares come true. Which is how you could end up if Man City keep distorting the laws of reality like this.&quot; Not too sure about the first point, Archi, but the second I&apos;ll give you. Which is why I&apos;m now going to hand my rough and all unable pen to Josh Widdicombe, who is neither rough or unable and will guide you through the remaining few hours before the transfer window slams shut. You can email him at joshwiddi@googlemail.com. Thanks for your emails and sorry I couldn&apos;t use them all.  7.30pm Hello there. I&apos;m here to take you through to the big midnight deadline and battle with the creaking theguardian.com tools. And I bring news on Robinho to start us off, Peter Kenyon is still &quot;confident&quot; that he could be earning his honk in west London as of tomorrow morning. What a start, are you as excited by the next four and half hours as I am? Are you?  7.38pm &quot;In this Internet Age, wouldn&apos;t it be easier all round if Tottenham just put Moody Berby on E-Bay? And can MBMers suggest a listing blurb?&quot; Writes Gary Naylor, doing my riff-starting job for me. So, any takers?  7.44pm So, if ever it goes quiet I am not being lazy, just fighting my computer, apologies in advance. Also, big news! There are players considering moving clubs that aren&apos;t called Robinho or Dimitar Berbatov. No, really. Cristian Ionita, confirms it: &quot;You should know that Steaua Bucharest signed George Ogararu (Ajax Amsterdam, RB) and Antonio Semedo (CFR Cluj, FW). About a million euros each. Isn&apos;t this a lot more interesting than the Real-ManCity-ManUtd jibber-jabber?&quot; It certainly is, particularly because you have listed the players as if they are on Championship Manager, Cristian.  7.49pm An email from a disgruntled Evertonian (no not Naylor): &quot;Everton had NINE senior pros fit on Saturday,&quot; writes Pierluigi Orlandini. &quot;So far we&apos;ve signed an injured striker and a pensionable goalkeeper, yet we finished fifth in the League, semis of the Carling Cup and decent run in UEFA. What is the Board and manager playing at?&quot; Don&apos;t worry Pierluigi, I bring news of a bid, one of \u00a33.5m for Stephen Hunt. Let&apos;s overlook that it was rejected shall we?  7.54pm Hibernian have re-signed Derek Riordan, Hearts dropped out of the race about half an hour ago. let&apos;s be honest, they knew they had no chance but were just saving face, like when Andy Cole retired from international football. We have a eBay description for Berbatov from the ever-reliable George Templeton: &quot;Prime goal-scorer with big forehead available. Sometimes prone to moodswings and the occasional sulk, cured by huge piles of cash. Starting price \u00a325 million.&quot;  8.01pm It was a three-year contract for Riordan is anyone was wondering, someone must have been. &quot;Joey Barton is being pursued by a top 10 Premier League club (5.55pm) - Is it Arsenal, with big sticks?&quot; Arfs Hugh Macguire.  8.04pm Guess who Man City have been linked with now? Robinho. You couldn&apos;t make it up, though Real Madrid mouthpiece Marca just have. No really, they are reporting it on Sky. Meanwhile the latest news on Berbatov (keep it on the hush hush) is that he is possibly unsettled at Spurs and may be considering a move.  8.08pm &quot;Is Naylor just trying to take his mind off the fact that Man U had to get rid of Saha via Freecycle? &apos;Offered: one piece of striking furniture. Very elegant but possibly unreliable legs. New owner must collect,&apos;&quot; writes Jack Lee. Is having a report at the Tottenham training ground really going to help Sky break any news on Berbatov at all? It is dark and everyone has clearly gone home. I have a feel Berbatov&apos;s not going to return there anytime soon.  8.14pm Two potential deals for Hull today and here we go with confirmation on them ... Daniel Cousin has signed from Rangers on a three-year deal. As for Frazier Campbell, nothing as of yet but Wigan are considering a gazzumping.  8.18pm In a far off land where the population aren&apos;t obsessed with a Bulgarian&apos;s movements around a cotton-trading town, Genoa have signed Real Zaragoza&apos;s Argentinian forward Diego Milito. Yes, signed him, actual news, I knew such a thing existed. &quot;As one person who was interested, thank you for the Riordan info,&quot; writes Derek Adamson. No worries Derek, all part of the service, anything else you wanted to discuss? &quot;Yes Josh, any news on Ashton to Villa though?&quot; Nope.  8.22pm Burnley have signed Steve Thompson from Cardiff for free. Talking of cheap ... &quot;I&apos;ve just transferred \u00a375 from my savings to my current account to see me through until my payday which is 2 weeks off,&quot; boom booms Kevin Rainey, who theguardian.com&apos;s Alan Gardner has just described as a frugal miser for such cheap living antics.  8.25pm According to Sky Joey Barton is at St James&apos; Park &quot;thrashing out his future&quot;. Surely that is not the most responsible verb to use when discussing Barton.  8.29pm If anyone is enjoying this wonderful day of dealing too much, then here is the email for you: &quot;Seems like the last days of Rome, what with a global economic crisis, the premier league are looking to collectively spank 100s of millions on overrated, overvalued ball-kickers - must make hard up fans really happy to hand over \u00a340 a match,&quot; writes Rich Holman over strains of Joy Division&apos;s Unknown Pleasures.  8.36pm NON-TRANSFER NEWS: Kevin Bond has been sacked by Bournmouth. But what does that mean for Dimitar Berbatov? Nothing. Meanwhile, Mark Hughes has spent his day playing golf while Alex Ferguson picked Berbatov up from the airport. I just can&apos;t work out who he is going to join. In class-war news, Kevin Rainey is not taking Alan Gardner&apos;s abuse lying down: &quot;Guilty as charged ... unfortunately I&apos;m not paid the vast sums available to the sandle wearing brigade at Guardian Towers, meaning it beans on toast from here on out (thats baked beans not mung beans by the way),&quot; he writes. Gardner tells me that beans of toast (mung or otherwise) is his favourite meal and he even had it for lunch today. He also would like it made clear he went to a comprehensive and has never been in a Waitrose. In short, it&apos;s like working with Che Guevara here.  8.43pm My favourite quote so far today comes from Espanyol sporting director Paco Herrera who has bigged up new signing Steve Finnan with the following: &quot;He is always worth a &apos;seven&apos; in ratings.&quot; Another man who plays too much Championship Manager there.  8.48pm A couple of ebay listings for a certain man: First up Mark Judd: &quot;For sale: One misunderstood, deep thinking European footballer, likes an occasional cigarette, no trouble once gets own way. Buy him now for \u00a334m or will swap for tricky Portuguese winger who also likes to try to get his own way. No time wasters&quot; while Peter Richards goes with: &quot;Bulgarian import, well rested, guaranteed to demand attention.&quot; I think we should call an end to this Berbatov chat, I hereby refuse to write his name again until something actually happens.  8.55pm According to Sky&apos;s man on the ground the body language at the Britannia Stadium hints that they aren&apos;t signing Jermaine Pennant (no, I have no idea either). However, they are signing Danny Higginbottom and Tom Soares has just turned up. Meanwhile, the wonderful Plymouth Argyle are close to signing Glen Whelan from them. It&apos;s all gone there. And here is more news from Sky&apos;s man at the Britannia, Emile Heskey is possibly moving to Aston Villa (Once again, no, I have no idea either).  9pm Ok, Man City news. It&apos;s from good sources. Forget Villa and Gomez, they have not made bids for them. But a bid has been made for a certain Bulgarian and Robinho. Is that news? It&apos;ll have to be, it&apos;s all I have.  9.05pm Many emails about when Berbatov Deadline Day actually ends. Jut to be clear it is midnight, when he will turn into a pumpkin, or perhaps sign for a Manchester club (perhaps not Stockport). One further complication: &quot;Do you realize that in some parts of the world it is tomorrow already and all this is over,&quot; writes Mark Judd. If any of you readers live in any of these places can you just email me to tell me where Berbatov went and then we can all go home. Cheers.  9.07pm Apparently there are rumours now that Michael Owen is going to ... guess who? Manchester City. Well, after telling me that Sky have just told me it&apos;s rubbish. Why tell me in the first place then? In Heskey news, we are all still clueless. Clueless!  9.12pm Stoke have signed Danny Higginbottom. Confirmed. Pop those champagne corks Potters fans, it&apos;s all true. And here is some more news from a certain sport based TV channel, Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s phone is going straight to answer phone. No, really. What a day to forget to charge your mobile, nightmare. I can however confirm he is pushing through the Emile Heskey deal via Facebook chat.  9.18pm Tony Pullis is going transfer mad, Joe Ledley hoping to become their 48th transfer of the day. Meanwhile there is a new face in the Berbatov race: &quot;We&apos;ve had a whip-round in the lab,&quot; writes Dave Booth of the Derpartment of Physiology at the University of Liverpool (shouldn&apos;t he be doing some research or something). &quot;We&apos;ve got a bid of 9.56 ... er ... pounds, 47 Polish Zlotys, half a pack of chocolate Hob-Nobs and a cactus named Rex. We&apos;re looking for a one-in one-out deal for our own eastern European who&apos;s no-so good in the air. Take it or leave it Spurs, the Hob-Nobs aren&apos;t getting any fresher.&quot; Well, I have heard Berbatov has been spotted in the north-west, that I can confirm. The plot thickens.  9.27pm Everton have signed Carlo Nash. Message ends.  9.32pm &quot;Surely Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s phone might just be engaged?&quot; Says Eddie Robson and he might be right. There is only one way to sort this out, does any have Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s number?  9.36pm Berbatov has arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might be about to sign for them. Maybe. &quot;Any fool knows that the real game is now called Football Manager after the makers of the original CM, SI Games lost the rights to the name. The game known as Championship Manager these days is but a pale imitation,&quot; writes Jeff Black. I gave up after the 97/98 version, Jeff. The pinnacle of management simulation and no transfer deadline until March in those days.  9.45pm The next person who emails me to say they have seen Berbatov in an amusing place and that he is now signing for someone unlikely is going to get a strongly worded reply. Though a special mention for Stewart Harper for an excellent joke about Bulgarian cigarettes.  9.51pm I will be honest, we are in a lull. Where is Tony Pullis when you need him? Nothing, absolutely nothing, is happening.  9.53pm &quot;I recall that in CM 97/98 edition (I agree; undoubtedly the pinnacle of football management games) you could bid as much as you wanted for a player, then when the club inevitably accepted your \u00a320 million offer, you could revise it down to \u00a30 and get the player for free,&quot; writes Ed Bayling. &quot;Perhaps this is strategy Citeh are following today?&quot; We&apos;ll never know, it looks like they won&apos;t be signing anyone at this rate.  10pm Just TWO HOURS to go now. And as we speak Sir Alex Ferguson and Dimitar Berbatov are in conversation, presumably about him signing for them but that is only speculation. But here we go, this is the big one, a deal has been AGREED for Robinho to move to Manchester City, \u00a332m. Wow, what you going to do about that Chelsea?  10.05pm So, the big news is Robinho is moving to Manchester City. The credit for this must go to the emaillers who all sent me the link to the Spanish site that reported this, sadly I can&apos;t speak Spanish so that is why i was a bit slow on the uptake.  10.08pm To those that have asked for me to clear up the Berbatov cigarette joke from Stewart Harper earlier. I can&apos;t, it is not website-ready. It is very funny though. In terms of Championship Manager 97/98, the real story of the day, &quot;Two words. Ibrahima. Bakayoko,&quot; writes Paul Ansorge. &quot;It was always rumoured that Walter Smith only signed him because of how good he was in 97/98.&quot;  10.12pm There is a rumour that Frazier Campbell will be heading to Tottenham in part exchange for a certain person. Surely not. Meanwhile Stoke have upped their bid for for Joe Ledley to \u00a36m. That is a lot of honk for a Championship player.  10.15pm Joey Barton is staying at Newcastle, his move to &quot;a top ten Premier League club&quot; fell at the final hurdle.  10.17pm Richard Jeffries has sent me this brilliant link: here I have no idea if it is fake? But I can confirm the big news, he will be wearing number nine.  10.22pm More link fun, for those that requested a Spanish article on Robinho going to City, here you are: link  10.25pm Don&apos;t forget that it is easy to fake these kind of pages. in conclusion we know no more than we did this morning. In other news Alexei Smertin has had his contract terminated with just 95 minutes to find a new club.  10.30pm So it looks like that site was a fake then, how embarrassing. I have received around 400 emails of other examples of players there are pages for. My favourite, Marlon Brooms. He was excellent in Champ Man 97/98 coincidently.  10.35pm For those questioning the Spanish link for the Robinho story, they are all over it on Sky Sports too. So believe. News from Richard Graveling, &quot;Norwich have signed Antoine Sibierski on loan from Wigan, it&apos;s on the club website. That&apos;s the big one! I can go to bed now,&quot; night Richard.  10.39pm You know what I told you about Daniel Cousin moving to Hull earlier, it was true. All t&apos;s crossed and i&apos;s dotted etc. By the way, ignore that Spanish article, as has been pointed out by many, many, many people they still think Sven Goran-Eriksson is the Manchester City manager. Robinho is still City bound though.  10.44pm &quot;If the link Spanish-speakers are sending is by notoriously unreliable AS newspaper, said news story says that he is going to Sven Goran Eriksson&apos;s City ... which I assume is Cancun, Mexico ... &quot; boom booms Duncan Bishop.  10.49pm Joey Barton has apparently texted into Sky to say he wanted to stay at Newcastle all along. The age we live in, huh? I have yet to receive a text myself, but then he hasn&apos;t got my number.  10.55pm Transfer news from Holland via Pascal Hofmann: &quot;Ooijer and AZ Alkmaar. Well, it&apos;s official, that deal is off. And, Danny Blind is keeping his (and my) word and will still not be selling Huntelaar, even though &quot;astronomic offers&quot; have been made, according to NOS.nl.&quot; See, I have contacts!  10.59pm &quot;Unattached players can be signed after the window closes so you needn&apos;t worry about Alexei Smertin, not that I suspect anyone was,&quot; writes James Hudson. Phew. So, only an hour left, what will happen?  11.02pm Julian Gray has moved from Coventry to Fulham. Elsewhere, fans ourside the City of Stadium are singing &quot;we&apos;ve got Robinho, we&apos;ve got Robinho etc&quot;. That is evidence enough for me. As for Berbatov, it is just a matter of time as we all know.  11.06pm News from Spain: &quot;Spanish TV have the Robinho story, to city for 40 million euros. And Calderon saying it is best for both the player and the club,&quot; writes Brad in Valencia. While Pablo Requejo writes: &quot;Real Madrid\u00b4s president is now speaking and he has said than Robinho has been sold to Manchester City. Transfer made by \u20ac42m. He said that Cristiano Ronaldo maybe could land in Real Madrid next year.&quot; Let&apos;s not even get into that one.  11.10pm Robinho news: &quot;We have agreed to sell the player for human reasons, and for footballing reasons and for an important quantity of money,&quot; Real president Ramon Calderon told Spanish television station VEO. &quot;After consulting with the technical staff we have decided it was the best decision for the group and the club.&quot; But who has he been sold to?  11.12pm REAL MADRID HAVE CONFIRMED THEY HAVE AGREED TO SELL ROBINHO TO MAN CITY. I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be writing that when I woke up this morning.  11.16pm Some more transfers not containing Robinho and Berbatov, a change is as good as a rest. &quot;Two Belgian sites are now saying it&apos;s a done deal for Fellaini to go to Goodison \u2013 The first decent bit of progress for us toffees all day,&quot; writes Hugh Watson, who loses marks for referring to me as Widdyroo. &quot;There are some rumours over here in Sweden that Ola Toivonens agent, former player Martin Dahlin, is closing in on transfer deal with Stoke,&quot; writes Go22at, which might not be his real name but an email pseudonym.  11.19pm Berbatov will wear the number nine shirt, didn&apos;t I tell you.  11.23pm Frazier Campbell is on his way to Spurs, so says this. Thanks to Gary Robinson for that, excellent work.  11.25pm Poor old Arsenal, Mike Johnson sums up the mood of the emails I have received from Gooners tonight: &quot;Why haven&apos;t you written anything about Arsenal signing anyone better than Abou Diaby. Why? I&apos;m going to fly to London from Philadelphia and fight Arsene Wenger if nothing happens in the next 40 minutes.&quot; think about your carbon footprint Mike, it&apos;s not worth it.  11.30pm News from Wolves, via the very helpful Tom Bason: &quot;Why no mention of the transfer goings on at Molineux? George Friend (there must be a pun in there for you somewhere!!) signs from Exeter and Matt Hill and Stephen Elliott switch clubs in two allegedly completely unrelated transfers. It&apos;s a hotbed of activity- how many other clubs have signed no fewer than three defenders today?&quot; And as I type that ROBINHO HAS SIGNED FOR MANCHESTER CITY.  11.33pm &quot;Does nobody else realise that Police Academy 1 is on right now?&quot; Asks Anthony Browne.  11.34pm In my attempts to make this website appeal to football fans from outside the Greater Manchester area, here is some news from Stoke. They probably won&apos;t get Joe Ledley, they might get Tom Soares or even Michael Tonge though. And ... and ... they may add Henry Camara to that. Come on Pullis, get a move on.  11.39pm And not sure how true this is but it is a transfer free-for-all now in my email inbox. &quot;Aston Villa have sealed a deal with Swedish team Malmo FF over Ola Toivonen and the price is believed to be around 1.6\u00a3 million. They hijacked him in a last minute bid, infront of Stoke who have been interested. Ola Toivonen have played in the same clubs as the Swedish internationals Olof Mellberg (Degerfors)and Markus Allback (\u00d6rgryte)who probably have told him good things about the club. He have also for a few weeks ago expressed his dream to play in the Premier League,&quot; says my source ds22cp again.  11.44pm &quot;Oh come on, surely all the stories involving Manchester Utd must appeal to the people outside of the Greater Manchester region? I&apos;m loving all the Man City stories from out here in Sydney. What? Eh? Oh \u2026 &quot; writes Gavin Hudson, somewhat predictably. I&apos;ll be honest, we&apos;re playing out time now, time for one more big transfer?  11.48pm I&apos;m waiting ... only 12 minutes to sign that deal  11.50pm: The latest Frazier Who? news: &quot;Despite the BBC having the Campbell to Spurs story as well (we had it first). Sky seem to think its Hull may still sign him. Mind you the reporter did start referring to Frazier Richardson halfway through his report. Is this Richardson any good? I&apos;ve neverheard of him,&quot; writes Gary Robinson. I don&apos;t expect him to cause much of an impact Gary.  11.53pm &quot;Reports on the radio here in Melbourne, that Everton have signed Green Gully (Australian A league) striker, John Markovski,&quot; writes Gavin Knight. I&apos;ll take your word for it Gavin.  11.55pm Frazier Campbell is going nowhere now. Unless something changes in the next five minutes.  11.57pm I think we might be done for the night, tick tock tick tock ...  12.00am My friends, it is all over. &quot;Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and auld lang syne?

I have said that in order to compete with the best teams in the Premier League we have to be in the market for players of this calibre, and Robinho is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world. I am really looking forward to introducing him to the rest of the squad, and to the City fans at the earliest opportunity. This is a real statement of intent as to the ambitions of Manchester City Football Club&quot;  12.25am Me again. Just to confirm there is no actual statement on Berbatov, but we are pretty sure he has signed on the say so of people more in the know than us. And here is some news for Newcastle fans, striker Xisco has signed from Deportivo on a five-year deal. He&apos;s a Spanish under-21 striker for those who have never heard of him.  12.30am Stoke have failed with Joe Ledley and Henri Camara but they have signed Tom Soares from Crystal Palace and Michael Tonge from Sheffield United. Not a bad hit rate, better than Chelsea&apos;s.  12.36am Nothing official on Berbatov, but he has left in a car from Old Trafford and here is some news ... Frazier Campbell has gone to Spurs on a season-long loan and BERBATOV HAS SIGNED FOR MANCHESTER UNITED FOR \u00a330.7m. At last.  12.40am And I think just about brings an end to this wonderful evening of gossip and dealing. Thank you for all your emails (a huge amount), sorry for the ones I couldn&apos;t use.

Her fondness of two wheels, documented by countless paparazzi pictures of her cruising through the New York streets, Strokes boyfriend in tow, set enough of a trend for Page Six magazine to declare it &quot;a fashionable pursuit&quot;. Cycling&apos;s not only sustainable, cheap and healthy \u2013 it&apos;s officially chic. Cycle commuting in London has increased by 91 per cent since 2000, and with that comes a natural evolution of style. Last year&apos;s limited edition Chanel bike may have been a ridiculous \u00a36,000, and certainly ill-suited to London&apos;s cycle theft record, but Gucci soon followed with a limited Beijing-themed red model, embossed leather panniers included, which sold in China and Hong Kong for $3,400. Ludicrous, certainly, but also a sign of how fashion is starting to take cycling seriously. (Just ask Vivienne Westwood, a long-time devotee of pedal power.)  But sales of &quot;sit-up-and-beg&quot; bikes were on the up long before Agyness took to her Electra Amsterdam. While they&apos;re easier on the eye than a clunky mountain bike, the explosion of Dutch or vintage style brands like Pashley, Velorbis and Grand 1888 allows cyclists to be more fashionable. They&apos;re slower machines good for leisurely rides \u2013 think riding home with flowers in your wicker basket, and you&apos;ll get an idea of the pace. You&apos;re far less likely to work up a sweat on a Pashley than you are on a zippy racer, which means you&apos;re far less inclined to reach for the dreaded Lycra. This hatred of clich\u00e9d cyclewear unites bike-style bloggers across Europe and the US. They share a belief that the stereotype of an aggressive cyclist in Spandex shorts and wraparound shades does a great deal to harm the concept of cycling as simply a normal, everyday means of getting from one place to the next. &quot;There are two major misconceptions,&quot; explains Caz Nicklin, founder of cyclechic.co.uk, an online store and blog for fashion-conscious women on bicycles. &quot;One is that cycling is a geeky pursuit for which you have to be dressed from head to toe in Lycra. The other is that it&apos;s dangerous.&quot;  These concerns show that, despite recent growth, going anywhere by bike is still a novelty in Britain. A million Londoners may own bicycles, but only two per cent of journeys are made using them. We&apos;re still a long way behind the cycle-centric cultures of Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin and even Paris, now, and it&apos;s in Europe that &quot;cycle chic&quot; really comes into its own.  The term was coined by blogger Mikael Colville-Andersen for his site, Copenhagen Cycle Chic, which collects and publishes his daily shots of the city&apos;s most stylish cyclists. He tells of girls in Louboutin heels who seem to stick with &quot;beat-up old Raleigh granny bikes&quot; and how the city&apos;s men are switching to &quot;sit-up-and-begs&quot; like the Velorbis Churchill, but really, he says, &quot;We don&apos;t have cyclists in Copenhagen, we just have Copenhageners who get around on bikes.&quot;  Marc van Woudenberg, who runs the popular site Amsterdamize, supports the idea that fashionable cycling is about being able to wear your everyday clothes to do it. &quot;It&apos;s not for the purpose of cycling, but for the purpose of dressing according to your personality and the occasion, be it work, school, a party, whatever,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;Anything but Lycra.&quot; And that&apos;s what the boom in &quot;sit-up-and-beg&quot; bikes like the Pashley Princess, the Electra Amsterdam and those beat-up old Raleigh granny bikes will continue to nurture \u2013 dressing as you would every day, in Louboutin heels if you like, enjoying your leisurely bike ride.", "sentences": ["But sales of &quot;sit-up-and-beg&quot; bikes were on the up long before Agyness took to her Electra Amsterdam.", "We&apos;re still a long way behind the cycle-centric cultures of Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin and even Paris, now, and it&apos;s in Europe that &quot;cycle chic&quot; really comes into its own.", "He tells of girls in Louboutin heels who seem to stick with &quot;beat-up old Raleigh granny bikes&quot; and how the city&apos;s men are switching to &quot;sit-up-and-begs&quot; like the Velorbis Churchill, but really, he says, &quot;We don&apos;t have cyclists in Copenhagen, we just have Copenhageners who get around on bikes.&quot;  Marc van Woudenberg, who runs the popular site Amsterdamize, supports the idea that fashionable cycling is about being able to wear your everyday clothes to do it.", "&quot;It&apos;s not for the purpose of cycling, but for the purpose of dressing according to your personality and the occasion, be it work, school, a party, whatever,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;Anything but Lycra.&quot; And that&apos;s what the boom in &quot;sit-up-and-beg&quot; bikes like the Pashley Princess, the Electra Amsterdam and those beat-up old Raleigh granny bikes will continue to nurture \u2013 dressing as you would every day, in Louboutin heels if you like, enjoying your leisurely bike ride."], "title": "Cycle chic", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/04/fashion", "tags": ["Life and style", "Fashion"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-04T09:56:10Z", "article": "It could happen to any of us.

Even though it&apos;s just a 10-minute bike ride from the centre, it has a reputation for being an edgy spot, where youths hang out around the Mercatorplein square. De Baarsjes is one of the city&apos;s most multicultural &apos;hoods with 126 different nationalities, dominated by Surinamese, Turkish and Moroccan families. It&apos;s the ultimate place to go for quality cheap ethnic food. Pera (Jan Evertsenstraat 86, 0031 20-683 4311) is an excellent Turkish grill, while Farasa (Jan van Galenstraat 287, +20-612 6650) has one of the best Surinamese roti in the city. However, the scene is changing, thanks to a growth of style-conscious mid-range restaurants and bars set up to cater for the increasing number of students and creatives who have been attracted by the area&apos;s cheap rents and stash of one-bedroom apartments. While much of the area is generic pre-war housing, it has some architectural gems. The quarter between the canal Admiralengracht and the Surinameplein is part of the 1920s idealistic urban expansion Plan West, which combined social housing with Gaud\u00ed-esque brickwork, best exemplified in the De Sieraad, Mercatorplein, and the nearby church Jeruzulumkerk (Jan Maijenstraat 14, jeruzalem-kerk.nl). The neighbourhood made global headlines in 2006 when the local council put up signs prohibiting the smoking of marijuana in public in and around Mercatorplein. It had hoped they would reduce the number of loitering youths and petty crime, but the only resulting change in crime rates was an increase in stealing - of the signs. The depiction of two fingers holding a joint with marijuana leaves spiralling up in a cloud of smoke was the perfect bedroom wall decoration. To combat the problem, the district officials offered the iconic signs for sale at \u20ac90 each (the fine for stealing one was \u20ac80).  Mercatorplein The internationally renowned architect HP Berlage was responsible for this square, finished in 1927. Its rocketing corner towers were removed in 1961 due to safety issues, then after decades of going downhill, the square was renovated in 1998 and the towers rebuilt. Witte de Withstraat The term &quot;gallery strip&quot; does not immediately pop into mind as one wanders this nondescript street, but that is what it&apos;s becoming. Pioneers Illuseum (no 120, illuseum.com) were derided as freaks when they first set up their space here before the area got cool, and they keep that tradition alive with left-field art exhibitions and events that usually include a levitating magician or two. In sharp contrast, HoofdzaakHoeden (no 168, hoofdzaakhoeden.nl) sells hats and the limited-edition couture of the label ArtWear. Keep your eyes peeled for the outlet of &quot;art co-op&quot; Zoete Broodjes (no 89, zoete-broodjes.nl) which organises regular exhibitions and projects. Club 8  Probably the biggest magnet for people from outside the district, this nightclub features an alternative and varied programe of DJs, live bands and video screenings, which flirt with the alternative side of things - from the boogie-tastic Disco Exota to the more snotty attitude of club night Fuck Yeah. Plush retro leather couches bring quality to the chill-out zone. The club is also worth a daytime trip for the massive pool hall downstairs.Admiraal de Ruyterweg 56B, (+20-685 1703, club-8.nl). Con-Fusion At this hip restaurant you can choose between the lounge-style interior and the lovely canal-side terrace where you can slump in old-fashioned deck-chairs. Locals accuse Con-Fusion of naming itself after the service - but at least the staff are friendly when you finally have their attention. The Turkish bread sandwiches are super cheap but super filling. Postjesweg 7, (+20-616 2122, restaurantconfusion.nl). Het Sieraad Once a trade college for crafts people, mostly jewellers, and later squatted, De Sieraad was renovated and reopened last year to house a musical academy, smaller creative companies and artist studios.Postjesweg 1, (het-sieraad.nl). Edel Situated in Het Sieraad, caf\u00e9-restaurant Edel has a fantastic waterside terrace with picnic tables shaded by huge elm trees, and is best enjoyed at lunch with a sandwich or a salad.

From 11pm on Thursdays through Saturdays, DJs play music to match its loungey interior.Postjesweg 1, (+20-799 5000, edelamsterdam.nl). Meneer de Wit Across from Het Sieraad, Meneer de Wit is both a gallery and a studio space for artists and creative companies, including the much acclaimed handbag design collective Hardtroze (hardtroze .nl). Its managers are also active in organising community art projects, such as creating a white line (dewittelijn.nl) that dissected the neighbourhood, running up walls, over buildings, through backyards and across canals.

We were handsomely treated: in London we haunted Bertorelli&apos;s, but we spent more than one weekend at Michael Astor&apos;s beautiful Cotswold house, where Dame Rebecca strode the grounds authoritatively between bouts of laying down the law. There were perhaps 60 books, which seemed a lot, though modern judges are said to read twice as many. Getting through the 60 was made easier by our not daring to take on Dame Rebecca. &quot;Miss Murdoch writes good and bad novels in alternate years,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a bad year.&quot; Muriel Spark: &quot;clever but too playful.&quot; And out they went.  Two of us favoured Nicholas Mosley&apos;s Impossible Object, but were soon silenced. The choice of PH Newby&apos;s Something to Answer For was the result of a compromise. Dame Rebecca didn&apos;t dislike it as much as nearly all the others. Surveyors of the prize&apos;s history have spoken ill of this good book, perhaps without reading it, or by being too ready to suppose that this industrious writer could manage a novel a year as well as running the Third Programme. Anyway, I remember this, my one experience of judging, with much pleasure and amusement. 1970 Antonia Fraser The judging of the 1970 prize was a low-key affair except for the feisty behaviour of Dame Rebecca West, a judge for the second year running. At one point she denounced Margaret Drabble for her novels of domestic life on the grounds that &quot;Anyone can do the washing-up; just get a big bowl and some liquid; so why complain about it?&quot; The novel in question was The Waterfall, which both Richard Hoggart and I admired greatly (and didn&apos;t think was about washing-up). I knew Rebecca West, since she was a friend and neighbour of my parents in Sussex, and was very fond of her; all the same, it occurred to me that she was possibly one of the brilliant old ladies who felt threatened by a brilliant young one in the shape of Maggie Drabble. In the end we were split between William Trevor&apos;s Mrs Eckdorf in O&apos;Neill&apos;s Hotel and Bernice Rubens&apos;s The Elected Member. I voted for Rubens but today would vote for Trevor.  1971 was much more exacting. The most exciting thing that happened to me as a Booker Judge for the second time was not controversial. I shared a taxi back with fellow judge Saul Bellow on a long, long ride from somewhere in the City: he was nattily dressed in a pale green shantung suit, blue shirt, green tie with large blue dots on it; his silver hair and slanting, large dark eyes made him look like a 30s film star playing a refined gangster. Suddenly he leaned forward and asked: &quot;Has anyone ever told you that you&apos;re a very handsome woman?&quot; I pondered on a suitable reply, modest yet encouraging. But having spoken, the Great Man closed his eyes and remained apparently asleep for the rest of the journey. 1971 John Gross A faint aroma of the Nobel prize - or of Nobel prizes yet to come - hangs over the 1971 Booker. First, the award went to VS Naipaul (who was to be Nobel laureate in 2001) for In a Free State. It was a result with which I agreed. Second, the organisers had succeeded in persuading a distinguished writer from abroad to be one of the judges: Saul Bellow (who was to be Nobel laureate in 1976). It seemed a thrilling prospect. In the event, one of the things I remember most clearly about Bellow is that he insisted on being put up at the Ritz (which must have burned a big hole in the budget), and then complained because he hadn&apos;t been given a room overlooking Green Park. Another recollection is his response when I advanced the claims of Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which apart from the Naipaul was the book on the shortlist I most favoured. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;that&apos;s one of those little tinkling teacup things that the British always do well.&quot; He was quite wrong - Mrs Palfrey is a work of deep feeling - but his dismissiveness effectively put paid to its chances. 1972 George Steiner It was the most illustrious panel in the Booker&apos;s history. Both the other judges, Cyril Connolly and Elizabeth Bowen, were too ill to attend the ceremony. I fought very hard for John Berger to win for G, and then he threw it in my face by giving half the prize money to the Black Panthers. It was a very grim experience. I was in a very precarious position at the time and I literally thought it was the end for me in this country. I thought I would have to pack my bags and go.  1973 Edna O&apos;Brien Mary McCarthy and I were the judges, with Karl Miller presiding as chairman. Disputes were negligible. From a batch of about 20, it was whittled down to two contenders - The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell and The Black Prince by Iris Murdoch, with Farrell winning by a whisker. Next day, Mary changed her mind and it was left to Miller to cast the deciding vote, which he did with alacrity and no rancour. The prize has changed as the literary/publishing world has undergone a radical and not always edifying sea change: the celebrity virus now infects authors and judges alike. 1974 Ion Trewin We were three judges - AS Byatt, Elizabeth Jane Howard and me. At the shortlist meeting, Jane remarked that she thought Ending Up by Kingsley Amis (then her husband) was his best book and should go on the shortlist. I looked first at Antonia, and then at Martyn Goff, the prize&apos;s administrator - both remained impassive. We broke for a breather. Martyn said that as chairman it was up to me. Antonia liked the novel (as did I). On literary grounds neither of us had problems about shortlisting it, but what would the press say?  The Booker was already familiar with controversies. Martyn, I know, was not averse to the publicity that our decision would inevitably bring. (This was to centre around a vituperative correspondence in the Times.) But would the burgeoning reputation of the prize be damaged? He thought not. More important was our choice of winner. Antonia and I spoke up for Nadine Gordimer&apos;s The Conservationist, but Jane was less impressed. She remained keen on Ending Up, but realising that neither Antonia nor I would countenance it winning, she concentrated on Stanley Middleton&apos;s Holiday, a study of middle England that she saw as a &quot;perfect miniature&quot;. With only three judges, it seemed important to me that we did not compromise or produce a two-one verdict. Might we split the prize between Middleton and Gordimer? Martyn said he knew of no reason why not. We were vindicated by The Conservationist being selected this year for the Best of the Booker shortlist. My favourite Booker winner remains Schindler&apos;s Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally (but I must declare my interest and say that I was its editor). 1975 Susan Hill Peter Ackroyd was the young, newly appointed literary editor of the Spectator. Roy Fuller was a distinguished older poet. Angus Wilson was in his years as founder of the creative writing course at UEA and one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary novel. It was a daunting experience to join them as a judge. I took the mountain of submitted novels on my honeymoon, and our first meeting was scheduled for the day I returned. I discovered that Angus had spent a holiday at the same Italian hotel a few weeks earlier. So we should all have been in mellow mood, and three of us were. But Roy Fuller was not the easiest man to work with. He was acerbic and disliked being contradicted, and when it came to choosing a shortlist he refused to join in, on the grounds that we had agreed on our winner, so a shortlist was superfluous. The Booker management committee was, rightly, having none of this and insisted.  I had been shortlisted myself three years earlier, and it had given my career a huge boost. I fought hard. We all did. Fuller grudgingly agreed to allowing a shortlist of two - the winner and one runner-up. Otherwise, he was going to walk. It was tricky and it spoiled what should have been an enjoyable experience. I was very happy with our winner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala&apos;s Heat and Dust, but I wish we had stood up to Fuller and if he had walked out, so be it.  My personal Best of Bookers is JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. The omission of Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece The Blue Flower even from the shortlist in 1995 I find quite inexplicable.  1976 Francis King There is a vast difference of scale between the prize as I experienced it as a judge and how it is now. Then the prize money was far less generous, and the fee for the judging was an honorarium. There were only three judges: our chairman Walter Allen, an admirable novelist and critic, then confined to a wheelchair, so that I had to read out his presentation speech for him; Mary Wilson, the wife of the prime minister; and me. Despite his failing health, Allen was, unlike me, immensely conscientious in reading every submission from cover to cover. Mary Wilson, a lover of poetry and herself an artless but often touching poet, was at the disadvantage of having read few novels in the course of her life - so that she was clearly puzzled when I referred to one of the submissions as &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;.  My sister Elizabeth looked through the piles of books awaiting my reading, and eventually held up David Storey&apos;s Saville. With a colleague, John Guest, she had already put in a lot of robust work as one of its two editors. &quot;This will be the winner,&quot; she announced. It was, she explained, an epic about a north country mining community and was therefore exactly what would appeal to Allen, a lifetime socialist, and to the wife of a Labour PM. She was right. I battled for Julian Rathbone&apos;s King Fisher Lives, to no avail. Mary Wilson was obdurate: &quot;I couldn&apos;t be party to giving the prize to a book about cannibalism.&quot;  For me far and away the best Booker winner in the whole history of the Prize is JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. The best of all the novels that ought to have won the Prize but failed to do so is Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece The Blue Flower 1977 Beryl Bainbridge Making a choice was very difficult - because it was this great prize of the world, one had to be very careful. Since I was published by Duckworth, it was very peculiar to have a Duckworth novel - Great Granny Webster by Caroline Blackwood - included in the vote. I put my vote forward - for Blackwood - but the discussion on it lasted only about three minutes, because it was such a short book. So nobody was really interested in that. All I can remember of the final meeting is that I got terribly tired, I literally sank lower and lower under the table. Brendan Gill, who I thought was American, went towards the balcony saying he was going to throw himself off, he was so fed up. Philip Larkin was completely silent most of the time. Nobody dared say a word to him and he never said a word back. The only one who was in total control of everything was Robin Ray. He was so clever that we all went along with whatever he said, and he wanted Staying On by Paul Scott to win. Poor Scott was too ill to collect the prize. I&apos;ve been shortlisted for the Booker five times and never won. I&apos;m just very pleased to have been noticed. 1978 Derwent May In 1978, all the five jury members had a different first choice, and they were all sticking to it. Suddenly someone suggested a compromise candidate that we all quite liked, but it seemed to me that we were now heading for disaster. Freddie Ayer, the chairman, had more or less pulled out, saying that the only novels he enjoyed reading were crime novels. So I went round the jury - the other three were all novelists, PH Newby, Angela Huth and Clare Boylan - and said to them in turn &quot;Is this book your first choice?&quot; All, rather sheepishly, said &quot;No&quot;. I said, &quot;The winner must surely be at least one person&apos;s first choice&quot;, and I saw it was the moment for me to push what I thought was unmistakably the best book, Iris Murdoch&apos;s The Sea, The Sea - which I knew was at least one juror&apos;s second choice (the other shortlisted authors were Kingsley Amis, Andr\u00e9 Brink, Penelope Fitzgerald, Jane Gardam and Bernice Rubens). I&apos;m glad to say it won.  The best three winners have, I think, been the Murdoch, William Golding&apos;s Rites of Passage and Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day. The prize has always lurched too much in favour of writers with unpromising backgrounds or good liberal attitudes, but it has unfailingly provided an excellent focus on the year&apos;s new novels. 1979 Hilary Spurling  I loved my Booker summer, which boils down in my memory to long, hot, hazy days spent lying under a tree in the garden reading novels and saying to anyone who tried to interrupt: &quot;Go away, I&apos;m working.&quot; It was a strong field and the bookies&apos; favourite was VS Naipaul&apos;s A Bend in the River. Its opponents on the panel argued that the book shouldn&apos;t strictly be classified as a novel, and in any case he&apos;d won the prize before. The Naipaul lobby (including me) snapped back that the novel was doomed if it couldn&apos;t expand to include this sort of documentary fiction, and that our job was to pick the year&apos;s best book, regardless of its author. The final verdict was as much of a shock to the judges as it was to everybody else. We&apos;d spent the entire afternoon at loggerheads, and in the end compromised by giving the prize to everybody&apos;s second choice, Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s small, slight, melancholy but beautifully judged and executed Offshore. Her recently published collected letters make it clear that her triumph - and the general incredulity that greeted it - caused her humiliation ever after. 1980 Claire Tomalin I was determined that Alice Munro should be on the shortlist, and stuck my heels in to get her there. There were two real contenders for the prize, I believed, Anthony Burgess&apos;s Earthly Powers and William Golding&apos;s Rites of Passage, and the night before the final judging session I lay awake debating with myself: the Golding beautifully written and constructed, but with a slightly musty feel about it; Burgess a magnificent entertainer, overflowing with good humour, sometimes tipping into the slapdash. Both books thoroughly deserving. The next morning David Daiches, our chairman, began: &quot;We&apos;ll go through the list in alphabetical order. I take it no one consider Burgess a possible winner?&quot; Silence from the others. I exploded into a eulogy of Burgess&apos;s energy, invention and comic gift. I saw I had convinced no one, and felt that left only Golding. And so it was. Burgess sent a message saying he would not come to the dinner unless he won. I don&apos;t blame him. I saw a tear trickle down Golding&apos;s cheek when the announcement was made. I have re-read neither book, and I have rejoiced to see Alice Munro win the recognition she deserves.  1981 Hermione Lee Salman Rushdie has won the Booker of Bookers and the Best of all Bookers, with his lastingly dazzling, deep and splendid novel, now a classic of world literature, Midnight&apos;s Children. But over a quarter of a century ago, when I was one of the judges who gave him the prize, his book was by no means an easy winner. Not many people had heard of Rushdie, unless they&apos;d read a weird piece of science fiction called Grimus or seen the stunning extracts from the new novel in Granta. Our panel of judges (Samuel Hynes, Joan Bakewell, Brian Aldiss and me, with Malcolm Bradbury as chair) were pulling in different ways. We were reading many writers with more established reputations, and much more experience, than Rushdie - such as Muriel Spark. (To my lasting regret, we overlooked one of Nadine Gordimer&apos;s best novels, July&apos;s People.) Brian Aldiss was especially keen on Doris Lessing&apos;s &quot;space fiction&quot; The Sirian Experiments, Malcolm on Ian McEwan&apos;s The Comfort of Strangers.  We all jumped at the late arrival of the almost forgotten Anglo-Irish writer Molly Keane, the short-listing of whose wicked and eccentric novel Good Behaviour gained her a devoted new following. But our final discussion was painfully split between Midnight&apos;s Children and The White Hotel, DM Thomas&apos;s psychoanalytical erotic novel, centring on the massacre at Babi Yar, which made a strong impression on me at the time but now, looking back, seems to me sensationalist and exploitative. Sam Hynes, Joan Bakewell and I were firmly on the side of Rushdie; Brian Aldiss was passionately keen on Thomas, and so was Malcolm Bradbury, who tried at the very end of the discussion to argue that the chair should have a casting, and over-ruling vote. This was not allowed, Rushdie won by 3 votes to 2, and Brian Aldiss (whose intensity impressed me) left the room with tears in his eyes. When the 1981 prize was announced, a mighty career was launched. It would have taken off anyway, but it was helped by the prize. Chairing the prize 25 years on, I felt happy to be helping on Kiran Desai, a literary descendant of Rushdie&apos;s. 1982 Paul Bailey There are many things I regret doing, and being a judge for the Booker prize is one of them. For some years after I was associated with two novels I absolutely loathed and would not have even started reading in other circumstances (on the shortlist that year were Thomas Keneally&apos;s Schindler&apos;s Ark, John Arden&apos;s Silence Among the Weapons, William Boyd&apos;s An Ice-Cream War, Lawrence Durrell&apos;s Constance or Solitary Practices, Alice Thomas Ellis&apos;s The 27th Kingdom and Timothy Mo&apos;s Sour Sweet). They are history now and are likely to remain so. My one good deed was to ensure a place on the shortlist for Sour Sweet, consequently bringing his work to a larger audience. But otherwise it was a dispiriting experience. The winner, by a single vote, was Schindler&apos;s Ark, a controversial but ultimately very popular choice. The prize was founded, in part, to encourage competitiveness. Which of the six novelists will make it to the finishing post? This grisly notion constitutes a perfect recipe for envy, back-biting and self-glorification. The Booker has certainly mirrored fashion - the collapse of the empire; post-modernist Victorian pastiche; New Age sentimentality. Several stinkers have been honoured, but there have been some glorious losers: Alice Munro&apos;s The Beggar Maid, John McGahern&apos;s Amongst Women and Edward St Aubyn&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk. A wonderful book such as Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s The Blue Flower was completely ignored, and I hope the judges for 1995 are blushing now to be reminded of their grotesque oversight. 1983 Fay Weldon A lively year, as Booker prizes go. We had a distinguished set of judges and some terrific books. The panel was finally split between a Coetzee and a Rushdie - a clash of continents. As the chairperson I had the casting vote - which is not saying &quot;oh, I like that one best&quot;, but weighing up the arguments of one set of judges against the others and deciding which are the most convincing. The Coetzee (Life &amp; Times of Michael K) got it, and Rushdie was really annoyed.  As a fervent feminist (25 years back), and taking time to make up my mind, I made a joke: &quot;I haven&apos;t got my husband here to help me decide.&quot; But one should never make jokes in the presence of the police, security or at a Booker prize judging, and word got round that I meant it. Then I had to deliver the customary chairperson&apos;s speech. After I sat down, the then president of the Publishers Association got to his feet, crossed the room and hit my agent Giles Gordon, second best thing to hitting me. I&apos;d used the speech to reproach the publishers for giving such rotten deals to writers. Since the BBC was working to rule, they cut the cameras at 10pm precisely: I was using transparent screens from which to make the speech (a Thatcher trick), and they went blank before I had time to finish with the usual pacifying bit about how you are all honourable men and none of what I say applies to you. Instead, I just had to sit down and all hell broke loose.  I had actually shown the speech to the organisers earlier, but I suppose they hadn&apos;t bothered to read it. I hadn&apos;t thought it was all that inflammatory. Michael Caine, charismatic chairman of Bookers, came up to me years later, when I had been inadvertently invited to one of the subsequent dinners, and said: &quot;It is not by any wish of mine you are here tonight.&quot; It&apos;s all got rather dull since: the prize tends to go to well-behaved and deserving writers: no subversion allowed. No one hits anyone.  1984 John Fuller This was the year when the hot favourite, JG Ballard (Empire of the Sun), was passed over for a relative newcomer, Anita Brookner (Hotel du Lac). Hardly a scandal, but in a strong year we had already discarded some big names (Burgess, Golding, Spark, Bainbridge, two Amises, etc) before reaching the shortlist, so that journalistic antennae were twitching, and the outcome was felt to be a further surprise. The judges got on pretty well together. We were somewhat exercised by the question of whether Julian Barnes&apos;s Flaubert&apos;s Parrot was really a novel, while in the final judging session Anthony Curtis continued to argue for David Lodge (Small World), and Ted Rowlands stuck out for the Ballard. I thought that the Brookner was, in its economy and elegance, a small triumph of moral insight worthy of the tradition of James and Forster to which it belonged. I was relieved to have support from Polly Devlin and the somewhat eccentric Richard Cobb in this, and pleased at the nudge to her career that the prize must have given.  1985 Marina Warner Norman St John Stevas was our chair, and early on that summer he picked out a number of books which he recommended his panel to read. Among them was a surprise, a bulky novel called The Bone People by Keri Hulme. Alongside the many gleamingly designed offerings from the major publishing houses, it had the distinction of being published by a women&apos;s cooperative in New Zealand, who, when the book won the prize against very high odds, came up in full island dress to collect it, chanting a Maori praise song.  Feelings in the final meeting - and afterwards - ran very high about this novel, but St John Stevas unexpectedly championed it throughout. Nina Bawden opposed it very strongly on the grounds of its violence (the novel tells a terrifying story of child-beatings), and wrote later publicly to distance herself from the decision. Nina found herself significantly outnumbered in her opposition, because Joanna Lumley didn&apos;t attend the final judging. She sent a message to say she was in rehearsal and that her nominated winner was Doris Lessing, for The Good Terrorist. When she heard The Bone People had won, she too dissociated herself from the judgment. JW Lambert and I supported the book.  I think that the best argument for the whole cruel and unfair business of prizes is that they can lead readers to writers who wouldn&apos;t otherwise be read much or perhaps at all. I didn&apos;t think Lessing needed the prize (and she would agree) and certainly not for a novel that is not her best (though it&apos;s a feature of prizes that authors often win for their weakest works).  1986 Anthony Thwaite My chairing of the 1986 judges was marred, or enlivened, by several scandals or leaks or items of gossip. I was said (wrongly) to have lectured my fellow judges on &quot;how to read a novel&quot;. I unwisely wrote to Julian Barnes to commiserate with him about his non-appearance on the shortlist: I was quoted as blaming it on &quot;all those women&quot; (my four fellow judges were Edna Healey, Isabel Quigly, Gillian Reynolds and Bernice Rubens). It was a splendid shortlist: Kingsley Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul Bailey, Robertson Davies, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo. We were still going to and fro up until 10 minutes before the press announcement had to be made: two strongly for Amis, two equally strongly for Davies (What&apos;s Bred in the Bone), and a wobbler in the middle. At the last moment the wobbler came down on the side of The Old Devils, and Amis had won. A very satisfactory result, I thought. 1987 PD James I look back on my chairmanship in 1987 as a very happy experience, particularly as I had as my colleagues four hardworking, enthusiastic and knowledgeable judges: Lady Selina Hastings, Allan Massie, Trevor McDonald and John B Thompson. I did have a fear at the time - and still do - that to ask the panel to read more than 100 novels in a comparatively short time can result in a literary surfeit which makes the final judgment more difficult. Choosing the winner was a long process, and I remember scurrying to the dinner table a little after the meal had started. At the end, however, the vote was unanimous - Penelope Lively won, for Moon Tiger - which is what I had hoped for. The Booker may at times have tended to increase the unhelpful dichotomy between popular storytelling and books which are classified as literary novels, but most of the winners have combined high literary achievement with compelling storytelling.  1988 Blake Morrison We were a jury of writers that year: Sebastian Faulks, Rose Tremain, Philip French and, in the chair, Michael Foot, who seemed keener to talk about Byron than to reminisce about leading the Labour party. As early as our first meeting, Peter Carey&apos;s Oscar and Lucinda was the clear frontrunner. The only arguments were about which novels should be with him on the shortlist. I read the bulk of the 100 or so entries during a fortnight&apos;s holiday with two small children in Wales, rising early and retiring late. Those we finally settled on were Salman Rushdie&apos;s The Satanic Verses (which I read with innocent pleasure - the controversy over it didn&apos;t erupt till the following year), Bruce Chatwin&apos;s Utz (his last novel - his funeral was the day of the fatwa), David Lodge&apos;s Nice Work (one of his best), Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s The Beginning of Spring (one of her best) and Marina Warner&apos;s The Lost Father.  My biggest regret was failing to get Doris Lessing&apos;s The Fifth Child on the shortlist - though in retrospect Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, was a graver omission. The final meeting lasted 25 minutes: Foot was for Rushdie, the rest of us were for Carey, so that was that. Rushdie has sometimes been caricatured as a bad loser, but at the ceremony he behaved impeccably and was generous in his praise of the winning book. All in all, a pleasing outcome. My other experiences of sitting on prize juries have been grisly in comparison. 1989 David Lodge Our shortlist meeting was the longest to date, and much of it was taken up with discussion of Martin Amis&apos;s London Fields. It is public knowledge that two of the judges on the panel, Maggie Gee and Helen McNeil, successfully resisted its inclusion on the shortlist, an outcome I still regret. The final judging session was uncontroversial - all but one of us were unequivocally in favour of Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day. I consider it one of the best Booker winners I have read.  The success of the prize has had an enormous impact on the reception of literary fiction and other kinds of writing, not only directly, but also indirectly through the proliferation of new prizes that have imitated it. But the overtly competitive nature of these prizes, heightened by the publication of longlists and shortlists, takes its psychological toll on writers; and, given the large element of chance in the composition and operation of judging panels, the importance now attached to prizes in our literary culture seems excessive. A committee is a blunt instrument of literary criticism. 1990 Hilary Mantel  Not a discourteous word was exchanged between the hardworking 1990 judges - much to the disappointment of the administrator Martyn Goff, who praised us to our faces and later whined that we were boring. Denis Forman ran the meetings with smooth expertise, and largely kept his own opinions dark until he cast the final vote. Weeks before I was appointed a judge, I&apos;d read John McGahern&apos;s Amongst Women and said, reaching page 20, &quot;This will win the Booker&quot;. So I was disappointed, but AS Byatt&apos;s Possession was a good book and a popular choice, and the discussion was fair. The process exhausted me, and I declined to do it a second time. What I despised was the leaking by the publicity machine of trivial non-stories to the press - I felt the prize had enough status and news value without that. I also believe the judges shouldn&apos;t review the books under consideration or talk about them in public, and in 1990 we didn&apos;t. I&apos;m glad I was a Booker judge relatively early in my career. It stopped me thinking that literary prizes are about literary value. Even the most correct jury goes in for horsetrading and gamesmanship, and what emerges is a compromise.  For me the best of the Bookers is The Siege of Krishnapur. I read it again a few months ago and its supple humour, its insight, economy and narrative drive make it an enduring delight. 1991 Nicholas Mosley I was asked to be a judge probably because I had just won the Whitbread the previous year. This had itself been a surprise, because it seemed I was out of favour with the literary establishment, having been labelled a &quot;novelist of ideas&quot; while what was in favour was &quot;style&quot;. And style seemed most easily to be exhibited in stories that were outlandish, or grim, or quaint. I looked forward to judging the Booker because I thought I might give a boost to &quot;ideas&quot;. There were five judges, and we had to choose six books out of 100 for the shortlist. I thought - well, surely, with this set-up I&apos;ll be able to squeeze in one choice of mine. But, in the event, I got none of my choices on to the list, because of the inflexibility of the voting system and of the other four judges, who were devotees of &quot;style&quot;. So I resigned, partly in a huff, but also because I thought that by so doing I might still be able to strike a blow for &quot;ideas&quot;, as I might be asked to explain myself in the press - which I did. The winner chosen by the remaining judges was Ben Okri&apos;s The Famished Road - a beautifully written (yes) story of a boy in a west African village who goes to and fro between his family and the local witchdoctor. My choice would have been Allan Massie&apos;s The Sins of the Father, which confronted the issue of what was possible or impossible if the child of a notorious ex-Nazi and the child of a Jewish victim fell in love after the second world war. What could be forgiven, and by whom, and what could not. But these are controversial questions, and thus conventionally to be avoided. 1992 Victoria Glendinning My fellow judges were John Coldstream, literary editor of the Telegraph, Harriet Harvey-Wood, literary director of the British Council, Valentine Cunningham and Mark Lawson. We became intimate in the way of people thrown together in a scary but non-fatal railway accident. John dreamt one night that he was Spartacus, with the Roman legions advancing on him in the form of piles of new titles. It was a vintage year for rent-a-sneer in the media. Prominent journalists whinged chauvinistically about &quot;far-flung authors&quot;, deaf to the explosion of energy from Commonwealth novelists, which has been the most significant feature of the Booker&apos;s 40 years. The prize was &quot;essentially trivial&quot;, pontificated AN Wilson in contemptuous mode in the Evening Standard; and, enraged, I wrote to the Guardian letters page to contest Richard Gott&apos;s clich\u00e9s about the decline of the novel and what he called the &quot;tokenism&quot; of the inclusion of Mich\u00e8le Roberts on the shortlist. Every book on our shortlist had one passionate supporter and one furious antagonist. When at the final meeting we locked horns over the frontrunners, it was suggested that we should reach our decision by taking into account second choices - proportional representation. This procedure gave Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) and Barry Unsworth (Sacred Hunger) equal points. I turned to Martyn Goff, sitting behind me discreetly - or as discreetly as anyone can who is wearing a gold satin tie - and asked if we could share the prize between the two. He conceded there was no rule against it. So that&apos;s what we did. Before the meeting, I was so unnerved that I left my bag with all my notes in it at the bank. When stressed I become sharp-tongued, and at one point told a fellow judge that he was a condescending bastard. My notes on our sessions are, at this distance in time, enigmatic. What in the world, for example, was Val Cunningham on about when he said: &quot;I am very interested in Huntley &amp; Palmer&apos;s biscuits and their role in literature&quot;?  1993 Gillian Beer Olivier Todd, the French novelist, shrugged his shoulders at our second judges&apos; meeting: no lunches with publishers, no approaches from agents, he complained - what an odd English bubble of propriety we were gathered inside. He was joking, but only just. And it is one of the remarkable things about being a Booker judge that no one tempts you with hospitality. You simply sit and read, and talk, and read again, over several months. The pleasure is in the reading, and in the talk. One of the rewards of going to see a new film is the conversation straight after, but reading new novels can be a lonely business. Not in this case. In 1993 I remember impassioned defences of books one of us had grown attached to, but no quarrels, just engrossing talk. Our chair, Grey Gowrie, came up with an ingenious criterion: novels must have &quot;radioactivity&quot; to stay in the running. He meant we must remember them weeks, months later. They mustn&apos;t fade. A self-proving criterion perhaps, but reassuring. One novel that certainly had that quality and yet just missed the shortlist was Trainspotting and it was in arguing about Irvine Welsh&apos;s book that we came nearest to quarrelling. Getting from long to shortlist was painful, worse than sorting out the winner among that final six. Some wanted the prize to go to David Malouf&apos;s Remembering Babylon, while Caryl Phillips&apos;s Crossing the River and Carol Shields&apos;s The Stone Diaries had strong support as well. But Roddy Doyle&apos;s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha won the day with its extraordinary technical achievement and its emotional force, taking us inside the voice and experience of a 10-year-old boy in the midst of family break-up. 1994 James Wood After serving on the 1994 Booker prize committee, I made a pledge never to judge a big fiction prize again, and I have so far honoured it. We were a congenial group, and our chairman was not a former politician or bureaucrat but a distinguished literary critic (John Bayley); our meetings were friendly, and surely no less or more argumentative than those of other years. But the absurdity of the process was soon apparent: it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel (a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism). In practice, judge A blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes, and then judge B blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes, and nothing changes: no one switches sides. That is when the horse-trading begins. I remember that one of the judges phoned me and said, in effect: &quot;I know that you especially like novel X, and you know that I especially like novel Y. It would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist, yes? So if you vote for my novel, I&apos;ll vote for yours, OK?&quot; That is how our shortlist was patched together, and it is how our winner was chosen. It is how every shortlist is chosen, whether the premises are as explicit or not. I liked the winning book a great deal (James Kelman&apos;s How Late It Was, How Late) - it was one of my choices - and would have been happy with either that book or Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s The Folding Star. But I intensely disliked the way we reached that verdict, and felt that the arbitrary, utterly political process discredited the whole project. Since then, prizes have become a form of reviewing: it is prize-lists that select what people read, prize-lists that make literary careers. Bookshops order novels based on the prizes they have won or been shortlisted for. Nowadays, a whole month before the shortlist is announced, scores of novelists are effectively told that their books have not been the &quot;big books&quot; of the year, because they are not to be found on the longlist. Soon, no doubt, we will have the long-longlist, and the long-long longlist. Some wonderful books win the Booker, of course, just as the flypaper occasionally catches some really large flies. But it means - or should mean - nothing in literary terms. 1995 Ruth Rendell I was always being asked what it was like to be on the Booker &quot;jury&quot;. But I could never see us as that. Jurors have to decide between guilt and innocence while we had to pick the best. The best of 140 in our case - or 6.3 books a week. Reading that number is normal for me, but books I want to read, not ones I have to. It makes a big difference. We got on well, we judges. We disagreed but never quite quarrelled. I used to lie and say I read every word of every book. The truth is that I did my best, but I am a judicious skipper. Going home to Suffolk, I finished a novel and left it in the train. A man called out to me that I&apos;d forgotten it, but when I said to keep it he was delighted. I hope he liked it better than I did.  So what did I get out of being a judge? The pleasure of giving the prize to Pat Barker&apos;s The Ghost Road, my choice, not one I was persuaded into. A mild antipathy to new novels so that now I tend to read more non-fiction. And my friendship with Peter Kemp, a fellow judge, which began in those Booker days.  1996 Jonathan Coe How very arbitrary it seems, in retrospect. There was nothing wrong with our shortlist, and nothing wrong with our winner (Last Orders, by Graham Swift), but at 12 years&apos; distance, it feels as though we could easily have chosen another six novels altogether. Our discussions were lengthy - and amicable, for the most part (until the final session, when tempers started to fray) - but what strikes me now about the whole process was how entirely subjective it was. Anyone who sets great store by the choices of Booker prize panels should remember this: the process consists of nothing more rigorous than five people sitting in a room together for a few hours, swapping personal opinions. And as far as I remember, not a single judge (including me) ever changed his or her mind, or shifted his or her position, in response to an argument put forward by a colleague. In the midst of it all, the novel which I now remember as being the finest of all - Asylum, by Patrick McGrath - slipped through our net, and failed to make the shortlist by a whisker. If it had reached the shortlist, such is the randomness of the final selection process, it might easily have won the prize itself. 1997 Jason Cowley Before the longlist was made public, if you wanted to know which books were in contention you would usually be able to find out by having a discreet lunch with Martyn Goff, the charming and mischievous prize administrator who used to operate his own idiosyncratic system of leaks, withholding and revealing in equal measure. I remember turning up to the meeting at which our shortlist would be decided to be received with suspicion by our chairman, Gillian Beer. She wanted to know how our longlist was being discussed in the papers, and I was pretty sure by the way she looked at me that she thought I was responsible. Certainly I&apos;d been having fun writing polemical pieces about the state of the British novel.  I believed then as I do now that the Booker is essentially a jamboree, little more than a kind of sport, with its own roster of winners and losers. It shouldn&apos;t be dignified or taken too seriously. But I wasn&apos;t the leaker. As we sat down for the lunch that preceded our discussions, and with Gillian Beer still grumbling about the longlist leaking out, I heard Goff say: &quot;It&apos;s quite extraordinary. I don&apos;t know how it happened.&quot; He then, winningly, glanced at me and winked.  I often think that I&apos;ve never quite recovered from my experience of being a judge. I began the year as an enthusiastic and engaged reader and reviewer of contemporary fiction, and ended it much more interested in non-fiction and narrative journalism. And of all the novels I read that year there are perhaps only two that I could ever imagine rereading: Arundhati Roy&apos;s The God of Small Things (our unfairly maligned winner) and Ian McEwan&apos;s Enduring Love (which just missed out on being shortlisted and divided the judges more than any other entry).  1998 Douglas Hurd This was a quiet year. There were no sensational or overpowering entries, and no passionate disputes among the judges. The crafty device of holding the final meeting of the judges immediately before the award dinner certainly concentrated the mind. The prize went to Amsterdam by Ian McEwan, not because we thought it was about time he won the Booker, but because in a mild year most people (though not the chairman) thought his offering finished just ahead of Beryl Bainbridge, riding Master Georgie 1999 Shena Mackay It was a very strong year for fiction. When I was a judge - alongside Boyd Tonkin, Natasha Walter and John Sutherland, with Gerald Kaufman in the chair - several books assumed to be shoo-ins weren&apos;t on the shortlist, which caused dismay, as did the discovery by some authors that their books had not been entered, on the presumption that the judges would call them in. We failed to do so. Sorry. Pressures of time and books arriving late. Our shortlisted authors were JM Coetzee, Anita Desai, Michael Frayn, Andrew O&apos;Hagan, Ahdaf Soueif and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. We gave the prize - controversially because he had won in 1983 - to Coetzee for Disgrace. We were vindicated recently when it was shortlisted for the Best of Bookers. John Sutherland was a strong advocate of Salman Rushdie (The Ground Beneath Her Feet) in our year, and he must be delighted that Midnight&apos;s Children has won the Booker of Bookers for the second time. Our chief dispute arose from John&apos;s gadfly comments in this newspaper. As far as I remember, it was the suggestion that Natasha Walter and I had a feminist agenda which prompted Natasha to write a letter to the Guardian, which I signed. Being a judge gave me much more anxiety than being on the shortlist myself, even with the horrible bookies&apos; odds and the risk of being depicted as a cartoon racehorse, because as a judge you are responsible for disappointing a lot of people. 2000 Rose Tremain My second stint as a Booker prize judge contrasted with the first in one important respect: we had an extremely effective and powerful chair in Simon Jenkins. In 1988, the lovable Michael Foot had been hampered, as chair, by diary overspill. But Simon&apos;s influence on the 2000 jury was impressive. Meetings were held at his rooms in Albany, rather than at Martyn Goff&apos;s preferred venue of the Savile Club. Despite the constant lamentations of his fax machine, Simon&apos;s attention never strayed from the tasks in hand, the first of which was to kick out the dross. Roy Foster, Caroline Gascoigne, Mariella Frostrup and I were a vocal team and we each had our favourites. Mariella was able to squeeze Matthew Kneale&apos;s English Passengers on to the list, and Caroline&apos;s advocacy for Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s When We Were Orphans was duly recognised. Roy Foster and I lost our battle for Anne Enright&apos;s What Are You Like?, but my call-in title, Trezza Azzopardi&apos;s The Hiding Place, scraped home.  What is really interesting is that nobody thought Margaret Atwood&apos;s The Blind Assassin was her best book. Where Simon&apos;s mental agility paid off was in persuading us all (except Mariella) that Atwood deserved the prize anyway - for all the times she&apos;d nearly won it and had been pipped at the post by a lesser writer.  2001 Philip Hensher It&apos;s an unusual experience, reading for the Booker. For once in your life you take a synchronic slice through the English-language novel, and see exactly what&apos;s interesting it at that moment. I was lucky in having an excellent chairman in Kenneth Baker, unprejudiced, interested and diligent, and fellow judges who really knew about the novel - Kate Summerscale was particularly good to argue with. I think we made a good choice with Peter Carey&apos;s substantial True History of the Kelly Gang, but the whole shortlist was, in my view, exceptional. I regretted that media excitement over Beryl Bainbridge actually damaged her chances with According to Queeney. We realised that if we shortlisted her, she had to win. There was no point in blotting out the winner&apos;s publicity with a storm of &quot;Beryl Bridesmaid Again&quot; headlines. I wanted to do more for Nick Hornby&apos;s How to Be Good, and it was a relief that the Whitbread rewarded Philip Pullman&apos;s The Amber Spyglass, which we could easily have shortlisted. It was a good-humoured, interesting experience, but what I got most out of it was being introduced to new novelists - Zvi Jagendorf, Ciaran Carson, Jamie O&apos;Neill - however far they got in the judging process.  The best novel to have been given the prize is, I think, Naipaul&apos;s In a Free State in 1971.  2002 Salley Vickers I was a judge the year Life of Pi won, and there is no doubt that our choice was a rip-roaring popular success. The booksellers loved us for it. It was me, in fact, who first drew the other judges&apos; attention to the novel. I was given it while on tour in Canada, by a Winnipeg bookseller, and read it excitedly on the plane home. We used to have extra meetings at the home of our chair, Lisa Jardine, and I recall telling all the other judges - Erica Wagner, Russell Celyn Jones and David Baddiel - about the book, which at that time had not been entered by Canongate. I was very glad to see it on to the shortlist, but it was not my final choice (the other books on the shortlist were Rohinton Mistry&apos;s Family Matters, Carol Shields&apos;s Unless, William Trevor&apos;s The Story of Lucy Gault, Sarah Waters&apos;s Fingersmith and Tim Winton&apos;s Dirt Music). However, Lisa was a skilled chair. She wanted a unanimous verdict and, much as I admired the book, I couldn&apos;t give her that. So she said, &quot;Salley, it was you who brought the book to our attention. Will you give the decision your blessing?&quot; Well, I couldn&apos;t refuse. 2003 DJ Taylor I can&apos;t say that I enjoyed reading all the books - 113 of them, I believe, in that year - but there was a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from the attendant razzmatazz, the thought that for a very brief period in the year an artefact routinely overlooked by large swathes of an indifferent media was suddenly news. There were several memorable clashes of opinion, the funniest by far coming when the chair, John Carey, trying desperately to persuade us of the merits of Martin Amis&apos;s Yellow Dog, read aloud from a paragraph describing the death-throes of a dying fly, at which point Francine Stock and I caught each other&apos;s eye across the table and began to giggle. The judging process was pretty much a waste of time as all four of the other judges arrived at the longlist meeting convinced that DBC Pierre&apos;s Vernon God Little was one of the great masterpieces of the early 21st century, whereas I thought that it was a promising first novel. This meant that the final judging session lasted a bare 10 minutes, after which I had to sit discussing the existence (or non-existence) of God with AC Grayling, a subject on which both of us hold strong views. 2004 Tibor Fischer I&apos;d heard the rumours. The hair-pulling, the eye-gouging, the shameful flouncing. I was, however, extremely impressed by the rigour of my fellow judges, who, unlike me, had proper jobs and families to distract them from the mound of books. What did I learn? Discussion is futile. No one changes their mind about a book. You might as well have a show of hands straight away. There aren&apos;t many bad books (only one novel ended up in the bin after two pages), but there are a lot of so-so, nondescript novels that leave no trace. Publishers are idiots. I was very pleased Alan Hollinghurst won. But I wouldn&apos;t say The Line of Beauty is a better novel than David Mitchell&apos;s very different Cloud Atlas (which came in second) or Neil Cross&apos;s Always the Sun (or others on the longlist). There are good reasons why Midnight&apos;s Children has been chosen as the Best of the Bookers (although every novelist I know rates Shame as Rushdie&apos;s best book), but it would have been a more interesting exercise to have chosen the best of the shortlisted novels. It&apos;s a pity that Beryl Bainbridge has always been pipped, and my favourite novel in the Booker annals (I&apos;ve read it at least a dozen times) is Derek Robinson&apos;s Goshawk Squadron 2005 John Sutherland When I chaired year 37, it more or less, as airline pilots say, flew by wire. The year was, by general agreement, a bumper one for fiction. As usual, no minds were much changed by the panel discussions - candidate B merely came forward when one judge&apos;s candidate A was voted down. John Banville came out top with The Sea. King of the As and Bs. Teeth were gnashed in the press the next day; but they would be if Jesus Christ had written the winning novel. I spoke to Kazuo Ishiguro (shortlisted for Never Let Me Go) shortly after. &quot;The goalkeeper jumped the wrong way&quot;, he sportingly said. I wish I&apos;d been quick-witted enough to rejoin &quot;not even Petr Cech has to save five penalty shots all coming at him at once&quot;. Julian Barnes, in an interview for the New York Times, was more savage (he had been shortlisted for Arthur &amp; George). Not, he felt, a bumper year for judges. Perhaps he was right. But posterity will forget us. Barnes, Ishiguro and - I believe - Banville they&apos;ll remember. And make their own judgments.  2006 Anthony Quinn I enjoyed every moment of the 2006 Booker until the very last minutes of our final meeting in the Guildhall. That was when I realised that the novel which I had set my heart on would not be the winner. On anecdotal evidence from friends who had judged the prize in previous years, I gathered that there was usually someone on the jury who would be a complete pest and make the whole process as awkward as possible. Not this time: our chairman, Hermione Lee, set a tone of almost heartless conviviality that Candia McWilliam, Fiona Shaw and Simon Armitage consistently upheld. Indeed, we had been so likeminded in the final reckoning of our shortlist that I must have blanked the ominous build-up of support for Kiran Desai&apos;s The Inheritance of Loss and assumed that everyone would come round to what was clearly the best book, Edward St Aubyn&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk. When I was outvoted 4-1 I was surprised, and appalled. Six months of reading and re-reading - only to be thwarted at the last! I asked for a recount, which at least got a laugh. It&apos;s not an exaggeration to say that I felt sick to my stomach. I was pleased for Kiran Desai, who&apos;d spent eight years writing it. But we chose the wrong book.  2007 Giles Foden Everyone expected arguments, and we had them, but with dignity (my fellow judges were Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs). We never fell out. In fact, we are meeting up this autumn for a drink. Some had their favourites that others couldn&apos;t stand; others tried to hold up yardsticks against which all books might be measured. The favourite supporters made persuasive cases for AN Wilson and Nicola Barker, but only Barker got through to the shortlist, despite an unfortunate error in transmission - not the judges&apos; fault - which suggested Wilson had. The longlist is where the real argy-bargy takes place.  Once an author is on the shortlist anything can happen. In our case we arrived at a situation in which every judge had mutually exclusive first and last choices. Luckily, in Howard Davies we had a competent chairman, who helped us mathematically towards a choice of winner with which everyone was happy. PS: note to publishers, try not to write call-in letters with spelling mistakes, or one that make foolish claims. Some of these letters looked as if they were written in haste. Then again, so did some of the novels submitted. 2008 Alex Clark Before I was asked to judge this year&apos;s prize, I had been on several literary prize panels and I felt I had enough experience to know roughly what I was doing. But little can prepare you for the Booker: not just the sheer volume of books submitted, but the sense that you are about to be partly responsible for making an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Now, with the final hurdle fast approaching, I can say that it&apos;s been not only an enjoyable process but also an instructive one. Reading is, of course, a solitary affair, and book reviewing not much less so. But anatomising one&apos;s taste and judgment and then communicating it to a group of people with equally strong views has been a wonderful challenge - not least because it makes for scrutiny of what it is that one values in fiction. And, gruelling though it was, I wouldn&apos;t give up those late nights and early mornings spent poring over novels. And the winner was ... Booker prize winners 1969 Something to Answer For by PH Newby 1970 The Elected Member by Bernice Rubens 1971 In a Free State by VS Naipaul 1972 G by John Berger 1973 The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell 1974 Holiday by Stanley Middleton and The Conservationist by Nadine Gordimer 1975 Heat and Dust by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala 1976 Saville by David Storey 1977 Staying On by Paul Scott 1978 The Sea The Sea by Iris Murdoch 1979 Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald 1980 Rites of Passage by William Golding 1981 Midnight&apos;s Children by Salman Rushdie 1982 Schindler&apos;s Ark by Thomas Keneally 1983 Life &amp; Times of Michael K by JM Coetzee 1984 Hotel du Lac by Anita Brookner 1985 The Bone People by Keri Hulme 1986 The Old Devils by Kingsley Amis 1987 Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively 1988 Oscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey 1989 The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro 1990 Possession by AS Byatt 1991 The Famished Road by Ben Okri 1992 The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje and Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth 1993 Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle 1994 How Late It Was How Late by James Kelman 1995 The Ghost Road by Pat Barker 1996 Last Orders by Graham Swift 1997 The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy 1998 Amsterdam by Ian McEwan 1999 Disgrace by JM Coetzee 2000 The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood 2001 True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey 2002 Life of Pi by Yann Martel 2003 Vernon God Little by DBC Pierre 2004 The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst 2005 The Sea by John Banville 2006 The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai 2007 The Gathering by Anne Enright \u00b7 &quot;The Booker 40 at the V&amp;A&quot; is at the V&amp;am 1969 Frank Kermode The first judges were Rebecca West, Stephen Spender, David Farrer and WL Webb, at that time literary editor of the Guardian. We were handsomely treated: in London we haunted Bertorelli&apos;s, but we spent more than one weekend at Michael Astor&apos;s beautiful Cotswold house, where Dame Rebecca strode the grounds authoritatively between bouts of laying down the law. There were perhaps 60 books, which seemed a lot, though modern judges are said to read twice as many. Getting through the 60 was made easier by our not daring to take on Dame Rebecca. &quot;Miss Murdoch writes good and bad novels in alternate years,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a bad year.&quot; Muriel Spark: &quot;clever but too playful.&quot; And out they went.  Two of us favoured Nicholas Mosley&apos;s Impossible Object, but were soon silenced. The choice of PH Newby&apos;s Something to Answer For was the result of a compromise. Dame Rebecca didn&apos;t dislike it as much as nearly all the others. Surveyors of the prize&apos;s history have spoken ill of this good book, perhaps without reading it, or by being too ready to suppose that this industrious writer could manage a novel a year as well as running the Third Programme. Anyway, I remember this, my one experience of judging, with much pleasure and amusement. 1970 Antonia Fraser The judging of the 1970 prize was a low-key affair except for the feisty behaviour of Dame Rebecca West, a judge for the second year running. At one point she denounced Margaret Drabble for her novels of domestic life on the grounds that &quot;Anyone can do the washing-up; just get a big bowl and some liquid; so why complain about it?&quot; The novel in question was The Waterfall, which both Richard Hoggart and I admired greatly (and didn&apos;t think was about washing-up). I knew Rebecca West, since she was a friend and neighbour of my parents in Sussex, and was very fond of her; all the same, it occurred to me that she was possibly one of the brilliant old ladies who felt threatened by a brilliant young one in the shape of Maggie Drabble. In the end we were split between William Trevor&apos;s Mrs Eckdorf in O&apos;Neill&apos;s Hotel and Bernice Rubens&apos;s The Elected Member. I voted for Rubens but today would vote for Trevor.  1971 was much more exacting. The most exciting thing that happened to me as a Booker Judge for the second time was not controversial. I shared a taxi back with fellow judge Saul Bellow on a long, long ride from somewhere in the City: he was nattily dressed in a pale green shantung suit, blue shirt, green tie with large blue dots on it; his silver hair and slanting, large dark eyes made him look like a 30s film star playing a refined gangster. Suddenly he leaned forward and asked: &quot;Has anyone ever told you that you&apos;re a very handsome woman?&quot; I pondered on a suitable reply, modest yet encouraging. But having spoken, the Great Man closed his eyes and remained apparently asleep for the rest of the journey. 1971 John Gross A faint aroma of the Nobel prize - or of Nobel prizes yet to come - hangs over the 1971 Booker. First, the award went to VS Naipaul (who was to be Nobel laureate in 2001) for In a Free State. It was a result with which I agreed. Second, the organisers had succeeded in persuading a distinguished writer from abroad to be one of the judges: Saul Bellow (who was to be Nobel laureate in 1976). It seemed a thrilling prospect. In the event, one of the things I remember most clearly about Bellow is that he insisted on being put up at the Ritz (which must have burned a big hole in the budget), and then complained because he hadn&apos;t been given a room overlooking Green Park. Another recollection is his response when I advanced the claims of Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which apart from the Naipaul was the book on the shortlist I most favoured. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;that&apos;s one of those little tinkling teacup things that the British always do well.&quot; He was quite wrong - Mrs Palfrey is a work of deep feeling - but his dismissiveness effectively put paid to its chances. 1972 George Steiner It was the most illustrious panel in the Booker&apos;s history. Both the other judges, Cyril Connolly and Elizabeth Bowen, were too ill to attend the ceremony. I fought very hard for John Berger to win for G, and then he threw it in my face by giving half the prize money to the Black Panthers. It was a very grim experience. I was in a very precarious position at the time and I literally thought it was the end for me in this country. I thought I would have to pack my bags and go.  1973 Edna O&apos;Brien Mary McCarthy and I were the judges, with Karl Miller presiding as chairman. Disputes were negligible. From a batch of about 20, it was whittled down to two contenders - The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell and The Black Prince by Iris Murdoch, with Farrell winning by a whisker. Next day, Mary changed her mind and it was left to Miller to cast the deciding vote, which he did with alacrity and no rancour. The prize has changed as the literary/publishing world has undergone a radical and not always edifying sea change: the celebrity virus now infects authors and judges alike. 1974 Ion Trewin We were three judges - AS Byatt, Elizabeth Jane Howard and me. At the shortlist meeting, Jane remarked that she thought Ending Up by Kingsley Amis (then her husband) was his best book and should go on the shortlist. I looked first at Antonia, and then at Martyn Goff, the prize&apos;s administrator - both remained impassive. We broke for a breather. Martyn said that as chairman it was up to me. Antonia liked the novel (as did I). On literary grounds neither of us had problems about shortlisting it, but what would the press say?  The Booker was already familiar with controversies. Martyn, I know, was not averse to the publicity that our decision would inevitably bring. (This was to centre around a vituperative correspondence in the Times.) But would the burgeoning reputation of the prize be damaged? He thought not. More important was our choice of winner. Antonia and I spoke up for Nadine Gordimer&apos;s The Conservationist, but Jane was less impressed. She remained keen on Ending Up, but realising that neither Antonia nor I would countenance it winning, she concentrated on Stanley Middleton&apos;s Holiday, a study of middle England that she saw as a &quot;perfect miniature&quot;. With only three judges, it seemed important to me that we did not compromise or produce a two-one verdict. Might we split the prize between Middleton and Gordimer? Martyn said he knew of no reason why not. We were vindicated by The Conservationist being selected this year for the Best of the Booker shortlist. My favourite Booker winner remains Schindler&apos;s Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally (but I must declare my interest and say that I was its editor). 1975 Susan Hill Peter Ackroyd was the young, newly appointed literary editor of the Spectator. Roy Fuller was a distinguished older poet. Angus Wilson was in his years as founder of the creative writing course at UEA and one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary novel. It was a daunting experience to join them as a judge. I took the mountain of submitted novels on my honeymoon, and our first meeting was scheduled for the day I returned. I discovered that Angus had spent a holiday at the same Italian hotel a few weeks earlier. So we should all have been in mellow mood, and three of us were. But Roy Fuller was not the easiest man to work with. He was acerbic and disliked being contradicted, and when it came to choosing a shortlist he refused to join in, on the grounds that we had agreed on our winner, so a shortlist was superfluous. The Booker management committee was, rightly, having none of this and insisted.  I had been shortlisted myself three years earlier, and it had given my career a huge boost. I fought hard. We all did. Fuller grudgingly agreed to allowing a shortlist of two - the winner and one runner-up. Otherwise, he was going to walk. It was tricky and it spoiled what should have been an enjoyable experience. I was very happy with our winner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala&apos;s Heat and Dust, but I wish we had stood up to Fuller and if he had walked out, so be it.  My personal Best of Bookers is JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. The omission of Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece The Blue Flower even from the shortlist in 1995 I find quite inexplicable.  1976 Francis King There is a vast difference of scale between the prize as I experienced it as a judge and how it is now. Then the prize money was far less generous, and the fee for the judging was an honorarium. There were only three judges: our chairman Walter Allen, an admirable novelist and critic, then confined to a wheelchair, so that I had to read out his presentation speech for him; Mary Wilson, the wife of the prime minister; and me. Despite his failing health, Allen was, unlike me, immensely conscientious in reading every submission from cover to cover. Mary Wilson, a lover of poetry and herself an artless but often touching poet, was at the disadvantage of having read few novels in the course of her life - so that she was clearly puzzled when I referred to one of the submissions as &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;.  My sister Elizabeth looked through the piles of books awaiting my reading, and eventually held up David Storey&apos;s Saville. With a colleague, John Guest, she had already put in a lot of robust work as one of its two editors. &quot;This will be the winner,&quot; she announced. It was, she explained, an epic about a north country mining community and was therefore exactly what would appeal to Allen, a lifetime socialist, and to the wife of a Labour PM. She was right. I battled for Julian Rathbone&apos;s King Fisher Lives, to no avail. Mary Wilson was obdurate: &quot;I couldn&apos;t be party to giving the prize to a book about cannibalism.&quot;  For me far and away the best Booker winner in the whole history of the Prize is JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. The best of all the novels that ought to have won the Prize but failed to do so is Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece The Blue Flower 1977 Beryl Bainbridge Making a choice was very difficult - because it was this great prize of the world, one had to be very careful. Since I was published by Duckworth, it was very peculiar to have a Duckworth novel - Great Granny Webster by Caroline Blackwood - included in the vote. I put my vote forward - for Blackwood - but the discussion on it lasted only about three minutes, because it was such a short book. So nobody was really interested in that. All I can remember of the final meeting is that I got terribly tired, I literally sank lower and lower under the table. Brendan Gill, who I thought was American, went towards the balcony saying he was going to throw himself off, he was so fed up. Philip Larkin was completely silent most of the time. Nobody dared say a word to him and he never said a word back. The only one who was in total control of everything was Robin Ray. He was so clever that we all went along with whatever he said, and he wanted Staying On by Paul Scott to win. Poor Scott was too ill to collect the prize. I&apos;ve been shortlisted for the Booker five times and never won. I&apos;m just very pleased to have been noticed. 1978 Derwent May In 1978, all the five jury members had a different first choice, and they were all sticking to it. Suddenly someone suggested a compromise candidate that we all quite liked, but it seemed to me that we were now heading for disaster. Freddie Ayer, the chairman, had more or less pulled out, saying that the only novels he enjoyed reading were crime novels. So I went round the jury - the other three were all novelists, PH Newby, Angela Huth and Clare Boylan - and said to them in turn &quot;Is this book your first choice?&quot; All, rather sheepishly, said &quot;No&quot;. I said, &quot;The winner must surely be at least one person&apos;s first choice&quot;, and I saw it was the moment for me to push what I thought was unmistakably the best book, Iris Murdoch&apos;s The Sea, The Sea - which I knew was at least one juror&apos;s second choice (the other shortlisted authors were Kingsley Amis, Andr\u00e9 Brink, Penelope Fitzgerald, Jane Gardam and Bernice Rubens). I&apos;m glad to say it won.  The best three winners have, I think, been the Murdoch, William Golding&apos;s Rites of Passage and Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day. The prize has always lurched too much in favour of writers with unpromising backgrounds or good liberal attitudes, but it has unfailingly provided an excellent focus on the year&apos;s new novels. 1979 Hilary Spurling  I loved my Booker summer, which boils down in my memory to long, hot, hazy days spent lying under a tree in the garden reading novels and saying to anyone who tried to interrupt: &quot;Go away, I&apos;m working.&quot; It was a strong field and the bookies&apos; favourite was VS Naipaul&apos;s A Bend in the River. Its opponents on the panel argued that the book shouldn&apos;t strictly be classified as a novel, and in any case he&apos;d won the prize before. The Naipaul lobby (including me) snapped back that the novel was doomed if it couldn&apos;t expand to include this sort of documentary fiction, and that our job was to pick the year&apos;s best book, regardless of its author. The final verdict was as much of a shock to the judges as it was to everybody else. We&apos;d spent the entire afternoon at loggerheads, and in the end compromised by giving the prize to everybody&apos;s second choice, Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s small, slight, melancholy but beautifully judged and executed Offshore. Her recently published collected letters make it clear that her triumph - and the general incredulity that greeted it - caused her humiliation ever after. 1980 Claire Tomalin I was determined that Alice Munro should be on the shortlist, and stuck my heels in to get her there. There were two real contenders for the prize, I believed, Anthony Burgess&apos;s Earthly Powers and William Golding&apos;s Rites of Passage, and the night before the final judging session I lay awake debating with myself: the Golding beautifully written and constructed, but with a slightly musty feel about it; Burgess a magnificent entertainer, overflowing with good humour, sometimes tipping into the slapdash. Both books thoroughly deserving. The next morning David Daiches, our chairman, began: &quot;We&apos;ll go through the list in alphabetical order. I take it no one consider Burgess a possible winner?&quot; Silence from the others. I exploded into a eulogy of Burgess&apos;s energy, invention and comic gift. I saw I had convinced no one, and felt that left only Golding. And so it was. Burgess sent a message saying he would not come to the dinner unless he won. I don&apos;t blame him. I saw a tear trickle down Golding&apos;s cheek when the announcement was made. I have re-read neither book, and I have rejoiced to see Alice Munro win the recognition she deserves.  1981 Hermione Lee Salman Rushdie has won the Booker of Bookers and the Best of all Bookers, with his lastingly dazzling, deep and splendid novel, now a classic of world literature, Midnight&apos;s Children. But over a quarter of a century ago, when I was one of the judges who gave him the prize, his book was by no means an easy winner. Not many people had heard of Rushdie, unless they&apos;d read a weird piece of science fiction called Grimus or seen the stunning extracts from the new novel in Granta. Our panel of judges (Samuel Hynes, Joan Bakewell, Brian Aldiss and me, with Malcolm Bradbury as chair) were pulling in different ways. We were reading many writers with more established reputations, and much more experience, than Rushdie - such as Muriel Spark. (To my lasting regret, we overlooked one of Nadine Gordimer&apos;s best novels, July&apos;s People.) Brian Aldiss was especially keen on Doris Lessing&apos;s &quot;space fiction&quot; The Sirian Experiments, Malcolm on Ian McEwan&apos;s The Comfort of Strangers.  We all jumped at the late arrival of the almost forgotten Anglo-Irish writer Molly Keane, the short-listing of whose wicked and eccentric novel Good Behaviour gained her a devoted new following. But our final discussion was painfully split between Midnight&apos;s Children and The White Hotel, DM Thomas&apos;s psychoanalytical erotic novel, centring on the massacre at Babi Yar, which made a strong impression on me at the time but now, looking back, seems to me sensationalist and exploitative. Sam Hynes, Joan Bakewell and I were firmly on the side of Rushdie; Brian Aldiss was passionately keen on Thomas, and so was Malcolm Bradbury, who tried at the very end of the discussion to argue that the chair should have a casting, and over-ruling vote. This was not allowed, Rushdie won by 3 votes to 2, and Brian Aldiss (whose intensity impressed me) left the room with tears in his eyes. When the 1981 prize was announced, a mighty career was launched. It would have taken off anyway, but it was helped by the prize. Chairing the prize 25 years on, I felt happy to be helping on Kiran Desai, a literary descendant of Rushdie&apos;s. 1982 Paul Bailey There are many things I regret doing, and being a judge for the Booker prize is one of them. For some years after I was associated with two novels I absolutely loathed and would not have even started reading in other circumstances (on the shortlist that year were Thomas Keneally&apos;s Schindler&apos;s Ark, John Arden&apos;s Silence Among the Weapons, William Boyd&apos;s An Ice-Cream War, Lawrence Durrell&apos;s Constance or Solitary Practices, Alice Thomas Ellis&apos;s The 27th Kingdom and Timothy Mo&apos;s Sour Sweet). They are history now and are likely to remain so. My one good deed was to ensure a place on the shortlist for Sour Sweet, consequently bringing his work to a larger audience. But otherwise it was a dispiriting experience. The winner, by a single vote, was Schindler&apos;s Ark, a controversial but ultimately very popular choice. The prize was founded, in part, to encourage competitiveness. Which of the six novelists will make it to the finishing post? This grisly notion constitutes a perfect recipe for envy, back-biting and self-glorification. The Booker has certainly mirrored fashion - the collapse of the empire; post-modernist Victorian pastiche; New Age sentimentality. Several stinkers have been honoured, but there have been some glorious losers: Alice Munro&apos;s The Beggar Maid, John McGahern&apos;s Amongst Women and Edward St Aubyn&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk. A wonderful book such as Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s The Blue Flower was completely ignored, and I hope the judges for 1995 are blushing now to be reminded of their grotesque oversight. 1983 Fay Weldon A lively year, as Booker prizes go. We had a distinguished set of judges and some terrific books. The panel was finally split between a Coetzee and a Rushdie - a clash of continents. As the chairperson I had the casting vote - which is not saying &quot;oh, I like that one best&quot;, but weighing up the arguments of one set of judges against the others and deciding which are the most convincing. The Coetzee (Life &amp; Times of Michael K) got it, and Rushdie was really annoyed.  As a fervent feminist (25 years back), and taking time to make up my mind, I made a joke: &quot;I haven&apos;t got my husband here to help me decide.&quot; But one should never make jokes in the presence of the police, security or at a Booker prize judging, and word got round that I meant it. Then I had to deliver the customary chairperson&apos;s speech. After I sat down, the then president of the Publishers Association got to his feet, crossed the room and hit my agent Giles Gordon, second best thing to hitting me. I&apos;d used the speech to reproach the publishers for giving such rotten deals to writers. Since the BBC was working to rule, they cut the cameras at 10pm precisely: I was using transparent screens from which to make the speech (a Thatcher trick), and they went blank before I had time to finish with the usual pacifying bit about how you are all honourable men and none of what I say applies to you. Instead, I just had to sit down and all hell broke loose.  I had actually shown the speech to the organisers earlier, but I suppose they hadn&apos;t bothered to read it. I hadn&apos;t thought it was all that inflammatory. Michael Caine, charismatic chairman of Bookers, came up to me years later, when I had been inadvertently invited to one of the subsequent dinners, and said: &quot;It is not by any wish of mine you are here tonight.&quot; It&apos;s all got rather dull since: the prize tends to go to well-behaved and deserving writers: no subversion allowed. No one hits anyone.  1984 John Fuller This was the year when the hot favourite, JG Ballard (Empire of the Sun), was passed over for a relative newcomer, Anita Brookner (Hotel du Lac). Hardly a scandal, but in a strong year we had already discarded some big names (Burgess, Golding, Spark, Bainbridge, two Amises, etc) before reaching the shortlist, so that journalistic antennae were twitching, and the outcome was felt to be a further surprise. The judges got on pretty well together. We were somewhat exercised by the question of whether Julian Barnes&apos;s Flaubert&apos;s Parrot was really a novel, while in the final judging session Anthony Curtis continued to argue for David Lodge (Small World), and Ted Rowlands stuck out for the Ballard. I thought that the Brookner was, in its economy and elegance, a small triumph of moral insight worthy of the tradition of James and Forster to which it belonged. I was relieved to have support from Polly Devlin and the somewhat eccentric Richard Cobb in this, and pleased at the nudge to her career that the prize must have given.  1985 Marina Warner Norman St John Stevas was our chair, and early on that summer he picked out a number of books which he recommended his panel to read. Among them was a surprise, a bulky novel called The Bone People by Keri Hulme. Alongside the many gleamingly designed offerings from the major publishing houses, it had the distinction of being published by a women&apos;s cooperative in New Zealand, who, when the book won the prize against very high odds, came up in full island dress to collect it, chanting a Maori praise song.  Feelings in the final meeting - and afterwards - ran very high about this novel, but St John Stevas unexpectedly championed it throughout. Nina Bawden opposed it very strongly on the grounds of its violence (the novel tells a terrifying story of child-beatings), and wrote later publicly to distance herself from the decision. Nina found herself significantly outnumbered in her opposition, because Joanna Lumley didn&apos;t attend the final judging. She sent a message to say she was in rehearsal and that her nominated winner was Doris Lessing, for The Good Terrorist. When she heard The Bone People had won, she too dissociated herself from the judgment. JW Lambert and I supported the book.  I think that the best argument for the whole cruel and unfair business of prizes is that they can lead readers to writers who wouldn&apos;t otherwise be read much or perhaps at all. I didn&apos;t think Lessing needed the prize (and she would agree) and certainly not for a novel that is not her best (though it&apos;s a feature of prizes that authors often win for their weakest works).  1986 Anthony Thwaite My chairing of the 1986 judges was marred, or enlivened, by several scandals or leaks or items of gossip. I was said (wrongly) to have lectured my fellow judges on &quot;how to read a novel&quot;. I unwisely wrote to Julian Barnes to commiserate with him about his non-appearance on the shortlist: I was quoted as blaming it on &quot;all those women&quot; (my four fellow judges were Edna Healey, Isabel Quigly, Gillian Reynolds and Bernice Rubens). It was a splendid shortlist: Kingsley Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul Bailey, Robertson Davies, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo. We were still going to and fro up until 10 minutes before the press announcement had to be made: two strongly for Amis, two equally strongly for Davies (What&apos;s Bred in the Bone), and a wobbler in the middle. At the last moment the wobbler came down on the side of The Old Devils, and Amis had won. A very satisfactory result, I thought. 1987 PD James I look back on my chairmanship in 1987 as a very happy experience, particularly as I had as my colleagues four hardworking, enthusiastic and knowledgeable judges: Lady Selina Hastings, Allan Massie, Trevor McDonald and John B Thompson. I did have a fear at the time - and still do - that to ask the panel to read more than 100 novels in a comparatively short time can result in a literary surfeit which makes the final judgment more difficult. Choosing the winner was a long process, and I remember scurrying to the dinner table a little after the meal had started. At the end, however, the vote was unanimous - Penelope Lively won, for Moon Tiger - which is what I had hoped for. The Booker may at times have tended to increase the unhelpful dichotomy between popular storytelling and books which are classified as literary novels, but most of the winners have combined high literary achievement with compelling storytelling.  1988 Blake Morrison We were a jury of writers that year: Sebastian Faulks, Rose Tremain, Philip French and, in the chair, Michael Foot, who seemed keener to talk about Byron than to reminisce about leading the Labour party. As early as our first meeting, Peter Carey&apos;s Oscar and Lucinda was the clear frontrunner. The only arguments were about which novels should be with him on the shortlist. I read the bulk of the 100 or so entries during a fortnight&apos;s holiday with two small children in Wales, rising early and retiring late. Those we finally settled on were Salman Rushdie&apos;s The Satanic Verses (which I read with innocent pleasure - the controversy over it didn&apos;t erupt till the following year), Bruce Chatwin&apos;s Utz (his last novel - his funeral was the day of the fatwa), David Lodge&apos;s Nice Work (one of his best), Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s The Beginning of Spring (one of her best) and Marina Warner&apos;s The Lost Father.  My biggest regret was failing to get Doris Lessing&apos;s The Fifth Child on the shortlist - though in retrospect Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, was a graver omission. The final meeting lasted 25 minutes: Foot was for Rushdie, the rest of us were for Carey, so that was that. Rushdie has sometimes been caricatured as a bad loser, but at the ceremony he behaved impeccably and was generous in his praise of the winning book. All in all, a pleasing outcome. My other experiences of sitting on prize juries have been grisly in comparison. 1989 David Lodge Our shortlist meeting was the longest to date, and much of it was taken up with discussion of Martin Amis&apos;s London Fields. It is public knowledge that two of the judges on the panel, Maggie Gee and Helen McNeil, successfully resisted its inclusion on the shortlist, an outcome I still regret. The final judging session was uncontroversial - all but one of us were unequivocally in favour of Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day. I consider it one of the best Booker winners I have read.  The success of the prize has had an enormous impact on the reception of literary fiction and other kinds of writing, not only directly, but also indirectly through the proliferation of new prizes that have imitated it. But the overtly competitive nature of these prizes, heightened by the publication of longlists and shortlists, takes its psychological toll on writers; and, given the large element of chance in the composition and operation of judging panels, the importance now attached to prizes in our literary culture seems excessive. A committee is a blunt instrument of literary criticism. 1990 Hilary Mantel  Not a discourteous word was exchanged between the hardworking 1990 judges - much to the disappointment of the administrator Martyn Goff, who praised us to our faces and later whined that we were boring. Denis Forman ran the meetings with smooth expertise, and largely kept his own opinions dark until he cast the final vote. Weeks before I was appointed a judge, I&apos;d read John McGahern&apos;s Amongst Women and said, reaching page 20, &quot;This will win the Booker&quot;. So I was disappointed, but AS Byatt&apos;s Possession was a good book and a popular choice, and the discussion was fair. The process exhausted me, and I declined to do it a second time. What I despised was the leaking by the publicity machine of trivial non-stories to the press - I felt the prize had enough status and news value without that. I also believe the judges shouldn&apos;t review the books under consideration or talk about them in public, and in 1990 we didn&apos;t. I&apos;m glad I was a Booker judge relatively early in my career. It stopped me thinking that literary prizes are about literary value. Even the most correct jury goes in for horsetrading and gamesmanship, and what emerges is a compromise.  For me the best of the Bookers is The Siege of Krishnapur. I read it again a few months ago and its supple humour, its insight, economy and narrative drive make it an enduring delight. 1991 Nicholas Mosley I was asked to be a judge probably because I had just won the Whitbread the previous year. This had itself been a surprise, because it seemed I was out of favour with the literary establishment, having been labelled a &quot;novelist of ideas&quot; while what was in favour was &quot;style&quot;. And style seemed most easily to be exhibited in stories that were outlandish, or grim, or quaint. I looked forward to judging the Booker because I thought I might give a boost to &quot;ideas&quot;. There were five judges, and we had to choose six books out of 100 for the shortlist. I thought - well, surely, with this set-up I&apos;ll be able to squeeze in one choice of mine. But, in the event, I got none of my choices on to the list, because of the inflexibility of the voting system and of the other four judges, who were devotees of &quot;style&quot;. So I resigned, partly in a huff, but also because I thought that by so doing I might still be able to strike a blow for &quot;ideas&quot;, as I might be asked to explain myself in the press - which I did. The winner chosen by the remaining judges was Ben Okri&apos;s The Famished Road - a beautifully written (yes) story of a boy in a west African village who goes to and fro between his family and the local witchdoctor. My choice would have been Allan Massie&apos;s The Sins of the Father, which confronted the issue of what was possible or impossible if the child of a notorious ex-Nazi and the child of a Jewish victim fell in love after the second world war. What could be forgiven, and by whom, and what could not. But these are controversial questions, and thus conventionally to be avoided. 1992 Victoria Glendinning My fellow judges were John Coldstream, literary editor of the Telegraph, Harriet Harvey-Wood, literary director of the British Council, Valentine Cunningham and Mark Lawson. We became intimate in the way of people thrown together in a scary but non-fatal railway accident. John dreamt one night that he was Spartacus, with the Roman legions advancing on him in the form of piles of new titles. It was a vintage year for rent-a-sneer in the media. Prominent journalists whinged chauvinistically about &quot;far-flung authors&quot;, deaf to the explosion of energy from Commonwealth novelists, which has been the most significant feature of the Booker&apos;s 40 years. The prize was &quot;essentially trivial&quot;, pontificated AN Wilson in contemptuous mode in the Evening Standard; and, enraged, I wrote to the Guardian letters page to contest Richard Gott&apos;s clich\u00e9s about the decline of the novel and what he called the &quot;tokenism&quot; of the inclusion of Mich\u00e8le Roberts on the shortlist. Every book on our shortlist had one passionate supporter and one furious antagonist. When at the final meeting we locked horns over the frontrunners, it was suggested that we should reach our decision by taking into account second choices - proportional representation. This procedure gave Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) and Barry Unsworth (Sacred Hunger) equal points. I turned to Martyn Goff, sitting behind me discreetly - or as discreetly as anyone can who is wearing a gold satin tie - and asked if we could share the prize between the two. He conceded there was no rule against it. So that&apos;s what we did. Before the meeting, I was so unnerved that I left my bag with all my notes in it at the bank. When stressed I become sharp-tongued, and at one point told a fellow judge that he was a condescending bastard. My notes on our sessions are, at this distance in time, enigmatic. What in the world, for example, was Val Cunningham on about when he said: &quot;I am very interested in Huntley &amp; Palmer&apos;s biscuits and their role in literature&quot;?  1993 Gillian Beer Olivier Todd, the French novelist, shrugged his shoulders at our second judges&apos; meeting: no lunches with publishers, no approaches from agents, he complained - what an odd English bubble of propriety we were gathered inside. He was joking, but only just. And it is one of the remarkable things about being a Booker judge that no one tempts you with hospitality. You simply sit and read, and talk, and read again, over several months. The pleasure is in the reading, and in the talk. One of the rewards of going to see a new film is the conversation straight after, but reading new novels can be a lonely business. Not in this case. In 1993 I remember impassioned defences of books one of us had grown attached to, but no quarrels, just engrossing talk. Our chair, Grey Gowrie, came up with an ingenious criterion: novels must have &quot;radioactivity&quot; to stay in the running. He meant we must remember them weeks, months later. They mustn&apos;t fade. A self-proving criterion perhaps, but reassuring. One novel that certainly had that quality and yet just missed the shortlist was Trainspotting and it was in arguing about Irvine Welsh&apos;s book that we came nearest to quarrelling. Getting from long to shortlist was painful, worse than sorting out the winner among that final six. Some wanted the prize to go to David Malouf&apos;s Remembering Babylon, while Caryl Phillips&apos;s Crossing the River and Carol Shields&apos;s The Stone Diaries had strong support as well. But Roddy Doyle&apos;s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha won the day with its extraordinary technical achievement and its emotional force, taking us inside the voice and experience of a 10-year-old boy in the midst of family break-up. 1994 James Wood After serving on the 1994 Booker prize committee, I made a pledge never to judge a big fiction prize again, and I have so far honoured it. We were a congenial group, and our chairman was not a former politician or bureaucrat but a distinguished literary critic (John Bayley); our meetings were friendly, and surely no less or more argumentative than those of other years. But the absurdity of the process was soon apparent: it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel (a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism). In practice, judge A blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes, and then judge B blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes, and nothing changes: no one switches sides. That is when the horse-trading begins. I remember that one of the judges phoned me and said, in effect: &quot;I know that you especially like novel X, and you know that I especially like novel Y. It would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist, yes? So if you vote for my novel, I&apos;ll vote for yours, OK?&quot; That is how our shortlist was patched together, and it is how our winner was chosen. It is how every shortlist is chosen, whether the premises are as explicit or not. I liked the winning book a great deal (James Kelman&apos;s How Late It Was, How Late) - it was one of my choices - and would have been happy with either that book or Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s The Folding Star. But I intensely disliked the way we reached that verdict, and felt that the arbitrary, utterly political process discredited the whole project. Since then, prizes have become a form of reviewing: it is prize-lists that select what people read, prize-lists that make literary careers. Bookshops order novels based on the prizes they have won or been shortlisted for. Nowadays, a whole month before the shortlist is announced, scores of novelists are effectively told that their books have not been the &quot;big books&quot; of the year, because they are not to be found on the longlist. Soon, no doubt, we will have the long-longlist, and the long-long longlist. Some wonderful books win the Booker, of course, just as the flypaper occasionally catches some really large flies. But it means - or should mean - nothing in literary terms. 1995 Ruth Rendell I was always being asked what it was like to be on the Booker &quot;jury&quot;. But I could never see us as that. Jurors have to decide between guilt and innocence while we had to pick the best. The best of 140 in our case - or 6.3 books a week. Reading that number is normal for me, but books I want to read, not ones I have to. It makes a big difference. We got on well, we judges. We disagreed but never quite quarrelled. I used to lie and say I read every word of every book. The truth is that I did my best, but I am a judicious skipper. Going home to Suffolk, I finished a novel and left it in the train. A man called out to me that I&apos;d forgotten it, but when I said to keep it he was delighted. I hope he liked it better than I did.  So what did I get out of being a judge? The pleasure of giving the prize to Pat Barker&apos;s The Ghost Road, my choice, not one I was persuaded into. A mild antipathy to new novels so that now I tend to read more non-fiction. And my friendship with Peter Kemp, a fellow judge, which began in those Booker days.  1996 Jonathan Coe How very arbitrary it seems, in retrospect. There was nothing wrong with our shortlist, and nothing wrong with our winner (Last Orders, by Graham Swift), but at 12 years&apos; distance, it feels as though we could easily have chosen another six novels altogether. Our discussions were lengthy - and amicable, for the most part (until the final session, when tempers started to fray) - but what strikes me now about the whole process was how entirely subjective it was. Anyone who sets great store by the choices of Booker prize panels should remember this: the process consists of nothing more rigorous than five people sitting in a room together for a few hours, swapping personal opinions. And as far as I remember, not a single judge (including me) ever changed his or her mind, or shifted his or her position, in response to an argument put forward by a colleague. In the midst of it all, the novel which I now remember as being the finest of all - Asylum, by Patrick McGrath - slipped through our net, and failed to make the shortlist by a whisker. If it had reached the shortlist, such is the randomness of the final selection process, it might easily have won the prize itself. 1997 Jason Cowley Before the longlist was made public, if you wanted to know which books were in contention you would usually be able to find out by having a discreet lunch with Martyn Goff, the charming and mischievous prize administrator who used to operate his own idiosyncratic system of leaks, withholding and revealing in equal measure. I remember turning up to the meeting at which our shortlist would be decided to be received with suspicion by our chairman, Gillian Beer. She wanted to know how our longlist was being discussed in the papers, and I was pretty sure by the way she looked at me that she thought I was responsible. Certainly I&apos;d been having fun writing polemical pieces about the state of the British novel.  I believed then as I do now that the Booker is essentially a jamboree, little more than a kind of sport, with its own roster of winners and losers. It shouldn&apos;t be dignified or taken too seriously. But I wasn&apos;t the leaker. As we sat down for the lunch that preceded our discussions, and with Gillian Beer still grumbling about the longlist leaking out, I heard Goff say: &quot;It&apos;s quite extraordinary. I don&apos;t know how it happened.&quot; He then, winningly, glanced at me and winked.  I often think that I&apos;ve never quite recovered from my experience of being a judge. I began the year as an enthusiastic and engaged reader and reviewer of contemporary fiction, and ended it much more interested in non-fiction and narrative journalism. And of all the novels I read that year there are perhaps only two that I could ever imagine rereading: Arundhati Roy&apos;s The God of Small Things (our unfairly maligned winner) and Ian McEwan&apos;s Enduring Love (which just missed out on being shortlisted and divided the judges more than any other entry).  1998 Douglas Hurd This was a quiet year. There were no sensational or overpowering entries, and no passionate disputes among the judges. The crafty device of holding the final meeting of the judges immediately before the award dinner certainly concentrated the mind. The prize went to Amsterdam by Ian McEwan, not because we thought it was about time he won the Booker, but because in a mild year most people (though not the chairman) thought his offering finished just ahead of Beryl Bainbridge, riding Master Georgie 1999 Shena Mackay It was a very strong year for fiction. When I was a judge - alongside Boyd Tonkin, Natasha Walter and John Sutherland, with Gerald Kaufman in the chair - several books assumed to be shoo-ins weren&apos;t on the shortlist, which caused dismay, as did the discovery by some authors that their books had not been entered, on the presumption that the judges would call them in. We failed to do so. Sorry. Pressures of time and books arriving late. Our shortlisted authors were JM Coetzee, Anita Desai, Michael Frayn, Andrew O&apos;Hagan, Ahdaf Soueif and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. We gave the prize - controversially because he had won in 1983 - to Coetzee for Disgrace. We were vindicated recently when it was shortlisted for the Best of Bookers. John Sutherland was a strong advocate of Salman Rushdie (The Ground Beneath Her Feet) in our year, and he must be delighted that Midnight&apos;s Children has won the Booker of Bookers for the second time. Our chief dispute arose from John&apos;s gadfly comments in this newspaper. As far as I remember, it was the suggestion that Natasha Walter and I had a feminist agenda which prompted Natasha to write a letter to the Guardian, which I signed. Being a judge gave me much more anxiety than being on the shortlist myself, even with the horrible bookies&apos; odds and the risk of being depicted as a cartoon racehorse, because as a judge you are responsible for disappointing a lot of people. 2000 Rose Tremain My second stint as a Booker prize judge contrasted with the first in one important respect: we had an extremely effective and powerful chair in Simon Jenkins. In 1988, the lovable Michael Foot had been hampered, as chair, by diary overspill. But Simon&apos;s influence on the 2000 jury was impressive. Meetings were held at his rooms in Albany, rather than at Martyn Goff&apos;s preferred venue of the Savile Club. Despite the constant lamentations of his fax machine, Simon&apos;s attention never strayed from the tasks in hand, the first of which was to kick out the dross. Roy Foster, Caroline Gascoigne, Mariella Frostrup and I were a vocal team and we each had our favourites. Mariella was able to squeeze Matthew Kneale&apos;s English Passengers on to the list, and Caroline&apos;s advocacy for Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s When We Were Orphans was duly recognised. Roy Foster and I lost our battle for Anne Enright&apos;s What Are You Like?, but my call-in title, Trezza Azzopardi&apos;s The Hiding Place, scraped home.  What is really interesting is that nobody thought Margaret Atwood&apos;s The Blind Assassin was her best book. Where Simon&apos;s mental agility paid off was in persuading us all (except Mariella) that Atwood deserved the prize anyway - for all the times she&apos;d nearly won it and had been pipped at the post by a lesser writer.  2001 Philip Hensher It&apos;s an unusual experience, reading for the Booker. For once in your life you take a synchronic slice through the English-language novel, and see exactly what&apos;s interesting it at that moment. I was lucky in having an excellent chairman in Kenneth Baker, unprejudiced, interested and diligent, and fellow judges who really knew about the novel - Kate Summerscale was particularly good to argue with. I think we made a good choice with Peter Carey&apos;s substantial True History of the Kelly Gang, but the whole shortlist was, in my view, exceptional. I regretted that media excitement over Beryl Bainbridge actually damaged her chances with According to Queeney. We realised that if we shortlisted her, she had to win. There was no point in blotting out the winner&apos;s publicity with a storm of &quot;Beryl Bridesmaid Again&quot; headlines. I wanted to do more for Nick Hornby&apos;s How to Be Good, and it was a relief that the Whitbread rewarded Philip Pullman&apos;s The Amber Spyglass, which we could easily have shortlisted. It was a good-humoured, interesting experience, but what I got most out of it was being introduced to new novelists - Zvi Jagendorf, Ciaran Carson, Jamie O&apos;Neill - however far they got in the judging process.  The best novel to have been given the prize is, I think, Naipaul&apos;s In a Free State in 1971.  2002 Salley Vickers I was a judge the year Life of Pi won, and there is no doubt that our choice was a rip-roaring popular success. The booksellers loved us for it. It was me, in fact, who first drew the other judges&apos; attention to the novel. I was given it while on tour in Canada, by a Winnipeg bookseller, and read it excitedly on the plane home. We used to have extra meetings at the home of our chair, Lisa Jardine, and I recall telling all the other judges - Erica Wagner, Russell Celyn Jones and David Baddiel - about the book, which at that time had not been entered by Canongate. I was very glad to see it on to the shortlist, but it was not my final choice (the other books on the shortlist were Rohinton Mistry&apos;s Family Matters, Carol Shields&apos;s Unless, William Trevor&apos;s The Story of Lucy Gault, Sarah Waters&apos;s Fingersmith and Tim Winton&apos;s Dirt Music). However, Lisa was a skilled chair. She wanted a unanimous verdict and, much as I admired the book, I couldn&apos;t give her that. So she said, &quot;Salley, it was you who brought the book to our attention. Will you give the decision your blessing?&quot; Well, I couldn&apos;t refuse. 2003 DJ Taylor I can&apos;t say that I enjoyed reading all the books - 113 of them, I believe, in that year - but there was a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from the attendant razzmatazz, the thought that for a very brief period in the year an artefact routinely overlooked by large swathes of an indifferent media was suddenly news. There were several memorable clashes of opinion, the funniest by far coming when the chair, John Carey, trying desperately to persuade us of the merits of Martin Amis&apos;s Yellow Dog, read aloud from a paragraph describing the death-throes of a dying fly, at which point Francine Stock and I caught each other&apos;s eye across the table and began to giggle. The judging process was pretty much a waste of time as all four of the other judges arrived at the longlist meeting convinced that DBC Pierre&apos;s Vernon God Little was one of the great masterpieces of the early 21st century, whereas I thought that it was a promising first novel. This meant that the final judging session lasted a bare 10 minutes, after which I had to sit discussing the existence (or non-existence) of God with AC Grayling, a subject on which both of us hold strong views. 2004 Tibor Fischer I&apos;d heard the rumours. The hair-pulling, the eye-gouging, the shameful flouncing. I was, however, extremely impressed by the rigour of my fellow judges, who, unlike me, had proper jobs and families to distract them from the mound of books. What did I learn? Discussion is futile. No one changes their mind about a book. You might as well have a show of hands straight away. There aren&apos;t many bad books (only one novel ended up in the bin after two pages), but there are a lot of so-so, nondescript novels that leave no trace. Publishers are idiots. I was very pleased Alan Hollinghurst won. But I wouldn&apos;t say The Line of Beauty is a better novel than David Mitchell&apos;s very different Cloud Atlas (which came in second) or Neil Cross&apos;s Always the Sun (or others on the longlist). There are good reasons why Midnight&apos;s Children has been chosen as the Best of the Bookers (although every novelist I know rates Shame as Rushdie&apos;s best book), but it would have been a more interesting exercise to have chosen the best of the shortlisted novels. It&apos;s a pity that Beryl Bainbridge has always been pipped, and my favourite novel in the Booker annals (I&apos;ve read it at least a dozen times) is Derek Robinson&apos;s Goshawk Squadron 2005 John Sutherland When I chaired year 37, it more or less, as airline pilots say, flew by wire. The year was, by general agreement, a bumper one for fiction. As usual, no minds were much changed by the panel discussions - candidate B merely came forward when one judge&apos;s candidate A was voted down. John Banville came out top with The Sea. King of the As and Bs. Teeth were gnashed in the press the next day; but they would be if Jesus Christ had written the winning novel. I spoke to Kazuo Ishiguro (shortlisted for Never Let Me Go) shortly after. &quot;The goalkeeper jumped the wrong way&quot;, he sportingly said. I wish I&apos;d been quick-witted enough to rejoin &quot;not even Petr Cech has to save five penalty shots all coming at him at once&quot;. Julian Barnes, in an interview for the New York Times, was more savage (he had been shortlisted for Arthur &amp; George). Not, he felt, a bumper year for judges. Perhaps he was right. But posterity will forget us. Barnes, Ishiguro and - I believe - Banville they&apos;ll remember. And make their own judgments.  2006 Anthony Quinn I enjoyed every moment of the 2006 Booker until the very last minutes of our final meeting in the Guildhall. That was when I realised that the novel which I had set my heart on would not be the winner. On anecdotal evidence from friends who had judged the prize in previous years, I gathered that there was usually someone on the jury who would be a complete pest and make the whole process as awkward as possible. Not this time: our chairman, Hermione Lee, set a tone of almost heartless conviviality that Candia McWilliam, Fiona Shaw and Simon Armitage consistently upheld. Indeed, we had been so likeminded in the final reckoning of our shortlist that I must have blanked the ominous build-up of support for Kiran Desai&apos;s The Inheritance of Loss and assumed that everyone would come round to what was clearly the best book, Edward St Aubyn&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk. When I was outvoted 4-1 I was surprised, and appalled. Six months of reading and re-reading - only to be thwarted at the last! I asked for a recount, which at least got a laugh. It&apos;s not an exaggeration to say that I felt sick to my stomach. I was pleased for Kiran Desai, who&apos;d spent eight years writing it. But we chose the wrong book.  2007 Giles Foden Everyone expected arguments, and we had them, but with dignity (my fellow judges were Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs). We never fell out. In fact, we are meeting up this autumn for a drink. Some had their favourites that others couldn&apos;t stand; others tried to hold up yardsticks against which all books might be measured. The favourite supporters made persuasive cases for AN Wilson and Nicola Barker, but only Barker got through to the shortlist, despite an unfortunate error in transmission - not the judges&apos; fault - which suggested Wilson had. The longlist is where the real argy-bargy takes place.  Once an author is on the shortlist anything can happen. In our case we arrived at a situation in which every judge had mutually exclusive first and last choices. Luckily, in Howard Davies we had a competent chairman, who helped us mathematically towards a choice of winner with which everyone was happy. PS: note to publishers, try not to write call-in letters with spelling mistakes, or one that make foolish claims. Some of these letters looked as if they were written in haste. Then again, so did some of the novels submitted. 2008 Alex Clark Before I was asked to judge this year&apos;s prize, I had been on several literary prize panels and I felt I had enough experience to know roughly what I was doing. But little can prepare you for the Booker: not just the sheer volume of books submitted, but the sense that you are about to be partly responsible for making an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Now, with the final hurdle fast approaching, I can say that it&apos;s been not only an enjoyable process but also an instructive one. Reading is, of course, a solitary affair, and book reviewing not much less so. But anatomising one&apos;s taste and judgment and then communicating it to a group of people with equally strong views has been a wonderful challenge - not least because it makes for scrutiny of what it is that one values in fiction. And, gruelling though it was, I wouldn&apos;t give up those late nights and early mornings spent poring over novels. And the winner was ...

We were handsomely treated: in London we haunted Bertorelli&apos;s, but we spent more than one weekend at Michael Astor&apos;s beautiful Cotswold house, where Dame Rebecca strode the grounds authoritatively between bouts of laying down the law. There were perhaps 60 books, which seemed a lot, though modern judges are said to read twice as many. Getting through the 60 was made easier by our not daring to take on Dame Rebecca. &quot;Miss Murdoch writes good and bad novels in alternate years,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a bad year.&quot; Muriel Spark: &quot;clever but too playful.&quot; And out they went.  Two of us favoured Nicholas Mosley&apos;s Impossible Object, but were soon silenced. The choice of PH Newby&apos;s Something to Answer For was the result of a compromise. Dame Rebecca didn&apos;t dislike it as much as nearly all the others. Surveyors of the prize&apos;s history have spoken ill of this good book, perhaps without reading it, or by being too ready to suppose that this industrious writer could manage a novel a year as well as running the Third Programme. Anyway, I remember this, my one experience of judging, with much pleasure and amusement. 1970 Antonia Fraser The judging of the 1970 prize was a low-key affair except for the feisty behaviour of Dame Rebecca West, a judge for the second year running. At one point she denounced Margaret Drabble for her novels of domestic life on the grounds that &quot;Anyone can do the washing-up; just get a big bowl and some liquid; so why complain about it?&quot; The novel in question was The Waterfall, which both Richard Hoggart and I admired greatly (and didn&apos;t think was about washing-up). I knew Rebecca West, since she was a friend and neighbour of my parents in Sussex, and was very fond of her; all the same, it occurred to me that she was possibly one of the brilliant old ladies who felt threatened by a brilliant young one in the shape of Maggie Drabble. In the end we were split between William Trevor&apos;s Mrs Eckdorf in O&apos;Neill&apos;s Hotel and Bernice Rubens&apos;s The Elected Member. I voted for Rubens but today would vote for Trevor.  1971 was much more exacting. The most exciting thing that happened to me as a Booker Judge for the second time was not controversial. I shared a taxi back with fellow judge Saul Bellow on a long, long ride from somewhere in the City: he was nattily dressed in a pale green shantung suit, blue shirt, green tie with large blue dots on it; his silver hair and slanting, large dark eyes made him look like a 30s film star playing a refined gangster. Suddenly he leaned forward and asked: &quot;Has anyone ever told you that you&apos;re a very handsome woman?&quot; I pondered on a suitable reply, modest yet encouraging. But having spoken, the Great Man closed his eyes and remained apparently asleep for the rest of the journey. 1971 John Gross A faint aroma of the Nobel prize - or of Nobel prizes yet to come - hangs over the 1971 Booker. First, the award went to VS Naipaul (who was to be Nobel laureate in 2001) for In a Free State. It was a result with which I agreed. Second, the organisers had succeeded in persuading a distinguished writer from abroad to be one of the judges: Saul Bellow (who was to be Nobel laureate in 1976). It seemed a thrilling prospect. In the event, one of the things I remember most clearly about Bellow is that he insisted on being put up at the Ritz (which must have burned a big hole in the budget), and then complained because he hadn&apos;t been given a room overlooking Green Park. Another recollection is his response when I advanced the claims of Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which apart from the Naipaul was the book on the shortlist I most favoured. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;that&apos;s one of those little tinkling teacup things that the British always do well.&quot; He was quite wrong - Mrs Palfrey is a work of deep feeling - but his dismissiveness effectively put paid to its chances. 1972 George Steiner It was the most illustrious panel in the Booker&apos;s history. Both the other judges, Cyril Connolly and Elizabeth Bowen, were too ill to attend the ceremony. I fought very hard for John Berger to win for G, and then he threw it in my face by giving half the prize money to the Black Panthers. It was a very grim experience. I was in a very precarious position at the time and I literally thought it was the end for me in this country. I thought I would have to pack my bags and go.  1973 Edna O&apos;Brien Mary McCarthy and I were the judges, with Karl Miller presiding as chairman. Disputes were negligible. From a batch of about 20, it was whittled down to two contenders - The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell and The Black Prince by Iris Murdoch, with Farrell winning by a whisker. Next day, Mary changed her mind and it was left to Miller to cast the deciding vote, which he did with alacrity and no rancour. The prize has changed as the literary/publishing world has undergone a radical and not always edifying sea change: the celebrity virus now infects authors and judges alike. 1974 Ion Trewin We were three judges - AS Byatt, Elizabeth Jane Howard and me. At the shortlist meeting, Jane remarked that she thought Ending Up by Kingsley Amis (then her husband) was his best book and should go on the shortlist. I looked first at Antonia, and then at Martyn Goff, the prize&apos;s administrator - both remained impassive. We broke for a breather. Martyn said that as chairman it was up to me. Antonia liked the novel (as did I). On literary grounds neither of us had problems about shortlisting it, but what would the press say?  The Booker was already familiar with controversies. Martyn, I know, was not averse to the publicity that our decision would inevitably bring. (This was to centre around a vituperative correspondence in the Times.) But would the burgeoning reputation of the prize be damaged? He thought not. More important was our choice of winner. Antonia and I spoke up for Nadine Gordimer&apos;s The Conservationist, but Jane was less impressed. She remained keen on Ending Up, but realising that neither Antonia nor I would countenance it winning, she concentrated on Stanley Middleton&apos;s Holiday, a study of middle England that she saw as a &quot;perfect miniature&quot;. With only three judges, it seemed important to me that we did not compromise or produce a two-one verdict. Might we split the prize between Middleton and Gordimer? Martyn said he knew of no reason why not. We were vindicated by The Conservationist being selected this year for the Best of the Booker shortlist. My favourite Booker winner remains Schindler&apos;s Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally (but I must declare my interest and say that I was its editor). 1975 Susan Hill Peter Ackroyd was the young, newly appointed literary editor of the Spectator. Roy Fuller was a distinguished older poet. Angus Wilson was in his years as founder of the creative writing course at UEA and one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary novel. It was a daunting experience to join them as a judge. I took the mountain of submitted novels on my honeymoon, and our first meeting was scheduled for the day I returned. I discovered that Angus had spent a holiday at the same Italian hotel a few weeks earlier. So we should all have been in mellow mood, and three of us were. But Roy Fuller was not the easiest man to work with. He was acerbic and disliked being contradicted, and when it came to choosing a shortlist he refused to join in, on the grounds that we had agreed on our winner, so a shortlist was superfluous. The Booker management committee was, rightly, having none of this and insisted.  I had been shortlisted myself three years earlier, and it had given my career a huge boost. I fought hard. We all did. Fuller grudgingly agreed to allowing a shortlist of two - the winner and one runner-up. Otherwise, he was going to walk. It was tricky and it spoiled what should have been an enjoyable experience. I was very happy with our winner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala&apos;s Heat and Dust, but I wish we had stood up to Fuller and if he had walked out, so be it.  My personal Best of Bookers is JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. The omission of Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece The Blue Flower even from the shortlist in 1995 I find quite inexplicable.  1976 Francis King There is a vast difference of scale between the prize as I experienced it as a judge and how it is now. Then the prize money was far less generous, and the fee for the judging was an honorarium. There were only three judges: our chairman Walter Allen, an admirable novelist and critic, then confined to a wheelchair, so that I had to read out his presentation speech for him; Mary Wilson, the wife of the prime minister; and me. Despite his failing health, Allen was, unlike me, immensely conscientious in reading every submission from cover to cover. Mary Wilson, a lover of poetry and herself an artless but often touching poet, was at the disadvantage of having read few novels in the course of her life - so that she was clearly puzzled when I referred to one of the submissions as &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;.  My sister Elizabeth looked through the piles of books awaiting my reading, and eventually held up David Storey&apos;s Saville. With a colleague, John Guest, she had already put in a lot of robust work as one of its two editors. &quot;This will be the winner,&quot; she announced. It was, she explained, an epic about a north country mining community and was therefore exactly what would appeal to Allen, a lifetime socialist, and to the wife of a Labour PM. She was right. I battled for Julian Rathbone&apos;s King Fisher Lives, to no avail. Mary Wilson was obdurate: &quot;I couldn&apos;t be party to giving the prize to a book about cannibalism.&quot;  For me far and away the best Booker winner in the whole history of the Prize is JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. The best of all the novels that ought to have won the Prize but failed to do so is Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece The Blue Flower 1977 Beryl Bainbridge Making a choice was very difficult - because it was this great prize of the world, one had to be very careful. Since I was published by Duckworth, it was very peculiar to have a Duckworth novel - Great Granny Webster by Caroline Blackwood - included in the vote. I put my vote forward - for Blackwood - but the discussion on it lasted only about three minutes, because it was such a short book. So nobody was really interested in that. All I can remember of the final meeting is that I got terribly tired, I literally sank lower and lower under the table. Brendan Gill, who I thought was American, went towards the balcony saying he was going to throw himself off, he was so fed up. Philip Larkin was completely silent most of the time. Nobody dared say a word to him and he never said a word back. The only one who was in total control of everything was Robin Ray. He was so clever that we all went along with whatever he said, and he wanted Staying On by Paul Scott to win. Poor Scott was too ill to collect the prize. I&apos;ve been shortlisted for the Booker five times and never won. I&apos;m just very pleased to have been noticed. 1978 Derwent May In 1978, all the five jury members had a different first choice, and they were all sticking to it. Suddenly someone suggested a compromise candidate that we all quite liked, but it seemed to me that we were now heading for disaster. Freddie Ayer, the chairman, had more or less pulled out, saying that the only novels he enjoyed reading were crime novels. So I went round the jury - the other three were all novelists, PH Newby, Angela Huth and Clare Boylan - and said to them in turn &quot;Is this book your first choice?&quot; All, rather sheepishly, said &quot;No&quot;. I said, &quot;The winner must surely be at least one person&apos;s first choice&quot;, and I saw it was the moment for me to push what I thought was unmistakably the best book, Iris Murdoch&apos;s The Sea, The Sea - which I knew was at least one juror&apos;s second choice (the other shortlisted authors were Kingsley Amis, Andr\u00e9 Brink, Penelope Fitzgerald, Jane Gardam and Bernice Rubens). I&apos;m glad to say it won.  The best three winners have, I think, been the Murdoch, William Golding&apos;s Rites of Passage and Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day. The prize has always lurched too much in favour of writers with unpromising backgrounds or good liberal attitudes, but it has unfailingly provided an excellent focus on the year&apos;s new novels. 1979 Hilary Spurling  I loved my Booker summer, which boils down in my memory to long, hot, hazy days spent lying under a tree in the garden reading novels and saying to anyone who tried to interrupt: &quot;Go away, I&apos;m working.&quot; It was a strong field and the bookies&apos; favourite was VS Naipaul&apos;s A Bend in the River. Its opponents on the panel argued that the book shouldn&apos;t strictly be classified as a novel, and in any case he&apos;d won the prize before. The Naipaul lobby (including me) snapped back that the novel was doomed if it couldn&apos;t expand to include this sort of documentary fiction, and that our job was to pick the year&apos;s best book, regardless of its author. The final verdict was as much of a shock to the judges as it was to everybody else. We&apos;d spent the entire afternoon at loggerheads, and in the end compromised by giving the prize to everybody&apos;s second choice, Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s small, slight, melancholy but beautifully judged and executed Offshore. Her recently published collected letters make it clear that her triumph - and the general incredulity that greeted it - caused her humiliation ever after. 1980 Claire Tomalin I was determined that Alice Munro should be on the shortlist, and stuck my heels in to get her there. There were two real contenders for the prize, I believed, Anthony Burgess&apos;s Earthly Powers and William Golding&apos;s Rites of Passage, and the night before the final judging session I lay awake debating with myself: the Golding beautifully written and constructed, but with a slightly musty feel about it; Burgess a magnificent entertainer, overflowing with good humour, sometimes tipping into the slapdash. Both books thoroughly deserving. The next morning David Daiches, our chairman, began: &quot;We&apos;ll go through the list in alphabetical order. I take it no one consider Burgess a possible winner?&quot; Silence from the others. I exploded into a eulogy of Burgess&apos;s energy, invention and comic gift. I saw I had convinced no one, and felt that left only Golding. And so it was. Burgess sent a message saying he would not come to the dinner unless he won. I don&apos;t blame him. I saw a tear trickle down Golding&apos;s cheek when the announcement was made. I have re-read neither book, and I have rejoiced to see Alice Munro win the recognition she deserves.  1981 Hermione Lee Salman Rushdie has won the Booker of Bookers and the Best of all Bookers, with his lastingly dazzling, deep and splendid novel, now a classic of world literature, Midnight&apos;s Children. But over a quarter of a century ago, when I was one of the judges who gave him the prize, his book was by no means an easy winner. Not many people had heard of Rushdie, unless they&apos;d read a weird piece of science fiction called Grimus or seen the stunning extracts from the new novel in Granta. Our panel of judges (Samuel Hynes, Joan Bakewell, Brian Aldiss and me, with Malcolm Bradbury as chair) were pulling in different ways. We were reading many writers with more established reputations, and much more experience, than Rushdie - such as Muriel Spark. (To my lasting regret, we overlooked one of Nadine Gordimer&apos;s best novels, July&apos;s People.) Brian Aldiss was especially keen on Doris Lessing&apos;s &quot;space fiction&quot; The Sirian Experiments, Malcolm on Ian McEwan&apos;s The Comfort of Strangers.  We all jumped at the late arrival of the almost forgotten Anglo-Irish writer Molly Keane, the short-listing of whose wicked and eccentric novel Good Behaviour gained her a devoted new following. But our final discussion was painfully split between Midnight&apos;s Children and The White Hotel, DM Thomas&apos;s psychoanalytical erotic novel, centring on the massacre at Babi Yar, which made a strong impression on me at the time but now, looking back, seems to me sensationalist and exploitative. Sam Hynes, Joan Bakewell and I were firmly on the side of Rushdie; Brian Aldiss was passionately keen on Thomas, and so was Malcolm Bradbury, who tried at the very end of the discussion to argue that the chair should have a casting, and over-ruling vote. This was not allowed, Rushdie won by 3 votes to 2, and Brian Aldiss (whose intensity impressed me) left the room with tears in his eyes. When the 1981 prize was announced, a mighty career was launched. It would have taken off anyway, but it was helped by the prize. Chairing the prize 25 years on, I felt happy to be helping on Kiran Desai, a literary descendant of Rushdie&apos;s. 1982 Paul Bailey There are many things I regret doing, and being a judge for the Booker prize is one of them. For some years after I was associated with two novels I absolutely loathed and would not have even started reading in other circumstances (on the shortlist that year were Thomas Keneally&apos;s Schindler&apos;s Ark, John Arden&apos;s Silence Among the Weapons, William Boyd&apos;s An Ice-Cream War, Lawrence Durrell&apos;s Constance or Solitary Practices, Alice Thomas Ellis&apos;s The 27th Kingdom and Timothy Mo&apos;s Sour Sweet). They are history now and are likely to remain so. My one good deed was to ensure a place on the shortlist for Sour Sweet, consequently bringing his work to a larger audience. But otherwise it was a dispiriting experience. The winner, by a single vote, was Schindler&apos;s Ark, a controversial but ultimately very popular choice. The prize was founded, in part, to encourage competitiveness. Which of the six novelists will make it to the finishing post? This grisly notion constitutes a perfect recipe for envy, back-biting and self-glorification. The Booker has certainly mirrored fashion - the collapse of the empire; post-modernist Victorian pastiche; New Age sentimentality. Several stinkers have been honoured, but there have been some glorious losers: Alice Munro&apos;s The Beggar Maid, John McGahern&apos;s Amongst Women and Edward St Aubyn&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk. A wonderful book such as Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s The Blue Flower was completely ignored, and I hope the judges for 1995 are blushing now to be reminded of their grotesque oversight. 1983 Fay Weldon A lively year, as Booker prizes go. We had a distinguished set of judges and some terrific books. The panel was finally split between a Coetzee and a Rushdie - a clash of continents. As the chairperson I had the casting vote - which is not saying &quot;oh, I like that one best&quot;, but weighing up the arguments of one set of judges against the others and deciding which are the most convincing. The Coetzee (Life &amp; Times of Michael K) got it, and Rushdie was really annoyed.  As a fervent feminist (25 years back), and taking time to make up my mind, I made a joke: &quot;I haven&apos;t got my husband here to help me decide.&quot; But one should never make jokes in the presence of the police, security or at a Booker prize judging, and word got round that I meant it. Then I had to deliver the customary chairperson&apos;s speech. After I sat down, the then president of the Publishers Association got to his feet, crossed the room and hit my agent Giles Gordon, second best thing to hitting me. I&apos;d used the speech to reproach the publishers for giving such rotten deals to writers. Since the BBC was working to rule, they cut the cameras at 10pm precisely: I was using transparent screens from which to make the speech (a Thatcher trick), and they went blank before I had time to finish with the usual pacifying bit about how you are all honourable men and none of what I say applies to you. Instead, I just had to sit down and all hell broke loose.  I had actually shown the speech to the organisers earlier, but I suppose they hadn&apos;t bothered to read it. I hadn&apos;t thought it was all that inflammatory. Michael Caine, charismatic chairman of Bookers, came up to me years later, when I had been inadvertently invited to one of the subsequent dinners, and said: &quot;It is not by any wish of mine you are here tonight.&quot; It&apos;s all got rather dull since: the prize tends to go to well-behaved and deserving writers: no subversion allowed. No one hits anyone.  1984 John Fuller This was the year when the hot favourite, JG Ballard (Empire of the Sun), was passed over for a relative newcomer, Anita Brookner (Hotel du Lac). Hardly a scandal, but in a strong year we had already discarded some big names (Burgess, Golding, Spark, Bainbridge, two Amises, etc) before reaching the shortlist, so that journalistic antennae were twitching, and the outcome was felt to be a further surprise. The judges got on pretty well together. We were somewhat exercised by the question of whether Julian Barnes&apos;s Flaubert&apos;s Parrot was really a novel, while in the final judging session Anthony Curtis continued to argue for David Lodge (Small World), and Ted Rowlands stuck out for the Ballard. I thought that the Brookner was, in its economy and elegance, a small triumph of moral insight worthy of the tradition of James and Forster to which it belonged. I was relieved to have support from Polly Devlin and the somewhat eccentric Richard Cobb in this, and pleased at the nudge to her career that the prize must have given.  1985 Marina Warner Norman St John Stevas was our chair, and early on that summer he picked out a number of books which he recommended his panel to read. Among them was a surprise, a bulky novel called The Bone People by Keri Hulme. Alongside the many gleamingly designed offerings from the major publishing houses, it had the distinction of being published by a women&apos;s cooperative in New Zealand, who, when the book won the prize against very high odds, came up in full island dress to collect it, chanting a Maori praise song.  Feelings in the final meeting - and afterwards - ran very high about this novel, but St John Stevas unexpectedly championed it throughout. Nina Bawden opposed it very strongly on the grounds of its violence (the novel tells a terrifying story of child-beatings), and wrote later publicly to distance herself from the decision. Nina found herself significantly outnumbered in her opposition, because Joanna Lumley didn&apos;t attend the final judging. She sent a message to say she was in rehearsal and that her nominated winner was Doris Lessing, for The Good Terrorist. When she heard The Bone People had won, she too dissociated herself from the judgment. JW Lambert and I supported the book.  I think that the best argument for the whole cruel and unfair business of prizes is that they can lead readers to writers who wouldn&apos;t otherwise be read much or perhaps at all. I didn&apos;t think Lessing needed the prize (and she would agree) and certainly not for a novel that is not her best (though it&apos;s a feature of prizes that authors often win for their weakest works).  1986 Anthony Thwaite My chairing of the 1986 judges was marred, or enlivened, by several scandals or leaks or items of gossip. I was said (wrongly) to have lectured my fellow judges on &quot;how to read a novel&quot;. I unwisely wrote to Julian Barnes to commiserate with him about his non-appearance on the shortlist: I was quoted as blaming it on &quot;all those women&quot; (my four fellow judges were Edna Healey, Isabel Quigly, Gillian Reynolds and Bernice Rubens). It was a splendid shortlist: Kingsley Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul Bailey, Robertson Davies, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo. We were still going to and fro up until 10 minutes before the press announcement had to be made: two strongly for Amis, two equally strongly for Davies (What&apos;s Bred in the Bone), and a wobbler in the middle. At the last moment the wobbler came down on the side of The Old Devils, and Amis had won. A very satisfactory result, I thought. 1987 PD James I look back on my chairmanship in 1987 as a very happy experience, particularly as I had as my colleagues four hardworking, enthusiastic and knowledgeable judges: Lady Selina Hastings, Allan Massie, Trevor McDonald and John B Thompson. I did have a fear at the time - and still do - that to ask the panel to read more than 100 novels in a comparatively short time can result in a literary surfeit which makes the final judgment more difficult. Choosing the winner was a long process, and I remember scurrying to the dinner table a little after the meal had started. At the end, however, the vote was unanimous - Penelope Lively won, for Moon Tiger - which is what I had hoped for. The Booker may at times have tended to increase the unhelpful dichotomy between popular storytelling and books which are classified as literary novels, but most of the winners have combined high literary achievement with compelling storytelling.  1988 Blake Morrison We were a jury of writers that year: Sebastian Faulks, Rose Tremain, Philip French and, in the chair, Michael Foot, who seemed keener to talk about Byron than to reminisce about leading the Labour party. As early as our first meeting, Peter Carey&apos;s Oscar and Lucinda was the clear frontrunner. The only arguments were about which novels should be with him on the shortlist. I read the bulk of the 100 or so entries during a fortnight&apos;s holiday with two small children in Wales, rising early and retiring late. Those we finally settled on were Salman Rushdie&apos;s The Satanic Verses (which I read with innocent pleasure - the controversy over it didn&apos;t erupt till the following year), Bruce Chatwin&apos;s Utz (his last novel - his funeral was the day of the fatwa), David Lodge&apos;s Nice Work (one of his best), Penelope Fitzgerald&apos;s The Beginning of Spring (one of her best) and Marina Warner&apos;s The Lost Father.  My biggest regret was failing to get Doris Lessing&apos;s The Fifth Child on the shortlist - though in retrospect Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, was a graver omission. The final meeting lasted 25 minutes: Foot was for Rushdie, the rest of us were for Carey, so that was that. Rushdie has sometimes been caricatured as a bad loser, but at the ceremony he behaved impeccably and was generous in his praise of the winning book. All in all, a pleasing outcome. My other experiences of sitting on prize juries have been grisly in comparison. 1989 David Lodge Our shortlist meeting was the longest to date, and much of it was taken up with discussion of Martin Amis&apos;s London Fields. It is public knowledge that two of the judges on the panel, Maggie Gee and Helen McNeil, successfully resisted its inclusion on the shortlist, an outcome I still regret. The final judging session was uncontroversial - all but one of us were unequivocally in favour of Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s The Remains of the Day. I consider it one of the best Booker winners I have read.  The success of the prize has had an enormous impact on the reception of literary fiction and other kinds of writing, not only directly, but also indirectly through the proliferation of new prizes that have imitated it. But the overtly competitive nature of these prizes, heightened by the publication of longlists and shortlists, takes its psychological toll on writers; and, given the large element of chance in the composition and operation of judging panels, the importance now attached to prizes in our literary culture seems excessive. A committee is a blunt instrument of literary criticism. 1990 Hilary Mantel  Not a discourteous word was exchanged between the hardworking 1990 judges - much to the disappointment of the administrator Martyn Goff, who praised us to our faces and later whined that we were boring. Denis Forman ran the meetings with smooth expertise, and largely kept his own opinions dark until he cast the final vote. Weeks before I was appointed a judge, I&apos;d read John McGahern&apos;s Amongst Women and said, reaching page 20, &quot;This will win the Booker&quot;. So I was disappointed, but AS Byatt&apos;s Possession was a good book and a popular choice, and the discussion was fair. The process exhausted me, and I declined to do it a second time. What I despised was the leaking by the publicity machine of trivial non-stories to the press - I felt the prize had enough status and news value without that. I also believe the judges shouldn&apos;t review the books under consideration or talk about them in public, and in 1990 we didn&apos;t. I&apos;m glad I was a Booker judge relatively early in my career. It stopped me thinking that literary prizes are about literary value. Even the most correct jury goes in for horsetrading and gamesmanship, and what emerges is a compromise.  For me the best of the Bookers is The Siege of Krishnapur. I read it again a few months ago and its supple humour, its insight, economy and narrative drive make it an enduring delight. 1991 Nicholas Mosley I was asked to be a judge probably because I had just won the Whitbread the previous year. This had itself been a surprise, because it seemed I was out of favour with the literary establishment, having been labelled a &quot;novelist of ideas&quot; while what was in favour was &quot;style&quot;. And style seemed most easily to be exhibited in stories that were outlandish, or grim, or quaint. I looked forward to judging the Booker because I thought I might give a boost to &quot;ideas&quot;. There were five judges, and we had to choose six books out of 100 for the shortlist. I thought - well, surely, with this set-up I&apos;ll be able to squeeze in one choice of mine. But, in the event, I got none of my choices on to the list, because of the inflexibility of the voting system and of the other four judges, who were devotees of &quot;style&quot;. So I resigned, partly in a huff, but also because I thought that by so doing I might still be able to strike a blow for &quot;ideas&quot;, as I might be asked to explain myself in the press - which I did. The winner chosen by the remaining judges was Ben Okri&apos;s The Famished Road - a beautifully written (yes) story of a boy in a west African village who goes to and fro between his family and the local witchdoctor. My choice would have been Allan Massie&apos;s The Sins of the Father, which confronted the issue of what was possible or impossible if the child of a notorious ex-Nazi and the child of a Jewish victim fell in love after the second world war. What could be forgiven, and by whom, and what could not. But these are controversial questions, and thus conventionally to be avoided. 1992 Victoria Glendinning My fellow judges were John Coldstream, literary editor of the Telegraph, Harriet Harvey-Wood, literary director of the British Council, Valentine Cunningham and Mark Lawson. We became intimate in the way of people thrown together in a scary but non-fatal railway accident. John dreamt one night that he was Spartacus, with the Roman legions advancing on him in the form of piles of new titles. It was a vintage year for rent-a-sneer in the media. Prominent journalists whinged chauvinistically about &quot;far-flung authors&quot;, deaf to the explosion of energy from Commonwealth novelists, which has been the most significant feature of the Booker&apos;s 40 years. The prize was &quot;essentially trivial&quot;, pontificated AN Wilson in contemptuous mode in the Evening Standard; and, enraged, I wrote to the Guardian letters page to contest Richard Gott&apos;s clich\u00e9s about the decline of the novel and what he called the &quot;tokenism&quot; of the inclusion of Mich\u00e8le Roberts on the shortlist. Every book on our shortlist had one passionate supporter and one furious antagonist. When at the final meeting we locked horns over the frontrunners, it was suggested that we should reach our decision by taking into account second choices - proportional representation. This procedure gave Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) and Barry Unsworth (Sacred Hunger) equal points. I turned to Martyn Goff, sitting behind me discreetly - or as discreetly as anyone can who is wearing a gold satin tie - and asked if we could share the prize between the two. He conceded there was no rule against it. So that&apos;s what we did. Before the meeting, I was so unnerved that I left my bag with all my notes in it at the bank. When stressed I become sharp-tongued, and at one point told a fellow judge that he was a condescending bastard. My notes on our sessions are, at this distance in time, enigmatic. What in the world, for example, was Val Cunningham on about when he said: &quot;I am very interested in Huntley &amp; Palmer&apos;s biscuits and their role in literature&quot;?  1993 Gillian Beer Olivier Todd, the French novelist, shrugged his shoulders at our second judges&apos; meeting: no lunches with publishers, no approaches from agents, he complained - what an odd English bubble of propriety we were gathered inside. He was joking, but only just. And it is one of the remarkable things about being a Booker judge that no one tempts you with hospitality. You simply sit and read, and talk, and read again, over several months. The pleasure is in the reading, and in the talk. One of the rewards of going to see a new film is the conversation straight after, but reading new novels can be a lonely business. Not in this case. In 1993 I remember impassioned defences of books one of us had grown attached to, but no quarrels, just engrossing talk. Our chair, Grey Gowrie, came up with an ingenious criterion: novels must have &quot;radioactivity&quot; to stay in the running. He meant we must remember them weeks, months later. They mustn&apos;t fade. A self-proving criterion perhaps, but reassuring. One novel that certainly had that quality and yet just missed the shortlist was Trainspotting and it was in arguing about Irvine Welsh&apos;s book that we came nearest to quarrelling. Getting from long to shortlist was painful, worse than sorting out the winner among that final six. Some wanted the prize to go to David Malouf&apos;s Remembering Babylon, while Caryl Phillips&apos;s Crossing the River and Carol Shields&apos;s The Stone Diaries had strong support as well. But Roddy Doyle&apos;s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha won the day with its extraordinary technical achievement and its emotional force, taking us inside the voice and experience of a 10-year-old boy in the midst of family break-up. 1994 James Wood After serving on the 1994 Booker prize committee, I made a pledge never to judge a big fiction prize again, and I have so far honoured it. We were a congenial group, and our chairman was not a former politician or bureaucrat but a distinguished literary critic (John Bayley); our meetings were friendly, and surely no less or more argumentative than those of other years. But the absurdity of the process was soon apparent: it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel (a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism). In practice, judge A blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes, and then judge B blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes, and nothing changes: no one switches sides. That is when the horse-trading begins. I remember that one of the judges phoned me and said, in effect: &quot;I know that you especially like novel X, and you know that I especially like novel Y. It would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist, yes? So if you vote for my novel, I&apos;ll vote for yours, OK?&quot; That is how our shortlist was patched together, and it is how our winner was chosen. It is how every shortlist is chosen, whether the premises are as explicit or not. I liked the winning book a great deal (James Kelman&apos;s How Late It Was, How Late) - it was one of my choices - and would have been happy with either that book or Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s The Folding Star. But I intensely disliked the way we reached that verdict, and felt that the arbitrary, utterly political process discredited the whole project. Since then, prizes have become a form of reviewing: it is prize-lists that select what people read, prize-lists that make literary careers. Bookshops order novels based on the prizes they have won or been shortlisted for. Nowadays, a whole month before the shortlist is announced, scores of novelists are effectively told that their books have not been the &quot;big books&quot; of the year, because they are not to be found on the longlist. Soon, no doubt, we will have the long-longlist, and the long-long longlist. Some wonderful books win the Booker, of course, just as the flypaper occasionally catches some really large flies. But it means - or should mean - nothing in literary terms. 1995 Ruth Rendell I was always being asked what it was like to be on the Booker &quot;jury&quot;. But I could never see us as that. Jurors have to decide between guilt and innocence while we had to pick the best. The best of 140 in our case - or 6.3 books a week. Reading that number is normal for me, but books I want to read, not ones I have to. It makes a big difference. We got on well, we judges. We disagreed but never quite quarrelled. I used to lie and say I read every word of every book. The truth is that I did my best, but I am a judicious skipper. Going home to Suffolk, I finished a novel and left it in the train. A man called out to me that I&apos;d forgotten it, but when I said to keep it he was delighted. I hope he liked it better than I did.  So what did I get out of being a judge? The pleasure of giving the prize to Pat Barker&apos;s The Ghost Road, my choice, not one I was persuaded into. A mild antipathy to new novels so that now I tend to read more non-fiction. And my friendship with Peter Kemp, a fellow judge, which began in those Booker days.  1996 Jonathan Coe How very arbitrary it seems, in retrospect. There was nothing wrong with our shortlist, and nothing wrong with our winner (Last Orders, by Graham Swift), but at 12 years&apos; distance, it feels as though we could easily have chosen another six novels altogether. Our discussions were lengthy - and amicable, for the most part (until the final session, when tempers started to fray) - but what strikes me now about the whole process was how entirely subjective it was. Anyone who sets great store by the choices of Booker prize panels should remember this: the process consists of nothing more rigorous than five people sitting in a room together for a few hours, swapping personal opinions. And as far as I remember, not a single judge (including me) ever changed his or her mind, or shifted his or her position, in response to an argument put forward by a colleague. In the midst of it all, the novel which I now remember as being the finest of all - Asylum, by Patrick McGrath - slipped through our net, and failed to make the shortlist by a whisker. If it had reached the shortlist, such is the randomness of the final selection process, it might easily have won the prize itself. 1997 Jason Cowley Before the longlist was made public, if you wanted to know which books were in contention you would usually be able to find out by having a discreet lunch with Martyn Goff, the charming and mischievous prize administrator who used to operate his own idiosyncratic system of leaks, withholding and revealing in equal measure. I remember turning up to the meeting at which our shortlist would be decided to be received with suspicion by our chairman, Gillian Beer. She wanted to know how our longlist was being discussed in the papers, and I was pretty sure by the way she looked at me that she thought I was responsible. Certainly I&apos;d been having fun writing polemical pieces about the state of the British novel.  I believed then as I do now that the Booker is essentially a jamboree, little more than a kind of sport, with its own roster of winners and losers. It shouldn&apos;t be dignified or taken too seriously. But I wasn&apos;t the leaker. As we sat down for the lunch that preceded our discussions, and with Gillian Beer still grumbling about the longlist leaking out, I heard Goff say: &quot;It&apos;s quite extraordinary. I don&apos;t know how it happened.&quot; He then, winningly, glanced at me and winked.  I often think that I&apos;ve never quite recovered from my experience of being a judge. I began the year as an enthusiastic and engaged reader and reviewer of contemporary fiction, and ended it much more interested in non-fiction and narrative journalism. And of all the novels I read that year there are perhaps only two that I could ever imagine rereading: Arundhati Roy&apos;s The God of Small Things (our unfairly maligned winner) and Ian McEwan&apos;s Enduring Love (which just missed out on being shortlisted and divided the judges more than any other entry).  1998 Douglas Hurd This was a quiet year. There were no sensational or overpowering entries, and no passionate disputes among the judges. The crafty device of holding the final meeting of the judges immediately before the award dinner certainly concentrated the mind. The prize went to Amsterdam by Ian McEwan, not because we thought it was about time he won the Booker, but because in a mild year most people (though not the chairman) thought his offering finished just ahead of Beryl Bainbridge, riding Master Georgie 1999 Shena Mackay It was a very strong year for fiction. When I was a judge - alongside Boyd Tonkin, Natasha Walter and John Sutherland, with Gerald Kaufman in the chair - several books assumed to be shoo-ins weren&apos;t on the shortlist, which caused dismay, as did the discovery by some authors that their books had not been entered, on the presumption that the judges would call them in. We failed to do so. Sorry. Pressures of time and books arriving late. Our shortlisted authors were JM Coetzee, Anita Desai, Michael Frayn, Andrew O&apos;Hagan, Ahdaf Soueif and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. We gave the prize - controversially because he had won in 1983 - to Coetzee for Disgrace. We were vindicated recently when it was shortlisted for the Best of Bookers. John Sutherland was a strong advocate of Salman Rushdie (The Ground Beneath Her Feet) in our year, and he must be delighted that Midnight&apos;s Children has won the Booker of Bookers for the second time. Our chief dispute arose from John&apos;s gadfly comments in this newspaper. As far as I remember, it was the suggestion that Natasha Walter and I had a feminist agenda which prompted Natasha to write a letter to the Guardian, which I signed. Being a judge gave me much more anxiety than being on the shortlist myself, even with the horrible bookies&apos; odds and the risk of being depicted as a cartoon racehorse, because as a judge you are responsible for disappointing a lot of people. 2000 Rose Tremain My second stint as a Booker prize judge contrasted with the first in one important respect: we had an extremely effective and powerful chair in Simon Jenkins. In 1988, the lovable Michael Foot had been hampered, as chair, by diary overspill. But Simon&apos;s influence on the 2000 jury was impressive. Meetings were held at his rooms in Albany, rather than at Martyn Goff&apos;s preferred venue of the Savile Club. Despite the constant lamentations of his fax machine, Simon&apos;s attention never strayed from the tasks in hand, the first of which was to kick out the dross. Roy Foster, Caroline Gascoigne, Mariella Frostrup and I were a vocal team and we each had our favourites. Mariella was able to squeeze Matthew Kneale&apos;s English Passengers on to the list, and Caroline&apos;s advocacy for Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s When We Were Orphans was duly recognised. Roy Foster and I lost our battle for Anne Enright&apos;s What Are You Like?, but my call-in title, Trezza Azzopardi&apos;s The Hiding Place, scraped home.  What is really interesting is that nobody thought Margaret Atwood&apos;s The Blind Assassin was her best book. Where Simon&apos;s mental agility paid off was in persuading us all (except Mariella) that Atwood deserved the prize anyway - for all the times she&apos;d nearly won it and had been pipped at the post by a lesser writer.  2001 Philip Hensher It&apos;s an unusual experience, reading for the Booker. For once in your life you take a synchronic slice through the English-language novel, and see exactly what&apos;s interesting it at that moment. I was lucky in having an excellent chairman in Kenneth Baker, unprejudiced, interested and diligent, and fellow judges who really knew about the novel - Kate Summerscale was particularly good to argue with. I think we made a good choice with Peter Carey&apos;s substantial True History of the Kelly Gang, but the whole shortlist was, in my view, exceptional. I regretted that media excitement over Beryl Bainbridge actually damaged her chances with According to Queeney. We realised that if we shortlisted her, she had to win. There was no point in blotting out the winner&apos;s publicity with a storm of &quot;Beryl Bridesmaid Again&quot; headlines. I wanted to do more for Nick Hornby&apos;s How to Be Good, and it was a relief that the Whitbread rewarded Philip Pullman&apos;s The Amber Spyglass, which we could easily have shortlisted. It was a good-humoured, interesting experience, but what I got most out of it was being introduced to new novelists - Zvi Jagendorf, Ciaran Carson, Jamie O&apos;Neill - however far they got in the judging process.  The best novel to have been given the prize is, I think, Naipaul&apos;s In a Free State in 1971.  2002 Salley Vickers I was a judge the year Life of Pi won, and there is no doubt that our choice was a rip-roaring popular success. The booksellers loved us for it. It was me, in fact, who first drew the other judges&apos; attention to the novel. I was given it while on tour in Canada, by a Winnipeg bookseller, and read it excitedly on the plane home. We used to have extra meetings at the home of our chair, Lisa Jardine, and I recall telling all the other judges - Erica Wagner, Russell Celyn Jones and David Baddiel - about the book, which at that time had not been entered by Canongate. I was very glad to see it on to the shortlist, but it was not my final choice (the other books on the shortlist were Rohinton Mistry&apos;s Family Matters, Carol Shields&apos;s Unless, William Trevor&apos;s The Story of Lucy Gault, Sarah Waters&apos;s Fingersmith and Tim Winton&apos;s Dirt Music). However, Lisa was a skilled chair. She wanted a unanimous verdict and, much as I admired the book, I couldn&apos;t give her that. So she said, &quot;Salley, it was you who brought the book to our attention. Will you give the decision your blessing?&quot; Well, I couldn&apos;t refuse. 2003 DJ Taylor I can&apos;t say that I enjoyed reading all the books - 113 of them, I believe, in that year - but there was a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from the attendant razzmatazz, the thought that for a very brief period in the year an artefact routinely overlooked by large swathes of an indifferent media was suddenly news. There were several memorable clashes of opinion, the funniest by far coming when the chair, John Carey, trying desperately to persuade us of the merits of Martin Amis&apos;s Yellow Dog, read aloud from a paragraph describing the death-throes of a dying fly, at which point Francine Stock and I caught each other&apos;s eye across the table and began to giggle. The judging process was pretty much a waste of time as all four of the other judges arrived at the longlist meeting convinced that DBC Pierre&apos;s Vernon God Little was one of the great masterpieces of the early 21st century, whereas I thought that it was a promising first novel. This meant that the final judging session lasted a bare 10 minutes, after which I had to sit discussing the existence (or non-existence) of God with AC Grayling, a subject on which both of us hold strong views. 2004 Tibor Fischer I&apos;d heard the rumours. The hair-pulling, the eye-gouging, the shameful flouncing. I was, however, extremely impressed by the rigour of my fellow judges, who, unlike me, had proper jobs and families to distract them from the mound of books. What did I learn? Discussion is futile. No one changes their mind about a book. You might as well have a show of hands straight away. There aren&apos;t many bad books (only one novel ended up in the bin after two pages), but there are a lot of so-so, nondescript novels that leave no trace. Publishers are idiots. I was very pleased Alan Hollinghurst won. But I wouldn&apos;t say The Line of Beauty is a better novel than David Mitchell&apos;s very different Cloud Atlas (which came in second) or Neil Cross&apos;s Always the Sun (or others on the longlist). There are good reasons why Midnight&apos;s Children has been chosen as the Best of the Bookers (although every novelist I know rates Shame as Rushdie&apos;s best book), but it would have been a more interesting exercise to have chosen the best of the shortlisted novels. It&apos;s a pity that Beryl Bainbridge has always been pipped, and my favourite novel in the Booker annals (I&apos;ve read it at least a dozen times) is Derek Robinson&apos;s Goshawk Squadron 2005 John Sutherland When I chaired year 37, it more or less, as airline pilots say, flew by wire. The year was, by general agreement, a bumper one for fiction. As usual, no minds were much changed by the panel discussions - candidate B merely came forward when one judge&apos;s candidate A was voted down. John Banville came out top with The Sea. King of the As and Bs. Teeth were gnashed in the press the next day; but they would be if Jesus Christ had written the winning novel. I spoke to Kazuo Ishiguro (shortlisted for Never Let Me Go) shortly after. &quot;The goalkeeper jumped the wrong way&quot;, he sportingly said. I wish I&apos;d been quick-witted enough to rejoin &quot;not even Petr Cech has to save five penalty shots all coming at him at once&quot;. Julian Barnes, in an interview for the New York Times, was more savage (he had been shortlisted for Arthur &amp; George). Not, he felt, a bumper year for judges. Perhaps he was right. But posterity will forget us. Barnes, Ishiguro and - I believe - Banville they&apos;ll remember. And make their own judgments.  2006 Anthony Quinn I enjoyed every moment of the 2006 Booker until the very last minutes of our final meeting in the Guildhall. That was when I realised that the novel which I had set my heart on would not be the winner. On anecdotal evidence from friends who had judged the prize in previous years, I gathered that there was usually someone on the jury who would be a complete pest and make the whole process as awkward as possible. Not this time: our chairman, Hermione Lee, set a tone of almost heartless conviviality that Candia McWilliam, Fiona Shaw and Simon Armitage consistently upheld. Indeed, we had been so likeminded in the final reckoning of our shortlist that I must have blanked the ominous build-up of support for Kiran Desai&apos;s The Inheritance of Loss and assumed that everyone would come round to what was clearly the best book, Edward St Aubyn&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk. When I was outvoted 4-1 I was surprised, and appalled. Six months of reading and re-reading - only to be thwarted at the last! I asked for a recount, which at least got a laugh. It&apos;s not an exaggeration to say that I felt sick to my stomach. I was pleased for Kiran Desai, who&apos;d spent eight years writing it. But we chose the wrong book.  2007 Giles Foden Everyone expected arguments, and we had them, but with dignity (my fellow judges were Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs). We never fell out. In fact, we are meeting up this autumn for a drink. Some had their favourites that others couldn&apos;t stand; others tried to hold up yardsticks against which all books might be measured. The favourite supporters made persuasive cases for AN Wilson and Nicola Barker, but only Barker got through to the shortlist, despite an unfortunate error in transmission - not the judges&apos; fault - which suggested Wilson had. The longlist is where the real argy-bargy takes place.  Once an author is on the shortlist anything can happen. In our case we arrived at a situation in which every judge had mutually exclusive first and last choices. Luckily, in Howard Davies we had a competent chairman, who helped us mathematically towards a choice of winner with which everyone was happy. PS: note to publishers, try not to write call-in letters with spelling mistakes, or one that make foolish claims. Some of these letters looked as if they were written in haste. Then again, so did some of the novels submitted. 2008 Alex Clark Before I was asked to judge this year&apos;s prize, I had been on several literary prize panels and I felt I had enough experience to know roughly what I was doing. But little can prepare you for the Booker: not just the sheer volume of books submitted, but the sense that you are about to be partly responsible for making an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Now, with the final hurdle fast approaching, I can say that it&apos;s been not only an enjoyable process but also an instructive one. Reading is, of course, a solitary affair, and book reviewing not much less so. But anatomising one&apos;s taste and judgment and then communicating it to a group of people with equally strong views has been a wonderful challenge - not least because it makes for scrutiny of what it is that one values in fiction. And, gruelling though it was, I wouldn&apos;t give up those late nights and early mornings spent poring over novels. 2009 John Mullan My fellow judges were Lucasta Miller Jim Naughtie, Sue Perkins and Michael Prodger. I do confess that I already knew, at least slightly, all the other judges. Did this make it too cosy? Maybe, but the process is enough of a challenge to make conviviality a useful blessing. It felt as if there was rather little disagreement until the end, when suddenly it was sharp. On the very day of the dinner, you get shut in a room with sandwiches and orange juice, and chip away at your short list. I would have been happy to see Sarah Waters&apos;s The Little Stranger win, and I think in another year it might have done. But it came down to Wolf Hall versus Summertime: Mantel versus Coetzee. Two of the other judges, Lucasta and Sue, have written elsewhere of theirpreference for Coetzee, so the voting can hardly be a secret. What I had not expected was that my cards would be the last to go on the table.  Being a natural loudmouth, I had been trying to speak judiciously, and had ended up seeming to be biding my moment. Coetzee is, with Roth, maybe the greatest living novelist in the English Language. He could win almost any year he publishes a novel. But Wolf Hall was something extraordinary. After the meeting, Lucasta and Sue did both say &quot;agenbite of inwit&quot; to me a few times. If you&apos;ve read the opening of Summertime,you&apos;ll understand. And the winner was ...

In the end it was the Terry family that came out on top thanks to John&apos;s older brother Paul, whose first goal for two years set Leyton Orient on their way to their first League win, and League goals, since the opening day of the season.  It completed a disappointing few days for Anthony Gerrard, who had started the week hoping to join Championship side Southampton only for Walsall to turn down the South Coast club&apos;s \u00a3300,000 offer on transfer deadline day.  Terry, 29, had not scored for Orient since joining them from Yeovil 15 months ago. Mind you, brother John&apos;s record is hardly any better with one in the last two years. The pair&apos;s lack of success in front of goal had even forced Soccer AM to drop its annual competition, &apos;The Terry-Terry Cup&apos;, awarded to the one who scored the most goals each season.  Perhaps it will be reintroduced now that Paul has broken a duck that stretched back to September 2006 when he scored for Yeovil against Crewe. A Walsall defence well marshalled by Gerrard had given Orient precious little encouragement when, in the 73rd minute, a ball from Adam Boyd took a deflection and sat up nicely for Terry to smash into the bottom corner. Seven minutes later Orient wrapped up the points when the tricky JJ Melligan was sent crashing to the ground as he skipped past Paul Boertien and Boyd dispatched the penalty into the roof of Walsall&apos;s goal.  After several hours of rain in the west Midlands, the pitch had needed two inspections from referee Dean Whitestone before he gave the go-ahead. But the pitch played surprisingly well as both sides opted to play their normal short-passing games that, although pretty to watch, were largely ineffectual with the defences well on top.  The best two moments of the first half came from pieces of individualism from the visitors. First, in the 10th minute, Boyd did well to make some space for himself 20 yards out and dinked a delicate chip that drifted narrowly wide of the Walsall post.  Seventeen minutes later, Melligan aqua-planed his way down the right wing, evading three challenges and pulled back a low cross that deserved better, but the Orient forwards had failed to keep pace with him.  For Walsall, Jabo Ibehre was the outstanding performer. The 25-year-old had spent 13 years as boy and man at Orient before joining Walsall in the summer. His effort could not be faulted, but he received precious little support.  Even the introduction of Michael Ricketts in the second period made little difference. Remember Ricketts? He capped a meteoric rise in 2002 when, having scored 15 goals in his first top flight season for Bolton, he was picked for England by Sven-Goran Eriksson against Holland in Amsterdam.  Inevitably a one-cap wonder, he is now back where his career started, but his only contribution here was a crude challenge on Brian Saah in the 71st minute that earned him a caution.  At the other end of the career scale, 20-year-old Ishmel Demontagnac demonstrated why he frustrates Walsall manager Jimmy Mullen so much. A hat-trick hero last week against Southend, here he was largely anonymous until the final stages when he blasted Walsall&apos;s best two chances high into the stand.", "sentences": ["He capped a meteoric rise in 2002 when, having scored 15 goals in his first top flight season for Bolton, he was picked for England by Sven-Goran Eriksson against Holland in Amsterdam."], "title": "League One: Terry strikes to end Orient's drought", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/07/leagueonefootball.walsall", "tags": ["League One", "Walsall", "Leyton Orient", "Football", "Sport", "League One 2008-09"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-09T06:11:44Z", "article": "     Nike has launched a series of animated online ads that tell the story of the challenges faced by athletes such as tennis star Maria Sharapova and runner Nicola Sanders, as part of a pan-European campaign to inspire young women. The five films, developed by Wieden &amp; Kennedy Amsterdam, form part of a wider multimedia campaign which includes a coffee table book, exhibitions at flagship Nike stores, digital advertising and posters. Nike&apos;s ads, which use the strapline &quot;Here I Am&quot;, use different styles of animation to tell the story of the individual journeys the five women have made to become top athletes. The film featuring Sharapova, titled &quot;Be Your Own Fan&quot;, tells of the Russian tennis sensation&apos;s rise from a childhood in Siberia to the number one ranked player in the world. Nike&apos;s ad highlights the criticism and negativity that Sharapova had to overcome \u2013 such as she was &quot;Just another pretty face&quot; \u2013 in becoming a global sports star. It ends with a call for women to &quot;Be strong like Maria&quot;. The other ads feature 400m runner Sanders, Swiss triathlete Nicola Spirig, Sicilian triple jumper Simona La Mantia and French martial arts expert Delphine Delsalle. &quot;Their stories, like the young women themselves, are as charming as they are impressive and inspiring,&quot; said Betsy Decker, associate creative director at W&amp;K Amsterdam. W&amp;K chose to show the athletes in animated clips \u2013 as opposed to more typical slick live action shots of the women \u2013 because it was felt that the approach &quot;humanised&quot; them more. &quot;By humanising these young athletes\u2026 we hope to show girls of all ages and fitness levels how sport strengthens self-belief,&quot; added Decker. The films will be made available on a Nike Women website, officially launching later this week, as well as on social networking websites and on plasma screens in university gyms and student unions across Europe. There is a possibility the films may be used in more traditional media such as on TV. In the UK, the campaign is being driven by an exhibition at Nike Town in Oxford Circus, London. Part of the exhibition includes a limited-edition Nike Women &quot;Here I Am&quot; book featuring 22 young international female athletes. Each chapter has a &quot;visual interpretation&quot;, such as Japanese manga drawing, of each athlete&apos;s journey to sports success. The UK leg of the campaign is supported by athletes including Heptathlete Kelly Sotherton, England striker Lianne Sanderson, Steph Twell and Emma Byrne. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

When Alan called one in Southwark, he could make out the sound of a child asking for his tea. And when Mick called another to inquire about their services, he was told that he could have a &quot;dirty Oriental bitch who will do stag nights, anal, and the rest.&quot; The men were undertaking research for Big Brothel: a Survey of the Off-Street Sex Industry in London, the most comprehensive study ever conducted into brothels in the UK. The project, which gathered information from 921 brothels in the capital, was commissioned by the Poppy Project, the only British organisation that offers support for women trafficked into prostitution. My co-author Helen Atkins and I recruited male friends and colleagues to help with the research, and warned them that the work might be upsetting. They were to telephone brothels, posing as potential punters, with a list of questions including &quot;What nationalities are on offer tonight?&quot;, &quot;Do the girls do anal?&quot;, &quot;How about oral without a condom?&quot;, and &quot;What age are they?&quot; We wanted to look at what really goes on in brothels - how much control the women really have; whether there is evidence of trafficking; if local councils are giving licences for saunas and massage parlours when it is clear that they are brothels; and how the sex industry is growing and evolving.  During 120 hours of telephone calls, we established the following: at least 1,933 women are currently at work in London&apos;s brothels; ages range from 18 to 55 (with a number of premises offering &quot;very, very young girls&quot;); prices for full sex start at \u00a315, and go up to \u00a3250; and more than a third of the brothels offer unprotected sex - including, in some cases, anal penetration. The lowest price quoted for anal sex was \u00a315. &quot;Come along and bring your mates,&quot; said one brothel owner. &quot;We have a Greek girl who is very, very young.&quot; While kissing used to be off-limits for women selling sex, it can now be bought for an extra tenner.  Of the brothels researched, 85% operate in residential areas. Almost two-thirds are located in flats and more than one-fifth are in a house. Wherever you are in the city, the likelihood is that buying and selling women is going on under your nose. Our researchers contacted only brothels that advertised in local newspapers - not those that advertise on websites or on cards in telephone boxes. Because of this we only uncovered the tiniest corner of the trade. But we still encountered brothels in every London borough, with Enfield (a typical residential area of north London) having a minimum of 54, and Westminster at least 71. We estimated that the brothels we surveyed made anything from \u00a386m to \u00a3209.5m in total per year through newspaper advertisements alone.  Although it is a criminal offence to advertise prostitution services, the law is not enforced, and this &quot;blind eye&quot; approach serves the pimps and punters well.  Researchers also interviewed women who have worked in London brothels, and all reported having felt degraded and violated while selling sex. This tallies with previous research: one large US study on prostitution and violence found that 82% of women had been physically assaulted since entering the trade, with many having been raped. More than 80% were homeless, and a majority, on and off-street, were addicted to illegal drugs and/or alcohol. UK research published in 2000 found that prostitutes routinely face sexual and physical violence from pimps and punters, but have little or no &quot;workplace&quot; protection.  One of the women we spoke to was Naomi, who, like many prostitutes, has a history of childhood sexual abuse. When she ran away from home, she met a man who pimped her - first into hostess clubs, then from a private flat. &quot;It&apos;s an unsettling, unhealthy experience seeing 20 guys a day,&quot; she says, &quot;and you don&apos;t know what the next person will be like&quot;. A common assumption is that brothels are safer than the street, and while it seems that women are more likely to be murdered if they are working on the streets, the prevalence of rape and other attacks from pimps and punters is also high in brothels. &quot;The men have up to an hour to do what they like to you,&quot; says Janet, who was pimped into a Leeds brothel when she was 15, &quot;whereas at least on the street you can always try to run away.&quot; Rachel told us about the reality of how much money the women make, as well as the inherent danger in the off-street trade. &quot;Flats are set up to be a rip-off, to be truthful with you, because you&apos;re not going to make money for yourself.&quot; Rachel made about \u00a3200 a day, but after paying card boys, rent, the maid, and her &quot;protector&quot; (pimp), she came out with next to nothing. &quot;And you&apos;re not guaranteed security at the end of the day.&quot; Alice brought it home to us just how accepted and normalised prostitution has become. &quot;You sit in a basque, in a window with your red light on. When you get a client you close your curtains and turn your red light off. That starts from eight in the morning.&quot; The minister for women, Harriet Harman, is determined to curb the massive trade in women&apos;s bodies. Last week she released findings from a Mori poll of more than 1,000 British adults on attitudes to paying for sex. It found that the vast majority of both men and women polled would think it &quot;unacceptable&quot; if a partner paid for sex; the majority would support a law that criminalised paying for sex; and around half would back a law that decreased the number of women being trafficked into the UK. As our researchers discovered, brothels market women merely as merchandise. Frank was offered &quot;two for the price of one&quot; if he visited during &quot;happy hour&quot; (any time before 5pm). One brothel owner offered to send two women to the punter&apos;s home for a \u00a350 delivery charge; another offered free oral sex without a condom if more than \u00a350 was spent; and at one suburban sauna, first-time buyers were offered a voucher which entitled them to 50% off the next visit. We primed the telephone researchers to look for evidence of trafficking. There was plenty. Brothels offered women of 77 different nationalities and ethnicities, including many from known-source countries for trafficking. One researcher was told by a brothel owner, &quot;For no condom and anal, call tomorrow. Eastern Europeans promised later in the week.&quot; One punter I interviewed for another research project told me that in choosing a woman, &quot;I made a list in my mind. I told myself that I&apos;ll be with different races eg Japanese, Indian, Chinese. Once I have been with them I tick them off the list.&quot; Many people are unhappy that this research has been done at all. The pro-legalisation lobby do not seem to want the horrors of what goes on in brothels exposed, preferring to present such places as being similar to an office environment; simple, clean, consensual workplaces. Punters are also unhappy about public exposure of brothels. One frequent customer at a Soho brothel told me, &quot;I don&apos;t know why people have to research prostitution - the army shoots innocent people, fast food poisons people; no one wants to research them. It&apos;s the only job that has no downside. It only brings pleasure to the customer.&quot; Some of the male researchers had previously been liberal about prostitution. Frank had thought that legalisation would be beneficial to the women, and Mick believed that some would be happy earning good money. By the end of the project, all the men considered prostitution to be a violent and abusive industry, and perceived the punters as harmful misogynists. Nigel said that after weeks of talking about sex to third parties in a cold, clinical way he realised that the women were being used as nothing more than a product. &quot;The idea of sex started to be devalued and demeaned, its sanctity lost,&quot; he says. Tony was shocked at the number of brothels. &quot;They&apos;re on high streets, down alleyways and in suburban two-up two-downs.&quot; Unless we think about sustainable and substantive solutions that will eventually eradicate prostitution, it will continue to grow at an alarming rate - research published last year found that in just 10 years, the number of men paying for sex in the UK almost doubled.  What Big Brothel shows is that commercial sex is becoming as normalised as stopping off for a McDonald&apos;s. There are two key ways that the UK can respond. We can legalise the trade, make the women pay taxes, and declare the pimps to be legitimate businessmen. Where brothels have been legalised- in Amsterdam, for instance - the illegal sector continues to flourish. Since brothels were legalised in Melbourne, Australia, more than 20 years ago, the number of unlicensed brothels has trebled. Few prostitutes will pay tax, as the act of registering their trade is too stigmatised, and their lives are often too chaotic. There is no evidence that legalisation keeps women safe, but there is plenty that shows it results in an increase in demand for the sex trade. In Australia, $11.3bn was spent on prostitutes and strippers last year, and the trade is growing at approximately 8% a year.  The other option is to bring in a law that makes paying for sex illegal, while helping to educate the public that prostitution is not a victimless crime. This has worked in Sweden, where such a law was introduced nine years ago, and 80% of Swedes now support it. Trafficking into the country is now lower than in any other EU nation. This is the approach that government ministers Harriet Harman and Vera Baird support. Most men do not pay for sex. Those who do need educating about the harm that prostitution causes to women and society in general. Some will only stop if they are frightened of the consequences, such as one charmer who told me, &quot;If she isn&apos;t crying but says no, I keep on. I only stop if she is really crying.&quot; Others are able to justify to themselves what they do, simply because it is not against the law. When I asked why he pays for sex, one regular punter told me: &quot;It&apos;s like going for a drink. You are not doing anything illegal.&quot; At the moment, he is right. Let&apos;s hope the government has the courage to change that.", "sentences": ["Where brothels have been legalised- in Amsterdam, for instance - the illegal sector continues to flourish."], "title": "Julie Bindel reveals the truth about brothels", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/10/women.socialexclusion", "tags": ["Women", "Gender", "Life and style", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-11T07:00:00Z", "article": "Seventy years ago this month in Munich, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, signed a document that allowed Germany to grab a large chunk of Czechoslovakia. The so-called  Munich Agreement would come to be seen as an abject betrayal of what Chamberlain termed &quot;a far-away country of which we know little&quot;. But that was not what many people thought at the time.  Chamberlain&apos;s belief that Britain was not yet ready for war with Nazi Germany, and that diplomacy and compromise were safer options, was in fact shared by many Europeans, who knew from personal experience the horrible consequences of war. Nonetheless, Chamberlain has gone down in history as a coward, and his &quot;appeasement&quot; of Nazi Germany is often blamed for Hitler&apos;s subsequent campaign to conquer the rest of Europe.  Chamberlain was probably wrong. Britain and France could have stopped Germany. &quot;Munich, 1938,&quot; was one of the rare occasions in the history of democracies when careful diplomacy was a mistake. What was needed was a bloody-minded romantic hero, willing to gamble the fate of his nation by fighting on, &quot;whatever the cost may be,&quot; in the words of Winston Churchill.  George Santayana famously warned that &quot;those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&quot; History, however, teaches many lessons, some of them contradictory, and is never repeated in quite the same way. Sometimes too much attention paid to the past can lead us badly astray. So, what, exactly, has the world learned from Munich, 1938?  If anything, west Europeans after the second world war drew conclusions that were closer to Chamberlain&apos;s thinking in 1938 than Churchill&apos;s. After two catastrophic wars, Europeans decided to build institutions that would make military conflict redundant. Henceforth, diplomacy, compromise, and shared sovereignty would be the norm, and romantic nationalism, based on military prowess, would be a thing of the past.  Out of the ashes of war a new kind of Europe arose, as did a new kind of Japan, which even had a pacifist constitution (written by idealistic Americans, but gratefully accepted by most Japanese). Nationalism (except in football stadiums) gave way to smug self-satisfaction at having found more civilised, diplomatic, and pacific solutions to human conflicts.  To be sure, the peace was kept. But only because it was guaranteed by the United States, which still stuck to pre-second world war notions of national and international security.  In the US, Munich has had a very different resonance. There, it fed the Churchillian illusions of many a &quot;war president&quot; who dreamed of going down in history as freedom&apos;s heroic defender. Munich has been invoked over and over \u2013 to fight Communism, to topple Saddam Hussein, to stop Iran, and to wage a &quot;war on terror&quot;.  These different perspectives have caused peculiar tensions between the US and its democratic allies. Europeans and Japanese depend on American military power for their security, but often don&apos;t like the way the US uses it. Too much dependence has also had an infantilising effect. Like permanent adolescents, Europeans and Japanese crave the security of the great American father, and deeply resent him at the same time.  There is little doubt that the US, like all great powers, has embarked on foolish wars and acted like a bully, especially toward nations in its own hemisphere. But, even without invoking the ghosts of Munich, there are occasions when military force is the only way to deal with a tyrant. Europeans were unwilling to stand up to Serbian mass murderers. The Americans (after initial reluctance) had to do the dirty work. When the US decided to push Saddam Hussein&apos;s killers out of Kuwait, German protesters screamed that they would never &quot;shed blood for oil&quot;.  On the other hand, European diplomacy has had some remarkable successes. The prospect of joining the European Union helped consolidate democracy in central and eastern Europe, and in Turkey, too. Some of these democracies have joined Nato, and others desperately want to. Nato, however, unlike the EU, is a military organisation. Therein lies Chamberlain&apos;s old problem: are Europeans prepared to fight wars on behalf of their fellow members?  During the Cold War, this was not a serious dilemma. Europeans relied on Nato and the US to defend them in case of Soviet aggression. Now Georgia and Ukraine would like to expect that Europeans and Americans would shed blood to defend them against Russia.  The choice is stark: if Europeans are prepared to fight for Georgia or Ukraine, these countries should be invited to join Nato. If not, not. But, instead of choosing, major European countries such as Germany, have dithered, first dangling Nato membership as a juicy carrot, and then withdrawing the offer, leaving the Americans to indulge in heroic rhetoric without the necessary follow-through.  All this is making the western alliance look incoherent, and, despite its vast wealth and American military power, strangely impotent. It is time for European democracies to make up their minds. They can remain dependent on US protection and stop complaining, or they can develop the capacity to defend Europe, however they wish to define it, by themselves.  The first option may not be feasible for very much longer in the twilight days of Pax America. The second will be expensive and risky. Given the many divisions inside the Union, Europeans will probably muddle on, until a serious crisis forces them to act, by which point it could well be too late.

It is now unworthy of a banana republic. That is the message of Unesco&apos;s final warning this week as it ponders moving seven of Britain&apos;s 27 world heritage sites to &quot;endangered&quot; status. To those who resent being told how to guard their patrimony by an unelected foreign quango this is humiliation enough. Worse, the rebuke is merited. World heritage status, enjoyed by 885 sites on the planet, means absolutely nothing. The list, which includes everything from St Petersburg to the Great Barrier Reef, is the result of some parlour game by Paris bureaucrats, who sit around a table awarding medals to the creations of nature and mankind. It shines a spotlight on a selection of world monuments in the hope that this might shame owners and public authorities into protecting them. There are certainly worse parlour games than that. Most places do not need it. Authorities in such cities as Paris, Barcelona, Prague or Rome have a sense of pride and beauty instilled in them from birth. They can fight their own battles and need no lessons from outsiders. They draw up rules and stick to them. Elsewhere, Unesco is a useful goad. India is struggling to prevent decay to the Taj Mahal, Cambodia to Angkor Wat, Egypt to the pyramids. Britain&apos;s sites embrace Canterbury, Bath, Durham, Westminster Abbey, Hadrian&apos;s Wall, Stonehenge and more imaginative choices such as Liverpool&apos;s waterfront, Skara Brae on Orkney and the &quot;colony&quot; castles of north Wales. The difference is that, in Britain, nobody gives a damn. Individual buildings may be preserved, but their context, setting and development is left to the anarchic forces of local property development and government whim. For the past two years Unesco has been uttering dire threats to cut the British list. It is particularly appalled at London&apos;s refusal to safeguard the setting of the Tower of London, now probably a lost cause. The City planning department, so-called, has reduced it to a pastiche fortress besieged by sheet glass salesmen, mostly in the pay of the architectural lords, Foster and Rogers. It looks no more authentic as a historic monument than does the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas. To the Tower of London is added a longer list of shame. Unesco recently had to plead with Liverpool not to add a gratuitous 24-storey tower and a Will Allsop coloured blob to its famous waterfront. Neither paid the slightest respect to context. The same blight is afflicting Edinburgh, where the city has approved the bulky Caltongate centre by the Royal Mile, and towers abusing the urban texture of Leith docks. An unbelievable plan to replace the 1970s St James shopping centre in the east end with another tower shows that Scottish planning has learned nothing from its past mistakes. Unesco is equally concerned by wind turbines pock-marking the iron age settlements of the Orkneys. Others on the list include Bath, where the council proposes a brutal over-development of its riverside; Westminster, threatened by towers dwarfing its historic core; and Stonehenge, where nothing has been done to improve its wretched setting for decades. The decline of British urban design is a mystery. Projects that would not survive a minute in other European cities must be fought line by line through British planning committees, public inquiries and courts. Conservationists recently won the saving of Smithfield market in central London only after the City of London Corporation and developers had spent millions of pounds trying to erect a glass office block on the site. The deputy leader of Westminster city council, Robert Davis, wrote to the Guardian this week pleading for support for Unesco in the face of the government&apos;s &quot;fetishistic obsession with skyscrapers&quot;. Davis&apos;s particular concern is a 143-metre tower of luxury flats recently approved for the South Bank and higher even than the London Eye. It will loom over both Horse Guards and Westminster Abbey and parliament. The South Bank tower was the personal decision of the planning minister, Hazel Blears, against the advice of all concerned with London&apos;s skyline, including her own planning inspector. Like the bizarre &quot;walkie-talkie&quot; skyscraper that she has authorised to peer down on the Tower of London, and like John Prescott&apos;s now imminent Vauxhall tower, these buildings are not planned or clustered or governed by any concept of visual scale. They disregard the professed desire of the former culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, to safeguard world heritage sites with &quot;buffer zones&quot;. Blears makes up her mind as might a ruler of Paraguay or Burkina Faso. What appears to have collapsed is civic confidence. Stockholm, Amsterdam and Rome do not need government ministers to instruct their leaders in urban good manners - let alone in bad ones. They can plan for developmental prosperity within the historic context of their city. The London skyline and the dignity of its streets, squares and vistas were once protected by plot ratios and codes of practice, backed by a consensus of what constituted a civilised city. London shared with Paris the status of capital of street culture because its architecture respected the human scale of those streets. It was not a series of palaces in parks - or glass boxes in evergreen shrubs. The current affliction of Bath, and the waterfronts at Liverpool, Edinburgh and Bristol, derives from the inability of British architects to design streets. They just cannot do it. The pages of architecture magazines are crammed with large, freestanding buildings, intended to win prizes for office blocks, museums, schools or hospitals and pushing their creator into the headlines. Most are of glass and steel, energy-hungry, unadaptable and stylistic pastiches on Mies van der Rohe. They are for looking at rather than using, let alone walking past. They can be seen in central Birmingham and Manchester or in London&apos;s Paddington Basin. No British architect ever won a prize for streetscape, let alone for humility in the presence of history. All crave an Olympics cost-plus contract and a mention in Charles Jencks&apos;s The Iconic Building. The idea that every rich city must have a tower is absurd. As Davis wrote of Westminster - which became the richest city in Europe by eschewing skyscrapers - this is &quot;a stale cliche&quot;, echoing a mid-20th century obsession with architectural virility. Towers are environmental disasters, unless clustered in a visual monotony as at Canary Wharf. Certainly cities must be planned to higher densities, but skyscrapers are expensive to build and run and as a result hard to let. They are anti-ecological and brutal in their visual impact. Once built, they are in-your-face for ever. Sometimes a high structure can grace a skyline, such as Paris&apos;s Eiffel Tower or even the London Eye. Britain&apos;s skyscrapers, whether for offices or luxury flats, serve no such purpose, visual or civic. They are just pillars of extravagance. They are like the turbines now criss-crossing the British countryside, memorials not to energy-saving but to madcap public self-regard. These buildings scream that bigness is an adequate substitute for beauty, and that there is no such thing as public design. It is shaming that we need Unesco to tell us otherwise. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["Stockholm, Amsterdam and Rome do not need government ministers to instruct their leaders in urban good manners - let alone in bad ones."], "title": "Simon Jenkins: The neglect of our heritage is shameful - to be told it by outsiders doubly so", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/12/heritage", "tags": ["Heritage", "Art and design", "Culture", "Communities", "Society", "Politics", "Planning policy", "London politics", "London"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-11T23:01:00Z", "article": "July 18 This morning, my album was nominated for the Mercury music prize.

But I&apos;m pretty sure they won&apos;t, because I am still a folk artist. It&apos;s been a surreal day, but a very exciting one, too. I&apos;ve got some friends coming round for dinner tonight, so I&apos;m going to bake a celebratory cake. July 25 My life hasn&apos;t exactly changed since the nomination, but I have had a lot of lovely congratulatory texts from friends. Oh, and I went home to Reading a few days ago, and there was an article in the local paper about me being nominated. They even interviewed my teacher. I owe a lot to her, so that was nice, but it was all quite strange, too. I don&apos;t really enjoy reading about myself, because I don&apos;t want to look at myself in the third person, in case it changes my opinion of myself. The new Noah and the Whale single, which I sang backing vocals on, has gone into the Top 20 this week, which is quite exciting. It&apos;s great that they&apos;ve got this brilliant pop single that will open them up to a lot of people. I suppose it&apos;s the same with the Mercury; it pushes my music to people who wouldn&apos;t otherwise hear it, without me really having to do anything. The winner is announced in six weeks. I don&apos;t want to want to win it, if that makes sense. I think it&apos;s perhaps better just to be nominated. Having said that, my sister has put a bet on me to win, so there is some pressure. August 7 I&apos;m in Melbourne, on a rather fleeting trip to Australia. It&apos;s been very, very nice indeed. We&apos;ve done three gigs, one at the Splendour in the Grass festival in Byron Bay and two little headline shows in Sydney and Melbourne, which were both sold out. Everyone we&apos;ve dealt with here has been incredibly friendly, and I seem to have turned into the most positive person ever, possibly because of the maddening over-tiredness. I&apos;ve been really chatty at shows, too, which is really weird for me. I&apos;m on the other side of the world and I&apos;ve changed into a completely different person. I&apos;ve done a few interviews, but nobody has asked about the Mercury nomination. In fact, the only person who mentioned it was my godmother, whom we were staying with in Sydney. She didn&apos;t really know what it was, but she was very excited for me. It was the nicest thing ever staying with her. It&apos;d be lovely to have a mum in every city. August 13 We&apos;re in Edinburgh at the moment, doing two shows as part of the Fringe. We played in a cave last night with sweat dripping off the walls. None of us could breathe. But it&apos;s nice to be here. I love Edinburgh - in fact I&apos;m coming back here next week for a holiday. The Mercury nomination still hasn&apos;t had any major impact on me or my career. I&apos;ve actually been quite surprised by how little it&apos;s changed anything. But I have been worrying about what to wear to the ceremony. Apparently it&apos;s quite posh, but I&apos;m really not a dress kind of person, so I think I&apos;ll stick to jeans and a smart top. I&apos;m definitely not doing the red carpet thing, though. I&apos;m never standing up in front of those horrible photographers ever again in my life. My little old heart can&apos;t take much more of that terrifying stuff that I don&apos;t enjoy. The fact that I&apos;m going to be playing live there is terrifying enough, thank you. August 19 I&apos;m on a train on my way back up to Edinburgh. Since we were there last week, I&apos;ve played at Lowlands festival near Amsterdam, which was really beautiful and sunny, and Green Man in Wales, which was really wet and cold. Both were fun, though. I really enjoy festivals. My big news is that I&apos;ve just announced quite a big American tour, with Johnny Flynn, who&apos;s amazing. We&apos;re calling it the Fee Fie Foe Fum tour, because we wanted some way of letting people know the vibe of the tour without it being like, &quot;British folk invasion!&quot; The tagline is, of course, &quot;I smell the blood of an Englishman&quot;, although I actually have no idea if that&apos;s a famous saying in America. I&apos;m going up to Edinburgh for a rest, to get away from London and to see some friends and some plays. I like living in London, but it can get a bit much. Mercury-wise, nothing has really happened this week I&apos;m afraid. To be honest, I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s even mentioned it. But it&apos;s still lodged there at the back of my mind. August 27 It&apos;s a good thing I don&apos;t have much on this week, because I&apos;ve come down with a nasty cold. I had a lovely time in Edinburgh, going to see plays, cooking and walking. None of the plays were very good, but I had fun. I took my guitar, too - I take my guitar wherever I go - and did a bit of work on some demos on my laptop. It&apos;s two weeks until the Mercury prize and it all seems to be coming together nicely. We&apos;ve got a special guest fiddle player for our performance, which is very exciting for me. It&apos;s Tom from Noah and the Whale, who actually wrote the part for the song we&apos;re going to play. I&apos;m looking forward to it, but I know I&apos;m going to be a shivering wreck when it comes to the day. Apparently, I&apos;m still among the bookies&apos; favourites, but it turns out my sister didn&apos;t put a bet on me after all, which takes the pressure off slightly. I haven&apos;t really thought much about winning. The only thing I&apos;ve ever won was most improved swimmer when I left primary school, so perhaps I&apos;m not the winning sort. September 3 Less than a week to go, and I think I&apos;ve actually been more on edge than usual. It&apos;s starting to feel near and like quite a big deal, which it hasn&apos;t before. I really, really don&apos;t want to walk down the red carpet, but my manager pointed out that if I didn&apos;t, it might look rude. We came to a compromise that the band are going to walk down with me. But I&apos;m definitely not buying any new clothes or having my hair done. Actually, I think I may be under-preparing, but I pride myself on not caring too much about what people think I look like, so I&apos;m trying not to worry about it.  I got to talk to Russell Brand on his Radio 2 show at the weekend. It&apos;s the only radio show I listen to, so that was terribly exciting. They were saying they wanted me to win, which was nice, although I&apos;m still not sure whether I want that. I happened upon a really good episode of Friends the other day where Joey doesn&apos;t win an award and masters that magnanimous look of defeat, which might well come in handy for me. September 10 The ceremony was last night. To my surprise, I enjoyed it, although the red carpet was just as horrific as I predicted. I went down with the band, and we got shouted at from various quarters. I gave a kind of painful stare/grin and then just ran away. But I have to admit that I lost all integrity last week and decided I had to look smart, so I ended up wearing a black dress which a friend made for me. I was completely numb for my performance, which I think was quite beneficial. Then I went and had dinner at the table with my sisters. The food was pretty gross, but I am quite fussy. Just before Jools Holland announced the winner, I suddenly felt, like, &quot;Shit, what if I did win? I have no idea what I&apos;d do.&quot; All the blood rushed to my legs and I was terrified he&apos;d read my name out and my legs would give way. Then Elbow won and their speech was so perfect, and I genuinely breathed a massive sigh of relief. Although I never came round to wanting to win, I do think the Mercury is a worthwhile thing. I heard some people saying it&apos;s a big commercial mess, but it really does put effort into finding music that people might not have heard otherwise. That has to be good.

The conference debates, and the myriad meetings, debates and parties of the fringe are exciting, hectic stuff, and the adrenalin will carry one through. But there is a whole other side to party conferences. If you work in public affairs for a cause, a charity, a commercial lobbyist, public sector body or as a political correspondent for the media, the conference season is the definitive end of summer. While the delegate or MP will only attend one conference, some of us go to all three (or more, for those with an interest in Scotland, Wales or smaller parties). Welcome to the sad subculture of the party conference exhibitor. On the road Each party, and each conference town, has its own distinctive atmosphere. Labour in Brighton, and the Conservatives in Bournemouth, are probably the best, and the Lib Dems in Blackpool probably the worst, for entertainment value. Blackpool was perennially unpopular, for its air of dereliction, its chilly grey seas, unreliable train connection at Preston and sometimes squalid hotels.  But it had some redeeming features as a conference venue, such as the rattling trams, the splendid Funny Girls drag show and the illuminations. Recently the lamp-posts along the sea front have been adorned with giant illuminated bloodshot eyeballs, which always evoked a smile of recognition from some conference delegates.  But Blackpool is no more, replaced by the less quirky charms of Manchester and Birmingham for the two big parties. Their conference centres may be very efficient, and large enough, but something is lost when the party conference is just another big-city event rather than the taking over of a seaside town. Hats off to the Lib Dems for sticking with Bournemouth, which is always a pleasant venue with its warm climate and sandy beaches and its ready supply of cheap and reasonable hotels near the conference centre.  The conference season has its own rhythm. The Liberal Democrats, unfortunately for them, go first in mid-September while the political classes are still struggling out of their summer torpor, and the conference is a lot smaller and more earnest than the other two. Labour&apos;s is huge and hectic, and prone to sudden mood swings such as in 2006, when people decided they loved Tony Blair after all, and 2007, when it was overtaken with enthusiasm for an immediate election and rumours that that was about to happen.  Many exhibitors have a sneaking fondness for the Conservative conference. While stuffy Tories are very stuffy indeed, the fun Tories are probably more fun than anyone from the other two parties, and exhibitors are usually getting demob-happy by then, not to say a bit tired and hysterical. There is a decadent undertone, something of the night perhaps, about Tory conference.  Making an exhibition of oneself The Labour and Conservative conferences are both enormous trade fairs with some people talking about their political ideas as if they mattered in a room off to one side. The exhibitors are put in rows of little booths in a hall, around which delegates, MPs and off-duty fellow exhibitors will wander while one tries to grab their attention. If you think about the windows of the red light district in Amsterdam, you are getting the idea, but at conference the middle-aged men in rumpled suits are the ones hawking their wares.  The stand will have been assembled, if you are fortunate, by professional contractors. The unfortunates put up their own stands, with the result that conference starts with an involuntary team-building exercise that leads to arguments, breakages and the realisation that some essential bit of kit was left in the lobby of the office back in London. I was maimed in a Stanley knife incident during this process at last year&apos;s Conservative conference in Blackpool. There is a physical syndrome that sets in as the conference season progresses. Bad breath is one of the first symptoms, aggravated by poor diet, hangovers and a constant flow of instant coffee, but combated with a visit to one of the stands (Royal Mail is often a good bet) dishing out powerful breath mints.  Part of the reason that exhibitors are getting puffy-faced and dead-eyed by the middle of the Labour conference is that a diet of fried breakfasts, canap\u00e9s and alcohol is not a very healthy way to live, and it takes its toll after a while. A reasonable rule of thumb is that nothing in a fringe meeting buffet counts towards one&apos;s &quot;five a day&quot;, even if it appears at first glance to contain vegetable products. In recent years the health sector pressure groups and professional bodies have got together and held their meetings in a &quot;health hotel&quot;, which also offers some health checks and, wonderfully, supplies of fruit. And, unlike rehab, it&apos;s free and doesn&apos;t take very long. Some exhibitors also give out bottled water. Further complications include the compulsive twitching of &quot;exhibitor&apos;s knee&quot;, the stiff back and the frozen, coat-hanger grin of someone who has spent all day trying to be charming and polite. A rest and a massage are probably the most sensible ways of dealing with these problems, but most people choose instead short-term oblivion at the cost of feeling even worse the next day, and go out and get blind drunk at fringe meetings. Under the influence If you are something of an insider, or know someone who is, there are the big receptions, held by the major newspapers (the Mirror reception at the Labour conference used to be legendary). An invitation to one of these is highly prized. However, most exhibitors have to settle for going to each other&apos;s fringe meetings.  Market economics determines that the more loathsome the cause, the better the food and wine at the fringe meeting or evening reception. Some very worthy causes have the dreaded &quot;cash bar&quot; tag in the fringe programme. A general rule is: unless the fringe sponsors are very wealthy or morally suspect, stick to the red wine. Bad white wine can strip paint from walls, while bad red wine only gives one a bit of a headache. After the fringe has exhausted itself, there are discos. Among the best of these is often the Absolutely Equal bash sponsored by various equality organisations. This is particularly fun at the Conservative conference, as one can play the game of &quot;spot the Tory&quot; among all the liberal voluntary and public-sector types huddling together for warmth and mutual support. After these, the conference hotel bars stay open pretty much all night, and this is where the most outlandish stuff happens. Some of it is touching, like a late-night impromptu Billy Bragg singalong that sometimes happens at Labour conference. Some of it is a frightening tribal ritual outsiders witness at their mortal peril, such as the infamous Glee Club at the Lib Dems where they sing scurrilous folk songs at their own expense and Paddy Ashdown tells a convoluted joke.  A scant few hours later one jolts awake, in one&apos;s own or, even better, someone else&apos;s, hotel room, knocks back some Solpadeine and wonders who on earth these people whose business cards have appeared in one&apos;s pockets might be. Then you go and do it all again. Compositing Politics is rock&apos;n&apos;roll for ugly people, and similar rules of etiquette apply. What goes on tour stays on tour. It is the height of bad form to tell tales about what happens at night when you take several thousand people with a shared interest nobody else appreciates, and fill them with as much alcohol as they can take. If you must have an ill-advised liaison with a fellow exhibitor, it is best left until the Conservative conference, as it is easier to avoid each other for one conference than it is for three. The meaning of it all David Cameron briefly contemplated abandoning annual conferences, but decided not to. His idea was, from a purely practical point of view, not without merit. But one party, or indeed one exhibiting organisation, would lose out if it alone decided to boycott the entire circus. We are trapped into doing conferences the way we have always done conferences. It&apos;s stressful, it certainly counts as work (and often involves 16-hour days), and it&apos;s generally bad for one&apos;s health and wellbeing. But packing up at the end of the Conservative conference can be a sad, wistful business. For all its excess and absurdity, I love the conference season.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland&apos;s chief suspect in the 2001 murder managed to elude detectives who carried out a number of search and arrest operations in Northern Ireland last week related to the O&apos;Hagan killing, The Observer has learnt. It has also emerged this weekend that at least one of the five people still being questioned by police in connection with the O&apos;Hagan murder has been moved into protective custody.  Four men and one woman were arrested last week and remain in custody over the weekend. They include a husband and wife from Mid Ulster.  The searches and arrests were carried out by a new police unit which has been given powers to re-investigate murders committed between June 1998 and June 2004. The Retrospective Murder Review Team is headed by Supt Alan Skelton and Dt Chief Brian Murphy. Their brief includes re-examining many unsolved paramilitary-related killings, including that of the Sunday World reporter.  Skelton and Murphy reopened the O&apos;Hagan murder file last year.  The journalist, who was 51, was shot dead in front of his wife on 28 September, 2001, as they walked home from a pub in the centre of Lurgan, Co Armagh. Detectives investigating the case believe O&apos;Hagan&apos;s killers had been tipped off by a phone call from the bar that he and his wife were leaving for home. O&apos;Hagan was gunned down close to the loyalist Mourneview estate. The Loyalist Volunteer Force was blamed for the journalist&apos;s killing. O&apos;Hagan had a reputation for breaking stories about loyalists and their criminal enterprises, particularly in the Mid Ulster and North Armagh area where he came from. He was the second journalist in Ireland to be murdered in just under a decade. Five years earlier a Dublin crime gang shot dead Sunday Independent reporter Veronica Guerin. So far no one has been charged or convicted over O&apos;Hagan&apos;s murder. Last night security sources in Northern Ireland said their main suspect had fled the Province to the Irish Republic. &apos;This guy has long-standing connections with criminals in the south and wouldn&apos;t find it hard to get a safe house down there,&apos; one source told The Observer. &apos;He got wind of the operation and despite his house being hit a number of times there was no sign of him last week.&apos; He said that their chief suspect had recently returned from Mexico, where he had been on holiday. The LVF gunman also has a car business in the Netherlands, where he spent most of this year, and close ties to southern Irish criminals operating in Amsterdam, the source added. The Lurgan-born LVF terrorist and former associate of the murdered loyalist leader Billy &apos;King Rat&apos; Wright was first arrested by detectives six years ago and questioned about the murder of O&apos;Hagan.  A number of human rights organisations, along with the National Union of Journalists, have raised concerns about the failure to prosecute anyone over the O&apos;Hagan killing.  The Mid Ulster LVF was notorious for being full of police and MI5 informers, even though some state agents were involved in crimes including murder.", "sentences": ["The LVF gunman also has a car business in the Netherlands, where he spent most of this year, and close ties to southern Irish criminals operating in Amsterdam, the source added."], "title": "Suspect in O'Hagan murder flees south", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/14/northernireland.ireland", "tags": ["Northern Ireland", "Ireland", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-13T23:01:00Z", "article": "Time for some poetry!&apos; yells the diminutive figure on stage. He has finally got the crowd in this Amsterdam club bubbling ... and then he opts to kill the atmosphere stone-dead by cutting the music and mentioning poetry? But then, this is Lil Wayne, the Louisiana MC routinely referred to - often by himself - as &apos;the best rapper alive&apos;. A man credited with inventing the term &apos;bling bling&apos;, way back in 1998, when he was just 15. A man recently namechecked by Barack Obama. So this poem is bound to be some deep shit, perhaps involving the ongoing struggles of his native New Orleans, or black-on-black violence in America&apos;s inner cities, or even Obama&apos;s bid to become the first President of colour. An anticipatory hush descends. And, having got our full attention, Lil Wayne begins his recitation. &apos;Roses are red! Violets are blue! I love my Euros! But bitch... I don&apos;t love you!&apos; Lil Wayne holds out his arms and waits for the Amsterdam massive to show him their love. The crowd, at least 40 per cent female, withhold their affection in favour of bemused silence. Dead poets spin in their graves, like records on turntables. Dwayne Michael Carter Jr is a bona fide phenomenon. At a time when the music industry can&apos;t give away CDs, his sixth solo album, Tha Carter III, has sold two million copies in two months in America alone. The lead single, a winsome R&amp;B-ish sex ditty called &apos;Lollipop&apos;, was No.1 in America for five weeks. Even the radio-unfriendly &apos;official street single&apos;, a stunningly innovative meld of braggadocious metaphor and minimalist electro called &apos;A Milli&apos;, reached No.6. And unlike many a superstar rapper, the 25-year-old Carter has climbed gradually to this level of success, serving his apprenticeship as part of teen rap group the Hot Boys in 1997 before launching his solo career with 1999&apos;s Tha Block is Hot. It was street and internet support, rather than radio and TV, that broke Wayne, as each subsequent record has been more successful than the last.  But Tha Carter III isn&apos;t just a commercial leap for Lil Wayne, aka Weezy Baby. On previous records he was little more than a standard, money-gunz-bitchez MC. On this one he mixes the usual ghetto superstar lyrics with surreal flights of fancy, great jokes, different voices, different flows. His unmistakable southern croak takes as much from Howlin&apos; Wolf as from Busta Rhymes, and the likes of &apos;A Milli&apos;, &apos;Dr Carter&apos; and &apos;Mrs Officer&apos; are hip hop classics. Add the baby face, muscular, tattooed bod, Marley-esque dreads, perpetually stoned demeanour and cash-obsessed work ethic, and you have a perfect rap icon for the times.  The perception that Lil Wayne is hip hop&apos;s anointed one is heightened by &apos;Mr Carter&apos;, one of the best tracks from the album, on which Jay-Z (real name Shawn Carter, lest we forget) guests and refers to Wayne as &apos;my heir&apos;. But to match Jay Z&apos;s achievements, Wayne has to move from popular roughneck rapper to suave transcendent icon, preferably marrying the (preferably much shorter) equivalent of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles along the way. It took Jay-Z 12 years of platinum-shifting success before he became a household name on this side of the Atlantic, courtesy of Glastonbury and Jonathan Ross. So the first steps to going global for Wayne involve selling records in Europe and seducing hip cities like Amsterdam.  So: is Lil Wayne hip hop&apos;s next superstar? Or a spliff-addled shortarse who only makes sense to &apos;da hood&apos;? Ask Bryan &apos;Baby&apos; Williams and he&apos;ll tell you, without hesitation, that Wayne can achieve &apos;more than anybody ever did, more than any hip hop artist ever did&apos;. He might be a little biased, though. Williams who, along with his brother Ronald, runs Cash Money records, the label that Lil Wayne has recorded for since day one. It was Baby who discovered Carter in 1993, when he was just 11 years old. And the two have a bond so strong that Williams simply refers to him as &apos;my son&apos;. Despite being part of the gifted child programme at his primary school, Wayne, who had an absent father, was tempted into a life of dealing drugs on his local streets. Williams&apos;s mentoring skills, along with his business sense, gave Wayne the opportunity to use that big brain for something altogether more constructive. So, when Lil Wayne travels to Amsterdam, Williams is right there with him ... along with the usual entourage of homeys and hangers-on. He turns out to be pretty mellow for a rap mogul. He&apos;s a late Eighties hip hop throwback, in his dodgy tracksuit and ludicrously large gold chain, wearing shades inside one of the city&apos;s coffee shops, switching between enormous joint and enormous cigar. &apos;I met him in about &apos;93, &apos;94,&apos; Williams recalls in a deep, gentle drawl. &apos;In front of a record store in New Orleans. When he rapped for me I gave him my card. He knew of me because New Orleans is so small. And he called me. Called me about a hundred times. So I told him to come down the studio. And he ain&apos;t never left me since.&apos; Was Wayne in need of a father figure? &apos;Where I come from, the block become your daddy. There&apos;s a lot of people get killed in New Orleans and a lot of us be raised without a daddy and end up in penitentiary or some shit. The block became my daddy. I didn&apos;t want that for anyone else. I wanted to try to help us get off the block. That was my goal because I watched my brothers and our pops go to penitentiary and get killed. You&apos;re introduced to the streets of New Orleans at a young age. Nine or ten years old. I didn&apos;t want them to take that path.&apos; Is it true that your Cash Money crew invented the term &apos;bling&apos;? &apos;No ... Wayne did. We went into the studio and he had a song called &quot;Bling Bling&quot;. We put it on the [fellow New Orleans rapper] BG album, but it was really Wayne created that.&apos;  So you were in the room when a globally recognised word was invented. How does that feel? &apos;It still hasn&apos;t hit us. But we know it&apos;s in the dictionary. I wish I&apos;d had my business together then. I woulda made a fortune off it.&apos; A couple of hours later, Lil Wayne is talking about the Rev Al Sharpton, the New York civil rights activist. &apos;The boy said something about me and the future and the kids and I&apos;m not leading &apos;em in the right direction an&apos; all that.&apos; Lil Wayne has just called Sharpton &apos;the boy&apos;. And &apos;boy&apos; is one hell of a loaded term to apply to a black man, particularly when applied to a controversial 53-year-old Baptist minister, politician - and former tour manager for James Brown. I have just asked about &apos;DontGetIt&apos;, aka &apos;Misunderstood&apos;, the 10-minute epic that closes his latest album. What begins as a 2Pac-ish hip-hop ballad mutates gradually into a non-rhyming, state-of-the-American-nation address, which mutates into a gratuitous diss of Sharpton: &apos;You see, you are no MLK. You are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody ... to me. You&apos;re just another Don King. With a perm.&apos;  Wayne was goaded into this by Sharpton&apos;s work with an organisation called Soap - Stop Offensive and Abusive Language In Hip Hop Through Personal Responsibility. One suspects that Soap will be having little effect on the morals of rappers unless they collectively suffer from a debilitating fear of bad acronyms. Nevertheless, Big Al has got Wayne&apos;s goat. &apos;I was just upset because, before you judge someone, why don&apos;t you talk to &apos;em? Don&apos;t make an opinion on me if you don&apos;t know nothin&apos; about me.&apos; The Lil Wayne I meet is polite, quietly spoken, a little stoned... the no-smoking rule in the hotel doesn&apos;t prevent the waft of dope nearly knocking you out when you walk in the room. He looks effortlessly cool: dapper checked baseball cap over his tumbling dreadlocks, shades covering somewhat bloodshot eyes. But the interview is a struggle: he&apos;s bored, distracted by the entourage, unwilling to be drawn into anything genuinely personal. I ask how important Baby Williams was to him as a young kid. &apos;How important was he? He is very important to my life and my career. But how? Just too much. Because without him I wouldn&apos;t be here. I may still be rappin&apos; but I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d be rappin&apos; about. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d have a direction. And this work ethic that I&apos;ve got - I have to owe that only to Baby and Slim because they instilled it in me. Saying, &quot;If you want that lifestyle, where you pay out whatever you want and you do whatever you want... for that lifestyle you have to work.&quot; Extra hard. So I do.&apos; Baby told me that, for young black kids in New Orleans, &apos;the block becomes your daddy&apos; ... &apos;Exactly. And it was already happening to me when I met Baby. But I think I was too smart ... and my mom would never let it happen. That&apos;s one good thing about my mom right there, &apos;cause she wouldn&apos;t have let it go down like that. You could go hang on the corner and kick it an&apos; shit. But as for always being like dem niggas? Naw. No no no. She wouldn&apos;t let that happen.&apos; Are you going to vote in the presidential elections? &apos;No, I&apos;m not registered ... I don&apos;t think I&apos;m registered. I wish I could. I don&apos;t wanna use it as an excuse or nothin&apos;.&apos; So if you were ... &apos;Barack. Yeah. I think he&apos;s a peacemaker. Which is great. Plus he&apos;s got a crazy [basketball] jumpshot, so...&apos; Were you surprised when he mentioned you on his campaign trail? &apos;Hell yeah, I was surprised. I was like, Wow! And the way he used it was, like, really cool.&apos; So you agreed with what he said about too many black kids dropping out of school because they want to be rappers and sportsmen: &apos;Maybe you are the next Lil Wayne. But probably not, in which case you need to stay in school.&apos; &apos;Exactly. And I know it&apos;s true.&apos; When Wayne hits the stage at Melkweg a few hours later to a rapturous reception, you can&apos;t help remembering that this is a kid who dropped out of school at the age of 14. It&apos;s a weird show, though. We watch from the side of the stage and would feel privileged if there weren&apos;t 60 other people crowding the space behind Wayne right along with us. If only some of the assorted lackeys, groupies and wannabes were musicians; the backing band comprises Wayne&apos;s manager putting on his client&apos;s CDs. On the plus side, the show lasts for almost 90 minutes. On the minus, every time a decent performance of a well-loved Weezy tune builds up the momentum, the music abruptly stops and Wayne starts faffing about. The pointlessly misogynist poem is followed by Wayne attempting to sing a cappella and proving only that he&apos;s virtually tone-deaf. And this is trumped by a bizarre interlude when he picks up an electric guitar and proceeds to play along so badly to one of his weaker tunes that it sounds like your five-year-old&apos;s first school concert. Admittedly, a brilliant performance of &apos;A Milli&apos; and a rousing guest spot from his mentor Williams pick things up. But bemusement reigns again at the show&apos;s close when Carter leaves the stage in a woolly bathrobe while miming to Whitney Houston&apos;s version of &apos;I Will Always Love You&apos;. The evening is a reminder of the bad old days when every hip hop show could be relied upon to disappoint. Nevertheless, Tha Carter III is a rarity... a genuinely great hip hop album that effortlessly melds hardcore with pop, aggression with humour, materialism with surrealism. Maybe great live shows will come with time. Earlier, I&apos;d asked Carter how he responds to all those who feel that his obvious verbal skills are outweighed by all the usual misanthropic hip hop imagery, and that Lil Wayne is just another bad role model, leading kids astray. His response is surprisingly measured, but all the more convincing for its quiet determination. &apos;I know there are gonna be people like that for ever. But I want them to know that I&apos;m gonna be doing this for as long as I can.&apos; \u00b7 Lil&apos; Wayne&apos;s double A-side single &apos;Mrs Officer&apos;/ &apos;Mr Carter&apos; (Universal) is released 6 October.", "sentences": ["He has finally got the crowd in this Amsterdam club bubbling ... and then he opts to kill the atmosphere stone-dead by cutting the music and mentioning poetry?", "I don&apos;t love you!&apos; Lil Wayne holds out his arms and waits for the Amsterdam massive to show him their love.", "So the first steps to going global for Wayne involve selling records in Europe and seducing hip cities like Amsterdam.", "So, when Lil Wayne travels to Amsterdam, Williams is right there with him ... along with the usual entourage of homeys and hangers-on."], "title": "Get Shorty: Lil Wayne is the biggest new star in America", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/urban2", "tags": ["Lil Wayne", "Music", "Culture", "Hip-hop"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-13T23:01:00Z", "article": "Letter of the week My partner and I are getting married at the end of September and due to organisational ineptitude we have yet to book our honeymoon (we also sent the invites late, without including the wedding date!). We want to go on safari in Africa for a week and then spend a fortnight at a wondrous beach. Any suggestions?Dr James Walters, Cardiff I&apos;d suggest Tanzania, but are you sure you want to spend two weeks on a beach? You could spend your third week trekking in the north, exploring the south, or learning to dive off Zanzibar or Pemba. If, however, you&apos;re determined to bake for 14 days, there&apos;s still time to make a booking along the lines you&apos;ve suggested. Visions of Africa (0845 675 2604; www.visionsofafrica.co.uk) suggest visiting Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro and Serengeti National Parks staying at a mixture of lodges, then moving on to luxurious La Gemma Dell&apos; Est on Nungwi Beach, Zanzibar, where there are plenty of things to do beyond the beach including visits to Stone Town. This would cost around \u00a33,950 each. Q We will be going to Sydney in October 2009 for a wedding and we are flexible about dates for travelling out and back. We have three questions. Firstly, when do schedules and prices come out for flights at that time? Secondly, are we more likely to get a cheaper price booking well in advance, or by leaving it until nearer the time? And living 30 minutes from Cardiff airport, what&apos;s the best way of arranging our travel so that we can leave and return from here, as that would be easier than travelling to Heathrow?Valerie &amp; Jeremy Sparkes, Cardiff A Airlines release seats onto the market around 11 months before date of departure so you should be looking at late November. However, you may also do well waiting until January, when many airlines release sale fares for the rest of the year and there will still be plenty of availability. After that, the choice of dates will quickly start to diminish.  Austravel (0844 412 4620; www.austravel.com) suggests that if you do want to avoid Heathrow you could fly via Birmingham with Emirates, but there is not much distance or time advantage. Closer to Cardiff, you could fly from Bristol via Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and on to Sydney with KLM, or to Paris and onward with Air France. Both options are likely to cost slightly more than making your own way to Heathrow and flying from there. Q Next Easter my husband and I are going skiing in Whistler for a week with another couple. We have booked return flights from Vancouver a week after that. We definitely want to spend about three days in Vancouver but wonder how to spend the rest of the time. Our friends are going to hire a car to visit family members, first Seattle, then Oregon, returning to Vancouver. We feel that&apos;s a bit too much travelling and thought we might just get a lift to Seattle and return by ourselves. Is Seattle worth the nightmare of US border controls twice in a few days? Or have you a better suggestion within Canada, given that we will not want to do any internal flights? Jayne Riorden, Leicester A  I took the bus from Vancouver to Seattle and vice versa a couple of years ago and found the crossing straightforward. It takes around three hours to cover the distance but going through immigration can take longer if, as happened with us, either US or Canadian authorities have a problem with one of your fellow passengers. You would have to be unfortunate for this to add on more than a couple of hours. If you are hitching a lift, you obviously won&apos;t have these problems but do bear in mind that border queues for cars can build up at busy times, particularly weekends. Seattle can&apos;t compare with Vancouver for setting, but a couple of days here is worthwhile, especially if you combine visiting the Seattle Centre and Art Museum with getting out on the water, either by kayaking on Lake Union or taking a ferry to Bainbridge Island. If you&apos;re pining for more mountains, you could visit the resorts near Seattle - Snoqualmie (www.summitatsnoqualmie.com) is only a 50-minute drive west of the city.  You needn&apos;t leave Canada, though. Why not take a whistle-stop tour of Vancouver Island? Hunt out the independent shops and cafes in the old-fashioned state capital, Victoria. You&apos;re outside the whale-watching season but seals and sea-lions can often be visited on wildlife excursions. The real story on Vancouver Island is the Pacific Rim National Park - the coastal and rainforest scenery is spectacular and hiking and kayaking is excellent. It&apos;s a four-hour drive from one of the island&apos;s main entry points from Vancouver, Nanaimo. Tofino (www.tourismtofino.com) is the most popular spot on the west coast to stay.  Q  Three years ago I purchased a property in Aracaju in north-east Brazil and used the charter flights of First Choice holidays to fly into Salvador to get me there. I have now been told that First Choice have cancelled their holidays to Salvador for next year. This leaves me with the option of scheduled flights which are about \u00a3400 more expensive. Could you please find out what the problems are? Thomson holidays have also pulled out of Natal, which leaves no package holiday company going to Brazil. Roy Bairstow, Leeds A Charter routes into Natal and Salvador were primarily aimed at winter holidaymakers. The short answer is that these flights weren&apos;t popular enough, and so were a victim of cost-cutting by the tour operators. As you probably know, First Choice merged with Thomson last summer, as did Thomas Cook with MyTravel. One result has been the operators trimming back the least profitable destinations and accommodation to maximise profits. A Thomson and First Choice spokesman confirmed that Thomson stopped flying to Brazil at the end of the Winter 2007/08 season and that First Choice will be ceasing its holidays to this destination in October 2008. They cited &apos;a lack of demand for Brazil holidays&apos;. They don&apos;t rule out reinstating holidays to Brazil in the future, but have no immediate plans to do so. \u00b7  We welcome letters.

Nicholas Penny, the director of the National Gallery, denies that they are making a concerted effort to place more and more contemporary art in the gallery, pointing to its long-running artist in residence scheme and exhibitions arising therefrom, by people such as Tom Hunter and Alison Watt. None the less, it is interesting to note that the National Gallery has not renewed a former agreement with Tate to cut off its area of interest at 1900; while the gallery is also hosting a major Picasso exhibition in February, which will show works dating from as recently as the 1950s. The fact is that all the excitement and heat these days is around contemporary art rather than Old Masters. And to an extent, you can see why an institution like the National Gallery would want to grab some of that fashionability. The danger is that it can look a bit like your middle-aged dad attempting to dance with the kids. And, while it&apos;s a valid exercise to make connections between current artistic practice and the masterpieces of the past, the National Gallery needs to avoid - as I have every confidence it will - looking apologetic about its holdings of fabulous paintings.

Today he announced the first fruits of those plans and the exhibitions we&apos;re going to see at the National over the next 12 months are as intelligent, provocative, and weighty as anyone could wish. Any fears of a continuation of the woeful blind alleys of Renaissance Siena and Italian Divisionism are completely put at rest by Penny&apos;s plan of action. He has said he&apos;s suspicious of blockbuster shows that gratuitously ferry great paintings around the world. His own borrowings look judicious and carefully thought through - and thrilling. The big shock is how thoroughly the museum will engage with modern art; the big delight is how deeply that will enrich our sense of art history. Picasso: Challenging the Past, in February, confronts the twentieth century&apos;s greatest artist (as the press release quite rightly calls him) with the Old Masters he set himself to rival. Great! After that there&apos;s an Impressionist selection - and why not? Then in the autumn a real spectacle: an exhibition that puts Spanish seventeenth century painting alongside Hispanic painted wooden sculpture will be juxtaposed with a sleazy walk-in tableau of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district by Ed and Nancy Kienholz.

The idea is to make connections with the Dutch 17th-century paintings in the gallery&apos;s collection, which, despite their appearance of gentility, are set in the brothels for which Amsterdam is famous.

Well, it depends who you are. Sarah Palin would probably warn her children. But we have Soho just down the road where you can see young ladies in leopardskin miniskirts.&quot; Modern outlook Further evidence that the National Gallery is turning its attention more firmly towards contemporary and modern art is provided by the subject of next year&apos;s blockbuster exhibition, Picasso: Challenging the Past. The show will examine Picasso&apos;s relationship with the Old Masters, forging specific links between works by the Spaniard and masterpieces in the National Gallery&apos;s collection.  It will look at Picasso&apos;s engagement with different themes in European painting: his takes on the reclining female nude, the still life, and the self-portrait. It will also look at the artist&apos;s late &quot;variations&quot; on great works such as Manet&apos;s D\u00e9jeuner sur l&apos;herbe and Vel\u00e1zquez&apos;s Las Meninas. According to Chris Riopelle, curator of post-1800 art at the gallery: &quot;The notion that modernism was a rupture from the past has been replaced by a renewed interest in how modernism involved a constant re-examination of the past.&quot; Further evidence of a growing interest in modern and contemporary art is the non-renewal of an agreement with the Tate fixing the National Gallery&apos;s chronological endpoint at 1900, although it is understood that the Tate has been keen to continue the arrangement. Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, said: &quot;The idea is not to have an agreement of that kind. We are not happy with 1900 as the final absolute endpoint of the National Gallery.&quot; Another highlight of the forthcoming season&apos;s programme is an exhibition of 17th-century Spanish painting and sculpture. Little known to audiences outside Iberia, hyper-real wooden sculpture on religious subjects was prized in early-modern Spain.

Though he could be critical of the way the country was run, his presence was somehow reassuring, so that in his company it was tempting to focus on the healthier aspects of post-apartheid South Africa. But it remains a violent place, and earlier this year he was assaulted during a carjacking outside his home. According to his family, he never fully recovered. Matshikiza was born in the Johannesburg township of Sophiatown, which was soon after demolished to make way for the white suburb of Triomf (Triumph). His father, Todd Matshikiza, wrote the music and some of the lyrics for the highly acclaimed King Kong musical, which went on to launch the careers of singer Miriam Makeba and trumpeter Hugh Masekela. He was also a founder writer for Drum, the pioneering, black-led magazine edited by Anthony Sampson, who was John&apos;s godfather. In 1961, soon after the Sharpeville massacre, the banning of the African National Congress (ANC) and other political organisations and a state crackdown on the media, Todd went on tour to Britain with King Kong, with his family following. In 1964, they went to Lusaka, Zambia, where Todd became head of broadcasting services for the newly independent country; he died in 1968. John returned to London to study at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, Swiss Cottage, and, after training with the Royal Shakespeare Company, worked for the Glasgow Citizens Theatre company.  He then combined stage acting in London with activism for the ANC: in the early 1970s he helped form Mayibuye, its cultural arm. He also lived in the US, Amsterdam and various African countries including Senegal, where he was culture director of the Gor\u00e9e Institute. In the 1980s he began to develop a reputation both as a film actor - notably in Cry Freedom (1987), Mandela (also 1987, a film for television in which he played Walter Sisulu), Leon Schuster&apos;s There&apos;s a Zulu on My Stoep (1993) and Hijack Stories (2000) - and as a lyrical poet. One of his earliest published poems, And I Watch It in Mandela (1974), was recently republished in a Nelson Mandela anthology:  It is not for the safety of silenceThat this man has opened his arms to leadThe strength of his words hangs in the air As the strength in his eyes remains on the sky; And the years of impatient waiting draw onWhile this man burns to clear the smoke in the air.There is fire here,Which no prisonCan kill in this man;And I watch it in Mandela. But his poetry went well beyond the laudatory, and achieved critical acclaim. Published works include South Where Her Feet Cool on Ice (1981) and Prophets in the Black Sky (1986). When Mandela was released in 1990, Matshikiza decided to return to the country he had not seen for 30 years. &quot;I was in London, with my mother and my daughter and my partner and we were all just bowled over by what was happening,&quot; he said afterwards. &quot;We&apos;d been waiting all of our lives for this. That is all I can say. It was the whole of my life.&quot; By 1991 he was back in Johannesburg, where he soon won several prizes for journalism - he was a columnist for the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, wrote for Business Day and The Weekender, presented a BBC radio series and contributed to several British and American publications. His occasional returns to film included Wah-Wah (2005), Richard E Grant&apos;s exploration of the pre-independence Swaziland of his youth. Matshikiza&apos;s friend Ronald Suresh Roberts described him as &quot;the gentle ex-columnist&quot;, because he tended to avoid the most pressing debates within the South African media, taking a left-field approach. In one Mail &amp; Guardian column, he wrote of the irony of South Africa becoming &quot;the great white hope of the black diaspora&quot;. He went on: &quot;People speak comprehensible English here. Telephones work. There&apos;s a black president, a largely black cabinet, black empowerment and a black economic elite which, even though they may show signs of moral confusion and fallibility, nevertheless symbolise a significant advance in the worldwide profile of the black world.&quot; His great strength as a journalist was that he was never seduced by offers of power or patronage and was never afraid to poke barbs at the new elite. Another friend, Ismail Mahomed, said: &quot;John was betrayed in many ways by our new democracy simply because he refused to fall into the comfort zone of being a &apos;returned exile&apos;. John was unafraid to speak out against a new breed of African opportunists just as much as he was unafraid to challenge old-style racists. I&apos;ll sorely miss his brilliance.&quot; Matshikiza is survived by his mother Esme, who lives in Cape Town, his ex-wife Eva Kavuma, and his two daughters Lindiwe and Fubi. \u00b7 John Matshikiza, actor, poet and journalist, born 1954; died September 15 2008", "sentences": ["He also lived in the US, Amsterdam and various African countries including Senegal, where he was culture director of the Gor\u00e9e Institute."], "title": "Obituary: John Matshikiza", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/17/southafrica.pressandpublishing", "tags": ["South Africa", "Newspapers & magazines", "Stage", "Culture", "World news", "Media", "Film", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-19T12:21:51Z", "article": "     Hooray, one of my favourite days of the year: International Park(ing) day. This glorious anti-car festival only started in 2005, when a San Francisco-based group called REBAR decided that they would take over a parking space for a day and turn it into a park. So they did.  They brought along some astroturf and a bench and a tree and fed the metre all day long and had a lovely day with people asking what they were doing and why. As one of their members explained, they re-interpreted a parking space as a potential inexpensive short-term lease, and decided that it didn&apos;t just have to be for cars: the day was a success. But it didn&apos;t stop there. People wanted to know how they could do it for themselves. REBAR explained the basic principle (don&apos;t forget to feed the meter - that&apos;s it really) and set up a website where people could post up pix. By the following year REBAR had a partner (the agreeable Trust for Public Land) and every year since then it&apos;s just got bigger and bigger, spreading all the way around the world, to Italy, Germany and Australia (in the YouTube clip above). Well, it should spread like wildfire, because it&apos;s such a genius idea. It&apos;s so simple, and yet so pleasing: it makes a very simple point (humans have as much right to this space as cars) and it makes it without nagging (as I am very nearly now doing) or whining, but just by having a laugh.

Importantly, also note that border officials have the right to refuse you entry even if your paperwork is in order. Under the terms of the Visa Waiver Programme, which allows most British travellers to enter the US without applying in advance, visitors are granted 90 days in the country. If you leave the US to visit an adjacent country (Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and Caribbean Islands) then re-enter the US, the time you were overseas counts towards your 90-day total.

A B-2 holiday visa can be valid for anything from three months to 10 years with the length of stay determined by the immigration official when you arrive. If you have firm plans in place you should secure an initial stay of six months, which may be renewable for another six.

Q My partner and I want to take our two sons (who will be 13 and 11) to France next summer. The plan is to take the Eurostar to Paris, where we will spend three days seeing the sights. We want to keep our carbon footprint as small as possible, so we would like to take another train somewhere south for a seven-night &apos;beach&apos; holiday.

First up is Arg\u00e8les-sur-Mer, near Perpignan. The beach is 2.5km from the station, but you can find a g\u00eete, holiday apartment or even camp closer to the coast. The town&apos;s tourism website (www.argeles-sur-mer.com) has links to accommodation. The town&apos;s family credentials are reinforced by the watersports, walking trails and summer festivals. Like everywhere on the coast, it gets very busy in summer, so book well ahead. Boyd also suggests Antibes for families: &apos;It has a great family atmosphere, with a touch of Riviera chic, while its 25km of coastline boasts fine sandy beaches and creeks. The historic old town, with its fishing harbour and world-famous Picasso connections, is great for the grown-ups, while the Marine Land theme park is a good family day out.&apos; The Hotel Astor (00 33 4 9293 3400, www.hotel-astor1.com) in nearby Juan-les-Pins has a studio for four people that costs \u20ac88 mid-season. For details of all TER (regional rail) services see www.ter-sncf.com.  Q I am planning a gap year which has led to some difficult flights. I need to fly from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Antananarivo in Madagascar in March 2009, though I am fairly flexible on the date. Is there any way of doing this without going to Johannesburg? I am a student and need to keep costs down.Rachel James, by email It&apos;s still difficult to fly within Africa and from Africa to the Indian Ocean islands and costs can be high if you don&apos;t buy your ticket in conjunction with an international ticket. In many cases, the easiest route is via Europe or South Africa. However, Kenya Airways has recently started flying from Nairobi to Antananarivo and has good connections from Dar Es Salaam. Africa Travel Centre (0845 450 1520; www.africatravel.co.uk) can book this flight for \u00a3552 one-way, including taxes. While this option doesn&apos;t offer a huge saving on flying via Johannesburg, the flight has other advantages. Firstly, it is faster and involves fewer hours in the air. Secondly, it requires no overnight stops, leaving Dar early in the morning with a two-hour stop in Nairobi, and arrives in Madagascar in time for lunch at the excellent Sakamanga in downtown Tana (www.sakamanga.com). Q Next month I will be spending 24 hours in LA. I arrive on a Monday lunchtime and fly out late Tuesday afternoon. I will not have a car and am not a theme park fan, so was wondering what recommendations you have? I was planning to stay in an airport hotel - the Custom hotel - as this would be the most practical distance-wise.Robert Cowie, by email  Staying at the airport is perfect for a quick getaway, but means you&apos;ll be heading to and from the airport at least twice if you&apos;re planning Monday evening and Tuesday morning excursions into town. For this reason, you may wish to limit your excursions to neighbourhoods that are closer to the airport. A short taxi ride away is Santa Monica, perfect for a first taste of LA life, an evening beachfront stroll, a trendy drink on Ocean Avenue or Third Street Promenade. Morning options include Venice Beach, great fun for browsing the hip boutiques of Abbot-Kinney Boulevard as well as the jumble of characters, street hawkers and sun-worshippers that congregate here. Even closer to LAX, Manhattan Beach is another good neighbourhood to ramble around for a few hours. Feedback In response to Lucy Metcalfe&apos;s request (Letters, 7 September) about cruising in the Arctic, we can highly recommend Naturetrek (www.naturetrek.co.uk). We flew to Spitzbergen, then boarded a small ship. There were only 48 of us. We circumnavigated the islands, landing frequently in zodiacs. There was a geologist, an ornithologist, a botanist, an historian, and leader with over 20 years experience in the Arctic. We saw polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, walrus, seal, whales and lots of birds. It was the trip of a lifetime. Anne Hames, by email You recommended (Letters, 7 September) that readers from Cardiff who wanted to go to Sydney without driving all the way up to Heathrow should fly from Bristol.

Those who described what was going on in places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau were obliged, Koestler lamented, to become &apos;Screamers&apos;. The Screamers did succeed in reaching listeners, but only momentarily. &apos;You can convince them for an hour,&apos; Koestler said, &apos;and their mental half-defence begins to work, and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned.&apos; For every brutally honest Koestler, however, there have always been others prepared to believe that humans are either basically good or susceptible to persuasion when it comes to saving the world. Frumpy, usually dressed in black, reviled by conservatives as much as she was revered by her progressive followers, Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s widow, Eleanor, was in 1948 the most famous woman in American public life. In her weekly radio shows she offered listeners an unceasing flow of upbeat liberal homilies. It was she who presented the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the General Assembly on a winter&apos;s day in 1948, in Paris. It&apos;s hard not to sense that this was a historic moment. She stresses that the document is not &apos;a statement of law and legal obligation&apos;; but that it may well become &apos;the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere&apos;. Most poignant is Eleanor&apos;s assertion that human rights are based on what she calls &apos;a spiritual fact&apos;. Man must have freedom to develop his full stature, she states, &apos;and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity&apos;. The declaration was one of a number of documents adopted by the newly created UN as part of the postwar effort to save humanity from further bloodshed. It is emphatically a document of its time, making no mention of many things that liberals would now regard as their inalienable rights - to express one&apos;s own sexuality by choosing partners of either sex in perfect freedom - and of course no mention of the death penalty and abortion. Much of the declaration reeks of the collectivist, welfarist consensus of the late 1940s. David Cameron and contemporary conservatives would find nothing to object to in its evocation of its importance of the family as the cornerstone of civilisation. Truly striking, however, are the guarantees of free speech, freedom to migrate (as crucial a right for refugees in the 1940s as it is for the world&apos;s migrants today), and the basic kit of political freedom that comprises what democrats value in the contemporary world. &apos;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&apos; (Article 19). No one could have put it better, even after all these years of attempts to implement these principles. I wonder what Eleanor would make of our world. She would be astonished by the proliferation of treaties and declarations designed to further the cause, and she would certainly be encouraged by the arrival of a new international style of public life. No non-governmental organisations (NGOs) existed in her lifetime, and we can imagine her as a member of Amnesty or Human Rights Watch. But she might be shocked to discover that the undertakings made in the wake of the mid-century catastrophe hadn&apos;t borne much fruit. The killing fields are still open, though they may be more carefully hidden and on a smaller scale. What the poet Robert Lowell called &apos;the blind swipe of the pruner and his knife&apos; still disturbs the Sabbath rest. In 1948 the Russians sent Andrei Vyshinsky, the judge who had presided over Stalin&apos;s show trials, to the UN. He declined to sign the Declaration, referring to it as &apos;just a collection of pious phrases.&apos; In post-Communist Russia, journalists are killed with impunity. It is still possible to fight wars in the name of peace or human rights - on behalf of the beleaguered South Ossetians - but no one must pretend that this is the real reason for the conflict. Perhaps hypocrisy is on the wane.  Meanwhile China has inscribed a commitment to human rights in its constitution. During the Olympics, acting under international pressure, the Chinese created a site in which its citizens might be given official permission to hold demonstrations. Two 70-year-old women wishing to protest that their flat had been torn down were given a year of &apos;re-educative labour&apos;, though the sentence was suspended pending their good behaviour. I suppose this is a step forward from the Cultural Revolution in which more than a million Chinese were beaten up, tortured and killed in what historians now see as a bout of state-sponsored anarchy. But what of the Western idea of &apos;humanitarian intervention&apos; - pioneered in Kosovo and repeated, with less conspicuous success, in Iraq. War was fought in the 1940s in order to save humanity, not to dispose of unwanted minor tyrants. Is it possible to impose democracy when the means involve violating human rights? Nothing in the traditional lexicon of human rights gives any guidance in such matters.  As the neocons tell us, parts of the world appear bent on perfecting authoritarian systems. Because of their beliefs, Islamists can have no regard for secular rights. Just as worrying is the assertion (invariably made by those who wish to dispense with them, finding expression in many deeply shocking documents churned out by the UN) that human rights belong to the West, either a rich man&apos;s toy or a legacy of imperialists.  My own worries are somewhat different. Human rights may simply be a last, ineffectual expression of Samaritanism in a post-Christian world in which suffering is commemorated but no one ever meets the victims. Trying to impose standards by means of pieces of paper which express high humanitarian aims may be what we do when we no longer have the power or the will to engage with the messiness of real politics. Put another way, human rights may merely be a way of appearing to save the world for those who don&apos;t want to try too hard to do so.  Not long ago, I attended the annual Amnesty human-rights media awards. I&apos;ve spent much of my career producing films in which atrocities are documented, but I was shocked by the procession of horrors. As one atrocious, unspeakable act after another was brought to light by means of images projected above our heads, it became hard to recall the many courageous journalists, film-makers and activists whose work was being celebrated. Articles about female foeticide were honoured, and there were films (I had indeed been involved with them) about Darfur and the dungeons of George Bush. Index on Censorship was awarded a prize for its expos\u00e9 of the murders of Russian journalists, crimes unpunished and greeted with indifference by the Russian elite. The most touching moment was the award in absentia of a prize to Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani, a Yemeni journalist jailed for &apos;insulting the President&apos;. It seemed only appropriate that the prize should be given by the BBC&apos;s Alan Johnston, fresh from his own imprisonment in Gaza.  Chardonnay is served on such occasions, and a glass was in my hand when I encountered a journalist friend from the BBC. He appeared chastened, anxious, and his thoughts mirrored mine. &apos;So much care goes into the making of these films, the writing of these articles. And people risk their lives,&apos; he said. &apos;But does anyone actually watch them? Does anyone care?&apos;  For the past months, I&apos;ve tried to answer this question, navigating my way around activists and theorists. I&apos;ve found many eloquent defenders of human rights. But I notice, too, an impatience with the subject among those whom I interview. &apos;Yes we know that rights are important,&apos; they wish to say, &apos;but do we always have to talk about them in a hand-wringing way? Can&apos;t we find better news about rights?&apos; And I notice, too, a weary anger when it becomes apparent to both of us that, alas, the news will never be very good. Still, human rights can be exciting. Sir Geoffrey Nice, the man who spent four years of his life trying Slobodan Milosevic, carries the trial around on his laptop. Here is another intelligent human being with whom I can jointly define the nature of contemporary atrocity. But I meet optimists, too. The lawyer and author Geoffrey Robertson speaks out against obscurantists in his book Crimes Against Humanity with the eloquence and gusto of a north London Voltaire. &apos;There is much more awareness of human rights and we have made a start in enforcing them,&apos; he tells me. In between visits to the Hague, where he&apos;s selecting judges for the UN tribunal, he outlines his pet project - a Convention Against Tyranny capable of giving legal justification in order to overthrow evildoers.  &apos;At present it would be confined to situations where genocide or widespread murder and torture are being inflicted by state agencies,&apos; he says. &apos;But there are other forms of barbarism: the Taliban&apos;s denial of education to women and girls and execution of homosexuals. Mugabe&apos;s destruction of democracy and use of starvation and thuggery as political weapons. That is for the future.&apos; If not beady-eyed, the redoubtable Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty, turns out to be nearly as positive. &apos;You have to think of the Europe of 1938,&apos; she says. &apos;The biggest European country was ruled by a government that persecuted minorities, arranging &quot;disappearances&quot;. That would be unthinkable now.&apos; Khan points to all the treaties signed in the past 60 years. &apos;We don&apos;t need any more declarations about rights,&apos; she says. &apos;The problem is implementation.&apos; She describes to me a world in which a civil society involving millions globally is campaigning on behalf of rights only to find themselves frustrated by politicians. I tell her that I am only partly convinced by this. Politicians are conservative people, but there must be a reason why they are so reluctant to make a stand.  We are all agreed, however, when it comes to evoking the damage wrought to the cause of human rights by the so-called war against terror. In the name of national security, America, viewed in 1945 as the sole beacon of a world in darkness, has attempted to re-establish torture as a legitimate method of interrogation, practising it on a substantial scale. Dozens of books chronicle the ineptitude with which the Bush administration stumbled into Iraq. The best is Jane Mayer&apos;s The Dark Side, a bestseller in the US. It has yet to find a publisher here. Dip into any chapter and you will find out about &apos;interrogation&apos; in the new century: &apos;11:15: Told detainee dog is held in higher esteem... Began to teach detainee lessons such as stay, come and bark... 13:00: Dog tricks continue... Interrogator showed photos of 9-11 victims and told him he should bark happy for these people. Interrogator showed photos of al-Qaeda terrorist and told detainee he should growl at these people. A towel was placed on detainee&apos;s head like a burka, and interrogator proceeded to give detainee dance lessons.&apos;  The most convincing explanation for the Bush debacle comes from a former top Bush administration lawyer who Mayer quotes. The lawyer, Philip Zelikow, tells her, &apos;Fear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.&apos; Americans were ready to go along with torture as long as it was called something else. So the lawyers who betrayed America were responding to something more than a public mood. But can we really suppose that these emotions are uniquely American, and that any country, confronted with what is perceived as a threat to its security, won&apos;t go the same way? Why should the dark side not prove a common destination in the new century? &apos;American ideals are undercut by torture. It makes nonsense of our constitutional protections and our claims that all humans have inalienable rights under the law,&apos; Mayer says. &apos;It hurts the rest of the world, too - because when America forsakes its role as a defender of human rights, it gives licence to tyrannies everywhere.&apos; British governments, too, have been swayed by fear and anxiety. As junior allies we&apos;re complicit in what the law lord Johan Steyn called &apos;the legal black hole of Guant\u00e1namo.&apos; As Conor Gearty, professor of law at the London School of Economics, points out, Anglo-American linkage of human rights and the war against terror has tried to turn them &apos;into a basis for selective aggression abroad and an alibi for brutality at home&apos;. Another optimist (and international lawyer), Philippe Sands, urges me to take a long view of human rights. He says that rights are the only riposte to the notion, enshrined in European law for centuries, that the state and its representatives have unlimited powers. We should not expect that doctrines adhered to for so long can be overthrown in a year or a decade. Sands was involved in the Pinochet case. He sees the detention of the Chilean dictator as the moment when it was established that for &apos;crimes against humanity&apos; there should be no frontiers. The law lords did decide that the dictator had a case to answer - not in the country in which the crimes were committed, but where the prosecution was initiated. Home Secretary Jack Straw did return Pinochet to Chile, but the decision was made on health grounds. And yet superpowers do still act to protect themselves, invoking sovereignty. America posed throughout the Cold War as the world&apos;s defender of freedoms - but things were different when US citizens might conceivably find themselves prosecuted under international law. Like the Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Genocide was signed in 1948, after a long, single-handed campaign by Rafael Lemkin, a Polish refugee settled in New York. However, the US Senate declined to ratify the document. Each day the Senate was in session, for 19 years, Senator William Proxmire got to his feet and made a four-minute speech condemning genocide. But it took the charm of Ronald Reagan (and presumably the death of most of the remaining concentration-camp guards in exile somewhere in America) to persuade senators to overcome their objections. As Samantha Power shows in her history of genocide, A Problem from Hell, America proved to be reluctant when it came to preventing genocide. Invariably, it was decided that vital interests were not at stake in the poor, remote countries where killings took place. Officials could then say that it was too late to do anything. Afterwards came the moment to say that it should never happen again. This is what happened in Bosnia, and, most horrifyingly, in Rwanda. With Obama or McCain President, the camps in Guant\u00e1namo will finally be emptied and closed down. But can we expect to see American troops freely used to prevent genocide in places like Darfur? I somehow don&apos;t think so. The most important NGO active in human rights remains Amnesty International. It was launched in the pages of this newspaper in 1961 by a London lawyer and a group of fellow liberals. &apos;The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence,&apos; Peter Benenson began. Amnesty would seek to adopt individual &apos;prisoners of conscience&apos;, writing letters to the governments which had incarcerated them or encouraging others to do so.  Amnesty&apos;s aims were carefully limited, and the prisoners adopted came from the West as well as the Communist bloc and the developing world. (Those who advocated violence were not selected, and Amnesty felt ambivalent about Nelson Mandela, first adopting and then rejecting him when he was found guilty of sabotage, although they did acknowledge that people like him might &apos;feel or find themselves forced into a position in which the only road to freedom is violence...&apos;). Soon letters poured in from a new breed of human-rights activist. Numberless teenagers (myself included) formed Amnesty cells at school. The approach of carefully selecting prisoners, restricting Amnesty&apos;s aims, appeared satisfactory. But times changed, and during the 1970s it became possible for Western governments to raise human-rights questions with their Soviet bloc counterparts. In consequence human rights were no longer the sole property of NGOs. As the scope of campaigning increased, those who practised it became more aggressive. In danger of being overtaken by its rivals, Amnesty did move with the times. But it was not until 2003, under Khan&apos;s stewardship, that its charter was substantially revised. Amnesty now runs campaigns in relation to the fullest range of &apos;economic and social rights&apos;. Khan is proud of the recent Stop Violence Against Women in which rape, honour killings, domestic violence and clitoridectomy were targeted. Traditionalists criticised the changes, suggesting that this would make Amnesty indistinguishable from other liberal NGOs. They were upset by the professionalisation of what appeared to be an institution set in its ways. Spread over many floors and located to the east of the city in Shoreditch, as clean-lined as a newly completed city academy, the new Amnesty headquarters is a daunting place, with activists beavering away on each floor. It&apos;s hard not to be impressed by so much seriousness. But I find myself surprised, too, by the jolliness of so many working there. Can they really spend each day trying to nudge the immobile Home Office into treating asylum seekers just a little better? Can they remain motivated over the long slog required to get the UN to create some sort of document aimed at limiting the social ravages caused globally by the arms trade? It would appear that somehow they do, though I realise that I would find such diligence testing.  However, it&apos;s hard here to evade the central contradiction of Amnesty, which is that of the human-rights movement itself. Amnesty still exists by placing in the public eye what, in perfect earnestness, it aims to put an end to. As an institution Amnesty is dedicated to unceasing, endless struggle. I ask a researcher whether the work doesn&apos;t get to her. &apos;Sometimes it does,&apos; says simply. &apos;But there are compensations.&apos; I can find an echo of such feelings in my own experience. My way into the human-rights maze came via a trap door labelled Srebrenica. A Cry From the Grave is a film which gives an exhaustive, minute-by-minute account of the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995. The director, Leslie Woodhead, says, &apos;Like the crimes committed, it won&apos;t go away. You can see a version of it now in the town&apos;s museum, where the massacre is commemorated.&apos;  Geoffrey Nice was the prosecutor in the four-year trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague, and I ask him what he now thinks of the experience. Did he feel cheated when Milosevic died before the proceedings were completed? Lanky, hyperarticulate, Nice is frank and uncomplicated when it comes to admitting that the system is far from perfect. &apos;It would have been good to secure a conviction, and obviously I wanted one,&apos; he says. &apos;But the record stands. Anyone who wants to re-establish the reputation of Milosevic will have to contend with what we found out.&apos; But Nice proves to have complex views about prosecuting war criminals. He senses that it is time to abandon the all-out model of Nuremberg, in which a verdict is also a political statement of sorts. We should come to regard international courts as normal, uncontroversial. If it isn&apos;t always possible to secure convictions (or indeed to try people, because political considerations make that impossible), maybe we shouldn&apos;t worry too much. Only a few years ago Henry Kissinger was shocked when he was presented, via the manager of the Ritz Hotel in Paris, with a legal document asking for his help in sorting out aspects of the Pinochet-era killings in Chile. Unsuccessful attempts have been made in a German court to indict Donald Rumsfeld. I don&apos;t think Rumsfeld, or indeed George W Bush, have anything to worry about, even if they do take their holidays in Europe. But in The Hague a few weeks ago, you could choose to see a freshly shaved, suited ex-New Age guru and former Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska Radovan Karadzic appear in court, declining to enter a plea, or watch Charles Taylor, the ex-President of Liberia, fumble with his papers as he watched another witness give an account of his role in the horrifying 10-year civil war. The courtrooms are heavily protected with giant, aquarium-like windows. They&apos;re unpicturesquely located in buildings that resemble the headquarters of waste-disposal companies. However, in their anonymity, they are deeply moving places, expressing a determination that impunity should be punished. Many years in the creation, the new International Criminal Court (ICC) was backed by Clinton and melodramatically &apos;unsigned&apos; by George Bush. Bizarre regulations restrict those who can be tried there to citizens of signatory countries, or cases approved by the UN Security Council. (This means that no Russian, Chinese or American war criminal will ever be brought before the court; indeed the court has been criticised for targeting exclusively offenders from Africa, thus appearing the instrument of neo-imperialism.) But Nice hopes that the US may one day change its mind. &apos;The real problem with international law is how hard it is to keep independent of politics,&apos; he says. &apos;Imagine you are running the court, choosing which cases to prosecute. There are war crimes committed everywhere. How do you know which ones to choose? It doesn&apos;t mean that you mustn&apos;t choose, but it&apos;s difficult.&apos; In Albert Camus&apos;s short, stinging monologue The Fall (1956), Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a seedy, drunk lawyer, buttonholes a reluctant listener in an Amsterdam bar. On first reading, the book appears to be a perfect-pitch rendering of the worst, smarmiest French intellectual, a man whom vanity impelled towards the humanitarian racket and for whom not believing has become synonymous with honesty. &apos;It is so late,&apos; Camus&apos;s cynic tells his interlocutor as he strives to avoid falling into a canal. &apos;One is always too late.&apos; Latterly, however, I&apos;ve begun to appreciate the text in a different fashion. Depressed when he wrote The Fall, Camus began to ask himself a simple question. What would happen to us all if, while, pretending that the lives of others mattered, we ceased to act as if they did? The answer is that we would, like Camus&apos;s ex-judge, no longer think of ourselves as human beings.  Inevitably the human-rights narrative comes readily peopled with good victims and evil perpetrators. It abounds in worthy clich\u00e9s. My own plea is that in films or articles, human rights politics should be depicted like anything else - not in black and white, as slogans or in pop lyrics, but with the right component of muted, real-life greys. Think of the unassuming, wholly remarkable Canadian Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who commanded the ill-fated UN force in Rwanda and refused to leave the country. Years later he was found drunk and weeping on a park bench. It appears that Dallaire never recovered from his experiences in Rwanda, though he was always ready to say that his own sufferings were nothing beside the ones he had witnessed. But Dallaire&apos;s sense of guilt and complicity proved embarrassing to the media covering his story. For reasons that were never discussed, he never seemed an appropriate protagonist. I also feel that human-rights activists should no longer be sniffy about what Irene Khan calls &apos;principled pragmatism&apos;. This was the message of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a student of Camus and existentialist philosophy, and the most effective, most dedicated fighter for rights in our time. Brazilian, the son of a diplomat, Sergio began his UN career with a belief that laws and resolutions alone would stop the killing. Speedily disabused, despising the ponderous UN bureaucracy in which he needed to survive, he went to the opposite extreme of seeking to conciliate killers, in the forlorn hope of getting them to behave better. However, it would seem that Sergio&apos;s view of the world, too, was altered by Srebrenica. Appointed to the despised, underfunded post of UN Commissioner for Human Rights, he began to read feverishly.  He began to see that human rights, far from being an optional extra, to be discarded when they weren&apos;t useful, were essential. They were the new global &apos;rule of law&apos;. Abstractions such as peace and security made sense only if states treated their citizens properly - and were prepared to extend such rights to the citizens of other states. But he also thought that human-rights culture had wrongly neglected the notion of dignity. Freedoms meant nothing if people could have no sense of their own worth. And maybe flawed states with a minimum of democratic practices but some legal rights were better than the pseudo-democracies magicked into existence by an overeager West in the post-communist perception that history had ended. In East Timor, where he ran the UN mission, he was able to put these views into practice, with success. Sergio refused to criticise the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Alone among humanitarians, he was able to meet with George Bush and criticise the American treatment of detainees. He went to Baghdad in the certain expectation that his UN mission would prove to be a failure. On 19 August 2003 he died after a car bomb exploded, turning the UN headquarters into rubble. Charismatic, sexually attractive, Sergio enjoyed life and had no taste for martyrdom - he was just doing what had to be done. He died, as his biographer Samantha Power says, &apos;buried beneath the weight of the UN itself&apos;.  Sergio&apos;s last words, spoken to a rescuer eager to give him spiritual comfort, were: &apos;Fuck God, just get me out of here.&apos; Human rights are indeed a matter of life and death. I can&apos;t think of a better slogan for our times than Sergio&apos;s. \u00b7  To read an edited version of the 1961 Observer article by Peter Benenson that launched Amnesty, go to tinyurl.com/52o6eu The United Nations&apos; Universal Declaration of Human Rights This is an edited version of the rights enshrined in the 1948 declaration&apos;s 30 Articles All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Human rights in writing: Nick Fraser recommends Fran\u00e7ois Bizot, The Gate 2003 The author was studying rural Buddhism in Cambodia when he was captured and interrogated by the Khmer Rouge in 1971. His account of being imprisoned and the 1975 fall of Pnomh Penh (where he manned the gate of the French compound) is among the great pieces of writing of our time.  Orlando Figes, The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin&apos;s Russia 2007 With the help of oral testimony, beautifully researched, Figes uncovers the scale of damage wrought on Russian families by Stalin&apos;s rural collectivisation and the Thirties purges. Masterly popular history. Jane Mayer, The Dark Side 2008 Indispensable work chronicling the Bush administration&apos;s abuse of human rights. Mayer gives the detail of rendition and waterboarding, but her explanation of the legal betrayals that led to these abuses is brilliant. Only published in America. Primo Levi, If This Is A Man 1947 An early, perhaps never equalled account of the multiple atrocities which made up what we now call the Holocaust. The writing is accurate, the tone always modest and understated. Levi is a truly great writer who proves that nothing need be unmentionable.

Yesterday the wake-up call arrived. The 50-year-old Dutchman was confirmed as the replacement for Dave Collins, the national performance director who, along with his job title, was dismissed after Britain&apos;s track and field team won only four medals at the Olympics in Beijing last month. Having received lottery funding of \u00a326.5m since 2004 Britain&apos;s athletes failed to meet their target of five. UK Athletics has changed its stance and is now concentrating on developing coaching. By bringing back Van Commenee - UKA&apos;s multi-events director before leaving for the Netherlands - the governing body has re-employed a man with a reputation for ruthlessness. In 2004, he told Sotherton she was a wimp for not winning silver in the heptathlon at the Olympics in Athens moments after taking bronze. She burst into tears. Yesterday he said he regretted it - not that he called her a wimp, rather the timing of it. Van Commenee is leaving a position with the Dutch Olympic Association - he was chef de mission in Beijing - to spearhead UK Athletics on the path to London in less than four years&apos; time. &quot;I will speak to the coach one-on-one, I will speak to the athlete one-on-one and I will speak to both at the same time,&quot; he said. &quot;I have always done that. Sometimes you need a one-on-one with athletes to talk about the coach and vice versa. Not every coach appreciates it but I think it is fair as long as we are open. I have done that for many years and you cannot please everybody. Not everybody will be happy but that is what you are paid for.&quot; On a four-year deal, worth around \u00a31m, Van Commenee will take up his new position in February. In the meantime he will monitor the start of the process towards the 2012 Games. UKA is restructuring its whole coaching set-up, with Van Commenee at the helm of a system that the sport wants to go beyond the London Games. But it was the lure of the Games being held in the capital that played a major part in him taking up the position. His home track in south Amsterdam is where Fanny Blankers-Koen trained before winning four gold medals the last time London hosted the Olympics in 1948. &quot;She is a very famous person in my country,&quot; said Van Commenee. &quot;We see the black and white pictures of those Olympics many times each year on television and me being a product of the same athletics family at the same track, it feels like a special bond is there with London.&quot; Van Commenee was favourite for the performance director&apos;s position in 2004 but a man with a maverick, blunt style, was not appointed by Dave Moorcroft, the federation&apos;s chief executive. &quot;Dave Moorcroft is a 5000 metres runner and I needed to sprint,&quot; said Van Commenee, diplomatically, yesterday. But the new regime at UKA targeted him as its No1 choice because he delivers. In 2000 he coached Denise Lewis to Olympic heptathlon gold in Sydney yet he is equally remembered for the incident with Sotherton four years later having coached her in the 18 months before those Games. &quot;For some reason I have the image here of having being the most miserable person that you can walk into,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t actually mind. Let&apos;s count medals in the end and whatever attitude is required for that, that is what it takes. &quot;In hindsight, I should not have [called Sotherton a wimp] because it did not add anything at the time. I should have told her probably a month later because she did not have a second run the day after. But that was the way we worked together. Had she had finished fourth and that had been her potential I would have walked off as a happy man. But she should have won silver. It is about getting the best out of athletes and there is no time to waste. The word is bullshitting and I don&apos;t do that.&quot; But he is a man of many tricks. &quot;I would like to think I am reasonable and fair. I am always clear and some people perceive that as rude. Sometimes it&apos;s toughness, sometimes it&apos;s encouragement, sometimes it&apos;s being positive. I have to play 20 cards and toughness is only one of them.&quot; New man&apos;s challenges Attitude There will be no excuses for athletes who fail at major championships when their whole season should be geared around such events Peaking Christine Ohuruogu, the Olympic, world and Commonwealth 400m champion, sets the standard here and other must start to follow Central bases This has worked well for the cyclists in Manchester - they won eight golds in Beijing - and may be the future for track and field athletes London 2012 The majority of the current team are determined to be around with the Games on home soil, but that could prevent new blood emerging", "sentences": ["His home track in south Amsterdam is where Fanny Blankers-Koen trained before winning four gold medals the last time London hosted the Olympics in 1948."], "title": "Ruthless approach will bring medals, says the new head coach of UK Athletics, Charles Van Commenee", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/24/olympics2012.kellysotherton", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Kelly Sotherton", "Athletics", "Sport", "Charles van Commenee"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-25T19:45:00Z", "article": "Hip-hop star Busta Rhymes was denied entry to the UK on his way to a charity concert today because of his criminal convictions in the US.

But authorities at border crossings across the country were told on September 20 to watch out for 21-year-old Eric Breininger, from Saarland, and two accomplices. The three are believed to be on their way back to Germany from Pakistan. They were last seen in the Bosnian town of Zenica just over a week ago. Breininger is known to have links to a suspected Islamist terror cell known as the Sauerland group, which planned car bomb attacks in Germany last year. If successful they would have been worse than the Madrid train bombings. Police arrested the alleged ringleader, Daniel Schneider, and other members on September 2 last year. Breininger, who police say considers Schneider as &quot;an older brother&quot;, left Germany suddenly two days before the arrests. He went to Pakistan via Egypt and joined the Islamic Jihad Union in the Pakistani mountains, where he was trained in terrorist techniques. In May, a video showing Breininger brandishing a Kalashnikov and declaring his willingness to die for Allah appeared on the Internet, prompting police to say he was &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and &quot;willing to carry out a suicide attack&quot;. Germany&apos;s federal criminal police agency, the BKA, has warned that the presence of around 3,000 German soldiers in Afghanistan has increased the risk of terrorist attacks on German soil. Germany is beginning to come to terms with the phrase &quot;home-grown terrorist&quot;, having escaped a bomb attack that was planned on two trains from Cologne by two Islamist militants in 2006. The bombs failed to explode. On Tuesday, suspected Islamist militants were arrested for threatening to kill two police whom they lured into a side street in Cologne in an attempt to steal their guns. Security experts have warned that attacks on &quot;soft targets&quot; in Germany are likely. &quot;Since 2006 young Germans have been increasingly bombarded with al-Qaida propaganda and it&apos;s clear that terror cells are operating in Germany,&quot; Guido Steinberg, a terrorist expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, told the German news channel N24. &quot;We&apos;ve seen similar attacks planned in Germany to those that have taken place in London and Madrid, on soft targets such as trains and buses. We have to expect similar attacks here.&quot;", "sentences": ["The plane took off an hour late and landed safely at Schipol airport in Amsterdam."], "title": "Terror suspects arrested at Cologne airport", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/germany.terrorism1", "tags": ["Germany", "Al-Qaida", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-26T17:45:33Z", "article": "A judge ruled today that the hip-hop star Busta Rhymes could remain in the UK to perform at a charity concert, hours before he was due on stage.  Rhymes was within an hour of being deported yesterday because of criminal convictions in the US, before lawyers obtained an injunction preventing his removal. After being held at London City airport for 11 hours, he was released on bail pending today&apos;s hearing.  Mr Justice Stadlen, sitting at London&apos;s high court, continued the injunction preventing Rhymes&apos; removal from the UK. He emphasised the extraordinary nature of the case, stressing that he was acting so as not to disappoint thousands of fans on their way to the gig at the time the judgment was being handed down. The injunction gives Rhymes the opportunity to challenge the decision by immigration authorities to deny his entry and paved the way for him to perform at tonight&apos;s Orange RockCorps gig at the Royal Albert Hall - a free concert for 5,000 charity volunteers which he is headlining. The gig starts at 7pm. Rhymes, whose real name is Trevor Smith Jr, was kept in a small room with five armed police officers after being stopped by immigration officials when he arrived at the airport at 7.26am yesterday. The UK authorities wanted to fly him back to Amsterdam two hours later, citing &quot;unresolved convictions&quot; in America, but at 8.58am his legal team secured an injunction preventing him from getting on the flight. In March, Smith, 36, was given three years&apos; probation in New York for assaulting his former driver and a fan who had allegedly spat on his car, in separate incidents. He was ordered to do 10 days&apos; community service, pay a $1,250 (\u00a3675) fine plus costs and enrol in an anti-drink-driving programme. The judge at Manhattan criminal court warned Smith, whose hits include Woo Hah! Got You All in Check, Fire it Up and Everything Remains Raw: &quot;If you mess up, you&apos;re going to jail. I&apos;ve given you a chance.&quot; In the wake of Smith&apos;s detention, Orange RockCorps said Ludacris, a fellow American hip-hop star and a friend of Rhymes, was added to the bill to perform alongside the Automatic, Guillemots, Lethal Bizzle, John Legend and Feeder in front of concert-goers who had earned their tickets by volunteering for four hours at community charity projects over the summer.

Farshi Gillardian, from Hendon in north London, was detained by Scotland Yard officers last week after being accused by the US authorities of attempting to supply weapons components illegally to Iran. The other two British businessmen remain at large after allegedly supplying batteries for surface-to-air missiles and military aircraft parts to Tehran. Christopher Tappin vanished after leaving his Surrey freight company, while 77-year-old Brian Woodford, from Dorset, has fled to the Far East. Gillardian, 39, is named in US court documents as being involved in a clandestine international network accused of supplying electronic parts for roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan and of helping Tehran to acquire weapons of mass destruction. He faces an extradition hearing tomorrow at Westminster magistrates&apos; court over claims that he tried to circumvent US trade sanctions with Iran, which is listed by US authorities as a state sponsor of terrorism and is subject to United Nations sanctions over its alleged nuclear weapons programme.  Emails held by the FBI indicate that Gillardian was in contact with a number of alleged co-conspirators in the US and Iran who are also being investigated by the American authorities.  Investigators believe the network traded in electronic parts identified in sophisticated roadside devices that have targeted coalition forces, including British troops, in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FBI is also embroiled in attempts to apprehend Tappin and Woodford, whom it accuses of separately helping Tehran by smuggling military hardware. Tappin is accused of attempting to acquire batteries that power surface-to-air missiles, which he then intended to export to Iran. A former director of a Surrey-based freight firm, Tappin sourced the batteries from an American firm before arranging to send them via the UK or the Netherlands to a Tehran-based company, according to an affidavit filed by undercover federal agents in a US district court. It reveals that the batteries were designed to power the Hawk missile system and that they require government approval for export. The document describes the batteries as &apos;significant military equipment&apos;.  The deal is said to have been organised by Tappin last year from the offices of Brooklands International Freight Services, which is based in the Surrey village of South Nutfield. Tappin was a director of the company. Material from Tappin&apos;s computer files suggested that he may have made a number of previous shipments to Iran using a freight company in Amsterdam. Another worldwide investigation continues into a British pensioner accused by the US Justice Department of attempting to supply Tehran with large quantities of military aircraft components. Brian Woodford, who owns a 17th-century manor house and 100-acre estate in Dorset, remains on the run after being accused of illegally exporting millions of pounds worth of US military and civilian aircraft parts to Iran. The Observer has learnt that Woodford is in hiding in Singapore, where he is described as &apos;happy and healthy&apos;. Family members say he is prepared to hide there indefinitely, having been told by lawyers that US authorities cannot extradite him as long as he commits no offence. Woodford, whose property portfolio includes Chalmington Manor, near Dorchester, has been charged in his absence. He has not seen his 63-year-old wife, Laura, for six months since she was arrested in March on her arrival at San Francisco on a flight from Hong Kong. His wife was carrying two catalogues from a Chinese company described by the American prosecutors as a distributor of &apos;weapons of mass destruction&apos;.  The catalogues included details of surface-to-air missile systems and rocket launchers.

In one of David Cameron&apos;s boldest moves on the environment, the party will today unveil plans to cut 66,000 flights a year from Heathrow by tempting passengers on to the first new rail line north of London in more than a century. Theresa Villiers, the shadow transport secretary, told the Guardian last night: &quot;This is a seriously green decision. A few years ago it would have been inconceivable for the leader of the Conservative party to say no to a third runway and putting the brakes on Heathrow expansion.&quot; The announcement, on the second day of the party&apos;s conference in Birmingham, is designed to show that the party has not abandoned its &quot;Vote Blue, Go Green&quot; agenda in the face of the economic downturn. Gordon Brown has warned that some Tory green plans would jeopardise economic development, but Cameron hopes to blunt any Labour attack by outlining detailed plans to tempt airline passengers on to the railways. Villiers will announce that a Tory government would spend \u00a315.6bn between 2015 and 2027 (\u00a31.3bn a year for 12 years) to build the new high speed rail link from London St Pancras to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. A further \u00a34.4bn would be paid by the private sector. The line would be completely new and would allow the existing West Coast main line to be used for commuter journeys between smaller towns, such as Macclesfield, Stafford and Milton Keynes, and the big cities. There would also be a high speed line linking St Pancras with Heathrow. Journey times on the 180mph line would be slashed: London to Birmingham would take 45 minutes instead of 80; London to Manchester 80 minutes instead of 125, London to Leeds 97 minutes instead of 125 and Manchester to Leeds 17 minutes instead of the current 55. The Tories say the new rail link would cut flights from Heathrow by 66,430 a year - 44% of the capacity of the planned third runway. There are currently 36 flights a day between Heathrow and Manchester. The Tories hope to cut flights to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels as passengers are encouraged to use the new high speed rail line which would link up with the Eurostar service at St Pancras. Greenpeace last night welcomed the announcement.

As I sat at the Emmy awards last Sunday in Los Angeles I hoped, somewhere, that John Adams was smiling. He&apos;d won best actor while those three great men were competing only for the best supporting role. And he would appreciate the irony: an English filmmaker directed his story. Yet, when I arrived at the Emmys two years ago, I had not forgotten John Adams. I didn&apos;t know about him. I stepped off the plane to find HBO asking me to direct all seven episodes of John Adams. Nine hours, $100m (\u00a354m). I talked to the writer Joan Didion (Year of Magical Thinking). We were working on a script together set to go into production. Why should I switch? &quot;John Adams,&quot; said Joan, &quot;is tabula rasa for the American people.&quot; The American Revolution, it turned out, was neglected treasure in terms of popular history and screen storytelling. People tend to date their engagement in American history back to when their families first arrived. As Gore Vidal puts it: &quot;The United States of Amnesia&quot;.  Even during his own lifetime John Adams felt that the process of forgetting had begun. David McCullough, in his Pulitzer-winning biography on which the HBO mini-series is based, quotes Adams late in life mourning that &quot;the true history of the American Revolution is lost ... forever&quot;. This idea of a lost version began to take hold and fascinate me. When I met Tom Hanks - producer of the mini-series - Tom was fired up with the excitement of discovering this hidden history. At school he remembers being taught about the &quot;outrage&quot; of the Boston Massacre (episode 1), when British soldiers occupying the city opened fire unprovoked on a peaceful crowd.  It would have &quot;blown his tiny little mind&quot;, he said, to know that a Boston lawyer defended the British soldiers, that the court found them not guilty, and that the man was Adams, who became the second president of the United States. We were intrigued by the idea that England in John Adams was a near equivalent to superpower America today. The British were an occupying military force in Boston, hated by many of the locals. In turn, the local &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; were distrusted as insurrectionists by the English. McCullough explained deeper layers: Adams joins the revolutionary war fighting not for independence but for his rights as a &quot;natural born Englishman&quot; - he doesn&apos;t want to be a second-class English citizen. As an English director, I was intrigued to discover that I was tracking the birth of American identity from its English base. John Adams is so fascinating for an English audience because it is the first chapter of our special relationship with the US.  It is also an epic of ideas, showing through Adams and Jefferson the two themes of American government. Adams, politicised in Boston, a town of violent unrest, sees what the mob is capable of and is distrustful of human beings - they are &quot;weak, evil, and vicious&quot;. This leads him to believe in strong government, strong laws, a strong executive. Jefferson, growing up in aristocratic isolation in Virginia, is optimistic about the perfectibility of man and believes in giving power back to the people. These themes of less versus more government, states versus federal power, remain central fault lines in American politics - debate about government intervention in the credit crunch being the latest example.  John Adams moves from the east coast of America to pre-revolutionary France to bankers in Amsterdam to the court of George III in London to the newly built White House in Washington. As I directed the wonderful cast through seven epic episodes - John and Abigail Adams, played by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney, the English actors Tom Wilkinson, Stephen Dillane, Rufus Sewell, Tom Hollander - it was fascinating to see how the revolution was driven by a group of exceptional individuals who were an elite if ever there was one, a group of radical, highly articulate Enlightenment intellectuals. Now the American mainstream uses elite as a dirty word, and can distrust &quot;intellectual&quot; leadership. At the same time, the series shows how there was no golden age in American presidential politics. Adams was profoundly anti-slavery, but the slave issue was not resolved. Many historians consider the 1800 election, when Jefferson fought and beat Adams, to be one of the dirtiest in American history.  John Adams won 13 Emmys, the highest for a programme in one year.  \u00b7 Independence, episode 2 of John Adams, is on More4 on Saturday at 5.30pm.", "sentences": ["John Adams moves from the east coast of America to pre-revolutionary France to bankers in Amsterdam to the court of George III in London to the newly built White House in Washington."], "title": "Television, Tom Hooper: Somewhere, John Adams is smiling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/29/john.adams.emmy.award.television", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media", "Emmys"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-09-29T23:01:00Z", "article": "The planners and politicians have got it wrong.

Rail tickets are either extortionate or highly restrictive, and luggage space is often minimal. And journeys from most destinations involve multiple changes, often on to crowded tubes or traffic-prone coach services. This is impractical for those with heavy luggage or children in tow.  Heathrow planners should follow the lead of Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris and provide direct, reasonably priced rail services from the airport to every major city in Britain. All that is needed is a direct rail link to Reading, and on to the north and west.

A similar rail link from the east coast ports to the rail-freight terminal at Corby, using the same sort of trains that run through the Channel tunnel, would cut carbon emissions from the lorries that use the congested A14.

About a third of our passenger train operating companies and the largest freight train operating company are now wholly or partly owned by the governments of Germany, France and Netherlands.

Further, these flights make up less than 3% of Heathrow&apos;s total flights - nowhere near the 66,000 claimed. &quot;The Tories hope to cut flights to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, as passengers are encouraged to use the new high-speed rail line which would link up with the Eurostar service at St Pancras,&quot; you report. But a high-speed rail network already exists to destinations in Europe, and passengers still choose to fly. It is not realistic to expect that a new rail link between Heathrow and St Pancras will result in 52,000 flights being cancelled - the only way to achieve this would be to ban flights to western Europe. However, the critical point in this debate is that the choice between rail and air is a false one: the country needs both. Heathrow is full today and, with airline slots at Heathrow trading at up to \u00a330m each, it is clear that any limited surplus capacity created by rail would be quickly absorbed. High-speed rail would, though, undoubtedly complement a third runway at Heathrow, and help create a world-class transport hub of which Britain could be proud.  Overseas, our competitors are investing in airports and rail. France, a long-time leader in European high-speed rail, has a hub airport at Paris with twice as many runways as Heathrow. Spain, which has just opened a new high-speed rail line between Barcelona and Madrid, has also doubled to four the number of runways at Madrid airport. I&apos;m all for the &quot;first new rail line north of London in more than a century&quot;, but we should also get on and build the first new full-length runways in the south east since the second world war - first at Stansted and then at Heathrow. Rail is never going to serve the long-haul destinations that Heathrow can - and even for short-haul routes, rail will always be more limited than in continental Europe because we are an island nation. Moreover, it is not the nature of our links between Manchester and London that will determine our future economic success, but our connections with the world&apos;s emerging economies in India and China. All major infrastructure decisions are difficult, and they impact on local communities and the environment. There are no simple solutions; however, the decisions we take (or avoid) now will affect our competitive position for generations. \u2022 Colin Matthews is chief executive of BAA heathrowmediacentre@baa.com", "sentences": ["&quot;The Tories hope to cut flights to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, as passengers are encouraged to use the new high-speed rail line which would link up with the Eurostar service at St Pancras,&quot; you report."], "title": "Response: Even with high-speed rail, we'll still need a third runway at Heathrow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/02/transport.theairlineindustry", "tags": ["Transport", "Airline industry", "Business", "Conservative conference", "Conservatives", "Transport policy", "Politics", "Travel and transport", "Heathrow", "Travel", "Environment", "UK news", "Conservative conference 2008", "Heathrow third runway", "Air transport", "Rail transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-03T23:01:00Z", "article": "Art for free!

Lorna was a member of the Pinner Occasional Players, of which your father was at that time one of the leading lights. She was your first visitor. He was your first gift.&quot; I can&apos;t imagine I took much notice of Blue Ted when he first arrived. I take my mother&apos;s word for it that he was an unusually handsome bear, beady-eyed, solidly stuffed, and - as the name might imply - bright blue. But as a host of other rivals for my affections gradually appeared on the scene, I religiously spurned them all, until by the time I was walking, Blue Ted and I were, indisputably, an item.  There exists an embarrassing series of black-and-white photographs of me gambolling in a park in about 1962, Blue Ted clamped firmly under one arm as if no force on earth could ever pry him loose. &quot;You were absolutely inseparable,&quot; says Mum. &quot;You carried him everywhere. Along with an empty jar of Marmite. You loved that, too. You wouldn&apos;t go anywhere without them.&quot; We&apos;ve had our ups and downs since those heady early days, Blue Ted and I, as is the nature of all relationships. Our moments of complicity, and of seeming indifference. For some time, I&apos;m told, a small plastic tortoise supplanted him in my heart and hot little hand, followed by a succession of Dinky and Corgi toys (including that gold Aston Martin DB5 with the pop-out machine guns, spring-up bullet-proof rear window shield and ejector seat). But Blue Ted must have been special. You only have to look at him now - limp, threadbare, battered, darned, the stuffing literally knocked right out of him, to see how much he must have been hugged. The spark went out of our physical relations, I would imagine, some time in the mid-60s, but Blue Ted continued to sit somewhere in my bedroom throughout my childhood and adolescence, a largely forgotten but still comforting presence amid the hormonal turmoil. An emblem of innocence, perhaps, as I set resolutely about the business of losing mine.  We grew ever more distant with adulthood. Still, Blue Ted came with me - albeit, as far as I can remember, in a shoebox - to university. He accompanied me on a 20-year European tour that took in Amsterdam, Helsinki and Paris. Intriguingly, around the time I had children of my own, he seems to have emerged from his hibernation. In fact he&apos;s lying in a corner of the bedroom now, though not so as anyone would ever notice him.  I haven&apos;t a clue what all this says about me, of course; this must be the first time I&apos;ve consciously devoted more than about two seconds&apos; thought to the scraggy old bugger in about 45 years. But Blue Ted is the only object from my earliest childhood that I still possess. He&apos;s still there, and that is, undeniably, a thought that kind of pleases me. So, um, thanks, Lorna.  William Leith When I was asked if I had a childhood teddy bear, I began to feel distinctly odd. Well, yes, I did have a teddy bear. And this bear was in a cupboard in my house. On a shelf, actually, behind some bags of stuff that I want to sort through, but never do. I knew where the bear was. I had not thrown the bear away. But it was definitely out of sight, and when somebody asked me about the bear, I felt very slightly queasy. What was the bear called? I also felt strange thinking about this. The bear was - or, rather, had been - called Ted. For a while, after my little brother got a smaller bear, my bear was Big Ted, and my brother&apos;s was Little Ted. At primary school, my brother was asked to write a story about his teddy bear. This story, it turned out, was some of the most potent ammunition I ever had in my armoury. Just mentioning it - or, in the end, anything to do with it - would draw unimaginable amounts of shame and embarrassment.  &quot;Hey, what was that you wrote about your teddy bear?&quot; And: &quot;Don&apos;t worry, mate - there&apos;s nothing weird or strange about a guy who writes about his teddy bear.&quot; And: &quot;If you feel that strongly about it.&quot; And: &quot;No, I&apos;m just saying.&quot; And: &quot;Ow!&quot; And: &quot;Mum, he&apos;s out of control!&quot; And now it&apos;s my turn, I suppose. It&apos;s all because of Sebastian Flyte and his bear in Brideshead Revisited. Now, I do have a theory about this. But first: taking your teddy bear to university? Dear me. I wouldn&apos;t have even taken mine to school. I slept in a dormitory with loads of other boys and a bear would have signalled vulnerability. A bear would have been a sign saying &quot;hit me&quot;. Anyway, Flyte&apos;s bear was Evelyn Waugh&apos;s symbolism at work. Flyte would not let go of his bear because he did not want to let go of his childhood; he was the aristocracy on its last legs, not wanting the future to happen. So: my bear. It was given to my mother, by the members of a class she was teaching, when she went on maternity leave. It&apos;s a nice story. I&apos;ve heard it told many times. It&apos;s the sort of story that gets told again and again - the sort of heart-warming story that, somehow, becomes hard to listen to. I heard it again, quite recently, after I had had my son. The bear resurfaced. My mother suggested that I give it to my son. I felt conflicted. Why? I&apos;m sure a psychiatrist could unravel the whole thing - the fact that I hate, and yet am drawn to, sentimentality, my relationships with the bear, the dormitory, my empty bedroom with the bear in it, and so on. So I gave the bear to my son. I said, &quot;Do you want it?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I want the other bears.&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; I said, relieved. That&apos;s when I put the bear in the cupboard. Andrew Martin  I can&apos;t remember when or where I came by The Panda. I&apos;ve just always had him. I never went so far as to name him, but a strong bond was formed between us when he survived a terrible attack. When I was a boy, it was the task of whoever made my bed (which was certainly not me) to prop The Panda on top of the pillows. One day, when I was nine, a friend of mine - a rather rough friend - came up into my bedroom. The first thing he did was to pick my goldfish out of its bowl, saying he wanted to &quot;stroke&quot; him. Lobbing the fish back into the water, he then turned his attentions towards my bed, and a moment later he was holding The Panda in one hand and a purple marker pen, snatched from my desk, in the other. As I hurled myself at him, he scrawled a drawing of a stick man on The Panda&apos;s chest, which was at that time coloured white.  It was class war. I was being punished for a) having a panda and b) having a desk, with pens neatly arrayed. I was angry rather than upset at this, but when I saw that my mother was upset, I became likewise. It was impossible to clean off the drawing; I would have to banish The Panda, otherwise I would be reminded of his assailant every time I looked at him. But then my mother set about sowing a black patch over The Panda&apos;s white chest. The sheer brilliance of this solution left me stunned: the only requirement of a panda was that it be black and white; it didn&apos;t matter which bits were black or white. I also had a golliwog (but we won&apos;t talk about him), and a long-snouted Clanger that was made of an old brown sock, as indeed, as far as I could see, were the ones in the animated television series that popularised these creatures. This pair fell by the wayside during my itinerant 20s, but I&apos;ve always found house room for The Panda in memory of my mother, who died about a year after performing that rescue operation. The Panda is accommodated in my youngest son&apos;s bedroom, where for years he&apos;s been kept out of the fray, sitting on top of a bookshelf. My son, a dutiful host but not emotionally involved, recently reported that The Panda&apos;s black patch is beginning to come off, and I&apos;m still furious when I peek at the stick man lurking underneath. I will not let the patch fall off entirely and, since it sends all the wrong signals for a man to ask his wife to repair his teddy bear, I suppose I will have to sew it back on myself. \u2022 How To Get Things Really Flat: A Man&apos;s Guide to Ironing, Dusting and Other Household Arts by Andrew Martin is published this week by Short Books, priced \u00a312.99 Guy Browning We call them cuddlies in our house. I believe the proper word for them is familiars but to my mind that doesn&apos;t really communicate our intense feelings for them. We have five cuddlies in our household. My wife has a panda called Nosewhiskers, a name that may sound cute when you&apos;re a child but begins to sound quite unpleasant when you&apos;re a middle-aged man. My eldest daughter has a sleepy rabbit called Snoozly, my eldest son a dog called Dougie and my youngest son a rabbit with unusually erect ears called Real Rabbit. It&apos;s called that because one night, when we&apos;d searched for him for about 17 hours, we tried to palm our son off with another similar rabbit with floppy ears. He knew immediately that this was an imposter, and when we eventually found the genuine article (stuffed in the back of a lorry like an illegal immigrant rabbit) he became Real Rabbit so we wouldn&apos;t be confused in future.  My cuddly is a donkey called Burro. He&apos;s from El Salvador, which is where I was when I was a baby and in need of something cuddly to alleviate possible home sickness. Sadly, cuddly toys didn&apos;t exist in El Salvador in those days, and the closest thing to it was Burro, a rather touristy donkey sold in airports to desperate business travellers wanting last-minute gifts for home. Without wishing to be in any way disloyal, Burro is not cuddly. As he is made out of some kind of industrial-strength sacking material, I would have to say that he is actually quite rough.  In his defence, Burro is a donkey and is therefore a hardworking beast of burden. Although he wasn&apos;t terribly good in the cuddling department, he did have saddlebags on either side of his sturdy little body. In these bags you could stow things of vital importance to a young boy, principally pieces of biscuit and the key to my secret treasure chest. In the treasure chest were things of absolutely vitally vital importance, such as Opal Fruits.  A brilliant design feature on Burro is that you could adjust the whites of his eyes. If you rotate them to the top of his eyes he looks rather happy, as if you&apos;d just relieved him of a great burden. My favourite position is one eye up and one eye down, which makes little Burro look like the Mad Donkey of the Pampas.  The other good thing about Burro is that he stood on his own four legs. This means he is rubbish in bed because he won&apos;t lie down, but it does mean he can tirelessly stand guard on my bedside table. One of the reasons I still have Burro is because he isn&apos;t very cuddly, so, like a prickly old aunt, he suffered very little in the way of emotional wear and tear. He still stands guard with his mad eyes and I find that comfortingly familiar.  Oliver James Whether I chose Koaly, my koala, I do not know. I suspect that he (for it is a he, I feel sure, absence of genitalia notwithstanding) was a present from a relative at a loss for something better to give.  I think his principal role for me was as a mummy substitute. I can distinctly recall clinging on to him and feeling safer as a result. This is interesting in theoretical and personal terms. Both my parents were psychoanalysts who were quite close friends with Donald Winnicott, the creator of the concept of the transitional object. By this he meant the infant or toddler&apos;s &quot;first possession&quot;, an object that could be experienced at times as being part of me; at others, not part of me. He maintained that it was able to occupy the space between me and not-me where play occurs, where we are neither trying to impose ourselves on our environment, nor being dictated by it. Play is not goal-directed or purposeful, not about trying to fulfil an instinct, as in sexual intercourse (versus flirting). Rather, like much of art or sport or fun, it is done for its own sake.  Winnicott argued that infants do not start life with very clear boundaries between inner and outer. They use transitional objects to play with this distinction, so that if you observe infants with their object they will sometimes treat it as a separate entity to be bossed about or stroked, and sometimes cling to it, as part of themselves. One of Winnicott&apos;s key points was that the transitional object is not a mummy substitute or what his contemporary, John Bowlby, would have called an attachment figure. That is why I find it interesting to reflect that my Koaly was both a transitional object and could stand in for my mum. While I definitely played with him (probably incredibly violent games in which he destroyed other soft toys), he was also my safe haven when the ghouls and wolves gathered after the lights went out. As the third of four children under five, I definitely needed something. My mum was run off her feet, having had a pretty tricky childhood herself. Now a parent myself, I can see all too clearly how helpful soft toys are for keeping wolves at the door as well as for helping us to enter imaginary worlds.  \u2022 See selfishcapitalist.com for Oliver James&apos;s writings and broadcasting Will Self My children ask me about the toys I had when I was a child all the time - the subject fascinates them. They never tire of hearing about the Secret Sam briefcase, complete with automatic pistol, and the Moon Probe (I was eight in 1969 and moon toys were in vogue). But these hi-tech toys, while lusted after, were never much played with.  What I tend to be a little quieter about - at least with the boys - is the extent to which I adored cuddly toys. I had bears I hung on to until they rotted and the amount of imaginative effort I put into giving them interior lives far surpasses anything I&apos;ve ever done with the characters in my books.  There were glove puppets that wouldn&apos;t leave my hand for weeks at a time, as they developed sinister sub-personalities of their own.  I do &apos;fess up to the cuddly toys with my daughter - since she&apos;s had the same passion. Together we&apos;ve visited &quot;bear factories&quot;, and acquired bears you can put in the microwave and ones that have artificial voice boxes on which you can record your own voice (her bear speaks in my angry tones, saying, &quot;Buck up, Maddie!&quot;); but while I&apos;ve brought her bears back from as far afield as Los Angeles and Lima, the sad fact is that she - unlike me - has outgrown them. There they sit, abandoned in her bedroom, and if it wasn&apos;t for me going in from time to time to give them a cuddle, I think they might pine away altogether. \u2022 Liver, by Will Self, is published by Viking at \u00a318.99 \u2022 Brideshead Revisited (12A) is now on general release", "sentences": ["He accompanied me on a 20-year European tour that took in Amsterdam, Helsinki and Paris."], "title": "Brideshead Revisted inspres six men to introduce their teddy bears", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/04/brideshead.revisted.teddies", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style", "Brideshead Revisited"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-06T10:59:38Z", "article": "It wasn&apos;t terribly long ago that FC Groningen were tap-dancing on the brink of bankruptcy. They wobbled and nearly fell into the abyss before being forced to go hat-in-hand to rich backers in order to pay players&apos; wages. But if Groningen were to look down today, they wouldn&apos;t see ruin but rather every other professional football club in the Netherlands. For Groningen are on top of the world and the Eredivisie table for the second straight week after easily discarding ADO Den Haag 3-0 in a battle of the season&apos;s sensations on Sunday. &quot;Not a single supporter of FC Groningen left straight after the showpiece,&quot; Algemeen Dagblad&apos;s Rob Hartog wrote. &quot;In the pouring rain, all the fans, who were soaked to the bone, stayed in the stands to cheer on their heroes for many more minutes.&quot; It was the late 1990s when Groningen were to be found sinking faster than Sarah Palin&apos;s credibility. A 1997-98 relegation coupled with a decrepit stadium and empty coffers left the club as good as dead. A new ground and business plan quickly yielded results though. Matches now sell out weekly in the 22,000-seat Euroborg, which the club has already outgrown (and plans to expand to 35,000, making it the third-biggest stadium in Holland); sponsorship is abundant; and recent transfers have been inspired. Tellingly, manager Ron Jans was offered the job at FC Twente - when they were still Champions League-bound - and brushed it off. &quot;We&apos;re first for now but we&apos;re just going to try to justify our status as a top-half team and then we&apos;ll see at the end of the season if we&apos;re top of the table,&quot; Jans said last week. &quot;But to be honest I wouldn&apos;t bet money on it,&quot; he added, to the annoyance of bookies everywhere.  &quot;Groningen proved they belong to the best clubs in the Netherlands once again,&quot; the less reserved TV-commentator Jeroen Gr\u00fcter said of Sunday&apos;s match. &quot;That first place is no coincidence.&quot;  Elsewhere, Ajax reserve keeper Kenneth Vermeer, who flaunted his considerable talent during the Olympics, finally got a chance to threaten Maarten Stekelenburg&apos;s starting position at the Amsterdam ArenA. The latter will be out for six weeks with a shoulder injury \u2013 a situation which has also resulted in the temporary return of Edwin van der Sar for Holland. Vermeer hardly got the start he would have wished for though, as Heerenveen made the nets bulge and the fans roar on no less than five occasions. After just eight minutes, Heerenveen were up 2-0. The 5-2 final score flattered Ajax&apos;s shambolic defence, non-existent midfield and impotent attack. No sign yet of the team that was supposed to &quot;be champions with two fingers up their nose&quot;. Manager Marco van Basten&apos;s inexperience is glaring though. He was made to look like the beginner that he actually is in club football: Ajax could well have lost by double figures.  &quot;In the same chair that Ruud Gullit once burned his Feyenoord squad to the ground in, Marco van Basten left nothing standing of Ajax,&quot; Maarten Wijffels wrote in Algemeen Dagblad. &quot;He belittled them so much [to the press] and filleted them with such venom that it looked like he was chopping up a goldfish with a samurai-sword.&quot;  &quot;May we call this a humiliation?&quot;, Van Basten was asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered without hesitating. &quot;Bad start. Bad mentality. Didn&apos;t see a team. Inadequate individually. Inadequate as a team. No chance.&quot;  &quot;We were a level better in the first half,&quot; Heerenveen&apos;s Norwegian manager Trond Sollied had uttered before anyone realised he was speaking in Dutch. &quot;In the second, we scored for 4-0 and it was game over.&quot; An Ibrahim Afellay-less PSV had been pummeled by Liverpool 3-1 midweek when the 22-year-old rising star had refused to play with an injection to numb his injured toe. &quot;I have to last longer than today,&quot; said Afellay on Saturday. &quot;If I can play I will but it&apos;s not like I&apos;m 38 and having to play my last professional game. It&apos;s my body and I decide.&quot;  With Afellay back and, perhaps more importantly, without J\u00e9r\u00e9my Br\u00e9chet and Danny Koevermans, mercifully benched because of injury and inability respectively, PSV cruised to a 3-0 victory over De Graafschap. In previous matches defender Br\u00e9chet had given away as many chances as striker Koevermans had botched - perhaps restoring the status quo in footballing karma. Feyenoord were unable to capitalise on their dominance at home to NEC as the visitors won 2-0, courtesy of two successful counter-attacks. Diego Biseswar and a once-again spectacular Georginio Wijnaldum were continually dangerous for Feyenoord but came up short, long or wide on several occasions. And if it sounds like I&apos;m smitten with Wijnaldum&apos;s unfathomable potential, it&apos;s only because I am. Steve McClaren&apos;s hairline receded a little further as FC Twente lost to FC Utrecht 3-0, after his side had shown superb resilience in knocking out Stade Rennes in the Uefa Cup in midweek.  But the performance of the weekend once again belonged to AZ. After winning at Willem II 5-2 last week, the AZians put away hapless Sparta 6-0. After 34 seconds Mounir El Hamdaoui scored the first of two splendid goals; Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 also scored twice.  The efficient ball movement, clean running routes and crisp through-balls are reminiscent of AZ manager Louis van Gaal&apos;s glory days at Ajax during the mid-90s. &quot;We are playing in an attractive manner that&apos;s fun for the public but you have to stay down to earth,&quot; van Gaal commented. Hamdaoui-Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 are undoubtedly the best strike pairing in the nation with nine goals in 10 matches and talent to boot. The ever-upbeat Mounir and the soft-spoken Moussa seem destined for bigger and better things. All AZ can do is hold on tight and enjoy the ride while it lasts.

A search of Heron&apos;s adapted Nissan Pathfinder uncovered 16kg of uncut cocaine stashed in carrier bags on the back seat, hidden inside tins of palm oil. Sentencing the pair at Canterbury crown court, the judge, Adele Williams, described Heron - who has diabetes, asthma and hypertension - as a &quot;willing participant&quot; in the crime. &quot;I have no doubt that your role in the car was to add some respectability to the journey in respect of your age and your ill health,&quot; the judge said.  The court heard that the pair, from Smethwick, near Birmingham, were likely to have smuggled drugs into the UK on several other occasions, as they had made the same or similar journey 14 times in the six months before their arrest. Financial checks revealed that \u00a390,000 in cash had been put in Chambers&apos; bank account since their first trip. Quentin Hunt, prosecuting, said Chambers, a mother of three, told customs officers they had been visiting relatives in France when they were stopped at about 11.30am on March 21. &quot;In fact they had gone to Amsterdam, or near Amsterdam, and it was clear that that was where the drugs were collected from,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;For the majority of the trips they had been going through France, through Belgium, and into Holland, and returning the next day or soon after.&quot; Defence lawyers for the mother and daughter asked the judge to take into account their ages and previous good character, as well as Heron&apos;s ill health.

But the reason for recounting this is that it all happened quite a long time ago now, at a time and in places where smoking was in no way a reprehensible activity (my first encounter with France&apos;s interpretation of the no-smoking area, in about 1980, was a sign in the corner of a restaurant that read, roughly, &quot;We apologise to our valued customers, but the law regrettably obliges us to reserve these tables for non-smokers.&quot;)  Now, of course, things are different. These days, it&apos;s actually quite difficult to be a smoker. Even Paris - even, so help me, Amsterdam - has smokefree legislation. In Britain, there&apos;s no more tobacco advertising, cigarette packets inform you bluntly that smoking their contents will kill you, it&apos;s illegal to sell tobacco products to the under-18s, you can get help with quitting on the NHS, and, most striking of all, it has become illegal to smoke in pubs, clubs, restaurants, any enclosed public space.  That&apos;s not the end of it. Over the coming year, smokers are going to have to get used to seeing an attractive selection of pictures on the back of their fag packets. One is of some poor sod, chest riven open, undergoing open heart surgery. Another is a frankly repulsive close-up of a throat sprouting some gruesome, fleshy growth. A third shows someone&apos;s foul and cancerous mouth, all missing and blackened teeth and dark, diseased tongue.  There are 14 of these shockers, and every cigarette packet sold in this country will have to carry one of them by October 2009. We&apos;re in the vanguard here, the first EU country to make photo warnings compulsory on all tobacco packaging. (In Canada, where they were launched in 2001, 31% of ex-smokers say they helped them kick the habit.) In fact, we&apos;re pretty good across the whole anti-smoking front: since the government&apos;s 1998 white paper Smoking Kills, Britain has become recognised as the European leader in tobacco control. In this country, in 2008, smoking is basically seen as antisocial and, increasingly, socially unacceptable. When I took my first puff, in the mid-70s, you could light up pretty much anywhere you liked and no one would raise an eyebrow: bus, cinema, dinner table. These days, guests don&apos;t even bother asking their host if they might smoke. They withdraw, discreetly, and slip outside (where they&apos;re not safe from abuse either; these days, smokers routinely get told off for indulging in the open air).  All of which should mean that smoking was a rather less widespread activity in Britain than it still is. Certainly the atmosphere is hostile enough to committed smokers for their tireless lobby group, Forest, to complain of &quot;persecution, bullying, humiliation and coercion&quot; in regard to a habit that never has been, and in the foreseeable future is unlikely ever to be, declared illegal. Despite all the anti-smoking measures of the past 10 years, says its director Simon Clark, smoking rates have fallen by only a few percentage points. &quot;We&apos;re all for education about the health risks of smoking, but this has now gone way beyond that,&quot; Clark says. &quot;I think it&apos;s a sign of desperation. The government seems determined to humiliate smokers until they behave in a state-approved way. Maybe the anti-smokers can knock one more percentage point off the smoking rate, but is it worth it for the bully society we&apos;re creating?&quot; For sure, many fewer of us light up than in 1948, when 82% of British men and 41% of British women were regular smokers. By 1974, 51% of men and 41% of women smoked; by 1992, it was 28% of us; in 2005, 24%. Since the Smokefree England legislation came into force in July last year, a further 235,000 people have given up with the help of NHS Stop Smoking Services. According to Professor Robert West&apos;s Smoking Toolkit Study, some 400,000 people have quit in the wake of the ban.  But that still leaves 23% of men and 21% of women, or just over 9 million people still smoking. They must know, or at least be aware of, the risks they are running: half of all regular cigarette smokers will die from their habit. Each year, some 114,000 smokers in the UK die from smoking-related causes. Smoking remains the single biggest cause of preventable deaths in Britain, killing more each year than alcohol, obesity, road accidents and illegal drugs together. So the real question is: who still smokes? The answer, according to Beyond Smoking Kills, a report published today by the broadly endorsed pressure group Ash, is the poor. &quot;The health inequalities involved are perhaps the most striking thing about smoking in Britain today,&quot; says Deborah Arnott, its president. &quot;The more deprived your circumstances, the more likely you are to smoke.&quot; According to Professor Martin Jarvis, a psychologist at University College London and a leading specialist in the field of smoking and health inequality, this is not a question solely of income: every main indicator of a lower socio-economic status is likely, independent of each of the others, to predict a higher rate of smoking. If your educational level is below the average, you are more likely to smoke. If you live in rented or overcrowded accommodation, you are more likely to smoke. Ditto if you do not have access to a car, are unemployed, or on state income benefit. &quot;There&apos;s already a considerable social gradient simply in who starts smoking,&quot; says Jarvis. &quot;But the main, really steep gradient is in who manages to stop. People in depressed circumstances are basically far less likely to give up. This isn&apos;t to do with motivation - they actually want to quit just as much. They just don&apos;t seem to be able to. The more deprived you are, the more dependent you are on nicotine, the more nicotine you take in.&quot; Today, 17% of men and 14% of women in professional and managerial occupations smoke. In routine and manual occupations, the figures are, respectively, 31% and 28%. In the most deprived areas of England, in parts of Knowsley and Liverpool, up to 52% of people smoke. In the least deprived, in places such as Rushcliffe, south of Nottingham, and Heatherside and Eastleigh in Hampshire, as few as 12% do. Some 48% of men in the poorest social class die before reaching 70, compared to just 22% in the most affluent; smoking is generally estimated to account for at least half that terrible difference in life expectancy. Several theories are advanced as to why people in deprived circumstances are so much more likely to smoke. The habit, says Jarvis, might be considered a form of self-medication: nicotine (and it is pretty much accepted that nicotine is why people smoke) is &quot;doing something for you that you value. Many smokers think it helps them deal with stress, reduce anxiety. Of course, there&apos;s very little evidence that it actually does that.&quot; Mainly, it seems, all smoking a cigarette does is relieve the (temporary) withdrawal symptoms you get from not smoking a cigarette.  There&apos;s also the economic argument. A smoking habit of 20 a day costs between \u00a31,700 and \u00a31,900 a year. Poorer smokers will spend a disproportionately large share of their income on cigarettes; research from 2003 showed that the poorest 10% of households in Britain spent 2.43% of their income on smoking, against 0.52% for the richest 10%. A 2004 Family Spending survey found that among the most deprived families of all - single parents on state benefits - three out of four smoke, a habit that costs them more than one-seventh of their total disposable income. &quot;One of the things that means, says Jarvis, &quot;is that if you&apos;re a poor smoker you&apos;re going to want to maximise the &apos;hit&apos; you get from each cigarette, because it represents a larger chunk of your income. The amount of nicotine you can get from each cigarette is very elastic; it depends how hard you puff, how deeply you inhale, how much of the cigarette you smoke.&quot; Across all age groups, and even if they smoke the same number of cigarettes, poorer smokers take in markedly more nicotine that wealthier ones. &quot;Smokers in lower socio-economic groups,&quot; says Jarvis, &quot;are addicted to a higher hit. Their nicotine addiction is stronger.&quot; Finally, poor families, being more likely to smoke, are more likely to produce future smokers. In general, fewer and fewer children in Britain are smoking: from 13% of 11- to 15-year-olds in 1996, the figure has now fallen to around 6% (including 9% of 14-year-olds, and 15% of 15-year-olds). But according to a recent Dutch study, the children of smoking parents are four times more likely to smoke themselves. And emulation or experimentation at an early age is a clear predictor of later smoking; a 2004 US survey found that smoking just one cigarette in early childhood more than doubles your chances of becoming a smoker by the age of 17. The public smoking ban will, experts believe, have gone some way to reducing the gap in smoking rates between social classes: the most recent figures show the decline in smoking recorded since its introduction occurred across the board, regardless of class, age or gender. But the government&apos;s future tobacco control policies should, Ash&apos;s Arnott says, clearly include measures - including more free help in giving up - targeted specifically at deprived groups. &quot;Smoking&apos;s an amazing area,&quot; she says. &quot;Nobody really knows how best to ensure people eat less, and eat healthily; how to encourage them to drink less, or take more exercise. But with smoking we do know what works: since 1998 there&apos;s been a really very significant decline indeed. What we&apos;re doing is working; we just need more.&quot; Jarvis says that the present government&apos;s record in slashing smoking rates is &quot;probably one of its finest achievements&quot;. So how to move forward? If the British public care deeply about questions of individual liberty, and will not in general support anything that unduly restricts it, most will back measures that might help cut tobacco consumption. Arnott cites the case of the public smoking ban, the idea of which was supported by just 20% of people in 2003, but this April by fully 78%. &quot;Big majorities also support raising tobacco prices by more than inflation, halting sales from vending machines, and ending point-of-sale displays,&quot; she says.  &quot;But perhaps the best indication of how the public feel about the whole smoking issue is the fact that compliance with smokefree legislation in Britain is so spectacularly high - more than 98%. Compare that with the proportion of people who comply with the 30mph speed limit in built-up areas. That&apos;s only around half.&quot; Today&apos;s Ash report, 10 years after the important white paper Smoking Kills, estimates that smoking is costing the NHS in England some \u00a32.7bn a year. It calls for a comprehensive new national tobacco strategy and tough targets, including a smoking rate of 11% in the adult population as a whole by 2015. Among its key recommendations are a ban on all tobacco product branding (which means selling cigarettes in blank packs, except of course for a graphic health warning); prohibiting retailers from putting cigarettes on display (the huge displays in tobacconists and supermarkets are, campaigners say, a &quot;powerful promotional tool that encourages impulse buying&quot;; banning them would essentially mean stocking cigarettes under the counter) and outlawing tobacco in vending machines, which are used by about 20% of under-age smokers. The report also calls for a properly resourced fight against tobacco smuggling, which accounts for about 13% of the cigarettes and 20% of the hand-rolling tobacco smoked in Britain. It wants tobacco to be more expensive to buy than it is now (historically, cigarettes are 60% more affordable than they were in the 1960s). It would like to see deprived and marginalised groups given priority in all stop-smoking campaigns, and, for smokers who are really unwilling or unable to quit, it would like pure nicotine products such as gums and inhalers that deliver nicotine as effectively as cigarettes, but without the fatal by-products that come with smoking to be more widely available, more competitive, and even free on prescription. Will all this work? The problem, as the number of dedicated smokers in Britain continues gradually to dwindle, is that those that remain will prove more and more resistant; any measure perceived as aggressive could just as easily prove counterproductive. The evidence from a sample of smokers accosted on the streets near the Guardian the other day was, certainly, not entirely encouraging. Confronted with those unpleasant picture warnings, most did not feel they would persuade them to stop.  &quot;They might stop a few young people starting, I suppose,&quot; volunteers Adam Riley, 41, sucking on a B&amp;H outside the sandwich shop. &quot;But I can&apos;t see them doing much for me. They&apos;re horrible, yes, course they are, but we already knew the risks, didn&apos;t we? What&apos;s this going to add to that, beyond making us all feel even more persecuted?&quot;  Perched puffing on the steps outside their dance school, Jackie, Mandy and Felicity were similarly unimpressed. &quot;If you were already thinking about giving up, this might give you the extra incentive,&quot; concedes Felicity, 17. &quot;They are revolting, though, aren&apos;t they? Ugh. That throat one . . . I don&apos;t want to look at that too often. But I think if you&apos;ve kind of rationalised smoking, then you&apos;ll just shut your eyes to these too.&quot; Mandy says she&apos;s only going to smoke for three or four more years, anyway. &quot;I&apos;ll be fine as long as I stop then. None of that stuff is going to happen to me, no way.&quot; David Levy, unemployed and 40, says he won&apos;t be quitting any time soon, whatever the government comes up with next. &quot;I&apos;m a smoker. I have been for a very long time and I enjoy it. These won&apos;t stop people like me.&quot; \u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008. Britain will not become the first EU country to require photograph-based health warnings on cigarette packets next year as we said in the article above. That is already the case in Belgium and Romania. It will, however, become the first to make picture warnings compulsory on all tobacco packaging.

That technology and other means are critical to many, many Iranians trying to travel. The blue Iranian passport may be ranked second from bottom in the Henley index of travel freedom but that doesn&apos;t stop Iranians seeking a document to get out of the millionaire mullahs&apos; country. The government prevents Iranian men from getting a passport if they don&apos;t do national service. And so Ayatollah Khamenei allows a roaring trade in illegal passports. The nomenklatura are not affected, as the sons of the wealthy and those of people on the Guardian Council buy off national service. President Ahmadinejad&apos;s anti-corruption drive has done nothing \u2013 he is powerless in Iran but for his passport to travel and give speeches around the world. Even his allies have been imprisoned when they mention the &quot;C&quot; word. I spoke to a man at a north Tehran coffee shop who was ripped off twice. He was given a contact by a friend who had successfully procured a passport for $5,000. They call you. And they never give you their number. The meeting took place in a park and, without any guarantees, money was exchanged. The passport would be ready in a week. Nothing happened. Such is the desperation; he did it again and was ripped off again. &quot;I think I have found another contact,&quot; he said.   Hopefully, it will work this time. I just have to save up. The thing is that the friend who gave me one of the previous contacts got stopped coming into Imam Khomeini airport last week. He had used his passport four times to travel abroad but the man he bought it from had been caught doing a deal and he revealed the numbers of all the passports he had sold.  He got five years and my friend was arrested at the airport and got six months in Evin Prison. He&apos;s now doing national service in a desert area in south east Iran \u2013 with an added six months to the normal two years&apos; service.  Perhaps he was lucky. Under article 15(1) of the 1988 amended Passport Act, the sentence should be 18 months in prison and article 525(2) of the Islamic Penal Code says a &quot;fake stamp&quot; in a passport means &quot;one to 10 years of imprisonment&quot;.  There&apos;s a big UNHCR office in Tehran, a testament to the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have caused a flow of war-weary refugees into the towns and cities of Iran \u2013 the largest refugee crisis in history. According to UNHCR, counterfeit Iranian passports are widely available and the prices change &quot;according to the quality of the counterfeit work&quot;. While the middle classes opt for buying on the black market, the very poor get to cross borders at will, but that is an ancient trade. Tehranis are rightfully frightened of crossing the porous Pakistan and Afghanistan borders where human trafficking is rife, with police often reporting round-ups of gangs, as well as frequent repatriation. There&apos;s stiff border security on the Azerbaijan border and the dhow-route to Oman across the Gulf isn&apos;t very useful as it&apos;s unlikely any consulate will help an escaping Iranian. Kurds, meanwhile, are on the Turkey-Iran border and cross when they want \u2013 part of a government-sanctioned smuggling route for drugs and alcohol. Women may not have to do national service but face other hurdles. Singles can&apos;t get visas to many Gulf countries if they are under 30. Countries like US-backed Saudi Arabia seem to believe that every young Iranian single woman must be a sex worker. And married women need the permission of their husband to travel anywhere abroad. Such is the unreconstructed Islamic respect for women. The Bush administration tried to tie in all this counterfeit passport business with its &quot;war on terror&quot; and the need to bomb Iran. In 2002, the FBI said it had caught an Iranian gang in Thailand that was busily forging passports and when asked about the supposed connection between Iran and al-Qaida, Thai police had to respond by saying &quot;they were not certain if the FBI agents were able to establish links between the Iranians and al-Qaida networks in the region or in the US&quot;. The 9/11 Commission report absurdly claims that Iran knowingly facilitated transit for al-Qaida militants: &quot;... operatives ... travelled through Iran, which did not stamp visas directly into passports&quot;. Presumably, the commission didn&apos;t understand the difference between Shia and Sunni, just like Republican presidential contender John McCain. It&apos;s no wonder that tourist guides to Iran advise that a foreigner&apos;s passport is his most valuable asset and to keep it strapped about one&apos;s person. Actually, crime in the big cities of Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz is much less than one might find in London or Paris. And given that most of Iran&apos;s Jewish community chose to ignore a recent Israeli invitation to come and occupy Palestinian land, life in Iran from a regional perspective \u2013 as against the labour camps of Dubai and the US-backed destruction of Iraq \u2013 isn&apos;t that bad at all. But for those fighting for more freedom in Iran, passports are a weapon of the state used to destroy their lives.

That&apos;s well over 20%. That&apos;s really bad news, I thought. And then I thought again. There are still 4,346 species left, in no danger. Is that not enough? Will the world and humankind be very much the poorer if we lose a thousand or so species? I&apos;m deliberately putting the question in a provocative way because I&apos;m genuinely seeking an answer. I passionately believe in saving the whale, the tiger, the orangutan, the sea turtle and many other specifically identified species. What I do not accept is the general principle that all species alive today should carry on existing for ever. We have become so attuned to treating every diminution of animals, insects, birds or fish with concern that we have forgotten to explain why we think it so terrible. I can see three good explanations for our reactions to the endangerment of species. First, the particular appeal of the animal in question: the whale (huge and dignified), the panda (cute), the tiger (majestic and beautiful), various apes (a lot like us). I doubt we would feel the same if hyenas or armadillos were at risk. Secondly, we are rightly angry if the devastation of the species has been caused by humans, whether by way of fishing, pollution, deforestation or urbanisation. Third, the dearth of some species can lead to the disruption of a food chain, and thus affect the health and numbers of other species in the chain. But this doesn&apos;t resolve my confusion.  Many species at risk are very close to other species that are not at risk; the differences are so small that only the scientists have any interest in them. My main reason for doubting that all species are essential is that so many are completely unknown to us. Scientists have told us that they exist, and we may have caught a glimpse of a few of them on wildlife programmes, but they are otherwise never seen by us, and we know nothing about them. How many mammal species can you think of? Can the remainder be that important? Can their loss matter that much, to you or to the world? Of course we must fight hard to retain as many species as we can; but it isn&apos;t a tragedy if we lose quite a few along the way. There are, in London, two kinds of bus stop. At the first, a mainly white sign, buses always stop. At the second, marked by a red sign saying &quot;Request&quot;, they stop only if someone inside has pressed the bell signifying a wish to get off, or a person outside has waved the bus down in order to get on. I now accuse Transport for London of an act of vandalism, by destroying - knowingly or not - that much loved traditional distinction. This is what happened. I wanted to get off at a stop that I knew to be a compulsory one. I therefore did not press the bell. I rose from my seat. The bus did not stop. I went up to the driver. A polite conversation ensued. &quot;You didn&apos;t stop.&quot; &quot;You didn&apos;t ring.&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t need to ring; you were supposed to stop.&quot; &quot;If you want me to stop you must ring the bell.&quot; Two days later, on a different route, the same thing happened to a fellow passenger. When I contacted TfL, they claimed not to know that their drivers were perpetrating these outrages. But they are. So beware, Londoners. All bus stops are now request stops. Tomorrow, Jacques Brel will have been  dead for 30 years. It is one of my life regrets that I never saw him perform live. I tried and failed miserably (as did many thousands of others) to buy tickets for what he said was to be his final performance in Paris, at the Olympia, in 1966. But we never believed he meant it; he would surely not, at the age of 37, be so cruel to his fans as to wander away from their worship. But he did, and we were left with only the vinyl albums, to be listened to in a haze of smoke and wine, accompanied by memories of loves gained and loves lost.  He was still around, doing this and that, including spending two years on the Pacific island where, eventually, he was to be buried in 1978, close to the grave of Paul Gauguin. He was 49, dead from lung cancer; his smoking had always been part of his attraction.  But for most of us, 1966 was where it ended, with that last emotional appearance at Olympia, which I had failed to witness. Brel&apos;s songs were once as important to me as Camus&apos;s novels and the poetry and lyrics of Jacques Pr\u00e9vert. He presented the anguish of passion, the torment of love gone wrong, the shadow of death as no singer-songwriter-composer has done before or since. Today, Sotheby&apos;s in Paris is auctioning a large collection of Brel memorabilia, including many of his personal belongings; the seller&apos;s identity has not been revealed. The priciest item is expected to be the manuscript of one of his most loved songs, Amsterdam, which could fetch \u00a360,000. He would have been surprised and amused.

Metro: Palais-Royal 2. B&amp;B Saint Denis      In the heart of the Sentier neighbourhood, Paris&apos;s bustling garment district, this eclectic B&amp;B is close to both the elegant mansions of the Marais and the inviting fashion boutiques of Les Halles. Alain, the owner, has traveled all over the world, and his decor is a colourful mix of kitsch 70s bar stools, art-naif paintings and primitive religious statues. Be prepared for a typically Parisian trudge up the stairs though, as the apartment is on the fourth floor and there is no lift. \u2022 2nd Arrondissement, +33 147340150, 2binparis.com, \u20ac86pn.

B&amp;B Rue D&apos;Assas      This B&amp;Bhas the additional plus of a small salon and kitchen for guests to use, though there are too many tempting bars and restaurant in the Latin Quarter to stay home in the evening. There are two rooms for rent - the &quot;Japonaise&quot; and &quot;Blue Room&quot; - furnished in a retro 50s style that could have come straight from the set of the movie Amelie Poulain. \u2022 6th Arrondissement, +33 134 199 000, bedbreak.com reference 75.88, \u20ac92pn.

The owners bought the boat in Amsterdam, sailed it to Paris, and have been living aboard for 22 years. Their two guest rooms are cute, but tiny (especially the beds!) seaman&apos;s cabins.

The owner here, Helene, is seriously into interior design, and even changes colours and objects in her spacious and luxurious apartment to suite the different seasons.

And this is exactly where B&amp;B Valmy is located, in a romantic 19th-century half-timbered house.

The exhibition in question, Picasso and the Masters, has just opened at the Grand Palais with additional sections at the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Orsay; according to reports in today&apos;s papers the Society of Friends of the Louvre see its involvement as yet another instance of desperately chasing visitor numbers.  Marc Fumaroli, the Society&apos;s chairman, said the crowds of visitors the Louvre gets are a &quot;cancer&quot; and it should not be encouraging them. The National Gallery recently announced it too will show the Picasso exhibition after it closes in Paris early next year. No one in London batted an eyelid, distracted as reports were by its plans to show a walk-in tableau of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district. In other words, while London chases the newer than new, Paris, where the new was invented, still has a cultural elite confident enough to frown on today&apos;s art-hungry masses. Or does it? Perhaps it just has a bunch of snotty frauds, sniffing at their perceived inferiors when they could be learning and contemplating. Because if anyone really is disconcerted by Picasso, they expose themselves as fools. No artist is more serious, more intelligent, more worthwhile - no artist offers a better bridge between new and old, shocking and serious. The whole point of Picasso and the Masters is to reveal this great artist&apos;s profound appetite for art&apos;s history even as he shattered and remade that history. Picasso&apos;s respect for high art makes him, by today&apos;s despicable standards, an elitist. Yet his art has so much kick and punch and visceral life that you could be satisfied with this one man alone and never look at another artist. Far from crowd-pleasing for its own sake, Picasso and the Masters is a vindication of serious cultural values for our time. I can&apos;t wait to see it. If these Paris snobs really are criticising Picasso, I have no time for them. Anyway, they are missing the point, aren&apos;t they? The Louvre really does have a problem with the way its visitors relate to its collections - but the culprit is not Picasso. It&apos;s not a modernist at all. The dumbing down of the Louvre is all the fault of Leonardo da Vinci. It&apos;s the Mona Lisa and her alone that a very high proportion of visitors come to the Louvre: the museum is failing totally to deal with the consequences of that. The Mona Lisa is displayed among 16th-century Venetian masterpieces that include Titian&apos;s Concert Champetre and Veronese&apos;s Marriage at Cana - but no one looks at them and you feel eccentric for doing so.  In their haste to find the Mona Lisa, the crowds even walk past Michelangelo&apos;s Slaves without stopping. I suppose a neon sign flashing MICHELANGELO might at least make them slow down. Other parts of the museum are often empty: you can have Van Eyck&apos;s Madonna of Chancellor Rolin or Watteau&apos;s Gilles to yourself. The museum needs to put the Mona Lisa in a separate section, and charge separately to see it. That one change would solve all the problems that worry Monsieur Fumaroli.", "sentences": ["No one in London batted an eyelid, distracted as reports were by its plans to show a walk-in tableau of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district."], "title": "Jonathan Jones: Dumbing down the Louvre?

To celebrate the tour - or, indeed, to drum up interest in it - the &quot;Queen of the Mash-up&quot; has set up a new website, anniemacpresents.com, from which she&apos;s currently offering a free 10-song MP3 mixtape (unusually, you don&apos;t even need to register to get it). The mix kicks off with a terrific mash of MIA and Salt-N-Pepa, before surging though half an hour of strident electro which is obscure enough to make Mac look cool, but uplifting enough to get you bouncing around your kitchen. As such, the mix certainly serves as a fitting advert for Mac&apos;s party-starting abilities. But it&apos;s worth downloading even if your nightclub days are long gone. Also out on the road this week are Elbow, who are still surfing a wave of good feeling (and increased sales) following their Mercury prize win. That victory has prompted Dutch website Fabchannel.com to put their film of Elbow&apos;s June gig at Amsterdam&apos;s Paradiso back on their front page, and the 100-minute show is very much deserving of the renewed attention. Not only do Elbow deliver a gorgeous, rousing performance, but a mid-set fault with the band&apos;s piano forces singer Guy Garvey into several minutes of &quot;spontaneous frontmanship&quot;, during which he answers questions from the audience, then leads them in an impromptu Mexican wave. But even that is trumped by the crowd&apos;s surreal-but-brilliant rendition of Europe&apos;s Final Countdown before the encore. It clearly has the hairs standing up on Garvey&apos;s neck, and may well have the same effect on you. It&apos;s not often these days that something appears online which is so downright impressive that it slightly boggles your mind. But audio-video mash-up artists Eclectic Method have achieved just that with their latest project. The London-based trio have long been at the forefront of the video remix scene, and their video for Don&apos;t Stop, the biting new single by US rockers Innerpartysystem, is a typically impressive collage of twisted TV clips (tinyurl.com/ipsvideo). The difference with this one is an incredibly clever bit of software allowing you to instantly make your own remix of the video, using just your keyboard (tinyurl.com/ipsremix). Each letter and number plays a different clip, enabling you to flit between Mr T, Victoria Beckham and Innerpartystem to create your own unique version of both the video and the song. Better still, once you&apos;ve played around for a while, you can record your masterpiece and share it with the world.

Guitarist Eliades Ochoa was impressed that &quot;everyone knew the songs and was singing along. The hall was completely full, and there were enough people outside trying to get tickets to fill the hall for another show.&quot; And film director Wim Wenders remembers &quot;how excited all these old men were! They were like a high-school band, all struck with stage fright like beginners. Mind you, they never really existed as a band.&quot; The date was July 1 1998, when the best-selling, mostly elderly musicians of Cuba&apos;s Buena Vista Social Club gave one of the most celebrated concerts in Cuban music history, at Carnegie Hall in New York - the show that provided the climax for Wenders&apos; celebrated documentary about the musicians. It was their first appearance in the US, and also their last performance anywhere. Buena Vista may be the best-known band in Cuban music history, as far as international audiences are concerned, but they gave only three concerts, and released only one album together- it has sold an astonishing 8m copies. Now, 10 years on, comes the second release by the full Buena Vista Social Club, a live double album recorded at that Carnegie Hall show. Three of the main Buena Vista stars - Compay Segundo, Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez and Ibrahim Ferrer - have died in the intervening years, but this rousing set is a reminder of the band&apos;s legacy, and their extraordinary and unlikely history. The Buena Vista Social Club were a hastily assembled group of Cuban musicians who would never have recorded that first album if it hadn&apos;t been for the failings of the postal service in west Africa. The original plan was for two Malian musicians, Djelimady Tounkara and Bassekou Kouyate, to travel to Havana in March 1996 to work with a small Cuban group including guitarist Eliades Ochoa and the American star Ry Cooder. But according to Nick Gold of World Circuit records, who put the project together, &quot;They sent off their passports to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso and they got lost. It was either that, or there was a rich patron in town paying so well that it was hard to leave.&quot; Either way, their absence left Gold with a problem. He had already put together one Cuban album, reviving the island&apos;s big band styles with Juan de Marcos Gonz\u00e1lez and the Afro-Cuban All Stars, but now he needed musicians to replace the Africans for the second project. The remarkable pianist Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez and bass player Cachaito L\u00f3pez were brought in from the All Stars, while the already elderly singer and guitarist Segundo (who had joined Eliades in recording an earlier version of the Buena Vista favourite Chan Chan back in the mid-80s) wasn&apos;t tracked down until the second day of recording. Others joined Buena Vista simply by chance. Ferrer, who would become internationally known for his romantic ballads, the boleros, was living in impoverished retirement, shining shoes and selling lottery tickets, until Cooder decided he wanted a singer with a soft voice for the song Dos Gardenias, and Gonz\u00e1lez said he knew such a man and brought Ferrer to the studio. Portuondo, a star in Cuba but less well-known in the west, was not at first going to be part of the project, until Cooder ran into her at the Egrem studio and asked her to record Veinte A\u00f1os before she left for a tour of Vietnam. It was, says Gold, &quot;amazing luck&quot;. The album was released in 1997, and its success led to solo projects and tours by different Buena Vista stars, and to Wenders travelling to Cuba to record interviews with the musicians, and to film the recording sessions for Ferrer&apos;s solo album. Wenders had been working with in Los Angeles with Cooder, who &quot;gave me a cassette of the rough mix of the Buena Vista recordings. I was hooked instantly and ended up hearing this music every day for months.&quot; In April the following year, the entire cast was finally assembled in Amsterdam for their first live shows, which proved so successful that a final concert was added, three months later, at Carnegie Hall. It hasn&apos;t been easy for Cubans to visit the US since the Castro revolution, and there was some doubt as to whether the musicians would be granted visas. &quot;It was touch and go,&quot; says Gold, &quot;but this was the Clinton era, so it was a bit easier at that time. We used specialist lawyers.&quot; Had the event been planned a few years later, when the Bush government promoted a hard line towards Cuba, it would not have happened at all. When Ferrer tried to go back to the US in 2004, after being invited to the Grammy awards, the gentle exponent of Cuban love songs was banned from entering. According to his close friend Portuondo, &quot;They stamped &apos;terrorist&apos; on his passport.&quot; Thankfully, there were no such restrictions in 1998, and New York clearly adored the Buena Vista concert. So why was it special? Gold remembers &quot;the incredible atmosphere, and Rub\u00e9n&apos;s piano playing was especially brilliant. It just wasn&apos;t happening for him at rehearsals, but when he came to the show he was blinding.&quot; For Wenders, &quot;It was very touching to watch Ry. He was so essential to the project and yet he was trying to hide on stage, in order to leave centre stage for the old men.&quot; And for Portuondo, the one woman on stage, it was an emotional occasion because this was the hall where her childhood heroine, the black American contralto Marian Anderson, used to sing. &quot;So I thought, &apos;How can I go on stage and do the same thing that Marian Anderson did so many years ago?&apos;&quot; The song she remembers most fondly is Silencio, her duet with Ferrer, which she had recorded with him not on the Buena Vista album but on Ferrer&apos;s first solo release. &quot;It was important because Ibrahim was a big friend for many years, and he loved the song so much. That&apos;s why when I came on stage to sing the duet with him, I started crying, not tears of sadness but emotion. And he took out his handkerchief and started drying my eyes. He was a gentleman.&quot; When the Carnegie Hall show was over, Buena Vista&apos;s members went back to their individual careers, but now attracted larger audiences than ever - especially when the success of the Wenders film guaranteed that their music was reaching an ever wider audience. &quot;Everything was tripled,&quot; says Ochoa. &quot;If I was doing 10 concerts before Buena Vista, I&apos;d now be doing 30. And the banks were really happy.&quot;  There were no more live shows, because logistics, and then the deaths of key performers, made it impossible. But the release of the Carnegie Hall album is not the end of the Buena Vista story, for Gold now plans to revive the original project that was shelved when the Africans lost their passports. Later this year it&apos;s hoped that recording will start on a new album bringing together the surviving Cubans from Buena Vista, including Ochoa and the laoud player B\u00e1rbarito Torres, with Malian musicians including Kouyate and Toumani Diabat\u00e9. What will they be called? Gold isn&apos;t yet sure. He&apos;ll find it hard to think of anything quite as memorable as Buena Vista Social Club. \u2022 Buena Vista Social Club at Carnegie Hall is released on World Circuit on Monday", "sentences": ["I was hooked instantly and ended up hearing this music every day for months.&quot; In April the following year, the entire cast was finally assembled in Amsterdam for their first live shows, which proved so successful that a final concert was added, three months later, at Carnegie Hall."], "title": "Hasta la vista", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/10/worldmusic", "tags": ["World music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-11T23:01:00Z", "article": "Andy Warhol: Other Voices, Other Rooms Hayward Gallery, London SE1; until 18 Jan  It might have been a mistake to visit the new Andy Warhol exhibition with jet lag, but I doubt it; even after eight hours&apos; sleep, this show would be a soporific mess. Has ever an artist turned out so much boring and banal work, and in such incredibly vast quantities, as Warhol? The answer, emphatically, is no - and the more you see, even of the better stuff, the less interesting he becomes.  This exhibition, Other Voices, Other Rooms, curated by Eva Meyer-Hermann and arriving on our shores hot from a record-breaking stint in Amsterdam, claims to give us a fresh perspective on the artist, being concerned not with stylish screen prints and Campbell&apos;s soup cans, but with Warhol&apos;s work on film and television. However, in gathering up the tricky-to-exhibit detritus of a career that, even when it was on full throttle, was always less than the sum of its parts, the exhibition falls into an embarrassing bear trap, allowing itself to become beguiled - charmed as a lover, in fact - by stuff that simply does not deserve such reverence.  In the 1960s, when Warhol was telling people that all he wanted was to be rich and famous, the critics made the fatal mistake of refusing to take him at his word. Foxed by the artist&apos;s inarticulate, blissed-out take on the world, they did his work for him, helpfully claiming such statements as sublime parodies of society&apos;s obsession with money and celebrity. Four decades on, this show makes a similar error. Warhol never made any great claims for his film and TV work, which is why his most famous statement on the subject - &apos;Before I was shot, I always suspected I was watching TV instead of living life. Right when I was being shot, and ever since, I knew that I was watching television&apos; - is now regarded as profound rather than merely witty. So, Meyer-Hermann steps in. Other Voices, Other Rooms, named for the Truman Capote novel of the same name, is, she says, nothing less than &apos;the landscape of a human soul&apos;. And you thought it was just a load of crummy old videotapes. The show is divided into four. First: the entire contents of Time Capsule 92, a collection of ephemera that includes invitations, receipts, newspaper cuttings and Polaroids of celebrities. I looked at this lot - like the trashy contents of a teenager&apos;s bedroom - and all I could think was how little Joan Collins, one of Andy&apos;s many friends, has changed her look over the years. There was a Warhol drawing (I believe it was of Helena Rubinstein) that I would have liked to examine more closely, but such is the way the material is displayed, I would have needed a ladder to do so. So, let us move on.  The exhibition&apos;s middle section is devoted to Factory Diaries - video diaries featuring Liza Minnelli and others - and to Warhol&apos;s 1980s cable TV series: Fashion, Andy Warhol&apos;s TV and Andy Warhol&apos;s Fifteen Minutes. You can watch all 42 episodes of these shows, mostly rambling interviews with stars such as Mariel Hemingway and Duran Duran, in a neat viewing area designed to resemble an American flag (the stools in front of the TV screens are shaped like stars and the area is screened off with a boudoir curtain of red, white and blue fringing) - but they are unendurably terrible, worse than anything on UK Living, or whatever it&apos;s called these days. So I went back to the Factory Diaries and stared at artist Neke Carson painting a portrait of Andy with his bottom (the brush is stuck between his buttocks, like a cigarette between a pair of swollen lips). Not an edifying experience. More infuriating still are the audiotapes of Andy &apos;in conversation&apos;. I tried to listen to him chatting to Truman Capote at Trader Vic&apos;s but, my ears not being bionic, this proved impossible, like trying to pick out the sound of two small girls in a roomful of Wall Street traders. The show&apos;s third section is devoted to Warhol&apos;s films, 19 of which are screened here simultaneously. They are predictably voyeuristic, homoerotic films: men in pants (Horse), naked men (Nude Restaurant), men doing naughty things (Blow Job) - though the socialite actress Edie Sedgwick also appears in all her glassy-eyed glory. But, my God, they&apos;re boring and, since this (1963-69) is also the period when Tom Jones, Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate were made, you would perhaps be better off staying at home and joining a good online DVD service.  Finally, en route to the gift shop, is a room filled with Silver Clouds, Warhol&apos;s helium-filled, pillow-shaped balloons - an apt finale, given how sleepy most visitors will be by this point. Oh dear. Have I given the impression that this show  is a must-miss? I hope not. Because I truly long for people to go, especially those who persist in placing the words &apos;genius&apos; and &apos;Warhol&apos; in proximity. If anything can prick the Warhol myth, now as flabby as a Las Vegas slot-machine addict, this is it. In that sense, at least, Other Voices, Other Rooms is a must-see.

But the broadcast ban was introduced by then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd in October 1988. McQueen&apos;s film, Hunger, is set during the 1981 hunger strike. This has been corrected.    The most visceral scene in Hunger, Steve McQueen&apos;s austere film about the IRA martyr Bobby Sands, shows a group of naked detainees being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-welding prison officers in full riot gear. It is a moment of sustained, ritualistic violence in a work that is characterised by its poetic tone and slow, cumulative power. When McQueen talks about the scene, something happens to him. He becomes suddenly voluble, agitated to the point of inarticulacy. &apos;We had to do five takes,&apos; he says, shaking his head furiously as if trying to expunge the memory from his consciousness, &apos;and each time the actors were actually being beaten with the truncheons because, well, there was really no other way to do it and make it look convincing. At one point, I looked at the monitor, which I hardly ever do, and what I was seeing suddenly became real. It was real! Not film. Not fake. Real. I jumped up and started shouting: &quot;No! No! Cut! We have to stop. Just cut, cut! Stop this now!&quot;&apos; As he tells me this, his whole being seems to be grappling with the emotional fallout of that unsettling moment. He stares at his hands for a while. Then, after a few seconds, he says: &apos;See, the thing was, I was in control of this violence. I was in control of these men being beaten with batons. It was down to me. Me! I was in control of what was happening.&apos; I ask him what happened next. Did they call it a day? &apos;No. No,&apos; he says, animated again, &apos;I wanted to but the actors insisted on doing another take. We were really close. And we did another take. And we got it. By then, I was losing it. I just walked away. I had to get out of there. All this emotion just welled up inside me.&apos; McQueen hurried off the set to the bemusement of his crew, one of whom followed him thinking he was dissatisfied with the shoot. &apos;He realised I was upset and he left me alone,&apos; says McQueen. &apos;That&apos;s when I started sobbing. I just lost it. It got to me. The fucker got to me. I mean, I&apos;m a big guy. I never even cried at my father&apos;s funeral. But, suddenly, I was crying like a baby.&apos; Why does he think that particular scene affected him so deeply? &apos;Don&apos;t you understand?&apos; he says, sounding suddenly impatient.&apos;It was real. And it was awful. You could feel the brutality of what the prisoners had to go through. It was a glimpse of the awful, brutal reality of the H Blocks. It was like we had crossed a line and all of a sudden we were dancing with ghosts.&apos; In person, McQueen is a formidable presence, one of those big, burly guys who can alter the atmosphere of a room by entering it. Which is exactly what he does when he strides into the ornate surroundings of an elaborately decorated lounge in the Soho Hotel in London, where I have been summoned to meet him. Initially, he seems a little awkward in his own skin, but that may just be a manifestation of the unease he feels when he has to explain himself. At times, he comes across as defensive-going-on-combative and he occasionally struggles to find the right words, growing visibly impatient with himself when they won&apos;t come. There is something slightly haughty and oddly vulnerable about him. You can see why he would be unsettled by the idea that his own emotional security could be breached in the pursuit of his art, which tends towards the formal, controlled and uncompromising. A friend of mine from Northern Ireland, who has seen Hunger, said McQueen had &apos;pulled off the impossible&apos; by &apos;making an art film about the IRA&apos;. When I mention the term &apos;art film&apos;, McQueen thows me a fierce look. &apos;I don&apos;t know what you mean by that,&apos; he says. &apos;What I tried to do was make the strongest, most powerful film I could from the events and the story. It may not have the conventional narrative of most feature films but that is my way of grappling with the subject. Art has absolutely nothing to do with it.&apos; Hunger, despite, or maybe because of, its formal purity, is an unsettling film and does indeed dance with ghosts. It takes you inside one of the infamous H Blocks of the Maze. You remain there throughout apart from a few short interludes, one of which is also brutally shocking in its violence. The film utilises the three-act structure of a Greek tragedy. The first part evokes the claustrophobic and violent atmosphere inside the prison block during the prolonged dirty protest that led up to the hunger strike. The second act is a long breathing space, which takes the form of a 22-minute real-time discussion between Sands and a Catholic priest (a beautifully pitched performance from Liam Cunningham) about the morality of self-starvation. Brilliantly written by Enda Walsh, it is compelling, despite its length. The third act observes Sands&apos;s 66-day descent into emaciation and eventual death. In the preview screening I attended, the audience left the theatre in utter silence. &apos;I always had this rhythm in my head, where the film was like a river and the landscape around it,&apos; says McQueen, &apos;Then, all of a sudden, you&apos;re on this rapid and the landscape is fractured, things are not exactly what they seem any more, then there&apos;s a kind of waterfall. So, essentially, you&apos;re being taken downstream, then your reality is being questioned, then the slow fall.&apos; The film is defined by McQueen&apos;s uncompromising directorial style which, in its accrual of telling details - a jailer&apos;s grazed and swollen knuckles, a fly on a metal grille - and its poetic slowness, possesses a cumulative power that, by the end, is almost overwhelmingly intense. &apos;I watched it with three friends and it was just a shattering experience,&apos; says Danny Morrison, the writer and Republican activist from west Belfast, who acted as an intermediary between the hunger strikers and the leaders of Sinn Fein at the time, and visited Sands throughout his fast. &apos;You really get an idea of the brutality of the state and the prison officers, a brutality that was dismissed at the time as Republican propaganda. I really hope people go and see it, because it asks a fundamental question that is being asked again in Guant\u00e1namo Bay: is it morally right to treat people in captivity as if they were not human?&apos; At its centre, Hunger features an extraordinary performance by the young German-Irish actor Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands. Fassbender fasted for 10 weeks under medical supervision before the third part of the film was shot on a closed set. &apos;He committed himself totally to the part, and I think it changed him somehow,&apos; says McQueen. &apos;He became very inward, very philosophical. At one point, he became like Bob Marley in a way, philosophising about the meaning of life and shit. I was like, what the fuck is going on here?&apos; When Hunger won the Camera d&apos;Or for Best First Film at Cannes, Fassbender talked to Channel 4 News about the role and said: &apos;Whatever your feelings about their political views and what they had done to get into that situation in prison, killings and atrocities, what they did was extraordinary. To starve yourself to death? I couldn&apos;t do it.&apos; Some people may argue that Hunger never grapples with the wider context of the Troubles, nor does it engage with the killings and atrocities that were carried out in the name of Republicanism. It presumes a level of knowledge on the part of the audience that is rare in contemporary cinema - but this is both a strength of the film and a limitation. In the final part, in which the skeletal Sands falls into fitful reveries and remembrances, there are hallucinatory scenes of his childhood that struck me as the only false note in a film that otherwise eschews any kind of easy romanticism. Did he worry that his film could be construed as a homage to a certain strain of Republican fanaticism, or indeed any kind of political fanaticism that calls for blood sacrifice and martyrdom from its followers? &apos;No, I never think of things like that,&apos; he says. &apos;Maybe I&apos;m weird but that&apos;s not what is on my mind when I look at a subject like this. I am thinking about what I am doing and how best to do it.&apos; Did he, in making the film, identify with Sands and his cause? &apos;Well, I&apos;ve obviously never been in a situation like that. I&apos;m not an Irish nationalist; I&apos;m not a black South African. I essentially identify with both sides in the Irish conflict. I show what prisoner officers did, but also what they went through. I can see why they did the job. It was incredibly well-paid and there was not much work about. And they were brutalised, too. And many of them were murdered by the IRA. I show that, too.&apos; He pauses again, struggling to find the words. &apos;It&apos;s difficult, it&apos;s difficult, it&apos;s incredibly problematic, but I am an artist. I have no answers to the bigger political questions.&apos; The historical context of McQueen&apos;s film, which is never spelt out, is the IRA hunger strike of 1981 and the so-called dirty protest that preceded it. That protest was made in pursuit of special category status, the IRA&apos;s demand that its convicted members be allowed, among other things, to wear their own clothes instead of the standard prison uniform and not to do prison work.  The &apos;blanket men&apos;, as the protesting prisoners came to be known, pursued a long and dogged campaign of passive resistance, refusing to wear prison uniforms, wash, or slop out, and smearing their excrement on the walls and doors of their cells. Their demands were brushed aside by an intransigent Margaret Thatcher. Only a single 90-second snatch of film exists of conditions inside the H Blocks at the time, shot by an Ulster Television camera crew for a documentary that was subsequently banned by the government. It shows two prisoners, bedraggled and Christ-like, wrapped in dirty blankets, shouting out their demands from a filthy, excrement encrusted cell. From that image, the artist Richard Hamilton created the first work of art based on the H Blocks, a painting called The Citizen, which he completed in 1983. Twenty-five years later, with several former IRA men now sitting in the Northern Ireland Assembly, McQueen has created the second. &apos;What initially brought me to the subject was the notion of what an individual is capable of doing just in order to be heard,&apos; he says. &apos;I remember, as a kid, seeing Bobby Sands&apos;s image on the news every night and this number underneath, which, I later found out, corresponded to the number of days he had gone without food. That somehow stayed with me. People say, &quot;Oh, it&apos;s a political film&quot;, but, for me, it&apos;s essentially about what we, as humans, are capable of, morally, physically, psychologically. What we will inflict and what we can endure.&apos; McQueen lives in Amsterdam but he grew up in Ealing, west London, the son of West Indian immigrants. His father worked for London Transport and his mother was a nurse. As a teenager, he says, he was encouraged to &apos;get a trade&apos;. He did well at school and says his interest in art &apos;initially manifested itself solely in the idea of getting an education&apos;. He ended up at Goldsmiths, University of London, where, though unhappy with the theoretical thrust of the tutors, he obtained a first-class degree. &apos;I thought they had only one way of looking at things and I knew there was never only one way of looking at things,&apos; he says, sighing. He later attended New York University&apos;s film school, but was unhappier still. &apos;I hated it,&apos; he says. &apos;It was full of all these rich kids who could afford the fees. It was nothing to do with talent.&apos; McQueen, you sense, is essentially an outsider, someone whose work possesses a formal rigour which seems to be his unique way of making sense of often-difficult subject matter. His early short films were formally experimental and thematically elusive. In Deadpan, the closest he has come to comedy, he paid homage to Buster Keaton by standing stock still while the gable wall of a building collapsed around him. In another, Drumroll, which earned him the Turner Prize nomination, he pushed an oil drum through New York, with three cameras attached to it, each recording the city streets in perpetual revolution, while his polite but stentorian voice shouted out &apos;Excuse me!&apos; and &apos;Sorry!&apos; at baffled pedestrians. I ask him if his films emerge, however obliquely, out of self-exploration? Are they essentially about his own inner struggles? &apos;God, no!&apos; he shouts, startling both myself and the two hotel guests sitting opposite us. &apos;Don&apos;t even mention that in a newspaper. You cannot. I mean, come on! I&apos;m not that selfish. I have never been interested in me. What I&apos;m interested in is not I, it&apos;s we. Always. It&apos;s we: our history, our culture, whatever makes us who we are and informs how we act.&apos; Though he won the Turner Prize in 1999, McQueen is best known in this country as a campaigning war artist, having travelled to Iraq in 2003. He says his short time there was &apos;difficult and incredibly frustrating&apos;. The outcome was a work called Queen and Country, in which he proposes that all the British servicemen who died in Iraq be commemorated on postage stamps. The campaign to convince the Post Office to make the work a reality continues apace and McQueen tells me that, having elicited the support of most of the dead soldiers&apos; families, he recently had a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the project. &apos;I even received a thumbs-up from the Daily Mail,&apos; he says, laughing. &apos;Millimetre by millimetre, inch by inch, we are getting closer. Seven out of 10 people in the UK want the stamps to be produced. It&apos;s hard to argue with that. Ultimately, too, it&apos;s a whole lot more effective than erecting some bronze statue in a corner of London.&apos; McQueen sees no contradiction between the role of war artist who wants to commemorate the deaths of British soldiers in Iraq and film-maker who, some might say, makes a hero of Bobby Sands, the romantic figurehead of a terrorist organisation that waged a fitful guerrilla war on the British army with often deadly results. &apos;I go where my work leads me,&apos; he says, &apos;and try to explore the subject matter as imaginatively as I can. What was going on in the H Blocks was so big and yet it was swept under the carpet. People talk passionately about the abuses in Abu Ghraib, but the same thing was happening here in our own backyard. The hunger strike was one of the biggest political events in Britain in recent history. But it&apos;s already forgotten over here, swept aside. That&apos;s how Britain operates.&apos; There is a kind of controlled rage underpinning the film, generated by at the brutality that became a kind of normality in the H Blocks. That brutality undoubtedly fuelled the bloody war of attrition raging outside the prison walls. A French journalist who interviewed McQueen recently suggested his film should have been called &apos;Anger&apos; rather than Hunger. You can see what he was getting at.  &apos;I&apos;m essentially quite happy,&apos; he says, &apos;but, for some reason, I have done a lot of stuff that is dark. I don&apos;t know why that is and I don&apos;t question it. I don&apos;t really think you have a choice where you go as an artist. I mean, I would love to make a comedy, I really would.&apos; Does he think that might happen? &apos;No,&apos; he says, erupting, for the first time today, into hearty laughter. &apos;No, I wouldn&apos;t hold your breath waiting for that one.&apos;  \u2022 Hunger opens on 31 October McQueen: Life Story Life: Born in 1969 to West Indian immigrant parents, he grew up in west London. Studied at the Chelsea College of Art and Design, Goldsmiths, where he made his first short films, and New York University&apos;s Tisch School of Arts where he studied film. He lives in Amsterdam with his partner and young daughter. Selected works:  Bear(1993). A sexually charged encounter between two naked men (one of whom is McQueen).  Deadpan(1997). A restaging of the famous Buster Keaton stunt in which a house collapses around McQueen leaving him unscathed.  Drumroll (1998). Part of McQueen&apos;s 1999 Turner Prize-winning entry alongside Deadpan, it shows him pushing an oil drum through the streets of New York. Hunger (2008).

Queen and Country (ongoing): A series of postage stamps bearing the faces of British soldiers killed in Iraq. They were exhibited at the Imperial War Museum last year and McQueen is negotiating with Royal Mail to have them commissioned.  He says: &apos;British cinema could be in a much better state if only we could take more risks.&apos; They say: &apos;In Hunger, Steve McQueen reshapes conventional film language to reach the viewer on a primal level. You feel very strongly that if McQueen could impose a regime of fasting on every audience member before they saw the picture, he would do so without hesitation.&apos; Ryan Gilbey in The Observer", "sentences": ["What we will inflict and what we can endure.&apos; McQueen lives in Amsterdam but he grew up in Ealing, west London, the son of West Indian immigrants.", "He lives in Amsterdam with his partner and young daughter."], "title": "McQueen and country", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/12/2", "tags": ["Film", "Art and design", "Culture", "Steve McQueen"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-13T07:00:01Z", "article": "Someone was being a little unkind by scheduling the Riba Stirling prize, an annual architectural TV event hosted by Channel 4, at the same time as a BBC2 documentary celebrating fifty years of Blue Peter. It would be interesting to see the evening&apos;s ratings: it&apos;s hard to imagine who would choose to watch architects tucking into a slap-up meal in Liverpool on a Saturday night when one of the all-time favourite television programmes was on the other side. The residents of Accordia, a new housing scheme in Cambridge, were surely among those who chose the architecture slot over Blue Peter. Why? Because Accordia was the favourite to win the prize, which is made in association with the Architects&apos; Journal; and their faith was rewarded when Accordia was voted the winner. Now in its 13th year, the Stirling claims to be architecture&apos;s Turner prize, and though this is no recommendation, it does help to generate publicity. This, presumably, is what the architects themselves hope for - especially this year, when the foundations of the financial markets underpinning so much new building are proving to be flimsy at best. The choice of Accordia is, though, a good one. This is some of the very best new housing anywhere in Britain, and it is good new housing that we find it so very hard to design and build today. The scheme has been designed not by a single star architect, but by a collaboration between Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, Alison Brooks Architects and Macreanor Lavington. Here on a former military site in Cambridge is a fine composition of varied flats and houses that work together well. Some are gathered around courtyards. Some boast rooftop gardens. All faces commonly shared public gardens where children can play safely, and each is as unpretentious as it is generously planned and well-detailed. It is, in fact, quite astonishing to find British housebuilders and planners going along with the design and construction of such decent new homes.  The judges did well to choose Accordia. A prize for a collaboration between architects might not seem so obviously newsworthy as one won by a single big-name architect, but in housing at least it might well be one of the best ways forward. If bright younger practices like Alison Brooks and Macreanor Lavington can be teamed up with established firms, then originality and experience can be merged to produce intelligent new designs.  The other Stirling contenders were Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena Station by Grimshaw and ARCADIS Architecten, Manchester Civil Justice Centre by Denton Corker Marshall, Nord Park Cable Railway, Innsbruck by Zaha Hadid Architects, the Royal Festival Hall renovation, London by Allies and Morrison and Westminster Academy at the Naim Dangoor Centre, London by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris.  A quick look at previous winners does suggest that the Stirling prize is a perennial child of its times. When it began in 1996, and Manchester&apos;s regeneration after the IRA bombing was in the headlines, the prize went to the Centenary Building, University of Salford, by Hodder Associates - a building that with the best will in the world, is not some that would tear you away from the antics of John Noakes and Shep if it was presented on telly today. Equally, the award made to Norman Foster&apos;s striking 30 St Mary Axe (aka the Gherkin) was at a time when there was great excitement about the latest development in new City skyscrapers, an excitement somewhat deflated now that City money appears to be as trustworthy as a Bob Maxwell pension scheme. Today, the big architectural concern in Britain is decent housing, and to their credit the Stirling judges have plumped for one of the very best schemes Britain has to offer. If only the prize itself could get away from its asinine &quot;glittering occasion&quot; presentation, it might yet be taken as seriously as it deserves to be - at least when it is awarded to projects like Accordia, a scheme that promises to transcend fads and fashion.", "sentences": ["The other Stirling contenders were Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena Station by Grimshaw and ARCADIS Architecten, Manchester Civil Justice Centre by Denton Corker Marshall, Nord Park Cable Railway, Innsbruck by Zaha Hadid Architects, the Royal Festival Hall renovation, London by Allies and Morrison and Westminster Academy at the Naim Dangoor Centre, London by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris."], "title": "Jonathan Glancey on the winner of the 2008 Stirling prize for architecture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/oct/12/stirling-prize-accordia-architecture", "tags": ["Architecture", "Stirling prize", "Liverpool 2008: European capital of culture", "Culture", "Communities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-13T23:01:00Z", "article": "The Dutch crime novelist Janwillem van de Wetering, who has died aged 77, began writing his series of offbeat, internationally successful thrillers in his 40s, having been a globetrotting businessman, a special constable in Amsterdam, and resident of a Japanese monastery. As steeped in worldly shenanigans as he was in mystical forces beyond it, De Wetering allowed his &quot;Amsterdam Cops&quot;, De Gier and Grijpstra, time to commune Zen-like by adapting Bach for their flute and snare-drum sessions as relief from &quot;the always-false world of activity&quot; fighting crime. Rarely have the fictional world-weary shown such brio. Wetering was born in Rotterdam, the son of a rich businessman who dealt in a wide variety of commodities. Although Wetering himself was to follow in his commercial footsteps, he also developed an early preoccupation with philosophy wrought by Rotterdam&apos;s wartime destruction and the deaths of Jewish friends. He read widely while studying at the University of Delft, and during a year at Cambridge, but in 1952 his father found him sales work with a firm in Cape Town, South Africa. The city&apos;s artistic life proved more galvanising; briefly, but influentially, married to an artist, Edyth, he refused a Johannesburg transfer, and remained at large until studying philosophy at King&apos;s College London in 1957. By way of Christianity, Socrates, and the modish philosophies of Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and existentialism, in 1958 he took a five-week voyage to Japan for an open-ended stay in a Kyoto monastery to study Zen Buddhism, a time recalled in his memoir The Empty Mirror (1971).  The place was not hidebound, its master being a baseball enthusiast who, &quot;when an important match was on would lock his house and nobody could see him&quot;. What&apos;s more, there were days when general rules were suspended and residents could seek different diversions: on one occasion, Wetering was startled, in others&apos; company, to find himself at a gay brothel where some girls, installed to fool the police, were so delighted to find that they were unexpectedly required that he had to be retrieved by taxi next day. With funds dwindling, in 1960 he left the monastery, where he had also chanced with delight upon the recently published, idiosyncratic detective novels of the Dutch-born ambassador to Japan, Robert van Gulik, who, in his turn, had been inspired by ancient Chinese detective techniques. In resuming a life in business, Wetering reached South America. After spending time in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, he headed for the Peruvian capital Lima, where he married Juanita Levy before working in real estate in Brisbane, Australia. He returned to Holland in 1965. Such prolonged absence meant that he had fallen foul of national service obligations, but jail was averted when a female civil servant suggested his joining Amsterdam&apos;s reserve constabulary. &quot;The idea staggered me,&quot; he said. &quot;I never knew that one could be a policeman in one&apos;s spare time.&quot; From 1968 he served for seven years while, amid this and continuing work, he sought another monastic residence, in America - described in A Glimpse of Nothingness (1975). By now, the elements were in place for 15 novels, beginning with Outsider in Amsterdam (1975, and adapted for the cinema in 1979), about debonair, footloose, cat-loving sergeant Rinus de Gier and his colleague, 10 years older, Henk Grijpstra, a burly man whose fine, blue suits are as frayed as his marriage to an even larger wife. Ingenious plots are secondary to the detectives&apos; partnership. A sideways view of life drives prose which Wetering himself translated into such nifty English as &quot;crazy people carry the country&apos;s genius&quot;.  Buoyed by his writing success, Wetering, along with Juanita and their daughter Thera, moved to Surry, in the US state of Maine in the 1970s, though the novels met a mid-1980s hiatus when the family sailed the American coast. Wider travels were as diverse as a return to England and an exploration of the uninhabited, remote Papua New Guinea for which De Gier and Grijpstra&apos;s boss, the commissaris, sometimes yearns. In resuming the series with the splendid Just a Corpse at Twilight (1994), Wetering contrived Maine settings (the Dutch detectives had already visited Japan). He also proved an imaginative children&apos;s writer, creating the character Hugh Pine the porcupine and, as well as writing a study of Robert van Gulik (1988), was a widely published essayist still pained by &quot;an inability to play the jazz trumpet&quot;. No longer smoking or drinking, he said that he was &quot;kept by a superior dog and has become allergic to the guru syndrome&quot;.

Let&apos;s review them, and work where the 2008 laureate belongs. 1. &quot;A Star is Born&quot; \u2013 eg Yann Martel or DBC Pierre. These shooting stars come from nowhere, and are overnight mega-bright. 2. The literary &quot;Long Service Good Conduct&quot; medal - eg Iris Murdoch and Kingsley Amis. &quot;OK, The Old Devils and The Sea, The Sea wasn&apos;t their best work - but no one ever lost their job for ordering IBM and it&apos;s a safe choice&quot;. 3. &quot;Let&apos;s for God&apos;s sake have a book this year that people will really enjoy reading&quot; - eg Byatt&apos;s Possession, Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. This, sad to say, is the slimmest category in the Booker archive. It won&apos;t be swollen this year. 4. &quot;This is the Britain&apos;s premier fiction prize, but let&apos;s show how &apos;post-British&apos; we are&quot; - the last four prizes (including that for 2008) have been won by two Indians (one resident in Mumbai, one in New York) and two citizens of Eire (one resident in Dublin, the other in New York). Anyone for home cooking? Or is it hot dogs and vindaloo washed down with a pint of Guinness? 5. &quot;Let&apos;s give him/her a prize before the poor old sod dies&quot; - eg Paul Scott (who did, unfortunately, snuff it before he could enjoy his victory) and William Golding (who won aged 70). 6. &quot;Let&apos;s give it to a fucking good fucking novel that isn&apos;t afraid to use the word fuck&quot; - eg James Kelman. &quot;And fuck Anita Brookner&apos;s wimpery. We&apos;re a tough-guy panel&quot;. 7. &quot;Let&apos;s be masochistic and give it to a novelist who, we know, despises prizes and won&apos;t even turn up to collect it&quot; - eg JM Coetzee. 8. &quot;Let&apos;s give it to the novelist who should have won it for his last novel - even though this one ain&apos;t so hot&quot; - eg Ian McEwan and Amsterdam. 9. &quot;We&apos;re out of our minds - lock us up before we do more damage to Literature&quot; - eg &quot;G&quot; and (forgive me New Zealand) The Bone People. 10. &quot;Jesus Christ, we&apos;re in luck. This is a masterpiece!&quot; - Midnight&apos;s Children (triple Booker winner), In a Free State. One could go on. The wonder is that, whatever the spin, the Man Booker invariably comes up with a novel which makes us think about what good fiction is. In which of the above categories does The White Tiger belong? Clearly there&apos;s an element of shooting star. For most of us Aravind Adiga was an unknown quantity before 2008. Clearly, too, his novel is what I&apos;ve called &quot;post-British&quot;. And it confirms a widening ripple in the Booker&apos;s sense of what the novel, as a genre, should do. Thirty years ago, I believe, Philip Hensher&apos;s introvertedly English Sheffield saga, The Northern Clemency, would have won hands down. Twenty years ago, I think some beloved old soldier (Beryl Bainbridge, for example, or John Le Carr\u00e9) would have been in with a strong chance.

However, she warned that the present economic climate made it hard to imagine digital media providing a rich revenue stream. Delivering the opening keynote speech to the World Association of Newspapers digital publishing conference in Amsterdam, Little painted a picture of a depressed industry. &quot;There&apos;s an unprecedented amount of gloom and doom enveloping the media business these days. Newsrooms are getting smaller. Media companies with once-obscene profit margins are now struggling to maintain profits at all. Foreign bureaux are being shuttered; investigative units being dismantled,&quot; she said. &quot;When I agreed to come here, I also didn&apos;t know that the title of my talk would be about the digital revenue goldmine. It&apos;s hard to imagine anything being a goldmine right now,&quot; she added. Little said that, to compound the depressed state of the industry, newspaper websites with the largest reach and audience still failed to deliver significant revenue to publishers. &quot;With these tremendous audiences and reach, the revenues digital newspapers have enjoyed remain a small fraction of their print counterparts,&quot; she said. &quot;For example, the New York Times and the Washington Post are at the top of the heap in terms of their percentage of online revenue as part of overall revenue. In both cases it&apos;s below 20%. It&apos;s not nearly enough.&quot; Little - who is advising Guardian News &amp; Media on its US expansion - told delegates that too many news providers still used their sites for the basic task of republishing their print or broadcast content and that they need to expand their horizons. &quot;Keep one foot rooted in the core journalism values of the core product, and one that happens to be delivering the most revenue, and with the other, stretch as far as possible to try new things in this new medium,&quot; she said. &quot;The news websites share the same journalistic values as the newspapers, but the web folks also are working in a medium that&apos;s indisputably different, one that requires trying new things and sometimes going down in flames,&quot; Little added. &quot;Fear of failure can be debilitating. All we have to lose by being too conservative is everything.&quot; Little highlighted four key areas she had identified for successful digital growth: multimedia storytelling, developing database journalism, improving reader engagement and embracing the world of fragmented media distribution. She said the almost limitless storage space offered by the web was perfect for building databases for readers, highlighting how Washingtonpost.com had exploited congressional voting databases going back to 1991 and built a searchable list of US war dead in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

I&apos;m away. In Amsterdam, in fact. This is the first time for many years that I haven&apos;t been with her on her birthday. I ring before leaving to say sorry that I won&apos;t be with her to celebrate her 84th birthday. &quot;Is it my birthday?&quot; she says. &quot;Oh well. I&apos;m not bothered about that stuff. I&apos;m all discombobulated.&quot;  Although it feels strange not to be with her, I am also relieved. It&apos;s a time to get away and take stock: of Mum&apos;s care, of my exhaustion and my decision to finish the column, which I&apos;ve been writing since January 2007.. My exhaustion is not physical, because others are now taking on more of Mum&apos;s care - my brother and sister, and her grandchildren. My exhaustion is mental, the result of the parallel existence that has to be lived trying to keep someone with dementia relatively independent - the organising and paying of carers, the endless appointments, the worrying about Mum&apos;s shopping and supplies, dealing with emergencies and, of course, wondering when the next one will strike.  The aim of the column was to document what it was like coping with an elderly and increasingly dependent relative. Over the past two years I&apos;ve become increasingly aware how little the medical profession and social services recognise the reality of looking after people with dementia. I&apos;ve been with doctors who insist on talking only to Mum, giving her complicated instructions that she&apos;ll never follow. I&apos;ve witnessed hospitals treating Mum as if she is just a collection of different ailments all requiring endless follow-up appointments, which it is assumed she will travel to herself. I&apos;ve seen the way that there is no coordination or continuity of her care. Most strikingly, I&apos;ve witnessed what sometimes feels like a convenient blindness as to just how much goes into keeping a dementia sufferer afloat in her own home, what they call &quot;coping reasonably well independently&quot;. So I need a break. But once away in Amsterdam, I&apos;m assailed by sadness. It&apos;s Mum&apos;s enthusiasms that keep waylaying me. We&apos;re walking in the Hortus Botanicus and all I can think of is how, with her enthusiasm for plants and gardens, she would have loved to be here. Hers has never been the sort of enthusiasm of the doughty ladies who appear on Gardeners&apos; World strolling round beautifully tended grounds identifying plants by their Latin names. Mum has lived most of her adult life in a council flat with a small balcony. But she was always passionate about plants and greenery and nature, and had a strong eye for design. In the 1960s she was one of the first to get a cheeseplant and put it in our G Plan flat. We were the only people on the estate whose flat wasn&apos;t all swirls and colours. Mum painted it white and put hessian on the walls, bought Swedish minimalist furniture, and bold plant prints, despising chintz nearly half a century before Ikea.  Later in Amsterdam, we go to the Van Gogh museum. He was never one of her favourites but again it&apos;s Mum who immediately comes to mind, with the passions she had at one time for drawing and, latterly, art. Like many things she did, her drawing was untutored, but she was naturally able - &quot;teachable&quot;, as my artist friend would say. She used to sketch branches, trees and flowers so it&apos;s Van Gogh&apos;s rather Japanese blossom paintings that remind me of her.  I buy her a print to take back, but what I really want is for her to be here, for her to be able to enjoy it. Why did I never make the time to bring her? Sadly, Mum never had any confidence - in her intuition, her abilities, her tastes or herself. When we were young, she was always ashamed of our small flat and discouraged us from bringing our &quot;posh friends&quot; home. We stayed crammed into this flat even through adolescence with tensions between my parents and us children seething and erupting mainly because my father - prescient man - thought that mortgages were &quot;immoral&quot;. But Mum hated it and hated domesticity and railed against her fate. &quot;You can&apos;t bring them back to this pigsty,&quot; she would say, usually in my father&apos;s hearing, as a dig at what she felt were his failures. I&apos;ve long ceased to dwell on those difficulties and have come to appreciate her extraordinary spirit. What she lacked as a mother she more than made up for as a grandmother. Not through gifts, but by &quot;being there&quot;, offering to take them out, riding the front of buses, taking them to galleries, never judging through adolescent excesses. In return, they all adore her. For all its terrible problems, what this period of dementia - and writing about it - has given me is a chance to process ambivalent feeling and old resentments, something denied to people who lose their parents suddenly. It&apos;s like a long, slow goodbye. In spite of beautiful weather in Amsterdam, it&apos;s the sadness that clings. Everything reminds me of her. I buy bulbs thinking that I&apos;ll plant some for her balcony and then wonder, where will she be next spring? I want so much to take her to places like this and now I&apos;ll never have that chance.  I only took her abroad twice, once to Venice for a week, which she adored. The children were small and she threw herself into their enthusiasm and pleasures, getting on and off vaporettos just for the hell of it, beside herself with pleasure when on the flight home the pilot invited her and the children into the cabin to go over the Alps. I can still see her expression when she ordered a glass of wine at a stall in the square at Verona. &quot;It cost 50p,&quot; she said ecstatically. Her attitude to abroad was like the St Trinian&apos;s cartoon that has the girls by a town fountain, one of them saying, &quot;It&apos;s wine!&quot; The only other time was when she and I had a &quot;free&quot; Eurostar trip to Lille. It was brilliantly sunny and brilliant fun, with Mum enthusing round the town. We ended up in the square in the sun with Mum raising her glass - &quot;This is the life!&quot; Why didn&apos;t I do this more often, I ask myself now? Why was I always so busy? This is why there will be no more columns. Because the person I want to remember is that one, with her enthusiasms and energy, raising her glass to life, greeting most things with &quot;Oh sooper.&quot; Already it&apos;s becoming difficult. It&apos;s as if someone has taken a rubber and smudged the edges off her. So much is about health and illness now, about tussles with the NHS, the horrors in which Mum and her sharp humour find ever fewer opportunities to shine. I feel I&apos;ve been able to pay Mum tribute not as someone pathetically dependent and old but still with her sharpness intact, and her free spirit, still somehow outfoxing the patronage of the medical institutions and, even in the havoc her condition brings, causing laughter. But if I am to remain truthful, the coming hardships may strip her of this. I want to leave it where, as one reader kindly said, there is still joy among the sadness. If I continued, it would be increasingly with the indignities and decline. Mum herself does not really seem to mind. &quot;No, no,&quot; she said the other night, &quot;write what you like. I&apos;d like to find out about myself.&quot; But not everyone in my family has seen it that way and I&apos;ve met some opposition for &quot;invading her privacy&quot;. I know there are greater difficulties ahead, decisions we will have to take about how she is looked after, how we deal with decline, and sadly there will probably be more family conflict. While I genuinely believe it has been, and would continue to be, a good thing to explore this publicly - because these issues affect so many people now - simultaneously I know that to continue would not leave open the possibility of healing family division. My mind was focused on this when I went to a showing of a film made by a talented Argentinian director about his mother. In his talk he described the problem of &quot;sacrificing his family&quot;, which he felt was justified by how much he had also given of himself. But in the pub afterwards, someone asked, &quot;Could you have made it if your mother was alive?&quot; He hesitated. Another filmmaker there turned to me quietly and said: &quot;I couldn&apos;t. Because of my siblings. They all have different stories of my parents. It&apos;s their story as much as mine.&quot; In the coming, more difficult times, I recognise that it&apos;s important that they have their own stories not dominated by mine. Writing this column, I&apos;ve realised that there is a taboo about being explicit about the process of ageing. This is not so much about death, but about the disintegration, decay and indignities of ageing and the shifts in dependency that come with it. Ageing may be a perfectly natural process, but somehow detailing these changes, and the care needed, is seen as &quot;shaming&quot; the person involved, robbing them of their personhood. It can rub off on the writer. I think some people are so horrified by the process that they would rather not have to think about it. In the mid 1980s, when my children were born, I remember the late Angela Carter advising me in typically flamboyant terms never to let newspaper editors hear the children in the background. If they knew I was distracted by caring for children they wouldn&apos;t take me seriously. Well, feminism, including Angela herself, changed those attitudes, but not attitudes towards that other caring that goes on unseen, the care for elderly parents. I&apos;ve sat through several work meetings recently where men have left early. &quot;I have to pick up the children on Tuesdays,&quot; they say, striding out with an aura of being &quot;good dads&quot;. I wait to the end. How would it go down if I said, &quot;I need to get over to my old mother&apos;s to check she&apos;s had her tea&quot;? It will take another revolution like feminism to make society accept that this is something that can&apos;t be hidden away, needing as much respect and support as childcare. I know from the large amount of correspondence that vast numbers are affected by this, people who are struggling with the lack of coordinated support for them as carers and the lack of recognition of the needs of the elderly, especially the increasing numbers of those with Alzheimer&apos;s and dementia.  I&apos;ve also learned from readers&apos; emails that the seeds of change are there. I&apos;ve been told about support networks such as the Alzheimer&apos;s Association, about new research into caring for dementia. But there&apos;s a long way to go before this awareness becomes so powerful that it changes social attitudes and provision. As one reader wrote to me about fighting for improvements to her mother&apos;s treatment, &quot;I&apos;m doing this not for my mother but because this is the fate that awaits all of us.&quot; Strangely, my mother knew Angela Carter, although she never realised that she was a &quot;famous novelist&quot;. Our kids were at the same primary school and if my mother collected them she often sat chatting to Angela on the bench outside.  It was typical of Angela Carter that she related to my wayward, eccentric mother, another spinner of yarns, who would tell Angela about her wild childhood in the Potteries, the local boys who courted her and the arrival of the mysterious older teacher (my father) who romanced her as a sixth former and then destroyed her spirit, a veritable Bluebeard in the telling. When my daughter was born, Angela suggested I should call her Sybil after my mother who often says of herself, &quot;I&apos;m a wicked witch.&quot; Perhaps I should have done but I had inherited my mother&apos;s dislike of her own name. As it turned out, it didn&apos;t matter. My daughter was a kindred spirit anyway. The birthday present I&apos;ve left her turns out to be strangely apposite. Earlier in the year at the Chelsea Flower Show I had bought various things bearing this year&apos;s insignia - tulips. Not so long ago, before her dementia, Mum had come to Chelsea with me, my partner, John, and my friend Lee. At one point, in true Chelsea style, it poured with rain and we found ourselves sitting watching a brass band playing with rain dripping into our Pimm&apos;s, dressed in giveaway macs. We laughed so much at the daftness of it all that we were hysterical, and no one more than Mum. When I ring her from Amsterdam I ask her whether she likes the present from Chelsea and whether it brings back memories of that day. But she doesn&apos;t seem to have registered the presents at all. &quot;Well, there&apos;s such a big heap here it might have got lost.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; I say and I&apos;m wondering if I&apos;m jealous. &quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m being sarcastic.&quot; So although we spend her birthday apart, she&apos;s on my mind. I feel sad, free, torn. I&apos;m sad I didn&apos;t do those things with her I always thought I would one day. I wonder if I have done enough.

He would eat around them like a small bird pecking out breadcrumbs. At the end of every meal, the vegetables would be there, winking at him and waiting to be eaten. Things hadn&apos;t always been this difficult. At 20 months old, Freddie had been happy to eat vegetables. When he turned two it all changed. I blame a birthday present. It was a white plastic spoon with wings, in the shape of an aeroplane. &quot;Here&apos;s a flying one,&quot; my husband Chris would say as he attempted to land a spoonful of broccoli into Freddie&apos;s mouth.  &quot;Open the aircraft hangar!&quot; Freddie&apos;s mouth clamped shut. Chris&apos;s commentary became more elaborate. The toddler became more resolute. &quot;The airport is shut,&quot; was one of his first sentences.  I had hoped that his aversion to vegetables would fade as he grew older. If anything, it became more intense. And one night, after an argument over seven peas, I had the idea for the Great Big Vegetable Challenge. It is OK to have things that you hate eating, but you can&apos;t ban an entire food group. Freddie systematically refused all vegetables so I would systematically offer him the entire alphabet. The rules of engagement were simple. We would eat our way through the A to Z of vegetables, trying out at least three recipes per vegetable and Freddie would score each dish. We set up a blog, appealing to parents around the world to join us on our journey.  Our first vegetable was the artichoke. The morning after the Great Big Vegetable Challenge was conceived, I checked the blog. Already there was commiseration from Calgary, angst from Amsterdam and nuggets of wisdom from Norfolk. A comment left by a grandmother in Italy, recommended slicing artichoke hearts onto pizzas. Freddie tasted them and quietly conceded that he quite liked them. As the weeks went on, the Great Big Vegetable Challenge took on a life of its own. Freddie monitored the visits by people around the globe and felt a responsibility to his virtual public to face up to the challenge of putting fork to mouth. My job was simply to bring the recipes to life. The tension was beginning to disappear from mealtimes.  Finding a vegetable for each letter of the alphabet became an obsession. I would take elaborate detours on my journey to work to track them down. I rose at six to take the early train into Chinatown to find the giant daikon, later taking it through the elaborate security procedures in Whitehall. &quot;I don&apos;t have a Blackberry,&quot; I joked. &quot;But this is a daikon and it doesn&apos;t connect to the internet.&quot; Security officers are not hired for their sense of humour. I tried to tell him about the Great Big Vegetable Challenge but he x-rayed the daikon all the same.  As a family we tasted nopales (a type of cactus), nori (seaweed), sampled the bitter karela, braved stinging nettles and foraged for sorrel and rock samphire. We grew tomatoes and herbs in tubs, mushrooms in a box under the sink, tasted 10 different lettuces for the League of Lettuce and held a Party for Pea Haters (there are a surprisingly high number of them). Even if he didn&apos;t like something, Freddie would try it, knowing that we would soon move on to the next vegetable, the next challenge.  Our fridge, renamed the Naming and Shaming Fridge, tells the whole story of our two-year alphabetical expedition. Freddie moves vegetable magnets up and down depending on how he rates each recipe. There are three categories: &quot;vegetables I hate&quot;; &quot;vegetables I&apos;m not sure about&quot; and &quot;vegetables I like&quot;. At the start of the challenge all but potato and sweetcorn sat in the &quot;I hate&quot; category. Now the fridge paints a different picture. Very few vegetables are hated. Many sit in a state of suspended hope, waiting to be loved. The golden ones look down from their exalted position, basking in the glory of being liked.  I started the Great Big Vegetable Challenge out of desperation. Nowadays I am at the receiving end of other people&apos;s anxieties. The other morning I opened an email with the subject: &quot;Desperate mother - Please help!&quot; I could imagine her pounding away at the keyboard, breathlessly detailing her child&apos;s refusal to eat any fruit or vegetables. &quot;What can I do? How did you do it?&quot; I showed Freddie the email and asked him what he would recommend. He took a deep breath and said: &quot;Start her on the artichoke and pancetta pizzas, then courgette quesadillas and end up with the beetroot and chocolate cake.&quot;", "sentences": ["Already there was commiseration from Calgary, angst from Amsterdam and nuggets of wisdom from Norfolk."], "title": "Breaking the veg barrier", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/18/children-eating-vegetables", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Vegetables"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-17T23:01:00Z", "article": "The published version of Ian McEwan &apos;s libretto for Michael Berkeley&apos;s opera For You became a collector&apos;s item even before its launch in June. There is a signed limited edition hardback, but the standard paperback contains the same bibliographic oddity: on the first page, it proudly announces that the opera received its first performance on &quot;31 May 2008 at Theatr Brycheiniog&quot;. It didn&apos;t. The opera will be premiered at the Royal Opera House&apos;s Linbury Studio later this month, having been postponed just a few days before the planned premiere in Brecon, an event that should have been one of the highlights of this year&apos;s Hay festival. Opera has a long and honourable tradition of postponed premieres, and Berkeley and McEwan find themselves in good company. Wagner, Verdi, Mozart and many others since endured their share of delays. For Berkeley there is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as the only copy of the score of his opera Jane Eyre was stolen from his car shortly before rehearsals in 2000. The reason for delay this time is more prosaic: the leading singer, baritone Eric Roberts, who had battled against throat problems throughout rehearsals, was forced to withdraw. &quot;We probably should have made a decision earlier,&quot; Berkeley says. &quot;Paradoxically, Eric&apos;s determination and commitment meant we went right up until the last minute, by which time it was too late to get anyone else.&quot; Alan Opie will sing the role at the Linbury, and while the technical teams have used the intervening months to rejig direction and design, McEwan and Berkeley say they haven&apos;t changed a word or note of their study of sexual obsession and overweening artistic arrogance, which centres on an eminent and monstrous composer/ conductor, Charles Frieth, and his increasingly fevered m\u00e9nage \u00e0 six with his wife, one of his many lovers, his assistant, housekeeper and family doctor. Berkeley and McEwan have been friends since the late 70s, when McEwan became a client of Berkeley&apos;s wife, the literary agent Deborah Rogers. They mapped out the themes of For You during long country walks, but they have been talking about working on an opera since 1982, when they collaborated on the anti-nuclear weapons oratorio Or Shall We Die?. When the piece was first performed \u2014 Richard Eyre filmed it for Channel 4 \u2014 it was a popular success, but critically dismissed. It was revived earlier this summer in Cardiff, as part of celebrations of Berkeley&apos;s 60th birthday, and the composer had the gratifying experience of several critics apologising to him for their earlier judgments. Both men say they wouldn&apos;t write the piece in exactly the same way today, but they decided not to make any changes for the revival. The theme of a mature artist looking back at the work of his younger self features prominently in For You, with Frieth perplexed at how unmoved he is by his early triumphs. McEwan&apos;s own earliest work is regularly reprinted and therefore, potentially, changeable. &quot;I do sometimes pick up early stuff, but all I want to change is the punctuation,&quot; he says. &quot;There was a stretch in my early writing life when I wanted to do something different with paragraphs and probably got a little too influenced by Samuel Beckett in using commas for full stops. But that was the story, so it feels wrong to change it. Not that I don&apos;t sympathise with people such as Auden who massively revised their work, but thank God for Edward Mendelson, who has ensured that we have the original Auden as well.&quot; Over the years since Or Shall We Die? they have periodically considered adapting novellas by writers including Stefan Zweig, Herman Melville and Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg. Zweig and S\u00f6derberg in particular led them towards the idea of sexual obsession, and of one character encouraging another to do the thing they wanted to do. As they developed the plot, they laid down ground rules for any performance. McEwan was adamant that he wanted surtitles. Berkeley, after some initial reticence, now declares himself &quot;completely converted&quot; to them, &quot;especially if you have a text where every word counts and the nuances are very important. You can always avert your eyes if you really want to.&quot; McEwan didn&apos;t do any specific research into how libretti work, but says his words \u2014 &quot;which include much more iambic pentameter than I had first envisaged&quot; \u2014 amount to a &quot;measured prose. I wanted a fairly plain, acceptable modern English that wasn&apos;t archaic or too bathetically modern: people don&apos;t sing: &apos;Pass the salt &apos;.&quot; The other condition they agreed on was &quot;to use the whole operatic train set&quot;. There is a Don Giovanni sent to hell ending and opportunities for the singers to combine in a sextet. McEwan says that both he and Berkeley are &quot;always a little disappointed to go to an opera and not get those moments when everyone is singing something different at the same time. Someone is saying &apos;I thought you loved me&apos;, someone else &apos;Leave me alone&apos;, another recapping what&apos;s just happened . And they are all in different emotional tones. It&apos;s the thing opera can do that no other art form can.&quot; McEwan began writing the libretto in breaks between working on his music-saturated novel On Chesil Beach. He would feed scenes to Berkeley, who would respond by playing McEwan outlines of the music \u2014 &quot;mostly via the Sibelius computer programme, which might sound like a band of kazoos, but does contain harmony and everything&quot; \u2014 so McEwan had a sense of what his words would sound like from the beginning. &quot;And that was quite a fillip because the words came alive.&quot; McEwan used to &quot;play the flute badly&quot; and so can read music. He also \u2014&quot;and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever told Michael this&quot; \u2014 played banjo in a trad jazz band: &quot;Maybe we&apos;ll use that if we ever do a Kurt Weill thing. But I am quite interested in the technical side of music, so it&apos;s been a particular pleasure to write inside music and about music and, of course, to have it set to music.&quot; Music has long featured in his fiction. The Booker-winning Amsterdamcontained another composer seized by hubris, and a very early short story was about murderous jealousy in a string quartet. He acknowledges that other themes in For You \u2014 &quot;the sexual obsession might run out of Enduring Love, the business of how a misunderstanding can lead to catastrophe&quot; \u2014 also fit well into his wider body of work. Berkeley, too, sees the work as an integral part of his career. &quot;I&apos;ve always been attracted to slightly dark and turbulent things, although I use quite a lyrical language a lot of the time. My clarinet concerto fi ts into that, as does my first opera, Baa Baa Black Sheep, which was really about the child abuse suffered by Rudyard Kipling. Equally, in Jane Eyre, there is ultimately a terrible price paid by the characters.&quot;  Berkeley drew on his own early music to reflect Frieth&apos;s early work. &quot;When he talks about his oboe concerto, there&apos;s a quote from my early oboe concerto, which seemed the right way to make the language of the music organic.&quot; Berkeley also drew on personal experience in scoring the tyrannical musician. &quot;I have seen conductors, more often than composers, close to megalomania. I once interviewed Karajan and he had the whole of the Berlin Phil on the stage at the Festival Hall waiting for a rehearsal. Our slot ended, but Karajan wanted to keep talking. After a while there was a rather tentative knock on the door and the leader of the orchestra poked his head round and said, &apos;Maestro, the orchestra are waiting on the stage.&apos; Karajan literally shouted &apos;Raus! Raus!&apos; and shooed this rather distinguished musician away.&quot; Yet Berkeley found he had more sympathy for the appalling Charles than he or McEwan anticipated. &quot;Charles is something of a devil, but even he is deeply moved when at his wife&apos;s hospital bed, and the music reflects that. And while Ian envisaged his last great work, Demonic Aubade, as being monstrous hyperbole and a pretty unbearable summation of the man, it would have been fatal to end the opera with parody. You can&apos;t end with terrible music.&quot; Berkeley notes that Charles is a successful composer, and so he tried to write appropriately powerful music. &quot;And to be honest, I found the wordsrather uplifting in a way that Ian probably thought I shouldn&apos;t. Opera likes the volume turned up on emotions, and so what might have started off as parodic and over-the-top works very well operatically.&quot; There are plans for a larger orchestral production in Italy, Switzerland and Germany later this year, but they hope that the current modest size, six singers and 16 musicians, will enable small companies to stage it. Berkeley is aware of the pitfalls. &quot;Opera is a complicated beast. Many concert-hall colleagues steer clear of it because you&apos;re really not allowed to fail. Donizetti and Bellini put on loads of operas before they got to the ones that we still play now. That freedom to get things wrong doesn&apos;t exist so much now. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve been so careful in terms of working closely with each other, as well as with conductor Michael Rafferty and director Michael McCarthy, to make sure everyone can put their tuppence in. There really are so many hurdles, you need all the help you can get.&quot; &quot;And we fell at the first,&quot; says McEwan, laughing. Yes, but that&apos;s part of the grand tradition, Berkeley reminds him: think of all those great operas that missed their first opening night. McEwan nods. &quot;True, but I daren&apos;t ask whether they made it to their second opening night.&quot; Extract from For You Charles: It does not touch me, this music of my younger self, when my name was unknown and I lived on nothing but sex and cigarettes and fast food, when I was in love again every other week. I hear it clearly, each intricate part, I understand it, even admire it, but I cannot feel its passion, the longing, the sharp hunger, the lust for newness of that young man. It does not touch me now. The car is ready, Sir! The usual table, Maestro? The Minister of Culture is waiting. A famous man with a rich wife \u2014 but the dimmed perception, the expiring powers, stamina, boldness, vigour wilting under the weight of years. The long descent to uselessness. Every man&apos;s fate, how banal it is, and still it makes me angry, the clock that&apos;s beating me to extinction. Stop! Enough!

It&apos;s in his inherent nature to question and resist. The refusal in the Netherlands&apos; first ever referendum, when the European Constitution was voted down in 2005, surprised few and confirmed why we don&apos;t hold referendums to begin with. This stubbornness is as Dutch as coffee shops and low-quality techno music. That&apos;s why the great Dutch football managers of yore were disciplinarians. Rinus Michels, who is credited with inventing Total Football, wasn&apos;t called &quot;The General&quot; for nothing. Kees Rijvers, Leo Beenhakker and Aad de Mos built impressive international careers on respect and order \u2014 the latter two held 35 managerial jobs between them. Louis van Gaal has a monopoly on the truth, or so he believes, and at Ajax was known for berating his players, standing to attention, for half an hour at a time. Following a Willem II loss, Co Adriaanse was once so peeved that he made them walk 20km to the stadium, complete a brutal training session and walk back. Ex-Everton player and former Roda JC manager, Raymond Atteveld, is a bruiser in the same mould. While no player on a lacklustre Roda roster merits star treatment, his players nevertheless grew disgusted with him and his methods. And so, with five games gone, Atteveld became the first managerial casualty of the season with his tally of two points from those five matches hardly helping his cause. His temporary replacement is his ex-assistant Martin Koopman, who makes everybody laugh and doesn&apos;t make them run as much. On Saturday caretaker Koopman fielded almost exactly the same side and hardly did better than Atteveld. Against Heerenveen, a tame match yielded a 2-2 score. After the match Koopman told the press that he has no interest in staying on. Atteveld&apos;s dismissal is emblematic of a power shift in Dutch football. His junior standing left him without the pedigree of van Gaal or Adriaanse, and thus he did not have their same mandate to shout. Dutch managers have been successfully exported to other football nations for decades but we may have seen the last of the headmaster variety. Today&apos;s sensitive footballer and his fragile ego no longer allow it. The boss is, in fact, no longer the boss. Since Jean-Marc Bosman granted footballers their freedom, it&apos;s something they&apos;ve grasped with glee. The result? A bunch of annoyed players can now get their manager fired. Perhaps it&apos;s why the modern Dutch manager is more relaxed. Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard have had considerable success by just standing back and letting squads regulate themselves. Marco van Basten, though, has had mixed results by blending the two managerial styles. He&apos;s relatively easygoing so long as his authority isn&apos;t questioned and his orders are followed, otherwise he becomes venomous. However the approach is yet to work at Ajax, who hardly look ready to compete for the Dutch title let alone European silverware. Van Basten&apos;s men barely beat FC Groningen 1-0 on Saturday. The away side&apos;s supporters could only console themselves by knowing their team were hard done by, something they noted with banners reading: &quot;Finally the No1 is playing in Amsterdam.&quot; Oleguer Presas scored the only goal with a header from a freaky bounce before &quot;the liberating final whistle was celebrated by Ajax \u2026 as if Groningen were PSV,&quot; wrote Nik Kok tellingly in Algemeen Dagblad. Ajax were only moderately better than their pathetic showing in their last match, when they were trounced by Heerenveen 5-2. &quot;We talked about our attitude of two weeks ago and there wasn&apos;t a shortage of that anymore,&quot; Van Basten said, begging the question of what it is then that ails Ajax. The manager perhaps? Unhelpfully, Klaas Jan Huntelaar, who hoped to score 35 league goals this year, hasn&apos;t been spotted in weeks. While the real Huntelaar sits in a basement, gagged and bound, his doppelganger is out making pub-league strikers everywhere feel better about themselves. Some 300 miles north-west perhaps Manchester City are breathing a sigh of relief that their \u20ac40m bid for him was refused. They&apos;ll use that change at the laundrette instead. Against De Graafschap, a somewhat lucky AZstriker Mounir El Hamdaoui unapologetically continued his charge up the scoring charts by stumbling in the only two goals of the match, bringing his season&apos;s tally to eight. He now trails only Matthew Amoah of NAC&apos;s nine net-bulgers. Afterwards the inimitable Louis van Gaal slagged off both his own team and the opposing supporters. &quot;I don&apos;t think we played well,&quot; he harrumphed. &quot;We weren&apos;t positioned well and we weren&apos;t aggressive enough. [I] tried to fix it with some instructions and some yelling, because at De Graafschap the players can actually hear you.&quot; Feyenoord fell further into disrepair, losing to Willem II 1-0. Steeped in talent, the wildly inconsistent Rotterdammers appear to have taken themselves out of the running for the league title; now in fact edging nearer the relegation zone. &quot;Ashamed? Why should I be?&quot; manager Gertjan Verbeek said shamelessly when asked about his side&apos;s shameful 15th place. Steve McClaren&apos;s primal scream, reminiscent of a Soviet discus-thrower on a double dose of steroids, eventually convinced his FC Twente side to dispatch Heracles 2-0 in the derby of the east. (Unmissable scream after 5:55 in clip.) Down south, NAC deservedly defeated four-time defending champions PSV. NAC have been performing better all season and their phenomenal wing play forced PSV manager Huub Stevens to humiliate both of his wing-backs, Erik Pieters and Jan Kromkamp, by substituting them early on. An own goal by Belgian PSV captain Timmy Simons and another fabulous finish by Amoah put NAC 2-0 ahead before Ibrahim Afellay, who transcended his peers once again, made the final score 2-1. &quot;PSV&apos;s club song says &apos;We&apos;re going to battle,&apos;&quot; Stevens noted. &quot;I don&apos;t know if our players know the club song because I didn&apos;t see [a battle].&quot; The result put NAC top of the table for the first time since Dutch football became professional in 1954. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s undeserved that we&apos;re there,&quot; manager Rob Maaskant said. &quot;We&apos;re playing decent football at the moment.&quot; &quot;You see that smaller clubs \u2026 aren&apos;t as scared of the big clubs anymore and that just makes the league more fun,&quot; NAC winger Anthony Lurling said, capturing the zeitgeist. Two hours after the final whistle NAC&apos;s players were still dancing on the field in front of a packed stadium, enjoying their first place. As they should.

The first 13 places in the men&apos;s race were filled by nine Kenyans and four Ethiopians. The first European was a Dutchman who ran 2hr 13min 51sec, which might have won him a British championship about 40 years ago. Prior to the marathon the city hosted this year&apos;s European Athletics Convention and on Saturday I took part in a discussion designed to examine the state of the sport in its traditional heartland. Tables were produced, performances analysed and trends were sought and one thing was abundantly clear - European men seem to have stopped running! Actually, that may be too positive a statement because it appears that in some areas they are going backwards. In recent times it has been difficult for European men to strike gold at the Olympics. In Beijing it proved almost impossible to win one medal on the track save for the Russian men&apos;s 4 x 400 metres relay team. The 20km and 50km walks still provide medals, but that is presumably because African athletes have not yet turned their attentions to events where the goal is not to run. In the field European men more than held their own but the track has become a foreboding arena dominated by Caribbean and American sprinters and African distance runners who are leaving the Europeans behind to such an extent that in certain events in many countries they just don&apos;t seem to be trying any more. Britain is faring better than most but a quick look at the distance events shows how far things have slipped in the last 10 years. Since September 1998 no one has managed to get into the top 10 best British times in the marathon, steeplechase or 10,000m. Mo Farah is the only athlete to have got into the top 10 at 5,000m and similarly Michael East in the 1500m and James McIlroy in the 800m. Just three names in the last 10 years. Of the other 47 in these five events, 12 were in the 1970s, 30 in the 80s and 15 in the 90s. Yes I know, statistics, but they represent quite starkly what has happened. It&apos;s a trend reflected all over Europe. My contention at the weekend was that despite the gloomy picture there was no need to give up the ghost in the middle-distance events but our men in particular need more help and support than is currently on offer from many federations. To his credit UKA&apos;s chief executive, Niels de Vos, has already highlighted it as an area requiring urgent attention from the new performance director, Charles van Commenee. I&apos;m sure he will be open to ideas from all interested parties but one area where the European Athletic Association could be more helpful is in the competition set up. If you&apos;re going to ask young athletes to train over 100 miles a week year on year and devote all their waking hours to distance running then there has to be more than just the opportunity to get your end kicked in by Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes once a year in a Grand Prix race or the prospect of a European medal once every four years. If something&apos;s not done fairly quickly European men in the 5,000m, 10,000m, steeple chase and marathon will become a rarity. At 800m and 1500m the picture is less bleak, but nonetheless a more varied competitive opportunity than countless paced races must be offered to the up and coming athletes. There are many other factors involved such as coaching, the size of the talent pool and shifting cultural influences but surely these apply to boys and young men in other sports too? Hundreds of thousands set off down the road in a multitude of mass partition events across Europe every year, as happened in Amsterdam on Sunday, but very few of them want to continue running. The Dutch famously have the story of a little boy who stuck his finger in the dyke to hold off the impending deluge of water. European men&apos;s track has not quite been washed away yet but the young boy needs some help before he gets tired of it all.", "sentences": ["On Sunday the 33rd Amsterdam Marathon had an all too familiar look.", "Hundreds of thousands set off down the road in a multitude of mass partition events across Europe every year, as happened in Amsterdam on Sunday, but very few of them want to continue running."], "title": "Athletics:Europeans are running out of gas as Africans open the throttle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/21/athletics", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-21T08:45:20Z", "article": "By the end of this week, if you are visiting Liverpool you will be able to ride into town on a train bearing the name of John Peel. And if you happen to be listening to one of the late DJ&apos;s favourite songs \u2013 Amsterdam&apos;s Does This Train Stop on Merseyside? \u2013 well, the answer will be yes. The train is intended as a lasting memorial for Peel, who grew up in the area. &quot;We are very proud of the man John was and of his connection with Merseyside,&quot; councillor Mark Dowd, chair of Merseytravel, said in a press release. The train will be inaugurated at around 3pm on Thursday, leaving Merseytravel&apos;s Liverpool South Parkway station.

It was Carter who brought the first virulent strain of political religiosity to the White House. Carter who first wore his Christian faith on his presidential sleeve. Carter who first alerted his Republican opponents to a voter base who cared more about faith than about policy. (Reagan trounced Carter at the next election to some degree by playing the &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; card.) Since Carter, no American president or presidential nominee has professed anything other than piousness \u2013 religion has become simply a prerequisite for the job, in much the same way as being white and male once was. This, at least, is the view of Larry Charles, whose new documentary Religulous had its UK premiere in the London film festival at the weekend. Charles didn&apos;t go quite so far as to demand Carter hand back his Nobel prize, but given the apocalyptic tone of the film&apos;s conclusion, he might as well have. His film, a collaboration with late night TV host Bill Maher, argues that religion is not only ridiculous \u2013 hence the film&apos;s title \u2013 but that, in a society afraid to challenge its dogmas, religion is downright dangerous. A mushroom cloud montage worthy of Kubrick summarises the argument, and when you see the current leader of the free world say, &quot;I believe that God wants everybody to be free \u2013 and that&apos;s one part of my foreign policy,&quot; it&apos;s hard not to feel a little disturbed. In truth though, Religulous is not a film that takes its own arguments all that seriously. It is, first and foremost, &quot;a date movie&quot; \u2013 the sort of film that, whether you agree with its agenda or not, should at least have you laughing. Like Charles&apos;s last film, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, its principal achievement is to make Americans look really, really dumb. One of the film&apos;s funniest moments comes from a Democrat senator, Mark Pryor, who, having admitted the jury is still out as far as he is concerned about &quot;Adam and Eve 5,000 years ago with a talking snake in a garden&quot;, goes on to admit that &quot;you don&apos;t have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate&quot; and then looks mortified as he realises what Maher has just got him to say on camera. (The lawsuits, incidentally, are already coming thick and fast.) There are a few genuinely interesting voices in the film, like the Vatican priest who thinks a lot of the Old Testament is hokum, or Francis Collins, the former director of the Human Genome Project and a devout Christian. But there is little room among Religulous&apos; broad satirical sideswipes for these more nuanced, intelligent viewpoints. Cut instead to the cannabis-worshiper in Amsterdam getting a short, sharp dose of paranoia: &quot;Hey, your hair is on fire!&quot; Or the anti-Zionist Orthodox Jew, who is friendly with Ahmadinejad. Or an extended sequence at The Holy Land Experience, a theme park in Florida whose daily crucifixions are, inevitably, a sell-out. Ultimately, though, I worry that the film&apos;s message is unlikely to get through to the people who really should hear it: the po-faced rightwing Christians who still believe God Loves America and vote accordingly. If those people do go to Religulous, it will be to picket outside, and that&apos;s a shame because I think Maher and Charles might have the right idea. Comedy appeals first and foremost to the inquiring mind, and if their film encourages people to engage their brains while they&apos;re choking back tears of laughter, it can only be to the good. The problem is, when you see former teen idol Kirk Cameron earnestly telling his fellow Christians to &quot;bypass their intellect&quot;, you realise that for some people, religious ideology and a sense of humour will always be diametrically opposed. If there is an End of Days somewhere on the horizon, it&apos;s not hard to believe that its perpetrators will be the sort of people who find nothing to laugh about in Religulous.", "sentences": ["Cut instead to the cannabis-worshiper in Amsterdam getting a short, sharp dose of paranoia: &quot;Hey, your hair is on fire!&quot; Or the anti-Zionist Orthodox Jew, who is friendly with Ahmadinejad."], "title": "Why rightwing Christians need to see Religulous", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/oct/21/religulous", "tags": ["London film festival 2008", "Documentary", "Film", "Culture", "London film festival", "Festivals"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-23T12:30:00Z", "article": "&quot;Three great forces rule the world: stupidity, fear and greed&quot; - Albert Einstein.  As fear takes over from greed in the financial world, markets are gyrating wildly with no apparent end in sight. Are stock traders and investors losing their nerve as the world heads into what many fear will be a deep and prolonged recession? Or are the violent movements an accurate assessment of the current plight of the global economy?  Markets can be slow to react to information that is unexpected and unwelcome, as was the case with the numerous warning signals that pointed to the US sub-prime crisis.  &quot;Most in the financial world were like deer in headlights,&quot; says Professor Hersh Shefrin, who teaches behavioural finance at Santa Clara University in California and the Amsterdam Institute of Finance.  He classifies the lack of reaction over the past three years as &quot;irrational behaviour&quot; on the part of traders. And now we are seeing an equally irrational overreaction, he believes: &quot;What we have now is the polar opposite, where the reaction is absolutely frantic. The underlying fundamentals on a day-to-day basis are not changing anything like what&apos;s happening in terms of the equity markets, which are bouncing around from day to day.&quot;  Piling on the stress are fears over job security - tens of thousands of bankers have lost their jobs as major firms merge or, in the case of Lehman Brothers, collapse. Goldman Sachs is reportedly poised to axe one in 10 of its workforce - more than 3,000 people.  Dr Alden Cass, a clinical psychologist who counsels Wall Street bankers and is the author of Bullish Thinking, says he has seen an increase in the number of new clients over the past month and has cut his prices to make his therapy sessions more affordable \u2013 his hourly rate now starts at $225, rather than $300.  &quot;There&apos;s a sense of powerlessness. Markets are extremely volatile and irrational \u2013 all of a sudden people are dealing with a different beast,&quot; Cass said.  Financial advisers don&apos;t know how to attract new business and hedge fund managers fear for their jobs. Often suffering panic attacks and muscle aches, his clients were drinking more alcohol and turning to prescription drugs &quot;to numb their pain&quot;, he said. &quot;Even when times are good, their coping skills for stress are not very good. The consequences are often depression and divorce.&quot;  Cass pointed to his study of 26 male New York stockbrokers conducted during the tech boom of 1999, which showed that 23% suffered from clinical depression, about three times the national average. They spent 12 hours-a-day at work, smoked nearly two packets of cigarettes and consumed alcohol and drugs, especially cocaine. For relaxation, they preferred solitary pursuits such as jogging, masturbation and fishing.  Brokers who showed the greatest signs of depression, anxiety and emotional exhaustion were the most successful financially. Surveys show decisions made by investors and stock traders are often driven by emotion rather than rational calculation.  The American economist Robert J Shiller, author of the 2000 book, Irrational Exuberance, used Julius Caesar&apos;s famous phrase: &quot;Men willingly believe what they wish&quot; to illustrate this. Like football fans, investors suffer a &quot;wishful thinking bias,&quot; Shiller said, meaning they overestimate the probability of success.  &quot;It should be clear that human patterns of less-than-perfectly rational behaviour are central to financial market behaviour, even among investment professionals. At the same time, there is little outright foolishness among investors,&quot; wrote Shiller, professor of economics at Yale University.  The phrase irrational exuberance was made famous by the former US Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, during the stockmarket boom of the 1990s. But it has its counterpart - irrational pessimism.  Major stockmarket trends often begin and end with periods of frenzied buying or selling. They are thought to reflect herding behavior that is often driven by emotion - greed in the bubbles, fear in the crashes.  Investors join the crowd in a rush to get into or out of the market. &quot;It&apos;s blindingly obvious at the moment that sentiment can be a dominant factor in the markets. Herding is just one aspect of that,&quot; said Mark Salmon, professor of finance at Warwick Business School.  &quot;Following the market means you don&apos;t stand out as an investment manager and you don&apos;t lose your job,&quot; he said. &quot;It also means suppressing your own private information. As people just follow each other, nothing more gets put in. Prices are driven purely by subjective forces as opposed to fundamentals.&quot;  Salmon warned against the assumption that the current stockmarket swings were all down to irrationality, however. &quot;The risk has risen and people are reacting rationally by getting out of risky assets; that is equities,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of perceived news is coming out and that&apos;s why there is a lot of volatility.&quot;  Another reason is that professional investors with highly leveraged positions have been unloading them gradually - and hedge funds are next.  &quot;Redemptions are building up in major hedge funds,&quot; Salmon said. &quot;The deleveraging process hasn&apos;t started properly,&quot; he said, adding that a large number of hedge funds would go bust when it did.  Salmon&apos;s view is that &quot;the efficiency of the City goes together with fear and greed \u2013 but they clearly have to be contained&quot; through better regulation.  Shefrin questioned whether the markets&apos; reaction was appropriate, however. &quot;Markets are down about 40% from their peaks \u2013 but is activity down by 40%? Are earnings going to be down by 40%?&quot;  He thinks markets have further to fall as the global recession unfolds \u2013 perhaps by two-thirds from their peak over the next 12-18 months. But, he said, this was nowhere near as bad as the 90% stockmarket slump seen during the Great Depression.  Researchers talk of &quot;recency bias&quot; \u2013 meaning lessons from history are rarely learned because people only remember the most recent events.  Shefrin said: &quot;This episode is going to be so painful that 10 years from now we won&apos;t have forgotten.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;Most in the financial world were like deer in headlights,&quot; says Professor Hersh Shefrin, who teaches behavioural finance at Santa Clara University in California and the Amsterdam Institute of Finance."], "title": "The psychology of the financial market turmoil", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/recession-market-turmoil-psychology-stress", "tags": ["Recession", "Market turmoil", "Credit crunch", "Business", "Mental health", "Society", "Depression"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-23T12:31:04Z", "article": " Team news: Aston Villa: Friedel, Luke Young, Cuellar, Laursen, Shorey, Reo-Coker, Petrov, Barry, Milner, Agbonlahor, Ashley Young.Subs: Guzan, Sidwell, Harewood, Davies, Knight, Salifou, Gardner. Ajax: Vermeer, Silva, Oleguer, Vermaelen, Emanuelson, Lindgren, Sarpong, Vertonghen, Suarez, Huntelaar, Gabri. Subs: Vonk, Van Der Wiel, Cvitanich, Leonardo, Sno, Anita, Schilder. Referee: Thomas Einwaller (Austria)  A hasty preamble: All the talk is of glamour coming to Birmingham as Ajax arrive with all the connotations (and ghosts) of European successes past. A manager legendary as a player, a team with names who are tipped to be big ... and, well, a distinct lack of form at home in the league. In fact, the biggest of those supposedly big name players - Klaas Jan Huntelaar - has been far less than prolific so far this season, having scored only two goals in 540 minutes of league football. Villa, meanwhile, possess enough strength and skill to cause them problems. Full of flair they may not be, but there&apos;s guile and quality a-plenty. Ajax might want to look out here.  An email that will allow me to fill some space in lieu of writing something meaningful about the game: &quot;Isn&apos;t the Ajax 70s kit fabulous? In a decade almost devoid of anything remotely &apos;cool&apos;, were Ajax the hippest of the hip (closely followed by Al Pacino in The Godfather)?&quot; asks the inevitable Gary Naylor.  They&apos;re off: and if the commentary team are to be believed, the atmosphere is crackling. Carew hasn&apos;t started as he has a bit of a sniffle, poor lad.  2 min: Ajax aren&apos;t about the sitting back away from home here. They&apos;ve spent a good couple of minutes stroking the ball about between themselves, giving Villa hardly a sniff. They&apos;re wearing blue, rather than red and white, though which is a bit of a shame.  4 min: Ah, that&apos;s a bit more like it. Agbonhlahor touches it. Not to anyone, mind, but he&apos;s touched it nonetheless.  6 min: Vertonghen runs into the box, offloads to Suarez on his right, but the right winger can&apos;t get past Nicky Shorey - which ought to be sufficiently embarrassing for him. Villa charge down the other end but Young&apos;s cross to Agbonlahor meets Oleguer.  7 min: Corner to Villa, with which Ashley Young fails to beat the first man. Shorey takes the subsequent throw-in then wins a free-kick from Gabri. Young whips it to the far post and, from the flick-on, Laursen just fails to stick it in the net. It&apos;s been an exciting start.  GOAL! Aston Villa 1-0 Ajax (Laursen, 8 min): Good corner from Ashley Young, keeper Vermeer rushed out for it but was too slow as Laursen had already risen from the penalty spot - without many Ajax players to obstruct him - and buried it in the back of the net with a solid header.  10 min Martin O&apos;Neill did a funny little dance when that went in. Van Basten, on the other hand, glowered in an alarmingly intense manner. Villa have responded by pressing up the pitch and making with the possession much like Ajax were in the first few minutes  12 min: Ashley Young takes it to the edge of the box, then slips the overlapping Nicky Shorey the ball. No matter that it had rolled a few inches out of play, Shorey sends over a good cross that Ajax just about deal with. Could have been another goal there, despite the fact it went out of play.  14 min: Ajax haven&apos;t really mounted anything that could technically be called an attack yet. They look a bit stunned, to be honest. As if they&apos;re a little resigned to their fate. Villa, on the other hand, look positively bug-eyed. They&apos;re running about all over the place and have just earned a corner. Barry sends it over, Laursen heads it, but can&apos;t get this one on target.  17 min: The Ajax defence find themselves staring at a bouncing ball. Much like when being tossed a hand grenade, their natural urge seems to be to back off nervously, hoping someone else will deal with it. Ashley Young nearly nicks it from them before they clear. No matter, Aston Villa spend the next minute merrily hammering dangerous balls into the Ajax box from wide. If they keep this up, Ajax are sunk.  20 min: &quot;What&apos;s happened to Ajax?&quot; screams Bill Heather in my inbox. &quot;They&apos;re terrible!&quot; That may be a bit harsh, actually. It&apos;s more the case that Villa have been good. Having said that, Ajax don&apos;t look quite as excited about playing European football as the home side do - which may have something to do with it. A case in point is when Vertonghen lines up a shot from several thousand miles out. It whizzes, laughably, into the crowd.  GOAL! Aston Villa 1-1 Ajax (Vermaelen 22 min): Veronghen flips a free-kick into the box for Sarpong - the Ajax player, not the T4 presenter - but Luke Young closes him down quickly for a corner. Emanuelson whips it into the near post and Vermaelen nods it home - again, unencumbered by any marking. Perhaps I spoke - or typed - to soon.  24 min: &quot;Many players gain an undeserved reputation for being &apos;good in the air&apos; - Duncan Ferguson, for example, hardly ever got a header on goal. But Martin Laursen must get on the end of more set plays than any other player in the Premier League (possibly Adebayor is ahead, but no-one else), so how does he do it? Having John Carew in the same shirt must help, but I suspect it&apos;s more about committing to attack the space in the box, a thrilling and rare sight these days, when teams seem to prefer walking the ball into the net,&quot; emails Gary Naylor, lengthily but with a point.  25 min: Ajax get another corner, this time as a result of Shorey&apos;s dallying, but they clear it without too much fuss. Suddenly Ajax have come alive. Their goal was, to an extent, out of the blue. Villa must ensure it doesn&apos;t knock the wind from their sails.  27 min: By far Villa&apos;s best outlet is Ashley Young down the left. Silva, the right back, has neither the pace nor the chops to cope with him, so Young puts in another good cross. It&apos;s put behind for a corner but Villa can&apos;t capitalise once again. Next, Petrov beats Silva - more because he can and it&apos;s a bit of a rare thing for him than for any good reason, you suspect.  30 min: Silva knocks it down the line for Huntelaar (who&apos;s done nothing to justify the hype). He swings a leg at it and earns a corner from Nicky Shorey. Villa play a dangerous game in the box, leaving plenty of men standing in space, and few marking Huntelaar and the striker nearly manages to toe-poke the ball home.  32 min: It&apos;s 1-0 to Braga against Portugal, by the way. If desperately hitting f5 and pretending you&apos;re watching Ceefax is how you get your kicks, you could do worse than clicking on this here link. If not, stay here so that I can tell you that Vermeer has just hoofed it up the pitch, allowing Cuellar to hoof it back at him.  34 min: Another good ball into the box finds Laursen. His strength allows him to beat Oleguer with ease. His header though - across the face of the goal, so we&apos;ll call it a pass rather than a shot, even though that&apos;s a bit charitable - finds no-one.  36 min: Milner battles his way down the left and puts in a good-ish cross to Agbonlahor on the penalty spot. It glanced off Emanuelson&apos;s head though, landing at Young&apos;s feet. He screws his shot wide of the left-hand post. That was a good chance going begging, is what that was.  37 min: Ajax aren&apos;t coping with crosses at all. This time Barry wings one in, Agbonlahor can&apos;t do much but it pings back to Milner, who doesn&apos;t do much either. So Ajax play it down the other end, where Suarez whistles a ball just over the cross bar from 30 yards out.  40 min: Villa are switching their attacks to the right where Milner is struggling to put over decent balls. Young, however, has been regularly beating his marker with consummate ease, making his flank the better from which to probe. In the stands, Stuart Pearce is watching on with a nose only bettered for redness by a certain reindeer.  42 min: Oleguer plants every single one of his studs into Ashley Young&apos;s chest as he runs onto the ball. The defender&apos;s subsequent look is of absolute amazement when the whistle blows. A second later, when the ref&apos;s back is turned, his grin is of a naughty schoolboy. Young can&apos;t do much with the free-kick, which is too straight for him to provide a good cross.  44 min: Gabri has been moved into a more central position, presumably to allow Silva to deal with Ashley Young exclusively, which seems foolish. That done, Ajax knock the ball around among themselves, comfortable in possession, grinding Villa down - who need to press harder if they&apos;re to get the ball.  GOAL! Aston Villa 2-1 Ajax (Barry, 45 min) Shorey played a one-two with Young, sending the winger away into the corner. His cut back evades every Ajax player in the box to find Barry on the edge of the area. He slides it cooly home into the bottom right-hand corner moments before the half-time whistle goes.  A half-time email: &quot;As a Birmingham boy who lives in Amsterdam, this match is unbearable for me \u2013 the Villa simply have to win, otherwise I won&apos;t be able to face my Dutch pals for at least a week ...&quot; At the moment Nathan, your Dutch pals may be avoiding you.  Another half-time email: &quot;If Villa are serious about breaking into the top four, they should be able to win the Uefa cup at a stroll. Middlesbrough, Celtic and Rangers have all reached the final in recent years and they couldn&apos;t handle the top four even if they were backed by the combined money and evil genius of Warren Buffet, Carlos Slim and Bill Gates,&quot; writes Hugh Collins.  We&apos;re off again: &quot;Barry scores on the half-time whistle! Ah, now you&apos;ve done yourself out of a reader, Tom. You&apos;ve made it sound too, too, too exciting, I&apos;m off to find a pub somewhere in Berlin that&apos;s showing the game ... The Kilkenny down Hackescher Markt might have it,&quot; writes disloyal turncoat Julian Gough. Come back Julian, I&apos;ll make the second half sound rubbish.  47 min: There&apos;s been a fair bit of hoofing the ball from one end of the pitch to the other to welcome in the beginning of this half. Is that the sort of skill-less football that&apos;ll keep you reading, and thus keep giving us the hits Julian? Uh-oh, there&apos;s a corner now. Something exciting might happen.  49 min: It&apos;s met by Suarez, who heads it well over the bar. His long hair and Alice band generate him a particularly loud wolf-whistle from the stands.  50 min: Ajax have remained mostly in possession so far, so Reo-Coker takes matters into his own hands, using a blend of the physical and agricultural to get his feet to the ball. He sends Milner away down the right, but the former Newcastle man can do little other than give away a throw-in. Meanwhile, Gary Naylor has this with which to entertain you: &quot;Ajax have Vermeer in goal and Leonardo on the bench - and they said Cruyff was a footballing artist.&quot;  52 min: Again, Ashley Young gets away down the left. He slides in a pass to Agbonlahor who is marked out but still cuts the ball back. It bobbles back to Milner, whose shot is deflected behind for a corner. From it, Laursen heads - again - but it&apos;s cleared to Shorey. His long range shot is saved well by Vermeer, but bobbles loose and its nearly turned back in by Laursen. Fortunately for the keeper he plucks it from the air before landing just the right side of the goal line. Unfortunately for our dwindling readers, that was quite exciting.  55 min: Young finds Shorey on the overlap and Bruno Silva, the right-back, again looks uncomfortable. He knocks the ball behind for a corner. Laursen comes rushing in but - gasp - he&apos;s a decoy. All the defenders follow him and the ball goes to Cuellar. There&apos;s some kind of foul though, which I&apos;m afraid I didn&apos;t see, and the ref blows up. Not literally. Cvitanich has replaced Sarpong for Ajax, by the way.  57 min: &quot;What do mean dwindling? I&apos;m still here ... in bloody freezing Lapland,&quot; writes Duncan Kemp, from bloody freezing Lapland. In the warmer climes of Birmingham, Martin O&apos;Neill is pacing about as nervously as Woody Allen trying to cook a lobster.  60 min: The Ajax substitution has given them a more attacking outlook. However, they&apos;re yet to get much of the ball as Villa have spent much of the last few minutes camped in Ajax&apos;s half. Every time Ajax work it free, Laursen just thumps it back at them. Finally Luke Young fashions an opening up the right, whereupon he puts it in a good cross that Silva just manages to get into touch, thus preventing Ashley Young from thumping it home. Leonardo is on for Suarez, which will be something of a relief for Villa as he looked their best player.  62 min: Barry aims a sighter at goal from the edge of the box. He doesn&apos;t quite hit it right though, and it dribbles along the ground and into the arms of the keeper.  64 min: Leonardo tries to pull some strings in the midfield but, after offloading to Emanuelson, he must have been heartened to see his team-mate pass it straight to Petrov. He knocks it to Milner, who aims a through ball to Agbonhlahor. Vermaelen cuts it out, though, to the audible disappointment of the Villa crowd.  65 min: &quot;I&apos;d love to know how you MBMers are judged? Is there some metric around how many IP addresses connect to the MBM? How many emails you get? How many you reply to? Or some director who thinks &apos;That Tom was funny today, we&apos;ll keep him on another week&apos;?&quot; asks David Leech. If only, David. It&apos;s more a case of being asked: &apos;Do you mind working until 10pm on Thursday night?&apos; As for being funny, I&apos;ll leave that to the professional comedians this desk seems attract.  67 min: Agbonlahor bumps Oleguer (I think) into touch and most of the Ajax players appeal for a free-kick. The referee, quite rightly, argues that football is a contact sport so that sort of thing is perfectly alright. Unfortunately the striker&apos;s cut-back takes a deflection and balloons tamely into the keeper&apos;s hands.  69 min: Ah. That same phsyicality works against Agbonlahor there. The striker rushed onto a through ball and beat Leonardo to it - who for some reason was the last line of defence. A bit of a tussle ensued, leaving Agbonlahor on his &apos;arris in the penalty area. The referee allows play to continue, arguing that football is a contact sport so etc and so on.  70 min: Silva makes his first foray into the Villa half. He puts over a dream cross that Cvitanich heads just over. He was offside too, which didn&apos;t much help his chances.  72 min: A sentence in favour of Stan Collymore: he&apos;s the summariser on the telly tonight and he&apos;s been quite good. On the pitch, Villa have a free-kick out right. Shorey swings it in and Ajax leg it - hell-for-leather - out of defence a la Wimbledon to leave the entire Aston Villa team offside. Haven&apos;t seen that for a while.  75 min: Bit reckless there from Villa. Luke Young got himself into a muddle just outside the 18 yard box. Coming in to clear up, Cuellar was a bit wild and earned himself a yellow card and a free-kick. Huntelaar hit it and it was goal-bound, until it took one of those awkward bounces off the wall that so often embarrass goalkeepers. Fortunately for Freidel it goes out for a corner which is cleared.  77 min: Young earns a corner up the other end. He hits it to the far post and Vermeer just tips it over the head of the lurking Milner. From the next corner, Shorey has a long-range shot but can&apos;t get enough pace on it.  79 min: From 45 yards out, Vertonghen puts his foot on the ball. He surveys his options, then sends Emanuelson away down the left wing. His cross is just put behind for a corner and suddenly Ajax look a threat again. Moments later, as if to confirm the fact, Emanuelson has long-range crack that Friedel saves at absolutely full stretch.  81 min: Emanuelson is getting some joy down the left. He puts in another dangerous cross, which Cuellar is forced to hoof clear. Luke Young needs to get a grip of him, really. Up front, Agbonlahor is looking a bit tired. He could do with some help. Instead, Reo-Coker gets subbed for Craig Gardner and fails to look happy about it.  83 min: &quot;As a Dutch season ticket holder and not an Ajax fan I praise the heavens for the English finally finding out that Huntelaar isn&apos;t all that,&quot; writes Ellen - presumably not the American comic of the same name. &quot;Watch out for Suarez though, he&apos;s a cunning diver,&quot; she adds. Huntelaar has done eff all in this game, to be honest, which suggests he might be more in the mould of Kezman rather than Van Nistelrooy were he to make the move over to England.  86 min: &quot;Villa back in the European big time,&quot; say the commentary team on the telly, apparently unaware that this is the Uefa Cup. On the pitch, Gardner earns himself a yellow card after flattening Vermaelen. Next, Milner goes on a meander up the right and beats three players. He goes down in the penalty area but the referee points just outside the line. Probably the right decision.  88 min: Gabri gets clattered a long way out and, from the free-kick, Vertonghen takes an almighty swing at it. The result? Someone deep in the stands gets a ball in the face.  89 min: Much of the discipline with which Ajax have been playing has been replaced with desperate long balls forward. Villa are dealing with them with a degree of ease. They clear to Milner, who knocks the ball to Barry, whose long range shot is bobbins. Gabri then does something similar up the other end.  92 min: Vermeer launches a long ball forward, then watches in panic as it gets launched back towards him and - more worryingly for the Ajax keeper - Agbonlahor. He comes rushing out of his box and heads into touch, flattening Agbonlahor while he&apos;s at it. The striker stays down too, much to the concern of the Villa medical team.  93 min: Not good news for Villa. With Carew ill in the stands, Agbonhlahor has just been stretchered off to the dressing room. Curtis Davies is his replacement.  Peep, peep, peep: That&apos;s it. Villa have won and deserved to, as well. A good, strong performance against an under par Ajax. The only worry will be the extent of the injury to Agbonlahor.  I&apos;m off, thanks for all your emails. Villa were very good tonight and Ajax weren&apos;t awful. Still, they probably weren&apos;t as good as they should be. The real test for Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s side will be when they face Hamburg, who look a very god side under Martin Jol. Still, this will be doing for starters.", "sentences": ["A half-time email: &quot;As a Birmingham boy who lives in Amsterdam, this match is unbearable for me \u2013 the Villa simply have to win, otherwise I won&apos;t be able to face my Dutch pals for at least a week ...&quot; At the moment Nathan, your Dutch pals may be avoiding you."], "title": "Uefa Cup: Aston Villa v Ajax - as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/23/uefa-astonvilla", "tags": ["Europa League", "Aston Villa", "Ajax", "Football", "Sport", "Uefa Cup 2008-09"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-23T23:01:00Z", "article": "This was not quite the European stage Gareth Barry imagined he would be appearing on this season but there was no sign of disappointment on the face of the England international last night as his well taken goal seconds before the interval gave Aston Villa a deserved victory over Ajax. Outplayed for periods in the first half, Villa were in control thereafter as Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s side collected the three points that provides the perfect platform to progress from Group F. Ajax were not without their opportunities to bring parity, Urby Emanuelson propelling a low drive from 25 yards which Brad Friedel clawed to safety, but Villa always seemed the more likely side to score again on a night when this famous old stadium reverberated with noise. That moment might have arrived in the second half when Leonardo Vitor Santiago hauled down Gabriel Agbonlahor in the area, but Thomas Einwaller, the Austrian referee, waved away the appeals. It was a reprieve for Ajax, although not one that they could exploit. Marco van Basten&apos;s side enjoyed more possession in the early periods but it was Villa, so suited to playing on the counterattack, who looked the more threatening in the final third. With John Carew rested after O&apos;Neill reported he was suffering from fatigue, the onus was on James Milner and Ashley Young to provide penetration from the flanks. The latter delivered, with his cut-back encouraging Barry to dispatch a left-foot first-time shot beyond Kenneth Vermeer. With Ajax playing neat triangles in midfield and providing evidence of their threat from set pieces when Thomas Vermaelen darted across at the near post to nod Emanuelson&apos;s corner beyond Friedel to cancel out Martin Laursen&apos;s eighth-minute opener, there was an expectation the Amsterdam side would crank up the pressure on Villa in the second half. O&apos;Neill, however, identified Villa&apos;s weakness and by pushing Barry into a more advanced role after the interval he was able to prevent the Ajax midfield from controlling the ball. As a result, the game turned in Villa&apos;s favour. &quot;I am absolutely delighted,&quot; said the Villa manager. &quot;I thought we were excellent and that we deserved to win. We should have had a penalty kick; the only two people in the ground who missed it were the referee and the linesman. That would have given us confidence. We were well aware of Ajax&apos;s capabilities. They&apos;re a very fine passing team and just after the equaliser they had a good spell. But I also thought we were playing too deep and I rectified that in the second half.&quot; O&apos;Neill singled out Agbonlahor for special praise, the Villa manager describing the forward&apos;s performance up front on his own as a &quot;masterclass&quot;. The England Under-21 international was taken off on a stretcher in the closing minutes after colliding with Vermeer but O&apos;Neill insisted the striker had no more than cuts and bruises across his knees. He might also be running on empty when he is examined the morning after he worked assiduously across the front line to provide a focal point for Villa&apos;s attacks. For all that, it was a defender who gave Villa the lead, with Laursen&apos;s goal in the eighth minute from Ashley Young&apos;s corner suggesting that Ajax had not done their homework on the threat O&apos;Neill&apos;s side pose from set pieces. It could be argued that Villa were also negligent in that department, with Vermaelen profiting from a zonal marking system that afforded the Ajax players a free run on goal. In the end, Van Basten was left to lament Klaas-Jan Huntelaar&apos;s failure to turn in another Emanuelson corner moments after the equaliser. &quot;I thought in the first half we played rather well,&quot; said the Ajax manager. &quot;It was just a pity that we conceded before the break. In the second half we didn&apos;t play football any more. We played long ball and we made Aston Villa stronger and stronger.

Not just because Pearce (who I&apos;ve known for about 20 years) always brings a forensic, perception-changing approach to environmental matters; but also because there&apos;re so many rich pickings for us to provide him with from the computing industry. Hell, on our own we could probably give him enough claims to fill the column for the first year. What sort of things? Well, first of all there&apos;s the underlying assumption that chucking away your old computer or data centre in favour of something newer is going to be more &quot;environmental&quot;. Thus Apple touted its new portable computers last week as its greenest-ever \u2013 &quot;highly recyclable and even more energy efficient&quot;. OK, but that&apos;s relative, isn&apos;t it? Carved from a block of aluminium they may be (watch the video), but that aluminium probably wasn&apos;t made by collecting discarded kitchen foil; it&apos;ll have been extracted as bauxite, and then turned into aluminium blocks, which in energy-intensity rivals running a particle collider. So they&apos;re &quot;greener&quot; if you don&apos;t mind all the fossil fuels burnt to extract the contents and put them together. (I&apos;m assuming the bauxite mines and smelters aren&apos;t powered by windmills \u2013 though Norway is a favoured location for aluminium smelting because of its plentiful, and green, hydroelectric sources.) I&apos;ve also enjoyed the past 18 months or so in which Dell has tried to transform itself into a &quot;green&quot; company. The most amusing part has been its &quot;Plant a tree for me&quot; plan, which tries \u2013 apparently not hard enough \u2013 to persuade people buying a new computer to purchase carbon offsetting, in the form of one-third of a tree planted per machine, for its first three years. The prices aren&apos;t high \u2013 \u00a31 per laptop, \u00a33 per desktop \u2013 but people aren&apos;t biting. The best numbers I can calculate, based on what the company doles out, is that less than 1% of purchased machines are offset.  The point is that Dell does seem to me to understand the need to reduce its impact on the environment. Todd Arbogast, its director of sustainable business, explained that Dell&apos;s headquarters in Round Rock, Texas, is powered by a mixture of wind, solar and &quot;methane capture&quot; sources, and it is pushing its suppliers to use more renewable sources of energy, and recycle more. All laudable aims; it&apos;s only a pity that its customers don&apos;t seem to share them. There&apos;s plenty more, of course. Is it really &quot;green&quot; to use cloud computing? You might think so \u2013 after all, it&apos;s all happening somewhere else, isn&apos;t it? \u2013 but if you consider that it means your computer is running, as well as lots of other computers all over the world, then it doesn&apos;t. Nick Carr, author of The Big Switch, calculated a while back that each avatar in Second Life, for example, has a carbon footprint as big as the average Brazilian \u2013 and that&apos;s in addition to their real-world personae, who probably aren&apos;t Brazilian, but American. Or the more recent case, noted by technology journalist Chris Edwards, of a company spotted by the consultancy Ovum which, in Edwards&apos;s words, found that &quot;when it came to their [carbon] footprint, some were forced to wear supersized carbon clown shoes: &apos;One of the delegates, who had travelled from D\u00fcsseldorf to Amsterdam, had been told that he had to fly there as it was not company policy to reimburse train fares \u2013 despite the fact that in this case there is no direct air service and flying was both considerably more expensive and slower! As this journey involved two relatively short flights, the fuel consumption per passenger was probably about 10 times that of the rail option.&apos;&quot; Ah, yes, the manifold ways in which we can be tripped up by our own good intentions.  But the question behind it all \u2013 and which the latest economic news might make us consider even more carefully \u2013 is: why do you need a &quot;new&quot; anything? Isn&apos;t there enough computer equipment in your home or business to do what you need? Isn&apos;t the real solution to speeding things up or making work easier actually in the software, not the hardware? I suspect that the coming year is going to see some dramatic slowdowns in spending (Gartner has already slashed its forecasts for 2009) and a lot of reevaluation.

Colin interviewed Snoop for a documentary about death row in American prisons, In Prison My Whole Life, released last week, and which the actor has co-produced. Colin told me: &apos;Snoop would only be interviewed in Amsterdam. He finds it the one European city that most suits his, er, needs.

Colin, who has just finished filming A Picture of Dorian Gray and whose film Easy Virtue debuts at the LFF next week, fears he might not be able to turn the challenge down. &apos;I&apos;d smoke Snoop under the table, no problem,&apos; he joked. &apos;Then again, I might just not inhale.

When I spoke to Oscar-winning director Demme, I told him that Hathaway&apos;s voraciously selfish character reminded me of Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins in Demme&apos;s Silence of the Lambs. &apos;I actually had Clarice Starling, Jodie Foster&apos;s character, very much in mind when I was filming Anne,&apos; he told me, laughing. &apos;I don&apos;t think even Hannibal would have liked the taste of Anne&apos;s character in this.

Good to see John Hurt, too. He&apos;s just had a severe hair cut to play Quentin Crisp again, over 30 years after his legendary portrayal in The Naked Civil Servant. Hurt told me he was on a short break from filming in Manhattan and was thrilled to be &apos;inhabiting the soul&apos; of Crisp once more. The film is called An Englishman in New York.

Reykjavik&apos;s myriad attractions as a city-break destination - vibrant culture, energetic nightlife, stunning scenery - have always been offset by the fact that it was so expensive. But now, with the Icelandic economy going through the worst recession the country has seen for decades, the pound buys a lot more Icelandic kronur and the city is suddenly one of the cheapest options for a weekend getaway in northern Europe. And with sales tax refunds available to EU shoppers, you&apos;ll save a bundle on your Christmas shopping. Checking in There is a consensus that the best place to stay in town is the lavishly designed Home Apartments Hotel (Skolastr\u00e6ti 1; 00 354 896 5665; this.is/home). Located in downtown Reykjavik, it offers great access to the old town and has studio and penthouse apartments from \u00a3180 per night. It offers fully-equipped kitchens, flat-screen TV, Bose sound systems and original art by some of Iceland&apos;s most exciting artists. For a cheaper alternative, visit Red Apple Apartments (redappleapartments.com; 00 46 763 416 730) where tourists can self cater from \u00a355 per night. For a more traditional experience, the Hotel Borg (Posthusstr\u00e6ti 11; 00 354 551 1440; hotelborg.is) is a safe bet. Built in 1930 and recently refurbished in its original Art Deco style, the four-star hotel offers luxury in style from \u00a3120 a night.  Hit the streets Start the day with a visit to one of the many geothermal swimming pools. No matter where you are in Reykjavik, you are always within a few miles of the nearest hot tub, where the locals start the day with a soak and a discussion about the day&apos;s issues. Next visit the iconic Hallgrimur&apos;s Church, then seek out the independent galleries such as The Living Arts Museum (Laugavegur 25; nylo.is) or Gallery Kling og Bang (23; 00 354 696 2209; this.is/klingogbang) where Iceland&apos;s most progressive artists regularly exhibit, or visit the Erro exhibition at the Reykjavik Art Museum (Grofarhus; 00 354 590 1200; listasafnreykjavikur.is). Coffee break When it is time to sit down for a few minutes and enjoy a hot coffee, Reykjavik is a good place to be. Iceland lies near the top of the world in per-capita coffee consumption, and the natives will not accept anything less than the best. Grab a chair at Kaffitar (Bankastr\u00e6ti 8; 00 354 511 4540; kaffitar.is), a coffee importer and roasterie that serves high-quality coffee, specially selected for her demanding customers by owner Adalheidur Hedinsdottir.  Neighbourhood watch Walk around Reykjavik&apos;s west side where the spirit of the old village that became a small city is still well maintained. There is an irresistible charm to the corrugated iron houses from the early 20th century that make up this part of town. Continue the stroll down to the harbour, where fishermen still bring in their catch, despite rapid redevelopment of the area.  Retail therapy Visit Laugavegur, the main shopping drag in the city, for a selection of boutiques and designer labels, both local and international, souvenirs and arts and crafts. Many local designers are in back alleys and less obvious retail spaces, so you have to keep an eye out for the smaller ones. For bigger fashion houses, visit shopping malls Kringlan (Kringlan 4-12; 00 354 517 9000; kringlan.is) or Smaralind (Hagasmari 1; 00 354 528 8000; smaralind.is).  Worked up an appetite? The locals will have you believe that they invented fish. It is not quite accurate, but there are few places in the world to rival Iceland when it comes to preparing fresh fish. For a traditional Icelandic fish restaurant, visit the family-owned 3 Frakkar, (Baldursgata 14; 00 354 552 3939; 3frakkar.com) where head chef Ulfar has been preparing cod for 30 years, and you can sample national dishes such as hashed fish with black bread for around \u00a316. At the Fishmarket (Aalstr\u00e6ti 12; 00 354 578 8877; fiskmarkadurinn.is), award-winning chef Hrefna S\u00e6tran serves fish with a Euro-Asian fusion theme in one of the oldest houses in town. Here, you can enjoy crispy duck salad or squid tempura for around \u00a310.  If you don&apos;t fancy fish, try Einar Ben (Veltusund 1; 00 354 511 5090; einarben.is), where Icelanders have enjoyed fine cuisine based on local products for decades - don&apos;t miss the lamb seasoned with Icelandic herbs. Escaping the city There is a lot to see outside Reykjavik. The most popular choices remain a trip to the Blue Lagoon, 30 minutes outside the city, or the Golden Circle day tour via Gullfoss, Geysir and Thingvellir. Both trips are available through Reykjavik Excursions (BSI Bus Terminal; 00 354 580 5400). But don&apos;t overlook the charms of a quiet night-time walk outside the city limits where - when circumstances are right - you can glimpse the Northern Lights.  Big night out A good night starts with drinks at Boston (Laugavegur 28). If you want to catch a band at a live venue try Nasa (Austurvollur) or Caf\u00e9 Amsterdam (Hafnarstr\u00e6ti 5). For a late-night drink, head to Kaffibarinn (Bergstadastr\u00e6ti 1) or Kaffi Kultura (Hverfisgata 18), where the party keeps going until the early hours.  Getting there Icelandair (0800 988 9989; icelandair.co.uk) has return flights to Reykjavik from Heathrow and Glasgow from \u00a3211, and from Manchester from \u00a3219. However, the airline currently also offers packages from \u00a3199, including flights and three nights&apos; bed and breakfast at the three-star Hotel Cabin, valid until March. \u2022 Sveinn Birkir Bjornsson is the editor of The Reykjavik Grapevine magazine, a guide to arts, travel and entertainment in Iceland, see grapevine.is", "sentences": ["If you want to catch a band at a live venue try Nasa (Austurvollur) or Caf\u00e9 Amsterdam (Hafnarstr\u00e6ti 5)."], "title": "Instant weekend: Why the collapse of the krona makes now an ideal time to visit Reykjavik", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/26/reykjavik-iceland-holidays", "tags": ["Reykjavik holidays", "Iceland holidays", "Weekend breaks", "Short breaks", "Budget travel", "Travel", "City breaks"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-25T23:01:00Z", "article": "In her essay &apos;Playing in the Dark&apos;, Toni Morrison looked back to the founding of America and observed: &apos;What was distinctive in the New World was, first of all, its claim to freedom, and second, the presence of the unfree within the heart of the democratic experiment.&apos; This sentiment - that ideals of economic and political liberty were dependent on brutal enslavement - is the starting place of all her work, and this, her first novel for five years, is another distillation of it. In her essays and novels, she has pursued - and mostly won - the argument that the history and literature of America were predicated on the exclusion of the black part of its population, that the myths of nation-building contained an explicit or an unspoken &apos;us&apos; and &apos;them&apos;. That this book will be published in the week before her nation may choose a President who for the first time could eclipse that divide, who could make &apos;them&apos; &apos;us&apos;, lends it a fundamental resonance.  In some ways, A Mercy is a prequel to Morrison&apos;s most comprehensive and unanswerable expression of those ideas, Beloved, recently voted the greatest American novel of the last 25 years in the New York Times. It is set at a time just before the earliest parts of Beloved, before bonded labour became a principal foundation of American wealth, when that grotesque idea was just forming in the marketplace.  Jacob Vaark enters that marketplace from Europe. He has found his way through Atlantic fog, dropped off at an unnamed coast by unnamed sloopmen, wading &apos;over pebbles and sand to shore&apos;, across mud and swamp grass, over boarded planks finally to a village, mimicking the advance of civilisation. Vaark has no illusion about where he has come to: &apos;1682 and Virginia was still a mess.&apos; Half-a-dozen years before, &apos;an army of blacks, natives, whites, mulattoes - freedmen, slaves and indentured - had waged war against the local gentry&apos;. This failed &apos;people&apos;s war&apos; produced a thicket of new laws that were to shape the nation&apos;s history: &apos;By eliminating manumission, gatherings, travel and bearing arms for black people only; by granting licence to any white to kill any black for any reason; by compensating owners for a slave&apos;s maiming or death, they separated and protected whites from all others for ever.&apos;  Morrison makes Vaark a Johnny Appleseed idealist (she is keen on suggestive names - he is Virginia&apos;s Noah: VA&apos;s ark). He has a parcel of land to farm, he has notions about how he will cultivate a virtuous fortune and he has advertised for a capable wife from England to share this optimism. The 16-year-old Rebekka duly arrives. When the novel opens, however, Vaark&apos;s ideals are floundering: he has lost three sons soon after childbirth; his daughter, aged five, has been killed by a kick from a horse, &apos;unleavening&apos; his wife. The farm is not as profitable as he had hoped. All this is in his mind as he travels to Maryland to claim a debt from a tobacco plantation owner, a Se\u00f1or D&apos;Ortega. When Vaark arrives at the plantation, it is clear there is no money to pay him. D&apos;Ortega instead offers him payment in that other fluid currency, human flesh. Vaark is outraged by this offer. D&apos;Ortega&apos;s line-up of two dozen of his chained workers brings to Vaark&apos;s Protestant mind a &apos;silence that made him imagine an avalanche seen from a great distance. No sound just the knowledge of a roar he couldn&apos;t hear&apos;. He has a conscience, still. Even so, to avoid embarrassment, he reluctantly receives what&apos;s owing to him in the form of a little girl, Florens - her name itself is loose change - whom he spots wearing some of Se\u00f1ora Ortega&apos;s cast-off shoes. This act is the mercy of the book&apos;s title. It is a profoundly small mercy, of course, but, at her mother&apos;s wish, Florens&apos;s life is passed from the cruelties of Ortega&apos;s plantation to the relative ease of Vaark&apos;s farm. The transaction has exacted another price, however; it has added to the irresolution in Vaark&apos;s mind. Why should this Ortega have the big house, and the fine clothes, while he struggles with his farming and restraint? At an inn, he falls into conversation with another man, who sets out to him the flavour of the new economics. The future is in sugar, in molasses, in rum (and, by inference, in mass slave labour). Sugar is not like fur, tobacco or lumber. There is &apos;no loss of investment. None. Ever. No crop failure. No wiped-out beaver or fox. No war to interfere. Crop plentiful, eternal. Slave workers, same. Buyers eager. Product, heavenly...&apos; Vaark is tempted by the invisible hand of this new market, not least because geography salves his &apos;liberal&apos; conscience. &apos;There was a profound difference between the intimacy of slave bodies at [Ortega&apos;s plantation] and a remote labour force in Barbados. Right? Right, he thought, looking at a sky vulgar with stars.&apos; Investing in the Barbados plantations is one of Vaark&apos;s last acts in the novel, but it is a defining decision in American history - it represents the moment when it was determined that the engine of capitalism in the New World would be slave labour in distant lands. Having set up his offshore commodity business - and created the world in which the women in his life will live - we next see him, considerably richer, dying of smallpox, leaving his young wife to farm their estate with the help of their three accommodated girls: Florens, now grown to be a teenager; Lina, their native American servant, taken in as an orphan; and Sorrow, the daughter of a sea captain, made simple-minded from almost dying in a shipwreck, another foundling on whom Vaark took pity. In these four representative souls, Morrison might have you believe, lay the best hopes of the nation. Each of the women seems locked inside her own head, and inside her own fate. All of them are slaves in different ways. Shipped over from England, Rebekka had to choose between the prospects of &apos;servant, prostitute or wife&apos;, and though horrible stories were told about each of those careers, &apos;the last one seemed the safest&apos;. Lina has witnessed a fall from the Eden of her childhood - her tribe was wiped out by a plague - and she clings to &apos;the Mistress&apos; as the only stability in her broken world. Sorrow changes her name over the course of the novel - she has a daughter and becomes Complete. Florens, meanwhile, swaps one slavery for another; she becomes infatuated with the blacksmith who comes to the estate, a freed slave from New Amsterdam, who wants nothing of her submission. Morrison structures the novel in her familiar manner, giving one chapter by turns to each competing voice, collapsing time frames, seldom letting her characters directly rub up against one another, trapping each of them in their biographies. In this way, she creates something that lives powerfully as an invented oral history and that seems to demand to be taken as a parable, but one whose meaning - which lives in the territory of harshness and sacrifice - is constantly undermined or elusive. Rebekka&apos;s voice is, in the present of the novel, delirious with fever - she has her husband&apos;s illness and, as a result, the world of all four women is reeling on its axis. Without the Mistress, none of the servant girls will have a place anywhere and without the assistance of her servant girls, Rebekka will die. It is on these kinds of paradoxes of mutual female dependency that Morrison builds her brief vision of America&apos;s genesis. Florens has gone to the blacksmith for help and, in her journey, for a moment, all of her nation&apos;s possibilities seem to lie: &apos;How long will it take will he be there will she get lost will someone assault her will she return will he and is it already too late? For salvation.&apos; Since winning the Nobel Prize in 1993, Morrison has, not altogether reluctantly, taken on the voice of America&apos;s conscience. After the marvels of empathy that were Beloved and, to a lesser extent, Jazz, that public voice has grown - she has sometimes seemed a spokeswoman rather than a writer - and the voice of her novels has become sparer. In this book, a good deal of Morrison&apos;s stark, almost biblical imaginative power is on display, without all of her former detailing energy. Nathaniel Hawthorne has become her model in some ways; like him, she is capable of creating fictional environments in which everything can come to seem symbolic. Portentous is not always a comfortable tone, but in the coming American weeks it may well be the appropriate one. The first line of A Mercy? &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid.&apos;  Toni Morrison: A life Born 18 February 1931, in Ohio. Educated Cornell University, where she read English.

Tom will be here from about 1.15pm GMT, or 2.15pm BST, which ... etc. In the meantime, read Paul Wilson&apos;s match preview, or something about Robbie Keane, or even a big interview with big Phil Scolari.  And your teams are: Chelsea: Cech, Bosingwa, Carvalho, Terry, Ashley Cole, Mikel, Kalou, Deco, Lampard, Malouda, Anelka. Subs: Cudicini, Ivanovic, Di Santo, Sinclair, Ferreira, Alex, Belletti. Liverpool: Reina, Arbeloa, Carragher, Agger, Aurelio, Alonso,Mascherano, Kuyt, Gerrard, Riera, Keane, Not Torres. Subs: Cavalieri,Dossena, Hyypia, Benayoun, Pennant, Babel, Leiva Lucas. Referee: Howard Webb (S Yorkshire)  So today&apos;s the day we see which of these teams can break the - quite frankly dull - hegemony Hull City have established over the Premier League. It&apos;s going to be tough for Liverpool though, despite that win over United - they were without Torres then too - they haven&apos;t looked two hot against Atl\u00e9tico and Wigan and the last time Chelsea lost at Stamford Bridge we all had jobs.  Daniel Levy has just popped up on Sky Sports by the way saying how horrified he is at what&apos;s happened to Spurs, which is quite amusing seeing as he&apos;s what&apos;s happened to Spurs.  1 min: And we&apos;re off. Does anyone think Liverpool can win the title, by the way? Remember to put I AM A LIAR in the subject line of your emails. If anyone knows another Chris de Burgh song apart from Lady in Red then email me with the heading I AM THE KIND OF PERSON WHO THINK LIVERPOOL WILL WIN THE LEAGUE.  3 min: Gerrard nicks the ball of Bosingwa and breaks forward but his ball&apos;s too strong for Keane and Cech gathers.  5 min: Mikel, who&apos;s looked like Vieira at his peak at times this season, sweeps a ball forward that&apos;s too strong for Bosingwa. Kalou then has the ball in the net after Anelka heads down for him on the edge of the area, but it&apos;s offside.  8 min: The game already looks like it&apos;s going to be an open one, with Liverpool happy to surge forward. It&apos;s been Chelsea that have been the more attacking team so far though and Kalou is caught offside as he shapes up to cross on the byline.  GOAL!!!!!!!! Chelsea 0-1 Liverpool (Alonso, 10 min)The ball breaks for Alonso on the edge of the srea and he hits a hopeful shot towards goal, that fulfills his hopes by deflecting off Carvalho and past the stranded Cech. If you think Liverpool can win the title, the send me an email and remember to put in the subject line in as I AM A VISIONARY  12 min:  Anelka has a sulky looking shot that dribbles wide of the Liverpool goal.  15 min: Liverpool are keeping the ball brilliantly when they go forward secure in the knowledge they can fall back on Mascherano, Alonso or Carvalho&apos;s chest if they get into any trouble.  18 min: Riera smacks the ball into the side netting, when he really should have crossed. &quot;Lady in Red is not a song, but rather some joke in poor taste perpetrated by some boffin with access to radio playlists (as then were),&quot; says Lou Roper. &quot;Obviously, having succeeded so dramatically once in defiling pop culture in this way, the offender has decided to lie low while the deBurgh &apos;career&apos; winds down to the level of comment by MBM readers (like those other 80&apos;s &apos;phenomena&apos;, Everton).&quot; Did you know De Burgh went to school with Nick Drake? Not that it did Drake much good in the long-term but there you go.  22 min: &quot;Unfortuately, I do know another Chis de Burgh song: Patricia the Stripper,&quot; says Duncan. &quot;I hope Hull City win the Championship.&quot; Too late, West Brom have already done it. Bosingwa&apos;s cross is met by Kalou&apos;s head, which then meets his hands when his shot balloons over the bar.  25 min: Gerrard&apos;s dips a shot in from Gerrard-range and Cech just about tips it over.  28 min: Chelsea escort the ball from Liverpool&apos;s area back to their own. They do keep possession though. &quot;It&apos;s too soon to say we, Liverpool, will win the title, just 10 games in. It&apos;s soon enough to be out of it, however, as we have been in recent seasons by this stage,&quot; says Brian Jones. &quot;What do Liverpool fans expect? To be in contention, come the last handful of games, with a real chance to win it. The only worry now, having scored at the Bridge, is how the hell do we come from behind?&quot;  33 min: Carragher flies in to intercept a Chelsea through ball, Lampard picks it up and lashes a shot in that goes just wide. &quot;Afternoon, Tom,&quot; starts Ian Copestake. &quot;Lady in Red is often dismissed as pure unadulterated pap, but appearing in 1986, three years prior to the fall of communism, the song anticipated that event by taking aim at the phantom of its popular appeal. Behind the old iron curtain the irony of De Burgh is fully appreciated.&quot;  35 min: With his back to goal, Mikel chests the ball down, spins round and without looking plays a quick pass to Bosingwa on the edge of the area.  37 min: Deco cuts in from the right and sends a stinging shot past Reina&apos;s right-hand post. Chelsea are creating everything at the moment, but it&apos;s still restricted to long-range.  40 min: &quot;Lady in Red (and a smoking hot daughter) may be DeBurgh&apos;s only claim to fame, but can you name a Nick Drake song other than River Man? Can you?&quot; shouts Joe Pearson. Yep: At The Chime Of A City Clock. Not as good as Lady in Red though If anyone wants to send in belaboured comparisons between Nick Drake songs and Liverpool&apos;s current league position, feel free.  43 min: Mikel&apos;s pass is intercepted near the centre circle and Liverpool have an extra man, but seem satisfied to keep possession rather than look for a second goal.  45 min: Gerrard plays a superb 25-yard ball to Kuyt who races down the right. The final ball into the box is picked up by Chelsea and they have a brief discussion between their defenders before the danger is cleared.  Half time: Chelsea have played some beautiful football at times: all quick passes and imperious moves, but haven&apos;t created a really clear chance. Liverpool meanwhile, relied on a deflection to score their goal and look happy to wait for another break to come their way for a second goal.  46 min: Right, Chelsea will need to get a little more urgent if they&apos;re going to prosper in this half. Here&apos;s Duke Serengeti, who would like everyone to know he&apos;s not a De Burgh fan: &quot;De Burgh&apos;s Spanish Train consolidates his status as a melodic Nostrodamus: And I said &apos;Look out, Lord, he&apos;s going to win&apos;,/ The sun is down and the night is riding in, / That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line, / Oh Lord, he&apos;s going to win!&quot;  49 min: Liverpool have a free-kick around 35-yards out. Gerrard shapes up to thrash it in, but instead lays the ball off to Mascherano who does absolutely nothing (well, he passes to a Chelsea defender).  51 min: Liverpool concede a free-kick when Malouda has a wee tumble. It flies across goal about six-yards out but no one in a blue shirt can exploit it. &quot;Re: De Burgh and the fall of communism (33 min),&quot; starts Lou Roper. &quot;Perhaps the sound emanating from &apos;decadent Western airwaves&apos; caused the communist authorities to hold their hands to their ears thereby relaxing their control over their societies?&quot;  Even more pertinently, if the domination of free-market capitalism after the fall of communism led to the current financial crisis, is De Burgh to blame for the imminent downfall of western society too, making him some kind of destroyer of worlds? The Chinese might want to keep an eye on him over the next few years.  53 min: &quot;Liverpool are passing it around nicely,&quot; says my colleague Richard Aikman 2.46 seconds before Carragher boots a long ball towards Spain. Lampard then finds Malouda in loads of space, but all he can do is drive his shot into Carragher&apos;s legs. Poor.  56 min: Aurelio is given responsibility for a free-kick in a dangerous position - presumably because he&apos;s Brazilian, because as you&apos;re about to find out he&apos;s rubbish at them - and cannons it over. Chelsea then have a clear penalty, shame Malouda was already flagged offside.  59 min: Reina&apos;s huge goal-kick eventually leads to a Kuyt chance on the edge of the area, which flies wide. Kalou is off for Di Franco and Malouda is off for Beletti. &quot;Maybe I missed it but are you aware that De Burgh is a huge Liverpool fan,&quot; says SteveW. &quot;He goes to many games and has played (sang) at the club many times. Apart from being probably the greatest singer songwriter in the universe he supports the greatest side.&quot; I know, he&apos;s emailed me 84 times already today about Gerrard&apos;s ability to play in the hole.  61 min:  Belletti has an immediate effect as his cross creates a bit of panic in the Liverpool area. Cole reckons he was pushed by Kuyt. But he wasn&apos;t. Super striker Robbie Keane is off for hip-hop&apos;s Ryan Babel.  63 min:  The Alonso/Carvalho combination nearly socres again as the Spaniard&apos;s free-kick smacks off the post and the Chelsea defender nearly puts the rebound into his own net.  66 min: Mascherano is booked for dissent but manages to stop himself having a meltdown and getting sent off. Well done, Javier. Richard Woods has been having a bit of a think about Spurs and Nick Drake. &quot;While listening to Fruit Tree I was struck by how pertinent &apos;forgotten while you&apos;re here/ remembered for a while&apos; is to the past 2 million Spurs managers. The following lines &apos;a much updated ruin / From a much outdated style&apos; is simply Tottenham Hotspur, now, then and forever.&quot; Eat that, De Burgh.  69 min: A ricochet unleashes Mascherano and he only needs to find Kuyt (who then admitedly needs to get it on target) but his cross doesn&apos;t find its target. Liverpool have had by far teh better chances this half, even with Chelsea continuing to dominate possession.  73 min: Ashley Cole has the best chance of the match for Chelsea. Di Santo heads down a cross for the ever popular England full-back who then slices his shot four miles wide. &quot;Amsterdam is rooting for Liverpool,&quot; says Caspar Wijers, who I assume is the mayor of Amsterdam, &quot;and another one of Kuyt&apos;s perfect deflection goals.&quot;  76 min: Di Santo is fantastic in the air and leaps again to head a cross down to which ever Chelsea player wants to score: which is none of them. Deco then dances into the box and his shot is deflected wide of the post  78 min: If Chelsea do score it&apos;ll be through Di Santo who has been their best player since he came on. &quot;I fear that De Burgh was a great fan of the real cause of our current financial meltdown,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Cannot say her name, but think miners.&quot; He&apos;ll email in in a bit, Ian, so I&apos;ll check with him then.  81 min: Liverpool play 20 or 30 passes in a row as they work their way up the pitch, step-by-delicate-step. It eventually ends as Babel miscontrols in the area, but it shows that Liverpool deserve what they&apos;ve got so far.  83 min: &quot;The Woman in Red, a movie using the De Burgh track and starring an excellent Gene Wilder, also contributed to the defeat of communism showing how a happy go luck proletariat in the west could make good,&quot; points out Billy Murphy helpfully.  85 min: Deco&apos;s flick comes to Di Santo at thigh-height and he can only jab at the ball and Liverpool clear the danger easily. Scott Sinclair comes on for Bosingwa.  87 min: Gerrard finds Kuyt on the right of the Chelsea area, his cross is parried out by Cech but with most of the Liverpool players in their own half, there&apos;s no one to exploit it. &quot;If this comes down to the last minute Liverpool need a player likeBarnes to just run it into the corner,&quot; chuckles Ian Copestake.  88 min: Lucas is on for Kuyt.  89 min:  Mikel takes a mighty swing from outside the area, but it flies over. The ball is that, not the area.  90 min: Three minutes of injury time...  90 min +1: Chelsea dirty themselves by knocking a long ball into the area that Liverpool deal with easily enough.  90min + 2The Liverpool fans sing little known Scouse ditty You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone as Chelsea resort to a long shot from Di Santo.  PEEEEEEP!!!!!Chelsea&apos;s 86 game unbeaten run at home is over! The way they took the lead wasn&apos;t impressive - Chelsea had been the better team and went on to dominate the first-half - but their second half performance was brilliant. It was Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side that looked the most dangerous and Chelsea never figured out how to get in behind them. Played like true title contenders.", "sentences": ["&quot;Amsterdam is rooting for Liverpool,&quot; says Caspar Wijers, who I assume is the mayor of Amsterdam, &quot;and another one of Kuyt&apos;s perfect deflection goals.&quot;  76 min: Di Santo is fantastic in the air and leaps again to head a cross down to which ever Chelsea player wants to score: which is none of them."], "title": "Chelsea v Liverpool - as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/oct/26/premierleague-chelsea", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Liverpool", "Football", "Premier League", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-27T00:01:00Z", "article": "Many artists have more than one work in our 1,000.

As the drops rolled down his foppish, unkempt and forever dirty-looking hair and onto his face, his bewilderment was tangible. How his Feyenoord, stocked with cracking footballers, were somehow taking another beating at home - to Heerenveen this time on Sunday - was incomprehensible. Young Brazilian striker Paulo Henrique had put Verbeek&apos;s former pupils 1-0 up before Danijel Pranjic doubled the score and, in so doing, reaffirmed his status as the league&apos;s best midfielder. Feyenoord managed to stage a spirited turnaround though through Roy Makaay and Michael Mols&apos;s goals late in the game. Their supporters greeted the draw, and the side&apos;s fifth point from seven matches, like it had won the Uefa Cup - something the club last did in 2002, which was also when consistently good football was last spotted in Rotterdam. However, following Wednesday&apos;s abysmal 3-0 loss to Nancy, actually accomplishing the aforementioned is out of the question. &quot;The fifth defeat was near,&quot; Algemeen Dagblad&apos;s Sjoerd Mossou wrote. &quot;So loud were the supporters&apos; cheers that their relief must have been heard [in every corner of the country]. Behind goal Mols was nearly hugged to death by a handful of team-mates.&quot; Verbeek found an easy target for his ire. A TV reporter asked him if his side had deserved their draw, which they hadn&apos;t. Verbeek paused for what seemed an eternity of awkwardness and looked down on the spry journalist with more than just condescension. &quot;I&apos;m wondering if you&apos;re taking your job seriously,&quot; Verbeek barked, his fleshy lips colliding with one another. PSV scarcely fared better. After a wholly unimpressive 2-0 win at home to Olympique Marseille on Wednesday, which was heralded by the Dutch press as a glorious triumph, the Eindhovenaren stumbled on domestically. Roda JC proved that PSV&apos;s mojo is still awol after they merely went through the motions on Saturday. Without the ever so slightly injured Ibrahim Afellay - who is now being accused of being soft by some and &quot;sensitive&quot; by former manager Sef Vergoossen - the Philips Sport Vereniging went down 3-2 at home to a side that are hardly imposing in their own right. &quot;We have to think of and show something different and we have to do it very soon or we&apos;ll have lost too many points,&quot; defender Dirk Marcellis said of his team&apos;s third defeat in seven Eredivisie contests. &quot;It&apos;s not as simple as it looks. It&apos;s difficult.&quot; &quot;PSV appeared to have gained little confidence since Wednesday,&quot; the ANP news agency reported. &quot;In possession the simplest things went wrong. Defensively PSV didn&apos;t come across as stubborn and solid as in previous seasons.&quot; Outside the other dressing room interim-manager Martin Koopman, who was appointed after Raymond Atteveld&apos;s canning last week, was at a loss to explain the win. &quot;I do what I have to do,&quot; he drivelled. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s clicking.&quot; The Roda squad have begged the board to keep him on. &quot;It&apos;s flattering but it&apos;s not up to me,&quot; Koopman said helpfully. &quot;This situation is fun but we&apos;ll see what happens.&quot; On Friday, ADO Den Haag saw their good start to the season disintegrate further on Heracles&apos; artificial pitch. Heracles&apos; Mario Jardel-esque Brazilian striker Everton scored two opportunistic goals, celebrating one by whipping out a pacifier and pretending to weep like a child as he strolled across the implausible plastic. The other goal was rewarded with the now clich\u00e9d Bebeto rocking of the newborn, in case there was any remaining doubt that he&apos;d just become a father. His scrappy colleague up front Ricky van den Bergh scored the third in the 3-1 win. But Groningen are once again kings of the Eredivisie hill after obliterating Sparta 3-0, thanks to a dominant performance by Swedish striker Petter Andersson who smashed in not just two goals but also the collarbone of Sparta defender Sander van Gessel. &quot;After going down 2-0 to this amazing team it becomes hard,&quot; Sparta manager Foeke Booy said. &quot;The difference in quality is enormous.&quot; Over in Amsterdam the whitening of Marco van Basten&apos;s dome accelerated a little further as he watched his Ajax creep to a second straight, devastatingly bad, win - this one against NEC. Gabor Babos twice saved Ajax shots, only to see the ball roll to the feet of Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Luis Suarez respectively for two tap-in goals and a 2-0 win. &quot;After another weekend of tricks in the magic box that is the Eredivisie, Ajax actually finds itself in fifth place,&quot; Willem Vissers wrote in De Volkskrant. &quot;Huntelaar and Suarez got chances despite the syrupy, almost sleep-inducing play \u2026 while NEC couldn&apos;t muster anything offensively. [Van Basten] simply doesn&apos;t understand why Ajax were so weak under the Arena&apos;s closed roof, a breeding ground for fair-weather footballers.&quot; In earning a commendable 1-0 win against Racing Santander on Thursday, Steve McClaren&apos;s Twente clearly used up their supply of good football for the week. Two decent finishes by Marko Arnautovic couldn&apos;t salvage the 90 minute yawn that was Twente&apos;s 2-0 victory over Vitesse. Having said that, at least Twente keeper Sander Boschker&apos;s near own goal when clumsily clearing the ball was good for a chuckle. In Louis van Gaal&apos;s 150th match in charge, AZ dispatched last-place Volendam, whose chunky goalie Jeroen Verhoeven turned in another good performance, 3-0. And in a boring-looking fixture De Graafschap and Willem II managed an exciting 1-1 draw while the exciting Utrecht - NAC match-up yielded a 0-0 bore draw. That didn&apos;t bother Utrecht any though after the week they&apos;ve had. Days before Spurs fired both their manager and his assistants, Utrecht thought they&apos;d try and solve the status quo in a new way. They decided not to fire manager Willem van Hanegem, a quasi-saint in the Netherlands who is ultimately responsible for the team&apos;s form, but his two assistants, fitness coach and goalkeeping coach. On Sunday van Hanegem was conspicuously absent with &quot;flu.&quot; The club then showed their faith in new assistant Ton du Chatinier by letting technical director Piet Buter manage the match. For the first time in many decades the Eredivisie is up for grabs. And the new big three, FC Groningen, NAC and AZ, look like the early favourites as Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord lie in an unimpressive fifth, sixth and fifteenth place respectively. Results: FC Utrecht 0-0 NAC; Ajax 2-0 NEC; Feyenoord 2-2 Heerenveen; Vitesse 0-2 FC Twente; PSV 2-3 Roda JC; AZ 3-0 FC Volendam; FC Groningen 3-0 Sparta; Willem II 1-1 De Graafschap; Heracles 3-1 ADO Den Haag.", "sentences": ["&quot;The difference in quality is enormous.&quot; Over in Amsterdam the whitening of Marco van Basten&apos;s dome accelerated a little further as he watched his Ajax creep to a second straight, devastatingly bad, win - this one against NEC."], "title": "Football: Leander Schaerlaeckens's Dutch round-up: Eredivisie up for grabs as new big three take over at the top", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/oct/27/azalkmaar-nacbreda", "tags": ["AZ Alkmaar", "NAC Breda", "Groningen", "Ajax", "PSV Eindhoven", "Feyenoord", "Utrecht", "Twente", "De Graafschap", "Heerenveen", "Roda JC", "Den Haag", "NEC Nijmegen", "Hercules", "Eredivisie", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-10-28T11:39:44Z", "article": "Forget the red-light district, forget the tulip market, and don&apos;t even think about rolling a joint in a coffeehouse. Amsterdam&apos;s Museumnacht has so much to offer, you&apos;ll never see Amsterdam in the same light again.  For one night, on November 1, 41 museums remain open and offer more than 200 free activities to curious visitors. At 2am, when the museums close, the party begins in the nine clubs celebrating the event until dawn.  Although in its eighth year, Museumnacht is little known to the outside world, perhaps because the programme is not available in any other language than Dutch. So be brave, and trust your instincts. You won&apos;t regret it. 1. Cut patients open at the Waag society Do you remember Rembrandt&apos;s famous painting; The Anatomy Lesson, which he painted in 1632 aged only 26? If you want to relive those exciting times of European scientific experiment and discovery - or you&apos;re just plain ghoulish - head over to the Waag Society, Amsterdam&apos;s new media centre based in one of the city&apos;s oldest houses. The Society is allowing visitors into its virtual &quot;theatrum anatomicum&quot;, or operating theatre, where they will be able to cut open (digitalised) patients. That&apos;s until midnight. If you need a stiff drink after butchering your first patient, the Waag society provides just that until 2am. \u00b7 Nieuwmarket, 4; waag.org 2. Listen to jazz at the Portuguese synagogue After Spain expelled Jews in 1492, many left for Portugal but a policy of forced baptism took them further north to Holland, and Amsterdam in particular, where they could enjoy the Dutch Republic&apos;s freedom of religion. A vibrant homage to the Jewish community&apos;s importance during the Dutch Enlightenment, the 17th-century Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam is one of the biggest and most beautiful in Europe. The Dutch jazz crooner Wouter Penris will perform live at 11pm, followed at midnight by a choral concert. \u00b7 Visserplein, 3; esnoga.com 3. Show some bling at Rembrandt&apos;s House At last year&apos;s Museumnacht, visitors to Rembrandt&apos;s house were treated to a glass of champagne, pink tarts with glitter glazing and a tombola: the lucky winner left with an original 17th-century print. This year, the night&apos;s theme is bling, an echo perhaps of Rembrandt&apos;s luxury tastes which saw him bankrupt at the end of his life. From 7pm to 2am, a &quot;low budget bar&quot; will welcome visitors in Rembrandt&apos;s kitchen. \u00b7 Jodenbreestraat, 4; rembrandthuis.nl 4. Have midnight tea at the Van Loons The Van Loons were Amsterdam&apos;s city-mayors and founders of the Dutch East-India company. Their fabulous home, kept intact since 1672, offers a refined journey through time. The museum keepers, dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns, will greet visitors with a glass of champagne. Every half hour, a historian will give a lecture on Anna, Louise and Thora, the women in the Van Loon family. At midnight, tea will be served. Decadence, the Van Loon way. \u00b7 Keizersgracht, 672; museumvanloon.nl 5. Follow a crash course in Guy Debord&apos;s situationism at ARCAM The Amsterdam&apos;s Architecture Centre is dedicating the whole night to Guy Debord and the situationist movement. To get in the mood, visitors will be greeted at 7pm with situationist cocktails prepared by Blendz, cocktail artist maker in residence, then artist Jacqueline de Jong will give everybody a crash course in international situationism. At 9pm, you can learn the basics of Parkour. DJ Kozzmann will spin the night out the situationist way with his Club D\u00e9rive until 2am. \u00b7 Prins Hendrikadde, 600; arcam.nl 6. Costume concerts at the Pianola Museum One of the smallest museums in Amsterdam, located in the Joordan district, was a police station before becoming the Pianola museum. The former cells now house one of the biggest Dutch collections of automated instruments and rolled partitions. Every half hour, from 7pm to 2am, musicians dressed in 1850s costumes will perform tableaux vivants and concerts such as Beethoven&apos;s Kreutzer sonata. \u00b7 Westerstraat, 106; pianola.nl 7. Visit the bag museum For all of you designer bag addicts, why not learn a thing or two at the Tassen Museum of the history of bags and purses? While perusing their 3,500-bag collection dating back to the middle ages, you&apos;ll be attended by usherettes dressed in 18th-century costume from toe to purse, and the melody of a live concert of 18th-century music will accompany you through this palace&apos;s many splendid reception rooms. Concert continues until 2am.  \u00b7 Herengracht, 573; tassenmuseum.nl 8. Bollywood and movies in bed at the Film Museum Does the idea of lying on a giant bed next to strangers in a closed room while watching, projected on the ceiling, 15 minutes of edited movie scenes showing people passionately kissing each other appeal? Then don&apos;t miss the Film Museum whose many Museumnacht activities include just that. The night will also be dedicated to Bollywood with the chance of dressing up like a Bollywood star and be photographed. \u00b7 Vondelpark, 3; filmmuseum.nl 9. Art and soul at the Van Gogh Museum Love is the Museumnacht theme at the Van Gogh Museum: visitors will be given samples of love potions to taste while eight actors will perform in the museum&apos;s corridors, taking &quot;love&quot; as their principal theme. From 8pm to 1am, you can declare your love for a work of art in the museum&apos;s virtual video booth and then see yourself on YouTube. If you prefer to text your declaration of love, just click and see your words adorn the museum&apos;s walls. If you&apos;re not in the mood for love, just stay in the main hall and listen at 8pm and 10pm to Amsterdam&apos;s new soul sensation, Giovanca Ostiana&apos;s acoustic sets.  \u00b7 Paulus Potterstraat, 7; vangoghmuseum.nl 10. After-party at the Sugar Factory The Sugar Factory is one of nine Amsterdam clubs celebrating Museumnacht until dawn. Ticket pass holders will get in for free or have to top up the entrance fee by a few euros. Sugar Factory has concocted a special evening where Hot-Mama Wannabeastar will be joining Discocult as the new resident in an &quot;atom-smashing party formula&quot;. Good night and good luck. \u00b7 Lijnbaansgracht, 238. Leidseplein; sugarfactory.nl More information \u00b7 Museumnacht&apos;s programme is available (only in Dutch) at www.n8.nl/2008. Tickets cost \u20ac17 (\u00a313.50) and are on sale at Amsterdam&apos;s central station and at the AUB ticketshop on Leidseplein. You can also buy them on the Museumnacht website. Tickets give access to 41 museums until 2am, discount at nine clubs organising Museumnacht after-parties, free use of all the city&apos;s buses, trams and metros till 6am, and a free museum visit valid for two months.

A number of people go to Amsterdam, and never get to the Vondelpark ... don&apos;t make this mistake! Try to catch one of the outdoor plays, as they really are a magical experience. The park also houses a fascinating museum, The Filmmuseum, which is well worth a visit.

I bought one for 48 hours and found it very good value for money. I certainly got more than \u20ac43 worth of museum, canal trips and transport from it. You can buy it from Holland Tourist Information at Schiphol by credit card and it makes it easier to work out a budget for the rest of your stay.

Selling about 500 beers from all over the world and specialising in beers from small independent brewers, it&apos;s an absolute treasure trove for the beer lover. You can buy Westvleteren there (which is reputedly the best beer in the world and extremely hard to come by), as well as some truly stunning Scandinavian and American beers. Try the Norwegian Porters and Imperial Stouts. Highly recommended. Once you&apos;ve bought some for later, why not pop into Caf\u00e9 Gollem to try a couple on tap and maybe a Kaasplank (literally a plank with cheese and bread on it). Very satisfying.

Art about self-identity that is desperate to escape staid self-consciousness. (RC) Raphael - The Marriage of the Virgin (1504), Agnolo and Maddalena Doni (c1506-1507), The Entombment (1507), The Bridgewater Madonna (c1507), The School of Athens (1509-1510), Pope Julius II (1511), Galatea (1511-1512), Madonna della Sedia (c1512), The Liberation of St Peter (c1512-1513), The Sistine Madonna (c1512-1514), Sistine Tapestry Cartoons (1515-1516), The Fire in the Borgo (c1516-1517), St Michael (1518), Transfiguration (1518-1520), La Fornarina (1518-1520) The perfection of Raphael&apos;s art, which once made him the most revered painter of all, has done much to harm his popularity in modern times. Today he is in the curious position of being at once indestructibly famous, irremovably in the canon, and yet largely unloved. People are trained now to dislike art like Raphael&apos;s without really looking at it: the very words that praise it - harmonious, proportionate, classical - condemn it to oblivion in a world that despises those virtues. Nothing is ever likely again to restore Raphael to the status of a popular classic - but nor will the museums be taking his works off the walls any time soon because he is, like it or not, one of the supreme visual creators who ever lived. His art brings 200 years of experiment in Italy, since the time of Giotto, to a triumphant climax. His classicism is not chilly, either, but soulful - and if it comes easily and naturally to him, this does not mean there is not deep urgency and need in his pursuit of order. Raphael, son of an artist and intellectual at the court of Urbino, was orphaned, which must have deepened the appeal of an embracing divine order for him. He lived in violent times: his Entombment was commissioned to mourn a young man killed in the faction fights that plagued Perugia, its grief rendered more powerful, not less, by Raphael&apos;s disciplined aesthetic. He is great at painting action and danger - his fresco of the Fire in the Borgo is quoted by Picasso in Guernica. His paintings glow with the utopian ideals of the Renaissance. In a world that was still medieval, ridden by wars and plague and lacking basic medical knowledge, the dream of the ancient world that so moved Italians 500 years ago was at its root a belief that life could be made perfect: that streets could be open and airy, squares civic and peaceful. Raphael expresses this dream of the utopian city in his lovely early picture The Marriage of the Virgin, with its glorious open temple on a piazza, and perfects it in The School of Athens, which portrays ancient Greek philosophers in an architecture so lofty it looks like Mount Olympus. His eye for the basic and human never gets lost in the ideal. His Portrait of Julius II puts a human being before you as intensely as the Fayoum mummy portraits. His portraits are always like this - his imitation of the pose of the Mona Lisa in his picture of Maddalena Doni is touching because his sitter is so plainly real, a living woman, not Leonardo&apos;s dream. In his late work La Fornarina he portrays his own lover naked. But Raphael&apos;s art cannot be reduced to terms we find easier, such as those of realist art. His power and beauty lie in his exquisite yet robust balance of forces: a balance that comes of perfect calculation of colours, symmetry of volumes, sympathy of gestures. In other words, it can be said the distinction of Raphael really does lie in harmony, proportion and classicism - qualities that are as compelling in him as in Mozart, or a pine cone. (JJ) Rapu Nui (Easter Island) (1000-1650) - Carved stone figures Square-jawed and hollow-eyed, the massive moai statues that stand on Easter Island&apos;s windswept slopes have captured imaginations ever since Europeans &quot;discovered&quot; them in the 18th century. They were made as a ritual by the entire community for nearly 700 years, and then the cult collapsed, displaced by a new preoccupation with a birdman who incarnated the universal creator god. They brood on their lonely shore as if bleakly awaiting the end of time. (JJ) Robert Rauschenberg - Bed (1955), Canyon (1955), Odalisk (1955-1958), Monogram (1955-1959) The paint spattered like gore on Rauschenberg&apos;s Bed echoes the dripped and poured art of Jackson Pollock. Abstract expressionist painting was still new when Rauschenberg made the assemblages he called Combines in the 1950s, and he did not so much reject as complicate it. In Bed, the freedom and energy of slapdash painting is not abstract but tells a story: this is a bed he had slept on, and its painterly stains seem clues to something that happened in it. It&apos;s the scene of a crime. Rauschenberg&apos;s Combines tantalisingly mingle sensual, painterly painting with stuff collaged and assembled from found detritus. There is a pungent atmosphere of old, decaying junk to them, in among the sexual symbolism and expressive globs of paint. They have an intensity, a life, that easily places them among the most resonant art objects of the last 60 years. (JJ) Man Ray - Compass (1920), Marcel Duchamp as Rrose S\u00e9lavy (1920-1921), Tears (1930-1932) Man Ray, the first artist to imbue photography with a thoroughly surrealist aesthetic, experimented restlessly with technique, reviving solarisation, using superimposition, under- and overexposure, photograms, and shooting through filters. But he also produced some of the most dynamically glamorous images - especially in his fashion photography - and redefined the possibilities of photography. Compass, a photographic hybrid of still life and installation, shows a suspended magnet clutching to a pistol that threateningly points the way. His portrait of Duchamp as alias Rrose S\u00e9lavy - that&apos;s meant to sound like &quot;Eros, c&apos;est la vie&quot; - subverts the young, supposedly revelatory tradition of photographic portraiture. Tears, meanwhile, is Ray in stylised glamour mode, with what looks like a silent screen starlet crying, and yet these are glass tears on a mannequin. Nothing is quite what it seems with Ray, and yet few photographers were ever so mesmerising. (EM) Odilon Redon - Portrait of Gauguin (1903-5) In Redon&apos;s art crisp symbols float in a perfumed mist - his homage to Gauguin is not a realistic portrait but a dreamlike elegy to this courageous artist&apos;s exotic soul.(JJ) Rembrandt - Old Woman (The Artist&apos;s Mother) (c1629), The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp (1632), Saskia as Flora (1634), Self Portrait with Saskia (1635), Belshazzar&apos;s Feast (1635), The Blinding of Sampson (1636), Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb (1638), The Night Watch (1942), Aristotle with the Bust of Homer (1653), A Woman Bathing (1654), Jan Six (1654), The Polish Rider (1655), Self-Portrait, holding His Palette, Brushes and Maul Stick (c1663), The Jewish Bride (1667), Self-Portrait (1669) The face of Rembrandt, from tousle-haired chubby boy, to the old man looking towards his own imminent death with one last spark of defiance, is more familiar than that of any of his contemporaries, because he created the record himself. It isn&apos;t in the handful of dull documents charting the arc of his life - a marriage, several mistresses, births, deaths, debts, a tangled estate - but in his own unparalleled series of self-portraits. We see Rembrandt as a gallant lad and a young married man, as an artisan holding the brushes and maul stick of his trade, as a prosperous (always a precarious state with Rembrandt) middle-aged man in splendid hat and furred robe. Finally, in a great last self-portrait painted within a few months of his death in 1669, like Prospero destroying his books, he has put aside the brushes from an earlier version, folded his hands, and waits for the end. Look at the left side of the face, and it&apos;s all gone - art, health, hope - but look to the right and that eyebrow is very slightly raised, the very corner of the lip slightly twitches, and just that one pinpoint of light remains defiant in the eye. He was only 23 when he painted the old woman now in the Royal Collection, long regarded as a portrait of his mother but probably just a study of old age to boast his prowess - and show wealthy patrons what he could do with their mothers or wives. The light is merciless, highlighting the pinched nose, sunken eyes and thin wrinkled lips - but she is no grotesque mocked by the young, but a figure full of calm assurance. Given a pretty model and a ravishing frock, Rembrandt could knock out a gorgeous goddess like Saskia seemingly smiling at her own grandeur. Take the frock away, and he could produce some of the most erotic nudes in art. He also left magnificent portraits of friends and patrons. More intriguing, however, are his dullest commissions, the group portraits where every man sharing the price of the picture wanted his own noble features immortalised. The Night Watch - a day watch before the varnish darkened - and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp become gripping human dramas, angled to draw the viewer into the tangle of lances or the circle of dark figures around the bright stripped corpse. For most of his life Rembrandt was a jobbing artist, taking commissions where he could get them, teaching a garret full of young hopefuls, using some of the brighter pupils to fill up canvases and adding the killer details himself, usually short of money and sometimes bankrupt. And yet the paintings seem drenched in a wisdom and humanity quite unaccounted for by the banal details of his life. Museums with the great Rembrandts are used to visitors transfixed before the paintings, lost less in the technique or even the beauty than in a yearning for some profound truth that seems just out of reach. It&apos;s there less in the aghast faces at Belshazzar&apos;s Feast than in a shiver in the light. It&apos;s there in the 1654 woman paddling (probably his mistress Hendrickje Stoffels, who bore him a daughter that year) holding her shift to mid-thigh to keep it out of the water - not a nymph or a saint, nor a coquette giving the come-on to the watchers in the bushes or the viewer, just a woman pleasantly lost in her own private thoughts. At the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, staff gently move on visitors who have stopped dead in front of The Jewish Bride. It shows a sumptuously dressed couple, picked out in amber light from the dark enigmatic background, the man much older than the girl, her fingers barely tipping his hand curved protectively just below her breast. Nothing is certain about them: whether they represent a biblical scene, a double portrait or models in studio fancy dress. The title was attached centuries later. But whatever the relationship, it seems agonisingly intense: as in so many of his works, a silence frozen, which must be broken by one of them speaking and revealing... something. (MK) Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Dance at La Moulin Galette (1876) The light that flickers across the faces and bodies of the young people at an open-air dance - brightly chancing on straw boaters, beer glasses, a stripy dress - shocked the first people who saw it. In that fragmenting movement of light, which makes painting itself visible between the world and the eye, they rightly glimpsed the impending modernist attack on pictorial comfort. (JJ) Gerhard Richter - October 18th, 1977 (1988) The faces of the Baader Meinhof terrorists dead in prison, their cells, their funeral, all blurred and grey in these works based on photographs, are terrible and sad in a shocking cycle of modern history paintings.(JJ) Bridget Riley - Fission (1963) Bridget Riley&apos;s early Op art paintings seemed to hum and buzz with electric energy. In the distortions of black dots and lines, she created optical illusions so that the surface of the paintings seem to be folding or opening, as if the viewer could dive into them. (JL) Diego Rivera - The Mexican War of Independence (1929-1935) The flamboyant Marxist painter Diego Rivera was the leader of the Mexican mural movement that sought to bring art to the masses through large-scale public works. This celebratory piece expounds the might of a united people.

He was the founding director of the Mickery Theatre in Amsterdam, a legendary centre for experimental theatre as well as a gallery and venue for performance art in the 1970s that played a pivotal role in setting many Dutch, American and UK artists on an international career. Artists such as the Pip Simmons Theatre Group, Mike Figgis and Station House Opera from Britain, and the Wooster Group, Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars from the US, showed their work under Ten Cate&apos;s care, and continued on through European festivals and venues.  Ten Cate went on to become the founding director of DasArts, Amsterdam&apos;s inter-disciplinary training programme, where he nurtured a new generation of performing artists, and throughout his career he contributed to numerous performances as a director, scriptwriter and designer. He was born into a wealthy family of textile mill owners in Almelo, the Netherlands; his childhood was overshadowed by the second world war, during which his parents hid resistance fighters, allied pilots and Jewish refugees in the family home.  He studied economics at Bristol University for a year in the 1950s but soon left to pursue his career in the Netherlands, where, in the rather provincial constellation that then prevailed, he navigated a complicated path to the performing arts through advertising, film, television and fashion. From the mid-1960s he ran a series of unpredictable performances and exhibits on his farm in Loenersloot, near Amsterdam, which attracted a curious and adventurous following.  In 1972 Ten Cate moved what had become the Mickery Theatre to a former cinema in Amsterdam, where he created a platform for international avant- garde performance. The presentation of experimental work from abroad was a novelty at that time, and in 1976, when the Hungarian security service evicted the Room Theatre from Budapest as dangerous subversives, Ten Cate set them up in an empty Rotterdam shop. From there, they moved to New York, and achieved fame as the Squat Theatre.  As well as being a nurturing producer, gentle, determined and assuring, Ten Cate directed his own productions, which experimented with the relationship between the performers and the audience, and tested the established perceptions of safety and comfort in the traditional auditorium. He published two magazines, worked as an installationist and supported many visual artists. He came to the view, however, that Dutch cultural policy failed to match his expansive production plans, so he decided to exit, not with a whimper but with a bang, and organised a festival, Touch Time, in all the venues around the Amsterdam Leidseplein in 1991. Then, having overseen 700 productions and 7,000 performances since its inception, he closed the Mickery and deposited its archive with the Theater Instituut Nederland, adding a generous grant to support its continued existence.  He spent several months at the institute, from 1992, preparing the future of DasArts, the international postgraduate training programme for theatre directors, designers and choreographers. This quickly established a European standing as an unorthodox school, with guest mentors running 10-week thematic blocks and students benefiting from Ten Cate&apos;s rich network to pursue their graduation projects in many venues and festivals. With stubborn loyalty to his artists, he always aimed to encourage his students to seek the furthest frontier of their freedom and creativity, putting fun and pleasure firmly in the foreground. Ten Cate left DasArts in 2000 to focus exclusively on visual and installation art, working for a year in the P.S.1 studio complex in New York, thanks to a grant from the Dutch government, then spending two years in the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, in Amsterdam, playing the role of a &quot;young artist&quot; with zest. His work soon appeared in many galleries, and for him the world of performing arts became something that belonged in the remote past. Reluctant to reminisce, he abhorred nostalgia, despised sentimentality and preferred to explore only the future of the arts. It took considerable coercion to persuade him to gather his speeches and essays into a book, Man Looking for Words (1996).  He finally succumbed to cancer after a long remission, but he had planned his exit as his last artistic production, with careful casting and attention to details, launching a farewell video performance, The Offering - A Meditation, on YouTube. He supplied the 450 mourners at his funeral with abundant champagne, which turned them into a chattering, artsy crowd on the sunny lawn. With this final act he made sure that fun and friendship triumphed over sadness and death.  He is survived by his wife, Colleen Scott, and a half-brother, Hendrik. \u2022 Ritsaert ten Cate, theatre producer, director and artist, born May 29 1938; died September 5 2008", "sentences": ["He was the founding director of the Mickery Theatre in Amsterdam, a legendary centre for experimental theatre as well as a gallery and venue for performance art in the 1970s that played a pivotal role in setting many Dutch, American and UK artists on an international career.", "Ten Cate went on to become the founding director of DasArts, Amsterdam&apos;s inter-disciplinary training programme, where he nurtured a new generation of performing artists, and throughout his career he contributed to numerous performances as a director, scriptwriter and designer.", "From the mid-1960s he ran a series of unpredictable performances and exhibits on his farm in Loenersloot, near Amsterdam, which attracted a curious and adventurous following.", "In 1972 Ten Cate moved what had become the Mickery Theatre to a former cinema in Amsterdam, where he created a platform for international avant- garde performance.", "He came to the view, however, that Dutch cultural policy failed to match his expansive production plans, so he decided to exit, not with a whimper but with a bang, and organised a festival, Touch Time, in all the venues around the Amsterdam Leidseplein in 1991.", "Ten Cate left DasArts in 2000 to focus exclusively on visual and installation art, working for a year in the P.S.1 studio complex in New York, thanks to a grant from the Dutch government, then spending two years in the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, in Amsterdam, playing the role of a &quot;young artist&quot; with zest."], "title": "Obituary: Ritsaert ten Cate", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/31/ritsaert-ten-cate-obituary", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Art and design", "Culture", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-02T00:01:00Z", "article": "For You, Linbury Studio, London WC2, today, then touringMatilde di Shabran, Royal Opera House, London WC2, tomorrow until 11 Nov A quarter of a century since they collaborated on a pacifist oratorio, Or Shall We Die?, composer Michael Berkeley and novelist Ian McEwan have teamed up again for an opera, premiered in Covent Garden&apos;s Linbury Studio after plans to unveil it in Wales, during this summer&apos;s Hay-on-Wye festival, went awry. Berkeley&apos;s wife being McEwan&apos;s agent, the two are old friends, so For You emerges as the product of a composer-librettist team working, for once, as equals. McEwan would thus be the last to suggest that the arrogant, self-obsessed composer in the opera - first cousin of the monstrous musician Clive Linley in his Booker Prize-winning novel, Amsterdam - has much, if anything, to do with Berkeley. But the similarities with the novel in this characteristically dark tale of sexual obsession run deeper; a cruelly doomed woman, the havoc wreaked in the lives of others by the self-proclaimed artist, the machinations of apparently lesser figures in our &apos;banal&apos; lives - these are classic McEwan themes handled here with a clever, witty verbal economy befitting opera. Echoing (and quoting) Mozart and Britten, Berkeley responds with a forceful, multi-faceted melange of a score, at times frenziedly ominous, then achingly tender as circumstances require. Other influences from Tippett to early Schoenberg race by in the hectic pace set by conductor Michael Rafferty for the expert ensemble of Music Theatre Wales. Both acts end with an ambitious sextet; each soloist has a testing solo amid the plot&apos;s Hitchcockian twists; though conventional in form, and responsive to the text, Berkeley&apos;s setting is highly distinctive in its chromatic character. On a cleverly simple touring set, director Michael McCarthy is blessed with an ensemble of six accomplished soloists. Alan Opie is dream casting for the leading role of Charles Frieth, the composer-conductor whose self-regard blinds him to the needs of others. Full-voiced and blustering, he wins unexpected sympathy when he meets his inevitable comeuppance. Helen Williams sings his wronged wife with affecting passion, Rachel Nicholls is his umpteenth wronged lover with rare stage bravery in the first operatic scene to cry out for Viagra. As the Polish housekeeper Maria, the strident mezzo Allison Cook turns out to be a doting but dastardly villainess, though Christopher Lemmings is less assured as Frieth&apos;s put-upon assistant. Some racy sexuality and four-letter words make this very much an opera of our times; its place with posterity must languish in more doubt. Upstairs in the main house, Rossini&apos;s Matilde di Shabran has arrived in a co-production with the Pesaro Festival as a showcase for Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, who first made his name in 1996 as its macho misogynist Corradino. A local hero even before his ringing top Cs in last year&apos;s La Fille du r\u00e9giment, Fl\u00f3rez&apos;s slight physique makes him unlikely casting for the &apos;iron-hearted&apos; tyrant, obliging him to indulge in all sorts of operatic strutting and tantrum-throwing to emphasise his supposedly rugged manliness.  Vocally, too, his coloratura sounds somewhat shrill for an operatic baddy; at the second performance, Fl\u00f3rez rendered it more so, his surprisingly thin, nasal voice flagging in the wide open spaces of the Royal Opera House, a much greater challenge than the intimate theatre at Pesaro. In this production, dulled by otherwise humdrum casting, Fl\u00f3rez winds up playing second fiddle to Polish soprano Aleksandra Kurzak in the title role. A superstar in the making, as I noted here after her Adina in last year&apos;s L&apos;elisir d&apos;amore, Kurzak fills the house with her thrillingly pure, warm voice and acts the rest of the cast off the stage. It is a rare moment, indeed, when an opera singer can change the mood with a flash of an eye, the tiniest gesture of disdain. More at ease than her co-star with Rossini&apos;s fiendish coloratura demands, she is rivalled only by the potent mezzo Vesselina Kasarova.  It&apos;s always a bad sign when the chorus enter through the stalls and Mario Martone&apos;s staging grows little better thereafter, hampered by the absurd designs of Sergio Tramonti, whose intertwining spiral staircases occasionally have singers emoting to the backcloth. Rossini opens both halves with too much buffa, not enough opera. In a very long evening, it is 30 minutes before Fl\u00f3rez enters, an hour before we get to meet Matilde. Carlo Rizzi conducts with expert panache, but the management&apos;s failure to wield its blue pencil winds up explaining why - for all the energy driving its uneven, at times ravishing score - this remains a rarely heard work, unseen in London since 1854.", "sentences": ["McEwan would thus be the last to suggest that the arrogant, self-obsessed composer in the opera - first cousin of the monstrous musician Clive Linley in his Booker Prize-winning novel, Amsterdam - has much, if anything, to do with Berkeley."], "title": "Sex, havoc, obsession - it must be Ian McEwan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/02/ian-mcewan-for-you", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Ian McEwan", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-03T14:59:12Z", "article": " Preamble: Evening. Newcastle have a task on their hands to haul themselves out of the basement tonight. Villa, with the astute if not a little eccentric Martin O&apos;Neill manning the tiller, are a heavyweight proposition in the top-flight these days. They haven&apos;t tasted defeat since Chelsea turned  them over 2-0 at Stamford Bridge and have plundered a whopping nine goals in their last three matches. The understanding cultivated between John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor has been key to Villa&apos;s good form. Big Bad John has been too much for defenders to handle at times this season, and despite reportedly being slapped with a \u00a3100,000 fine for  &apos;mistakenly entering&apos; Birmingham&apos;s Rocket lap-dancing bar \u2013 where customer perks include  &apos;The Best Bouncers In Town&apos; \u2013 on the morning of a match, his form appears undiminished. Providing Carew doesn&apos;t mistakenly turn up at Villa Park tonight , he&apos;ll start alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor in attack. Another key striker who often finds himself surrounded by sweaty mares (at the racecourse, I might add), is little Mickey O&apos;. He&apos;s due to make yet another return from injury for Newcastle tonight, although with Obafemi Martins beginning to look sharp up top, Joe Kinnear might start Owen on the bench or play him in a deeper lying role behind Ameobi and Martins. The former Wimbledon manager appears to have instilled some belief back into his players since arriving at St James&apos; Park. They&apos;ve certainly got a competitive midfield. Joey Barton, Nicky Butt and Danny Guthrie aren&apos;t shy of giving an opponent a good clout. And in Senegal international Habib Beye they may have found an answer to some of their comedic defending. Toon fans have already taken to singing &apos;Monday , Tuesday Habib Beye,&apos; to the tune of Happy Days in his honour. Beye&apos;s response: &quot;Monday, Tuesday, Habib Beye, yes, I like it. I used to watch Happy Days and know all about the Fonz.  The Fonz was cool but I am cool too.&quot; I need say no more.  An early email: &quot;Mr Roughley,&quot; says Patrick Sullivan in Washington DC rather formally. &quot;In the spirit in what the U.S calls exercise of democracy, which is really an attempt to gerrymander [MBM frantically checks online dictionary and finds this definition: &quot;To divide (a geographic area) into voting districts so as to give unfair advantage to one party in elections.&quot; MBMer suddenly feels smarter than he did a minute ago.] one&apos;s way into an election that is essentially determined by voting trends in four states, thereby making the opinions of others irrelevant, I am curious to see if you can predict this match&apos;s outcome through analogy of the American election. Will refreshing Barack Villa defeat aging but loyal Newcastle McCain, or will those who think they deserve victory by virtue of conviction shock the world with an upset?&quot; Judging by recent US election trends Patrick, I suspect a particularly close race, a few dodgy decisions and an undeserved victory for Newcastle McCain. Just call it a hunch. My prediction: Newcastle McCain 2-1 Barack Villa Teams to follow.  Here&apos;s Gary Naylor... &quot;In your photo, isn&apos;t John Carew saying, &apos;I wasn&apos;t at the strip club. It&apos;s always this size.&apos;&quot; I presume you&apos;re referring to the size of his talent Gary?  The teams are in:  Newcastle: Given, Beye, Coloccini, Taylor, Jose Enrique,Gutierrez, Barton, Butt, Duff, Martins, Ameobi. Subs: Harper,Guthrie, Owen, Bassong, Cacapa, N&apos;Zogbia, Geremi. Aston Villa: Friedel, Luke Young, Cuellar, Laursen, Shorey,Milner, Reo-Coker, Barry, Ashley Young, Agbonlahor, Carew. Subs:Guzan, Harewood, Davies, Knight, Salifou, Sidwell, Gardner.Referee: Steve Bennett (Kent)  So Michael Owen starts on the bench for Newcastle, as does Guthrie as Joe Kinnear favours the experience of Nicky Butt. For Villa, Carew and Agbonlahor start up front and former Newcastle player James Milner gets a start on the right wing. In fact looking at the Villa team my 2-1 prediction in favour of Newcastle is looking a bit ropey.  Joe Kinnear seems a little confused as he gives an interview on Setanta. He reckons a win tonight will take Newcastle into the top 10 in the Premier League. Sorry Joe, but it&apos;ll take Newcastle up to 14th. Perhaps the altitude when he was coaching Nepal in the 1980s had a lasting, and confusing, effect.  A disgruntled Fantasy Football fanatic writes: &quot;If Martin O&apos;Neill keeps leaving Curtis Davies out of his starting 11 we&apos;re going to have words,&quot; growls James Kenny. &quot;He has been my standout Guardian Fantasy Football team player and now he is suddenly getting dropped for yesterday&apos;s nearly man Cuellar!&quot; Well he has dropped him again James. So, those words better be stern ones; like Eh! and Oy!  Pre-match build-up: The Blaydon Races can be heard blaring out of the PA system on a chilly looking evening in Newcastle. The teams make their way onto the pitch and we&apos;ll shortly be underway.  &quot;Dear Mr. Roughley,&quot; writes another formal reader, this time the ever so polite Paul Jackson in Baltimore. &quot;Doesn&apos;t the &apos;Happy Days&apos; theme begin with &quot;Sunday, Monday Happy Days&apos;? So shouldn&apos;t it have read, &quot;Sunday, Monday, Habib Beye&quot;? As a child of the TV age I couldn&apos;t help but point that out. Does this reflect poorly on the level of intelligence of Toon fans, given that they now can&apos;t even seem to get TV theme lyrics correct? I hope not. As a Yank Toon Fan I find them more loveable than the management/players for the most part.&quot; Perhaps they were too busy watching Jossie&apos;s Giants Paul.  1 min: We&apos;re off! And Joey Barton immediately launches himself into a bone-crunching tackle with Reo-Coker. He wins the ball and lays down a marker.  3 min: Villa have the better of possession in the early exchanges, with Newcastle looking a little tentative as they look to play the ball forward quickly.  5 min: Martins forces Luke Young to play a difficult pass back to Friedel. His clearance is picked up by Duff, who crosses low and hard, but Laursen clears.  7 min: This is better from Newcastle. Martins has a pop from 25 yards but his shot is deflected for a corner. Duff knocks the corner in, but Villa have some huge players in the box and clear the aerial threat quite comfortably.  9 min: Ashley Young clears and Carew gathers it on his chest, under no real pressure from Colocinni. He thens ambles up the right wing and buys a corner off Colocinni.  10 min: Villa captain Gareth Barry swings the corner into the six-yard box. Given chooses to stay on his line and Laursen jumps highest and shaves the left hand post with a glancing header. Newcastle need to be strong in the air.  12 min: Ameobi is strong in the air as he outjumps Laursen and flicks Given&apos;s goal kick to Martins&apos; feet. He turns sharply inside Cuellar, who looks somewhat cumbersome, and lashes a powerful shot a couple of yards over the bar.  15 min: Newcastle are giving Barry and Reo Coker little time on the ball in midfield. This time Butt wins back possession and works the ball back to Given. But he humps the ball forward to no-one in particular. Back to the picture: &quot;Perhaps in the photo John&apos;s wondering why a Norwegian is wearing gloves and a short-sleeved shirt,&quot; reckons Keith McIntyre. It&apos;s been positively Baltic in Britain recently Keith. I suspect you&apos;re emailing from your laptop on a deck chair in some sunny part of the States. Am I right?  17 min: Barton gets his buttocks in the way to prevent Agbonlahor from winning the ball. Agbonlahor throws Barton over his shoulder and somehow Villa get a free-kick in a dangerous area on the right of Newcastle&apos;s goal. Barton is given a talking-to by Steve Bennett, and as is his way in these reformed days, he puts his arm around Bennett statesman-like and walks away a better man. Villa then waste the free-kick, much to the Toon fans&apos; pleasure.  20 min: Apart from a few tasty tackles it&apos;s been a poor match.  21 min: Oh hang on! A bit of decent football. Big Bad John Carew brings a long ball down with his ripped six-pack turns sharply and finds Milner on the right. He skips away from Coloccini and plays a come-and-spank-me cross to Agbonlahor, who completely misses the ball and belies his great form this season. Oh and he&apos;s in my fantasy team too.  23 min: More action! Barry is booked for tripping Gutierrez, who goes down far too easy - the soft sod. Barton then picks up a headed clearance 30 yards out and drives a low shot off the slippery turf which Friedel does well to gather in his chunky midfriff.  25 min: Did I say this game was poor? It&apos;s warming up nicely now. Milner turns inside his marker, and from 25 yards out, drives a shot at goal which, for a moment looks like it&apos;s about to trouble Given, but actually sails high over the bar.  27 min: Villa fans inform the Toon faithful that their team is &apos;going down, going down, going down&apos;. I presume they&apos;re singing that because they haven&apos;t got anything as original as Habib Beye&apos;s &apos;Happy Days&apos; song - even if the Newcastle fans get the words wrong.  30 min: Martins turns Laursen inside out on the right hand corner of the 18-yard box, he then shifts the ball onto his left foot 12 yards out but crashes his shot wide. If he&apos;d have shown more composure there he could have put Newcastle ahead.  33 min: Barton is trying to pull the strings for Newcastle, but on this occasion he pings a ball into the feet of Ameobi who can&apos;t untangle his legs and has the ball stolen off him by Cuellar.  35 min: Great save from Shay Given! Agbonlahor beats Coloccini on the right wing and finds Ashley Young in the six yard-box. He shifts the ball onto his right foot and hammers the ball at point blank range straight into the chest of Given, who stays big ala Schmeichel, and deflects the ball over the bar.  38 min: Ashley Young wastes the corner and Newcastle clear. A shush descends on the stadium and referee Steve Bennett can be quite clearly heard every few seconds shouting &quot;don&apos;t foul him&quot;. Luke Young then does exactly this to Gutierrez and is booked for it. He can&apos;t say he wasn&apos;t warned.  40 min: Martins looks like Newcastle&apos;s chief threat. He&apos;s the only real player in their team, perhaps barring Duff with the wind behind him, with any real pace.  42 min: &quot;John Carew&apos;s ripped six-pack, Brad Friedel&apos;s chunky midriff...&quot; begins Tom Chivers, &quot;have you got a torso fetish, Mr Vaguely, or are you just concerned that you&apos;re letting yourself go a little?&quot; I think you&apos;re onto something Tom. Subconsciously I think I yearn for a washboard to thump a medicine ball off. Meanwhile at St James&apos; Park. Beye ventures forward and curls a low cross invitingly towards Steven Taylor, but being a central defender, he ponders and watches the ball race past him instead of instinctively throwing a leg at the ball.  Half-time: Well that petered out after a promising opening. Apart from Given&apos;s stunning save from Ashley Young and Friedel&apos;s stop from Barton there was very little for either keeper to do. I&apos;m off for a half-time cuppa. Your emails to follow...  Half-time emails: Is Steve Bennett&apos;s instruction &quot;don&apos;t foul him&quot; allowed?&quot; enquires Mike Brown. &quot;What does the rule book say about refs giving coaching lessons during a match I wonder?&quot; I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any issue with it Mike. I&apos;d imagine the FA would have a problem with it if he was jumping around shouting &quot;break his f***ing legs&quot; though.   Setanta have just shown a replay of Joey Barton flicking Agbonlahor&apos;s lips in the first half. I&apos;ve got to say that boy is good. He got that one past my eagle eyes, and Steve Bennett&apos;s, expertly. It didn&apos;t seem that bad, but The Rage is obviously still bubbling nicely within the facade that is New Barton.  46 min: We&apos;re back underway. Ashley Young goes scampering down the right wing immediately and plays a low cross towards Agbonlahor on the back post, but &apos;Sunday, Monday, Habib Beye&apos; comes hurtling in front of Agbonlahor and clears for a corner.  47 min: Barry swings the corner into the six-yard box but Newcastle clear the danger.  48 min: Villa have started the second-half with a little more urgency than Newcastle. Although, after a tepid first-half that doesn&apos;t take much. Ashley Young clashes heads with Gutierrez and falls to the floor clutching his bonce. A lull in play.  49 min: Ameobi backs into Laursen and somehow wins a free-kick. Jose Enrique wastes the opportunity though. Villa win a corner. But again it doesn&apos;t beat the first man.  50 min: New Barton again shows that The Rage is bubbling beneath the surface as he stamps on the ball and Luke Young&apos;s ankles and receives a booking for his trouble. He reminds me of Michael J Fox in Teen Wolf. He&apos;s desperately trying to contain the beast within.  53 min: Barton then releases Martins down the left. Cuellar kicks Martins into the scoreboard. The little striker throws the mother of all tantrums as he protests that Cuellar should be booked, and is deservedly booked himself for being a whining sod.  56 min: After all that hullabaloo the free-kick is wasted. The set pieces haven&apos;t been good from either side tonight.  Goal!!! 58 min Newcastle 1-0 Aston Villa: Barton plays a neat ball into the right hand channel for Martins, who shrugs Laursen off with a sharp turn for the second time tonight and lashes a brilliant low drive into the bottom right hand corner. He might be a whining sod, but he deserved that for his efforts tonight.  60 min: The match has been largely poor apart from that moment of class from Martins. Barton has been Newcastle&apos;s other chief threat tonight (not just physically) so it is apt that he was instrumental in providing the assist. As for Villa, Barry has never really got the midfield working and too many long balls have been humped up towards Carew.  63 min: Newcastle are passing the ball much better now. It&apos;s amazing what a goal can do for a team&apos;s confidence. Conor Coen writes: &quot;Be honest Gregg , you&apos;ve been waiting a long while to work this line into your play by play...&apos;He reminds me of Michael J Fox in Teen Wolf. He&apos;s desperately trying to contain the beast within.&apos;&quot; Honestly Conor, I haven&apos;t. I was sat in a dingy flat, drunk on Halloween and happened to end up watching the film again for the first time in years. So maybe I&apos;ve been waiting four days.  66 min: Duff is fouled on the edge of the penalty area. Nicky Butt pulls rank on Barton and clatters the post with a curled effort from 20 yards. Martins then slaloms past three defenders as he cuts in from the left, before Laursen nicks the ball away from him. This is good from Newcastle.  68 min: Barton wins a corner on the left which Duff swings in. Carew, who has looked like he&apos;d rather be in The Rocket Club so far, hooks the ball into the air and Butt, bouyed by his previous effort on goal, shows little composure and thwacks the ball into the Gallowgate End.  70 min: As if to sum up what a bad night Carew is having, Nicky Butt - all 5ft 9in of him - outjumps the 6ft 5in Norwegian to clear a rare Villa attack.   71 min: Martin Laursen gets a forearm in the face from Ameobi and is booked for his trouble. A moment later, Laursen returns the favour, but escapes a booking. If I was American I&apos;d say: go figure!  74 min: Nicky Shorey is replaced by Steve Sidwell as Villa look to win the midfield battle and work the ball forward on the floor.  76 min: Sidwell brings little finesse to proceedings though as he lunges into a tackle with the game&apos;s star performer Obafemi Martins. He is deservedly shown a yellow card.  78 min: The match has descended into a bitty, nasty spectacle, which will suit Newcastle as they look to hold onto their lead.  80 min: Ameobi receives a long ball in the right hand corner and holds the ball up with aplomb. He wastes a few seconds with some rubber-legged stepovers and holds off a few defenders before... wasting possession.  Goal!!! Newcastle 2-0 Aston Villa, Martins 82 min: Gutierrez and Duff exchange passes on the left wing. Gutierrez draws his defender in towards him and then races to the by-line. He cuts the ball back inside and finds Martins a yard from goal, who simply taps the ball into the empty net. Well deserved on the balance of play.  84 min: A concerned Villa fan called Nathan, currently residing in Amsterdam, writes: &quot;Bugger me! Just when it&apos;s the time for the Villa to grasp the moment, assert our credentials as the real deal \u2013 now that Arsenal are slipping \u2013 we appear to be bottling it. I wish I had something witty or incisive to say. But I don&apos;t. That&apos;s the truth of it. It&apos;s just painful. Mind you, at least we don&apos;t have that thug Barton playing for us...&quot; No Nathan, if you had Barton on your team tonight you might have scored a goal. Perish the thought...  87 min: Man of the match Obafemi Martins is substituted to a huge round of applause. Cacapa replaces him.  88 min: Newcastle fans &apos;ole&apos; every pass now as Villa look consigned to defeat. I suppose they should be allowed their small moments of pleasure, they&apos;ve had precious little else to enjoy so far this season.  89 min: Beye stings Friedel&apos;s palms with an angled drive from 12 yards. Villa break and win a corner which is cleared to Sidwell; but his strike goes yards over the bar.  90+1 min: Shola Ameobi, who has worked his long socks off, is replaced by a grinning Michael Owen. His first touch is a pass to Duff who works the ball back to the Newcastle defence. Given receives the ball and clears long to Gutierrez.  Full-time: Duff jinks through the Villa midfield and referee Steve Bennett blows his whistle really loud to bring an end to play.  Full-time musings: What a strange weekend (and no, not the Teen-Wolf party). All four of the Premier League&apos;s bottom clubs won. Villa showed very little of the attacking prowess that has made them an exciting team to watch this season, but Newcastle clearly wanted it more. Joe Kinnear doesn&apos;t appear to have altered Newcastle&apos;s tactics any great deal, but he has instilled steel into the Magpies defence and midfield, which is making them difficult to break down in open play. Barton&apos;s return hasn&apos;t been heralded by many, but his nous, together with his competitive spirit, has clearly helped the Magpies. The problem for Kinnear - and a nice problem this is too - is how to fit Michael Owen into the frontline with Ameobi and Martins. Perhaps poor Mickey O&apos; is going to find himself left out by England and Newcastle too.

KKR said its public offering, which had been expected to raise up to $15bn (\u00a39.5bn), will not go ahead until 2009, although it stressed it remained committed to the move. The US firm is due to access the markets through a complex deal involving a merger with an offshoot, KKR Private Equity Investors, which is already listed on Amsterdam&apos;s Euronext stockmarket. It has become clear this Dutch-listed venture is suffering the effects of the global economic turmoil. It reported yesterday the value of its assets had slumped by $649m, including a $44m fall in its stake in Boots, blamed on the decline of sterling against the dollar. One of the biggest private equity firms in the world, KKR is run by billionaires Henry Kravis and George Roberts, who founded the business in 1976. In a statement, Roberts said: &quot;Some of our investments faced reduced valuations during the third quarter as a result of the extraordinary turbulence in the global capital markets.&quot; Among the assets losing value were investments in computer firm Sun Microsystems, market research firm Nielsen and Capmark, a financial services group with exposure to US mortgages. The company insisted the reduced valuation for the Boots investment was triggered entirely by the pound weakening against the dollar.  KKR partner Paul Raether told investors on a conference call: &quot;Our investment in Alliance Boots is performing well and validating our initial investment thesis for the business, which was to own a market leader in a defensive industry with significant potential for revenue enhancement and cost savings.&quot; He added that sales and top-line operating profit for Boots were &quot;above budget&quot;. Nevertheless, many investors remain concerned about high levels of debt and shrinking consumer spending. In common with many private equity-backed firms, Alliance Boots&apos; debt continues to trade at a discount to its face value.  KKR&apos;s Euronext-listed arm said sources of liquidity &quot;may not only be more difficult, but also impossible to obtain&quot; in the current market. But it said KKR&apos;s plans to go public were still a firm commitment: &quot;The parties remain committed to completing the transaction, but do not at this point expect the transaction to close until 2009.&quot; The delay is the latest in a string of hold-ups. The company initially filed regulatory documents in June 2007 for a flotation, shortly after rival Blackstone&apos;s public offering.  The company, whose ruthless approach was immortalised in the book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;, sees the public markets as a source of evergreen capital and as an eventual way for its founders to draw down the value of their stakes.", "sentences": ["The US firm is due to access the markets through a complex deal involving a merger with an offshoot, KKR Private Equity Investors, which is already listed on Amsterdam&apos;s Euronext stockmarket."], "title": "KKR delays $15bn float amid 'extraordinary turbulence'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/03/kkr-flotation-delay", "tags": ["Private equity", "Alliance Boots", "Market turmoil", "Business", "UK news", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-04T00:01:00Z", "article": "Originally planned as an 80th birthday celebration, the Southbank Centre&apos;s week-long Stockhausen tribute takes its name from his final project. Klang was a projected cycle of 24 works, one for each hour of the day, that was almost complete when the composer died last December. The festival concentrates on works from that cycle and from Licht, the week-long sequence of operas that preceded it, rather than those from the 1950s and 60s that established Stockhausen&apos;s reputation. Premieres come thick and fast, and the first two days of concerts included three of them, yet the work that made the deepest impression was a rarity from the early 1970s which had been heard here before.  Inspired by a dream, Trans, for orchestra and tape, was one of the pieces that paved the way for the quirky theatricality of the Licht cycle, with a full orchestra seated on stage behind a gauze and bathed in a curious violet light. The strings maintain a static, tight-packed chord throughout the 27-minute work, and woodwind and brass provide a decorative commentary; shifts in the harmony are triggered by the prerecorded sound of a shuttle loom. Every so often, orchestral players break free of the regime to deliver frenetic solos before merging into the ensemble again.  Trans was played twice (superbly well) in the opening concert by the Royal College of Music Orchestra conducted by Diego Masson, with each performance preceded by the UK premiere of a version of Harmonien, the fifth hour of Klang, a solo instrumental piece that exists in transpositions for the bass clarinet of Suzanne Stephens and the flute of Kathinka Pasveer. Harmonien served as the starting point for several instalments of the Klang cycle, one of which, Glanz, made up half of the Amsterdam-based ensemble Asko|Schoenberg&apos;s contribution.  Glanz has more of the am-dram role-playing and stage movement in what is essentially a conversational exchange between clarinet, viola and bassoon, interrupted in turn by oboe, trumpet, trombone and euphonium.  In Orchester-Finalisten, from Wednesday&apos;s episode of the Licht cycle, 11 instrumentalists audition for places in an orchestra by playing fragments of other Stockhausen works while an eight-channel tape supplies sound from the outside world. The archness and theatricality are often baffling, especially when the double bass&apos;s efforts are interrupted by a mummy, swathed in bandages, who strikes a gong to dismiss him, but as so often with Stockhausen, the music contains moments of unmistakable power. \u2022 The festival continues until next Sunday.

Stupid question, you might say. He is young, handsome, smart, inspiring, educated, cosmopolitan, and above all, he promises a radical change from the most unpopular American administration in history. Compare that to his rival, John McCain, who talked about change, but to most Europeans represented the opposite. And yet, there is something odd about the European mania for a black American politician, even as we all know that a black president or prime minister (let alone one whose middle name is Hussein) is still unthinkable in Europe. Or perhaps that is precisely the point. Europeans have long been hospitable to black American stars. Think of Josephine Baker, who wowed Parisians and Berliners at a time when blacks could not vote \u2013 or even use the same bathrooms as whites \u2013 in many parts of the United States. Cities like Paris, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam offered refuge to black American jazz musicians, who needed a break from institutionalised racism. The same was true for other artists. The writer, James Baldwin, for example, found a home in France. Since there were very few black people in Europe, the adoration of black American stars came easily. It made Europeans feel superior to Americans. They could pat themselves on the back for their lack of racial prejudice. When large numbers of people from non-western countries started to come to Europe after the 1960s, this proved to be something of an illusion. Still, the illusion was nice while it lasted, and Obamamania may contain an element of nostalgia, as well as hope. The other reason for the European love affair with Obama is that he is seen as something more than an American. Unlike McCain, the all-American war hero, Obama looks like a citizen of the world. With his Kenyan father, he carries the glamour once associated with Third World liberation movements. Nelson Mandela inherited that glamour; indeed, he personified it. Some of that has rubbed off on Obama, too. This did not help him much at home. Indeed, it could easily have hurt him. Republican populists have long tried to depict their Democratic opponents, often with great success, as &quot;un-American&quot; elitists, intellectuals, and the kind of guys who speak French \u2013 in short, &quot;Europeans&quot;. When Obama made his rousing speech at the Berlin Tiergarten in July in front of 200,000 cheering Germans, his popularity ratings at home actually fell, especially in the old industrial rustbelt of Ohio and Pennsylvania. He came dangerously close to looking too &quot;European&quot;. But the real Europeans loved him for it. But the main reason for Obamamania may be more complex. It has become popular of late for European pundits and commentators to write the US off as a great power, let alone an inspirational one. In this, they have more or less followed public opinion.  Many liberal-minded people expressed, often sorrowfully, their deep disillusion with America during the dark Bush years. The nation they had grown up looking up to, as a beacon of hope \u2013 a place that, while flawed, still inspired dreams of a better future and produced great movies, soaring buildings, rock&apos;n&apos;roll, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King \u2013 had been hopelessly tainted by reckless wars, officially sanctioned torture, coarse chauvinism, and extraordinary political arrogance.  Others expressed the same disillusion with a gloating air of schadenfreude. At last, that big, arrogant, fatally seductive nation, which left the Old World in its shade for so long, had been brought to its knees. Watching the economic rise of China, Russia, and India, and the American debacles in the Middle East, it was tempting to believe that US power really did not count for very much anymore. A multi-polar world, many thought, would be vastly preferable to more Pax Americana. Yet such projections could never entirely disguise a nagging anxiety. How many Europeans (or Asians, for that matter) would really be happier being subjected to the superior power of China or Russia? Under all the confident-sounding dismissals of US power, there is still some yearning to return to a more reassuring time, when the democratic world could lay its collective head on Uncle Sam&apos;s broad shoulders.  This, too, is probably an illusion. Too much has changed since the Marshall Plan, the Berlin airlift, and the Cuban missile crisis. But I do not believe that the American dream has died in Europe quite yet. Obamamania seems to have revived it. Obama&apos;s election has demonstrated that things are still achievable in the US that remain unthinkable elsewhere. As long as this is so, the US, as first among equals, can still be looked up to as the defender of our freedoms. Europeans \u2013 and others \u2013 may regard China&apos;s rise with awe, and hope to find a modus vivendi with Russia, but without the hopes inspired by that extraordinary republic, which represents the worst and the best of our battered western world, we would all be much worse off. In their hearts, most Europeans know this. That is why they are going crazy over Barack Obama&apos;s election.

It a stone&apos;s throw from Place de la Nation where the guillotine was in operation during the bloodiest months of the Revolution. Behind those old and severe walls at 35 rue de Picpus lies the biggest private cemetery in Paris where Lafayette rests alongside a thousand souls who lost their heads to The Terror. Lafayette&apos;s grave is adorned with American flags while the soil he was buried in comes from Bunker Hill, a famous War of Independence battlefield.

Local beaches, Sydney If I had a day left to live and conscience stopped me from going surfing, I would take my family out for a picnic at Queenscliff lagoon, then walk over the headland to Freshwater and Curl Curl Beaches before hiking up the breathtaking clifftop track to Dee Why Beach. We&apos;d stop for coffee at Splat (Queenscliff), Curlie&apos;s (Curl Curl) or Bacino (Dee Why). While Manly Beach itself is a tourist hub, this stretch of beaches just north of it is where us locals go for our dose of peace. Unlike the better-known city coastline (Bondi, Bronte, Coogee), north of the harbour is where you&apos;d come for a real taste of Sydney&apos;s unique conjunction of wilderness, beach and urban life.

Second, the music. The musicians are all young guys playing really old-school samba classics. At most samba shows in Rio you hear the same old stuff - the Samba da Ouvidor is the only one I go to because they play the real deal. The roda (samba show) happens every fortnight.

From then on, I lived and breathed music. I watched Top of the Pops every week, playing air guitar in front of the TV. I would be on plastic guitar and a mate would be on biscuit tins, drumming. That was it, really. Then my dad bought me a guitar at 12 and at 14 I was playing gigs in working men&apos;s clubs in Woking. When we got the Jam togetherDown by the Jetty - Dr Feelgood (1975) At first we only played Beatles covers, Chuck Berry and Little Richard, not only because we loved that kind of music but because the songs only have three chords. The rock&apos;n&apos;roll influence comes through my mum, a big Elvis fan, and then through Dr Feelgood. This album&apos;s menacing, edgy sound was a turning point amid the hangover from the Sixties that went on with Fleetwood Mac and Reo Speedwagon. Wilko Johnson is an English Chuck Berry: he takes English subjects and puts them into an R&amp;B idiom. When I left schoolOdessey and Oracle - The Zombies (1968) I was never bothered about making it in America. I wanted to portray my surroundings, and whether that translated on a universal level wasn&apos;t an issue. Odessey and Oracle showed me that you could write from your own perspective. Its sense of melody has been a huge influence, whether that means using mellotrons or certain chord sequences. It&apos;s similar to Nick Drake or Village Green Preservation Society by the Kinks: it did nothing when it came out, and could only have been made in England. It&apos;s autumnal.  When I formed the Style CouncilWhat&apos;s Going On - Marvin Gaye (1971) It&apos;s a choice between this, Innervisions by Stevie Wonder and Curtis Mayfield&apos;s first solo albums: all beautiful soul records that say something. Curtis was a prophet back then, out there on his own, putting humanitarianism and spirituality into black consciousness. But What&apos;s Going On is a symphonic concept album and Marvin Gaye the greatest singer of all time: his range and control over his voice is amazing. He raised the bar for me when I wanted to stretch out musically. Records this good take years to be properly appreciated.  My latest discoveryFleet Foxes - Fleet Foxes (2008) I really love this. It has a lot of choral harmonies, almost like church music, combined with Pet Sounds-era Beach Boys, and great melodies. But most important, it sounds fresh. Funnily enough, all the American bands I like are much better known here than they are there. I was in the States recently and was raving about Midlake, Black Mountain, Dr Dog and Fleet Foxes, and nobody had heard of them. Even Kings of Leon aren&apos;t particularly well known.

The figures show a rise in the proportion of foreign transfers, which do not directly benefit the UK economy. According to the Civil Aviation Authority, the proportion of passengers at Heathrow who are transfer travellers has fallen from 37% to 35.1% since 2003, accounting for 23.8 million passengers a year. However, the proportion who are international-to-international travellers - who pass through Heathrow but do not use it to enter Britain - has risen from 72% in 2003 to 76% in 2007. The rest of the transfers are domestic passengers flying into Heathrow for onward journeys abroad.  The study comes as the transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, prepares to confront parliamentary opponents of the Heathrow expansion in a debate tomorrow. More than 40 MPs have signed an early day motion urging the government to rethink its airport policy, but Hoon is expected to press ahead with a new runway if it meets noise and air pollution guidelines.  The value of international transfer passengers to Heathrow has been challenged by runway opponents, including the Conservative leader, David Cameron. They argue that international stopover travellers bring minimal benefit to the UK economy so there is little value in expanding Heathrow to encourage more transfer passengers who could use Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt without loss to Britain. Stephen Joseph, director of the Campaign for Better Transport group, said: &quot;The evidence is that transfer passengers don&apos;t add to the UK economy or to the strength of Heathrow as an international airport. They add to the cost of operating the airport and increase congestion.&quot;  CE Delft, a Dutch consultancy, has argued that extending air passenger duty to international transfer passengers - which is being considered by the government - would lessen Heathrow&apos;s attractiveness as a hub and undermine the case for expansion.  A spokesman for BAA, Heathrow&apos;s owner, said it was &quot;nonsense&quot; to dismiss the value of transfer customers. Some important Heathrow routes, such as Chennai and Bangalore in India and Los Angeles and Seattle, relied on connecting traffic for 50% of their customers. &quot;It takes GCSE-level economics to work out that transfer passengers are valuable to Heathrow and the UK economy.&quot; British Airways, Heathrow&apos;s biggest customer, warned that using transfer passenger figures to question the case for a third runway was &quot;absurd&quot; because they bring value to the airport and the UK economy by making many routes economically viable.  &quot;The presence of transfer traffic provides residents of London and the south-east with dozens of direct long-haul services that would not be financially viable if they relied on local demand alone. That is how a hub airport works. It is why the vast majority of the UK&apos;s long-haul routes are flown from Heathrow.&quot; BA and BAA argue that transfer passengers will desert Heathrow if congestion is not tackled. Once those customers take a flight to an alternative hub, say backers of a third runway, the connection flight to Heathrow could lose up to a quarter of its customers. &quot;Without transfer passengers, Heathrow&apos;s route network would contract sharply,&quot; said the BA spokesman.", "sentences": ["They argue that international stopover travellers bring minimal benefit to the UK economy so there is little value in expanding Heathrow to encourage more transfer passengers who could use Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt without loss to Britain."], "title": "Critics of third Heathrow runway say passenger data backs their case", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/nov/10/heathrow-theairlineindustry", "tags": ["Heathrow", "Airline industry", "Transport", "Economics", "UK news", "Travel and transport", "Environment", "Business", "Travel", "Heathrow third runway", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-10T16:11:32Z", "article": "Craigslist, the world&apos;s biggest small ads site, is the small operation that became a huge success, but stayed small.

But it is still run from a small house in San Francisco, which is unique for one of the world&apos;s leading websites.  It has sections covering items for sale, housing, jobs, community activities, and a wide range of dating-oriented personals. Although most users are based in the US, it now covers more than 40 countries and big cities from Amsterdam to Zurich. When Newmark is interviewed \u2013 he&apos;s been on the Daily Show and the Colbert Report, among others \u2013 he is usually asked why he doesn&apos;t sell out for billions of dollars. His reply: &quot;We just don&apos;t need the money.&quot;  Craigslist could probably bring in between $500m and $1bn a year, but it doesn&apos;t charge for classifieds, doesn&apos;t take a percentage of sales, and doesn&apos;t carry banner advertising. It may charge for job ads, apartment listings and adult-oriented entries, but this often looks like a response to abuse rather than an attempt to make money. For example, Craigslist started charging for New York apartment listings after the free list was swamped by people re-posting the same ads to keep them near the top of the chronological listing. But it has a seamy side. Craigslist is used by prostitutes and escort services as well as people seeking casual sex via the Casual Encounters section. In Sleeping Around Craigslist, two middle-aged women wrote about their adventures having sex with lots of men, noting: &quot;Probably because the ads are free and largely uncensored, Craigslist has become &apos;Hook-Up Central&apos; on the Web. There&apos;s no long questionnaire and no profile required as there is on other dating sites. There&apos;s just a bunch of hungry people looking for everything&quot;.  There are adverts seeking people willing to appear in front of webcams or in adult movies, and to work as escorts, for example. &quot;Girls needed for gangbang parties (London)&quot; is one example. Last week, the site acted &quot;to prevent its online communities and classified ads from being misused for the facilitation of human trafficking, child exploitation, and other illegal activities.&quot; It said: &quot;In addition to phone verification and other existing protective measures, craigslist will soon require credit card verification and a small fee per ad for posting in &apos;erotic services&apos;, to further encourage compliance with site guidelines.&quot;  An independent site called CraigsCrimeList posts stories about crimes and scams associated with Craigslist. Recent headlines include: Memphis craigslist hooker bust, Reader employment scam, Cali craigslist rapist convicted, and Madonna fans scammed. In one famous case, a Michigan woman advertised on Craigslist for a hitman to kill her lover&apos;s wife.

Best known in Britain for his stunning solo extract from Blues for the Jungle, as broadcast in DA Pennebaker&apos;s 1985 TV documentary Dance Black America, his work nevertheless covered a broad spectrum of themes. Rising to prominence in the Martin Luther King civil rights era, he addressed directly the racist legacy in the United States, while indirectly challenging the same negativity by exploring diverse cultural subject matter through his integrated dance company. As the New York Times critic Jennifer Dunning once put it, Pomare &quot;seethed&quot; rather than &quot;exploded&quot;. It took some eventful travelling before he found his artistic vocation and &quot;voice.&quot; Born in Santa Marta, Colombia, he lost his father in 1943 when a submarine torpedoed the ship they were travelling on to Panama. His father, the ship&apos;s captain, drowned. Six-year-old Eleo survived and later lived in Cartagena and Panama before his mother took him to live in New York in 1947. There he enrolled in the High School of Performing Arts to study acting, but the slightly built Pomare, who admitted being &quot;five-something&quot;, later switched to dance. He blossomed there, and his progress took him back into Harlem, where he had attended school, to organise student performances in schools and churches, and to teach dance for the Boys&apos; Athletic League. His studies and his early creations, such as Cantos from a Monastery (1958), acquainted him with the work of the German choreographer Kurt Jooss. Fascinated by photographs depicting the expressionist intensity of Jooss&apos;s company, and still subscribing to &quot;the myths that one had to study in Europe to be really educated, and that Europe was more sensitive to black people&quot;, he left for Germany in 1962, courtesy of a John Hay Whitney fellowship, to train with the company.  Jooss, however, soon expelled the mercurial Pomare after he organised a student dance company, telling him: &quot;There can&apos;t be two demi-gods in this space, and I was here first ...&quot;  Pomare formed a new company in Amsterdam. Almost immediately he flew back to the US for the 1963 March On Washington and then returned for another march in Amsterdam that he had organised with James Baldwin. Responding passionately to the new phase in the civil rights struggle and the Harlem riot of 1964, Pomare created Blues for the Jungle in 1966. Despite it being &quot;disorganised and violent&quot; Pomare later reflected: &quot;The reception was warm. That was something I didn&apos;t expect.&quot;  His compassionate but unflinching depiction of hopelessness in the Junkie sequence from Blues indicated Pomare&apos;s real artistic strength. In 1967 he became the first artistic director of Dance-mobile, a travelling performance space on the back of a flat-bed truck. Opening to shouts of &quot;Get some soul brother!&quot; he persevered and persuaded the Harlem audience that he had it, even if not expressed in their familiar street argot. Ruminations on his European experiences, and his initial attempts to see audiences through &quot;blue eyes&quot;, led to another classic piece. Based on Lorca&apos;s play The House of Bernarda Alba, and set to a jazz score by John Coltrane, Las Desenamoradas was brought into being through Pomare&apos;s ability to transform the written and spoken word into dance. This study of the destructive impact of a dominant matriarch on her children, with some reference to his own &quot;mothering problems&quot;, which had apparently helped to send him to Europe, became as equally a powerful and personal work as Blues for the Jungle. Since he was a prolific choreographer, the quality of his work often depended on the interpretation given in particular productions, thus reviews varied wildly. On one memorable occasion in a loft performance, he stared at the audience as he slowly ate watermelon and spat the seeds out. Eclectic but carefully woven diversity was his guiding intent. Although generally eschewing the &quot;abstract&quot; he composed Back to Bach in 1983, though it did contain some Watusi influence. In 1986 he created Morning Without Sunrise in honour of Nelson Mandela. He became a founding member of the Association of Black Choreographers, and international recognition and numerous awards followed. The 2001 PBS TV series Free to Dance, which has yet to be shown in the UK, provides a broad appreciation of his work. The high esteem in which he was held by his fellow dancers sustained his sense of purpose, which never lost its choleric fire, and he was able to keep earning, and creating, until the onset of the cancer that brought him down.  Although he commented wryly on one occasion: &quot;Actually, I guess I don&apos;t want to be rich and famous,&quot; he nevertheless became supremely successful and influential. In addition to his partner, Glenn Conner, he is survived by three sisters. \u2022 Eleo Pomare, dancer and choreographer, born October 20 1937; died August 8 2008", "sentences": ["Jooss, however, soon expelled the mercurial Pomare after he organised a student dance company, telling him: &quot;There can&apos;t be two demi-gods in this space, and I was here first ...&quot;  Pomare formed a new company in Amsterdam.", "Almost immediately he flew back to the US for the 1963 March On Washington and then returned for another march in Amsterdam that he had organised with James Baldwin."], "title": "Obituary: Eleo Pomare", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/nov/12/dance", "tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-12T00:01:00Z", "article": "MPs get rightly criticised for debates and votes that don&apos;t change much. Yesterday&apos;s testy Commons debate on the government&apos;s plans to add a third runway at Heathrow airport may prove an exception. If David Cameron wins power in 2010 and moves to cancel the runway - as he claims he will - there will be plenty of by-then-ex-Labour MPs he can quote in his defence. As with much else on the policy front, the Tory leader is all over the place on Heathrow. His plan to ease acute congestion at Britain&apos;s hub airport by building a high-speed rail link to the north is admirable, if implausibly optimistic. But it would only trim Heathrow&apos;s flight overload by 3% at best. And who would finance it?  Unblushing ministers complain that the third runway proposal - due to be confirmed soon after what critics dismiss as a public &quot;&apos;con&apos;sultation&quot; - will have been discussed for 30 years by the time (if) it is built by 2020. Like all the best rows this is one with powerful arguments and advocates on both sides. The green movement, the Tories and Liberal Democrats, are joined in opposition by the Economist magazine (whose readers must make more than the average two flights a year) and by MPs, from left to right, whose constituents hate the noise - from Reading across London, Essex and Kent. Their case is pretty lethal: all that noise and pollution from 220,000 extra flights a year, 46% up on current use, flying in and out of the ad hoc airport over a major world city. Throw in rising fuel costs, a recession and the green agenda and no wonder MPs are in revolt.  Four cabinet ministers are unhappy too: the Miliband brothers, Harriet Harman and Hilary Benn (who lives under the proposed flight path). It is a sign of Gordon Brown&apos;s weakened authority and of real concern that Britain must do more to meet EU pollution targets. Transport buff, Geoff Hoon, made only a lawyerly job of his case in the Commons. But his side, which includes business, the City and the unions, has a strong case too.  Yes, 1-in-3 passengers are in transit, most not passing through UK customs, let alone the wider economy. But every country&apos;s economy needs a hub which feeds and subsidises domestic traffic. Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, which already has more UK destinations than Heathrow, is shaping up to be ours. Under pressure of congestion, Heathrow&apos;s global routes are down from 220 to 180. Aircraft are getting cleaner as well as quieter, their pollution footprint shrinking. Most pollution around the airport is caused by traffic on the M4 and M25. Voters want to fly. And so on.  Brown&apos;s government, ever keen to wrong- foot Cameron, have approved expansion at Stansted while sanctioning the coming sale of Gatwick, whose new owners would be keen to expand there. A government will have to say no to the airport lobby one day. But not yet.

His knowledge was extraordinary in depth and range, but what set him apart from others was his genius as an activist and his brilliance as an advocate.  To those complementary roles he brought a unique curiosity, sharp intelligence and a prodigious memory. His memory was not just photographic; it was photovoltaic. He did not just absorb knowledge; he converted it to fuel for an unrelenting drive to salvage the environment and the planet. As he learned from each experience, he developed a portfolio of substance and technique that made him an unrivalled and deeply valued resource.  Phil was born in Los Angeles and graduated from Harvard University. His career began as a staff member in the US Congress, where he made a significant impact on environmental policymaking in the 1970s and 80s. His first great challenge \u2014 and victory \u2014 was blocking energy policy proposals that would override America&apos;s National Environmental Policy Act in support of rapid coal and oil shale development.  Subsequently, he helped strengthen the Clean Water Act, clean air laws, and US renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. He was among the first staff members in Congress to recognise the threat of global warming, the primary cause to which he dedicated the last decade of his life.  He served as the first and only president of the National Environmental Trust from 1994. At the helm of NET for almost 15 years, Phil instituted a new style of environmental advocacy, one characterised by innovative campaign management techniques. Our air, drinking water, forests and fisheries are all just a bit cleaner thanks to Phil&apos;s dogged advocacy.  He was as tough on his natural allies as he was on his opponents, taking both to task for blind ideology, personal self-importance or political opportunism.  He was recognised around the world, especially by the media, for his ability to decode the arcane language of legislation, expose the hypocrisy of votes, or provide the concise, quotable analysis that untangled a complicated negotiation and brought a deadening environmental debate to life. Many Guardian readers may have seen his name in one biting analysis of environmental politics or another concerning global warming.  Last year at the UN climate change conference in Bali, he described, for the assembled press, the recalcitrant Bush administration&apos;s tentative embrace of a negotiating plan to tackle climate change: &quot;They are not willing to call it an &apos;apple&apos;,&quot; he said, &quot;but they are willing to call it a &apos;juicy red fruit&apos;.&quot; He often scoffed at the frequently articulated pipedreams of salvation through technology: &quot;For every administration, embracing &apos;technology&apos; has always been another way to say manana.&quot;  Phil was renowned for his sense of humour, storytelling and exquisite company. He had a deep appreciation of music and literature and knew where to savour the joys of a proper English breakfast (at his beloved Reform Club).  In fact, his love of British culture made him an expert on the royal family, whose history he delighted in recounting \u2014 conquests and follies alike. He succumbed to pneumonia while on holiday in Amsterdam. His passing leaves a huge hole, but his dedicated commitment to protecting the Earth&apos;s environment lives on.

The study will help to reassure patients concerned that the powerful doses of hormones that are part of fertility treatment might put them at risk of developing cancer in the future. At the beginning of an IVF treatment cycle, women are given a course of hormone drugs to stimulate their ovaries to produce more eggs than usual so that clinicians can produce several fertilised embryos in vitro.  The treatment causes large spikes in oestrogen levels in the body. In theory this could promote the development of breast cancer, which is sensitive to the hormone.  The Dutch study, carried out by Dr Alexandra van den Belt-Dousebout at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, examined patient records from all 12 IVF clinics in the country between 1980 and 1995.  Her team compared 18,970 women who had had at least one cycle of IVF treatment and 7,536 other women with fertility problems who had not received fertility treatment. They matched these patients to records in the National Cancer Registry to establish whether they had gone on to develop breast cancer.  Of the 378 women who developed breast cancer, 266 were in the IVF group and 112 were in the non-IVF group.

Meanwhile, two new studies have revealed that women who receive acupuncture at the same time as IVF treatment are no more likely to have a baby. Both were randomised placebo-controlled trials in which the effect of acupuncture was compared with a sham procedure. Neither the patients nor the clinician evaluating their pregnancy knew who had received the true treatment. Acupuncture aimed at improving IVF success rates is widely offered by fertility clinics in the UK. In the first of the studies, researchers in Hong Kong split 370 women receiving IVF into two groups. One group received real acupuncture before and after having an IVF embryo implanted into their uterus. The other had the same procedure, except the treatment used retractable needles that did not penetrate the skin.  Of the 185 who received the sham treatment, 91 achieved a clinical pregnancy (foetal heartbeat identified using ultrasound) and 71 had a successful delivery. This compared with 72 clinical pregnancies in the true acupuncture group and 55 live births. The differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Dr Ernest Ng, in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Hong Kong, said that his methodology was the most powerful way of evaluating whether acupuncture was effective. His results are published in the journal Human Reproduction. In a second study, researchers in Chicago used a similar design in which 124 women received true or sham acupuncture. The control group had their skin punctured by real acupuncture needles, but not at genuine &quot;Qi-lines&quot; on the body.

An Air New Zealand jet will leave Auckland on December 3 with a 50-50 mix of jet fuel and oil from jatropha trees, in one of its four engines on a flight designed to show that jatropha biofuel is suitable for use in aviation as well as economical to produce .  &quot;This flight strongly supports our efforts to be the world&apos;s most environmentally responsible airline,&quot; said Rob Fyfe, chief executive of Air New Zealand. &quot;Introducing a new generation of sustainable fuels is the next logical step in our efforts to further save fuel and reduce aircraft emissions.&quot; The jatropha nuts, which contain 40% oil, were harvested from trees in Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania.  Friends of the Earth&apos;s biofuels campaigner, Kenneth Richter, welcomed the move to get the aviation industry to reduce the environmental footprint of its planes, but he raised concerns about the impact of biofuels. &quot;Even jatropha is being linked to food price rises and habitat destruction. Current rates of growth in air travel mean it is not enough to switch to biofuels.&quot; Robin Oakley, head of Greenpeace UK&apos;s climate change campaign, said: &quot;We need a dose of realism here, because this test flight does not mean an end to the use of kerosene in jet engines. The amount of jatropha that would be needed to power the world&apos;s entire aviation sector cannot be produced in anything like a sustainable way, and even if large volumes could be grown, planes are an incredibly wasteful way of using it.&quot; Boeing said their trees were grown on marginal land not required for food in India and south-east Africa.  Billy Glover, Boeing&apos;s managing director of environmental strategy, said that to prepare for the test flight, his team had tried to source biofuel reliably and economically for commercial aviation.  &quot;The processing technology exists today, and based on results we&apos;ve seen, it&apos;s highly encouraging that this fuel not only met but exceeded three key criteria for the next generation of jet fuel: higher than expected jet fuel yields, very low freeze point and good energy density. That tells us we&apos;re on the right path to certification and commercial availability.&quot; Air travel contributes up to 5.5% of UK carbon dioxide emissions and the search for a greener alternative to kerosene jet fuel has been fraught with difficulty. Airlines cannot use standard biofuels such as ethanol because this would freeze at high altitude. Testing for the Air New Zealand flight showed that the jatropha-based biofuel was more suitable for flying since it froze at -47C and burned at 38C. Chris Lewis, a fuels specialist at Rolls-Royce, which tested the jatropha biofuel, said: &quot;The blended fuel meets the essential requirement of being a drop-in fuel, meaning its properties will be virtually indistinguishable from conventional fuel which is used in commercial aviation today.&quot; Last month, Darrin Morgan, an environmental expert at Boeing, said biofuel-powered aircraft could be carrying millions of passengers around the world within three years, much sooner than most experts thought. The Air New Zeland plane is not the first to use biofuels. In February, Virgin Atlantic successfuly tried a mixture of 80% jet fuel and 20% biofuel (made from coconut oil and babassu palm oil) in one engine of a Boeing 747 on a flight between London and Amsterdam. Oakley said that technological advances in jet engines could only make a difference if there was a limit to the &quot;massive expansion of the airline industry around the world.&quot; &quot;If Boeing were really serious about reducing their impact on the environment they would end their vocal support for a third runway at Heathrow and put some of their billions into high-speed rail technology instead,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["In February, Virgin Atlantic successfuly tried a mixture of 80% jet fuel and 20% biofuel (made from coconut oil and babassu palm oil) in one engine of a Boeing 747 on a flight between London and Amsterdam."], "title": "Boeing to test biofuel on Air New Zealand flight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/13/travelandtransport-biofuels", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Biofuels", "Environment", "UK news", "Transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-14T00:01:00Z", "article": "If he wanted lessons in how to take it easy during his twilight years, Menahem Pressler would need to look no further than his own circle of friends. &quot;Many of them sit in front of the television set all day. A friend of mine who retired to Florida and built himself a big house on a golf course is up at six daily, driving around in his little golf cart. He says to me, &apos;When are you going to come and join me?&apos;&quot; But Pressler has no such plans. &quot;I can&apos;t find pleasure in getting a little ball into a little hole,&quot; says the German-born pianist and founder of the Beaux Arts Trio. He dissolved the internationally celebrated chamber music ensemble earlier this year after a record 53 years together - &quot;longer than the Rolling Stones,&quot; he quips - but has so far shown no sign of retiring.  Instead, at the age of 84, he continues to get his kicks from teaching and travelling the concert halls of the world. &quot;I receive all the nourishment I need from music. It&apos;s as close to the composer as I can get when I play and teach. The other night I was in New York, where I played Debussy. I was enchanted by the beauty of it, the way he opens our ears to sonorities we didn&apos;t know we had before he showed us. It is like a delicacy, like caviar. Beethoven, on the other hand, is necessary to life; he gives me that which I need to live.&quot; While his friends ride their golf carts and devour daytime TV, Pressler&apos;s punishing work schedule over the past two weeks has seen him flit from Illinois to New York, Massachusetts to Kentucky. &quot;I get all the exercise I need by running from gate 12 to gate 28, trying not to miss my plane,&quot; he says with a chuckle that causes his short, rotund frame to shake. He has just arrived in Amsterdam for a concert with the American String Quartet at the Concertgebouw, fresh from his 169th concert at the Metropolitan museum in New York. Despite jetlag, he is buoyed by the experience of having just performed, for the first time, Schubert&apos;s Shepherd on the Rock, with the star soprano Heidi Grant-Murphy. &quot;I had only heard it before, but the difference between hearing it and learning to play it as stark as the difference between making love in person or on the telephone,&quot; he says. Yet dampening his mood is the realisation that his suitcase, complete with his black-tie-and-tail concert suit, has erroneously been sent to London. &quot;I can&apos;t really complain; in the grand scheme of things, losing my suitcase is not important.&quot; His wife Sara - with whom he lives in Bloomington, Indiana, where he has been a university professor for the past half century - calls him a &quot;gl\u00fcckspilz&quot;: a lucky devil. &quot;In my life, the piece of bread has always fallen butter-side-up,&quot; he says. It was this luck, he firmly believes, that enabled his immediate family to escape the Holocaust. Last week saw him returning to his native Germany to mark the 70th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, the orchestrated, nationwide attack on Jewish homes and synagogues, which marked the start of state-sanctioned race hate and paved the way for the Holocaust.  Pressler, who was 14 at the time, remembers it all too clearly as the catalyst that finally forced his family to make the painful decision that, despite his mother&apos;s hope &quot;that it was something that would pass&quot;, they had to flee Germany. &quot;The thugs broke into our family shop in Magdeburg - a gentleman&apos;s outfitters,&quot; he recalls, before switching into the present tense as if reliving the nightmare in the here and now. &quot;We are hiding in the house, hoping it will go by ... in the street, you hear running, yelling, smashing sounds, banging at the door.&quot; But typical of the warmth and spirit of this jovial man is his insistence that &quot;not all Germans were bad&quot;. There were the SA officers who helped his brother when he fell off his bike and broke his leg, and his own piano teacher, a church organist called Herr Kitzel. &quot;Following Kristallnacht, he wasn&apos;t supposed to teach me, but he did so secretly. He was very sweet and supportive.&quot; The family fled Nazi Germany in 1939, escaping to Italy, and then went on to Israel. While in Trieste, Pressler received a package from Herr Kitzel. &quot;It contained a score of Reflets dans l&apos;Eau by Debussy, and he told me to keep practising.&quot; Menahem, his parents and his brother and sister arrived in Haifa just a day before war broke out in Europe. Not so fortunate were his grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins, all of whom perished in concentration camps. &quot;We were fortunate to find refuge in Israel, but I was a psychological wreck when I arrived,&quot; he says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t eat. My father accused me of behaving badly, but I simply couldn&apos;t, and I just got thinner and weaker.&quot; He was sent to a recuperation home, where the medicine that &quot;slowly, slowly&quot; healed him was music. &quot;During a piano lesson, I fainted playing Beethoven&apos;s penultimate sonata (Op 110). I&apos;m sure it was my emotional reaction to this magnificent work which summed up what I felt, everything that had happened. It has idealism, it has hedonism, it has regret, it has something that builds like a fugue. And at the very end, something that is very rare in Beethoven&apos;s last Sonatas - it is triumphant, it says, &apos;Yes, my life is worth living,&apos; and that&apos;s what I feel.&quot; His eyes glisten as he explains in English still heavily accented with the German of his childhood. Pressler offers a glimpse into the cultural richness embodied by the generation that Germany lost through nazism, a loss still keenly felt today. &quot;Despite having to flee my country, much of what is German, including the food and language, is very beautiful and meaningful to me,&quot; he says. &quot;The most influential years of my life were spent there. But it&apos;s nevertheless the case that Germany lost a whole generation of thinkers, writers and musicians.&quot; He left Israel and his parents for the US in 1946, specifically to take part in the Debussy piano competition, in which he won first prize. His success in the competition led to his debut at Carnegie Hall in 1947, where he performed Schumann&apos;s Piano Concerto with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The young Pressler made the US his home, encountering many of his fellow emigrants in Hollywood exile just as his own career was taking off. In their homes, or at concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, he bumped into, among others, Thomas Mann, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Sigmund Freud, Igor Stravinsky, Oskar Kokoschka, Artur Schnabel and the film composer Franz Wachsmann, who put Pressler up in his LA home. His teacher in Oakland was the great pianist Egon Petri. &quot;He used to ask me, &apos;What does the keyboard smell like, Menahem?&apos; because I always had my face so close to it.&quot;  Alma Mahler - the beautiful wife of composer Gustav, whose affairs with the painters Klimt and Kokoschka, and the architect Walter Gropius, were legendary - once invited him to play in her house. &quot;It was extremely hot, and I said to her, &apos;Mrs Mahler, may I take my jacket off?&apos; She said, &apos;Mr Pressler, as far as I&apos;m concerned, you can undress completely.&apos;  &quot;She opened the window, and when I protested that my playing might disturb the neighbours, she said, &apos;Don&apos;t worry, you can wake them all up!&apos;&quot; He adds: &quot;While it was a tragic time, it was also one of the most wonderful times of my life, in every respect. I&apos;m sure I wouldn&apos;t have become the musician I am now had I not experienced the depth of all that suffering and happiness.&quot; At the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Quartet musicians agree to appear in casual attire in solidarity with Pressler, whose suitcase has still not turned up.

His lyrics could make Eminem blush - sample: &quot;you can see this nigga with number 19/I can&apos;t even spend all my money/keep your daughter inside or you will be my family&quot; - but the Dutch seem to like it. &quot;The last one was called Eeyeeyo and went to number one in Holland over the summer,&quot; he says. &quot;Music has always been an important part of my life.&quot;  The Biljmermeer, or colloquially Bijlmer, is a cluster of tower blocks close to the Amsterdam Arena and home to many of the city&apos;s 70,000 immigrants from the former Dutch colony of Surinam. &quot;I don&apos;t want to use the word &apos;ghetto&apos; but that is one way people describe it,&quot; says Babel. &quot;I was lucky. My parents were very strict and had rules for me and, if ever I was playing outside, I always had a set time to come back in. But the Bijlmer had a lot of problems and I had other friends who chose the wrong road. There were a lot of drugs and crime and when you get into that scene it can be difficult to get back out.&quot;  This was also the place where El Al flight 1862, on the way from New York to Tel Aviv and having refuelled at Schiphol airport, crashed in 1992. &quot;The plane came over our flat [he uses his hand to show how close it was] before crashing into the next high block. It could easily have been us.&quot; Thirty-nine people from his neighbourhood were killed, along with the three crew members on the plane and the only other person on board, a non-paying passenger. &quot;It&apos;s a horrible memory. I was very young at the time [two months short of his sixth birthday] but I can still remember it. There was this almighty bang and when we ran out we could see all the flames and smoke. We were so close to it we had to leave our flat because it was not safe and we ended up at my grandma&apos;s. Then, when we were allowed to go back, I can just remember this terrible scene of complete devastation. It was like something out of a film.&quot; His upbringing makes him more interested in real life than celebrity life. Babel is not just an accomplished footballer for Liverpool but a fine ambassador. He has been involved in an anti-racism workshop run by the Anthony Walker Foundation and this week devoted himself to another of the Premier League&apos;s Creating Chances events, at the launch of Liverpool&apos;s Respect 4 All centre. The project, funded in part by the Premier League Professional Footballers&apos; Association, is for 12- to 16-year-olds with different types of disabilities.  Babel moved easily among the children, starting off with a game of wheelchair basketball before a target-practice routine with visually impaired children and a penalty shoot-out with youngsters with severe learning difficulties. Two hours of what would ordinarily be post-training rest time had elapsed by the time he had finished, but he was happy. &quot;It&apos;s always a good feeling if you can make these kids happy. Not everyone has the life they expect but I still think they can make the best of it and, with this kind of centre, we want to help to inspire them.&quot; Babel has sporting genes. His father, Guno, is a basketball coach. His mother, Asta, was an accomplished athlete and his sister, Janice, almost made it to the Olympics as a 100m and 200m sprinter. As fast as her brother? &quot;Close,&quot; he smiles.  His own athleticism was first spotted by Ajax when he was 11, although it was not a straightforward process. &quot;They used to have selection days for all the local kids and I went to these trials three times and got turned down every time,&quot; he recalls. &quot;On the third time I was so upset because I thought I was not good enough. I was eight years old and I had the feeling, &apos;That&apos;s it, I don&apos;t want to play for Ajax any more!&apos; But I kept doing well at my amateur club and, in the end, Ajax came to me.&quot; No community on the planet, per capita, produces more top footballers than Surinam. In their day, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids and Patrick Kluivert - all of Surinamese heritage - could all fit in a world XI. Babel is seen as the latest in a long distinguished line. He made his debut for Ajax shortly after his 17th birthday and, at 18, became Holland&apos;s youngest international goalscorer since the 1930s. He cost Liverpool \u00a311.5m and, in his first season, won their young player of the season award. Yet there are glimpses of frustration. Babel made 20 of his 48 appearances last season from the bench and, since the start of this one, has found himself on the edges even more. Of his 14 appearances, 10 have been as a substitute, making it difficult for him to fulfil the great Marco van Basten&apos;s prophecy that he could be &quot;the next Thierry Henry&quot;.  &quot;I&apos;m satisfied with my level of performance but the situation is clear - that I&apos;m not going to be one of the regular 11 starters,&quot; says Babel. &quot;It&apos;s difficult. I do get frustrated. I can tell myself that I&apos;m still only 21 and at the start of my career. But it is making it hard for me because, as time goes on, they keep telling me that I&apos;m young and that my time will come. Well, OK, but I&apos;m not a player who wants to wait. I want to be involved now rather than in three or four years&apos; time.&quot; While Rafael Ben\u00edtez has used Robbie Keane to partner Fernando Torres, Babel has mostly been employed on the wing. His pace could trouble any full-back, but Babel is a reluctant wide man. &quot;I have always said that I want to play as a striker,&quot; he says. &quot;Of course, it would not help me improve if I wasn&apos;t able to play, or train, in another position a couple of times. But all the time? I used to play as a striker in Holland. I grew up as a striker. That&apos;s the position I want to play. &quot;But I&apos;m working on it. I look at myself before I blame others. I&apos;m going to do something about it. It&apos;s not something I&apos;m scared about.&quot; As the children at Respect 4 All know, Babel likes a central role.", "sentences": ["He had to be to survive in the Bijlmermeer, the unloved district of Amsterdam where he was brought up.", "&quot;Music has always been an important part of my life.&quot;  The Biljmermeer, or colloquially Bijlmer, is a cluster of tower blocks close to the Amsterdam Arena and home to many of the city&apos;s 70,000 immigrants from the former Dutch colony of Surinam."], "title": "With a little help from above, Ryan Babel aspires to central casting at Liverpool", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/15/liverpool-premierleague", "tags": ["Premier League", "Liverpool", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-16T00:01:00Z", "article": "Letter of the week I am travelling with four friends to Japan in February to snowboard on the North Island. En route we are spending two and a half days in Tokyo. We want to get a real taste of the city and what it has to offer. I&apos;d be interested to hear your recommendations on whether we should sign up for a guided tour to get our bearings and see some of the key attractions and landmarks or go it alone. I prefer to explore cities independently but with the limited time available maybe a half-day or day tour is the best way to see the city? Can you recommend some tour guides or should we just strike out independently?Dave Runacres, by email A Tokyo can initially confuse visitors but no more than any other big city. Signage is generally in English as well as Japanese and getting around by metro is straightforward. The city is best explored as a series of neighbourhoods - colourful Asakusa, pictured above, the shopping districts of Shinjuku and Shibuya, and the cultural attractions of Ueno. If you&apos;ve explored other cities independently, then there&apos;s no need to grab a tour here. The Japan tourist board&apos;s rundown of attractions and PDF walking tours is useful: seejapan.co.uk. Q I live in Scotland, but go to Australia most years to see family. I like to stop over in each direction, but have no desire to make the stop in Dubai or North America.  I also hate Heathrow. Ideally, I would look for flights from a European hub with stops in Asia, buying a separate ticket from Glasgow to Europe and having a short stopover in Europe. However, I have repeatedly been told this is impossible, as the onward flight has to be with the same airline as that leaving the UK - so even flying KLM via Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, I cannot stop over in Amsterdam. Is there any way round this, short of taking a separate trip to Europe, and booking my ticket there? Could it be done online or by phone? I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m the only person who would prefer to start a long-haul flight from Europe. Is there a good reason for what looks like protectionism, or am I just ignorant about how to achieve what I want?Helen Owen, by email A UK agents can only sell discounted tickets that originate in the UK. They can sell tickets originating overseas but at &apos;full published fares&apos;, which will be considerably higher. So planning an itinerary that starts with a return flight to Europe and subsequently booking a separate ticket to another destination is not impossible; it is just not going to offer value for money. However there are airlines and alliances that offer European and Asian stopovers en route to Australia. KLM does allow you to stop in Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur en route to Australia as it operates &apos;codeshare&apos; flights with Malaysia Airlines (the flight will be operated by Malaysia Airlines, but also have a KLM flight number). For example, Glasgow-Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur-Sydney-Glasgow costs from \u00a31,424 return until 14 July 2009. And China Airlines&apos; agreement with KLM means you can fly via Bangkok, Hong Kong or Taipei. So Glasgow-Amsterdam-Bangkok-Sydney-Taipei-Glasgow would cost from \u00a3868 return.  If you want complete flexibility, you can book a multi-stop (or round-the-world) ticket. As long as you take one transatlantic and one transpacific flight you can choose from a range of stops. Trailfinders (0845 050 5858; trailfinders.com) can tailor-make an itinerary. Q We are going to a conference in Calcutta at the beginning of January. Our hosts will show us around but what should we absolutely not miss? And are there a couple of overnight trips? This is likely to be the only time we are in the region.Ruth Coppard, Sheffield A Calcutta has its share of great sights - Kalighat Kali Temple, the Indian Museum and Victoria Memorial chief among them. But the real joy of the city comes in walking the streets. BBD Bagh, Park Street, Chowringhee Road and the Mullik Ghat flower market are good focal points, and will give you contrasting images of the city. Perhaps your hosts could get you in to a cricket match at the legendary Eden Gardens.  Popular excursions include a tour to the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (see sunderbantigercamp.com). The terracotta temples of Bishnupur are a four-hour train ride away. It&apos;s worth taking an early train to see Calcutta&apos;s Howrah Station at its most boisterous. Q My partner and I want to get married in Las Vegas just before Christmas next year, travelling with about 10 friends. As it will be just before the festive season, will flights be cheap? And would we be better getting flights separately from hotel bookings?Nigel Van Beek, by email A The closer you get to Christmas the higher the fares. Fares for next December will go on sale in the new year. The earlier in December you fly, the better the deal. On the 14th you can fly for \u00a3372 with US Airways via Charlotte, North Carolina. A week later the cheapest fare is \u00a3473 with Delta via JFK.  Fares reach silly levels a few days before Christmas which, alongside Thanksgiving, is the busiest period to be travelling around the US. It can work out cheaper to book your flight and hotel together: for just \u00a3414, Opodo (opodo.co.uk) offers the US Airways flight above and five nights at the Circus Circus Hotel (based on two sharing) - meaning you get your hotel for less than \u00a310 a night. This Vegas icon boasts the world&apos;s only indoor double-loop rollercoaster, and the world&apos;s largest buffet.  Feedback Regarding the letter about visiting Flam, Bergen and Alesund in Norway without driving (last week) we had a wonderful trip to those places on a P&amp;O cruise from Southampton. Pay for a cabin with a balcony and enjoy the incomparable scenery. We had not been on a cruise before but thought it was a great way to see Norway. Most ports of call could be explored independently, though a trip through the fjords on a small boat and a visit to a glacier were amazing.L Phillips, Caversham", "sentences": ["However, I have repeatedly been told this is impossible, as the onward flight has to be with the same airline as that leaving the UK - so even flying KLM via Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, I cannot stop over in Amsterdam.", "KLM does allow you to stop in Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur en route to Australia as it operates &apos;codeshare&apos; flights with Malaysia Airlines (the flight will be operated by Malaysia Airlines, but also have a KLM flight number).", "For example, Glasgow-Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur-Sydney-Glasgow costs from \u00a31,424 return until 14 July 2009.", "So Glasgow-Amsterdam-Bangkok-Sydney-Taipei-Glasgow would cost from \u00a3868 return."], "title": "Ask Tom", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2008/nov/16/ask-tom-travel-advice", "tags": ["Flights", "Travel", "Japan holidays", "Australia holidays", "Kolkata holidays", "India holidays", "Las Vegas holidays", "United States holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-16T00:01:00Z", "article": "There are some mouth-watering new cookbooks out led, for me, by Paul Gayler&apos;s excellent Sauce Book (Kyle Cathie, \u00a320). What a great idea! I can never think up sauces for things and here&apos;s a dedicated book with over 300 of them, from basic brown to French classics, and a delicious soy kaffir one for lobster. Gayler is head chef at London&apos;s Lanesborough hotel and wrote most of the recipes longhand on the bus home, whereupon his wife typed them up.  From the same publisher comes Tapas (\u00a316.99) by Carlos Horrillo and Patrick Morcas, chefs of north London&apos;s El Parador (they&apos;re committed foodies at Kyle Cathie, and this is their local restaurant). Recipes are simple but unusual - a lovely butternut mash under scallops, a delicious cabbage-and-bacon dish you can do in a second.  Then there&apos;s the 480-page Gary Rhodes 365 (Penguin, \u00a325) - excellent value for a year&apos;s worth of recipes, from easy breakfast and tea ideas and simple midweek suppers to grander entertaining. His recipes are easy to follow, they work and there are often suggestions for alternatives or shortcuts.  I always use Mary Berry, especially for puddings. Desserts (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a318.99) is a good, updated, pretty much foolproof collection. She&apos;s also brought out a collection of recipes you can prepare in advance - One Step Ahead (Quadrille, \u00a312.99).  I love the way Skye Gyngell combines tastes and there are some brilliant ideas in My Favourite Ingredients (Quadrille, \u00a325). How about lobster with white beans, tarragon and tomato, or apple ice cream with toasted cobnuts and caramel sauce? Yum! Reissuing the Seventies classic, Delia&apos;s Frugal Food (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a317.99) is both a timely and generous move as all profits are going to the Catholic aid agency Cafod. You will find many useful recipes in here from dumplings to cheap cassoulet.  Two good curry books have just come out. Sunil Vijayakara&apos;s Curry (Ryland Peters, \u00a39.99) is a concise collection of uncomplicated worldwide dishes, with mouthwatering pictures by Kate Whitaker. And I love Vivek Singh&apos;s Curry (Absolute press, \u00a320). Executive chef at London&apos;s Cinnamon Club, Singh has taken a fearless approach to such dishes as marinated rib-eye steak with marsala potato accompaniment and a Punjabi lentil dish with scrambled eggs.  The art and observations in The Urban Cookbook (Thames &amp; Hudson, \u00a316.95) are more enticing than the recipes. But that is probably the point. King Adz has pulled together &apos;50 recipes, 25 urban talents and five cities&apos; - namely New York, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and London, in this very hip city guide that would make a great Christmas present. Good food takes some seeking out in Venice, which on the whole caters lazily for mass tourism, but Tessa Kiros&apos;s collection of traditional dishes, Venezia: Food and Dreams (Murdoch Books, \u00a325), is a jewel of a book - stunning photography, wonderful recipes and beautifully presented, down to the gilt-edged pages and wide black ribbon marker. And I love Christine Smallwood&apos;s An Appetite for Puglia (Bonny Day Publishing, \u00a319.95, Daunts, Stanfords or appetiteforpuglia.com) - a perfect combination of local recipes and travel guide to little places you might otherwise never find, with lovely pictures.  I expected The Complete Robuchon (Grub Street, \u00a325) to be rather complicated, but it&apos;s the opposite - simple versions of the classics, a really French charcuterie section with things like chitterlings, and over 800 recipes. Good value. The Inverawe Smoked Fish Cookbook (Quiller, \u00a314.99) is a useful collection of recipes, from an escabeche of kippers to smoked eel, chorizo and potato frittata and traditional cullen skink soup, by the smokehouse owner, Rosie Campbell-Preston. And I love Terrines and Verrines (Navigator, \u00a320). Franck Pontais worked at the traiteur counters of Harrods and Selfridges and has produced a collection of cooked, pressed and set terrines.

The old optimism that once seemed to be in the bones of Scots supporters whenever the national team took the field seems to have been drained off by a succession of failures over the past 10 years, including not qualifying for any of the five major championships since France 98. The support on the night will remain ferocious, but will spring largely from a tentative hope, rather than a swaggering confidence.  There is no doubt, either, that Diego Maradona&apos;s arrival in Glasgow for his first outing as Argentina&apos;s head coach will be a powerful draw. Since the announcement of his appointment less than two weeks ago, the Scottish FA has received so many applications for media accreditation from around the world - including Australia and Fiji - it may have to expand the capacity of the press box from 350 to 450 seats. By the end of last week, 25,000 tickets had been sold, two-and-a-half times the amount that would normally be expected to have gone at this stage of the build-up to a friendly in November.  George Burley, the Scotland manager, must look beyond the ballyhoo and view the match as a helpful exercise on the way to securing passage to the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. It will be difficult for him to strike a balance between avoiding a potentially morale-crushing defeat and experimenting with players and strategies that may be relevant to his side&apos;s next two qualifiers, away to Holland (28 March) and at home to Iceland (1 April). The fixture against Argentina will be a final rehearsal because Burley has decided against another friendly on the Fifa-allocated international date in February in favour of four days of training.  Of the 26 players named in Burley&apos;s squad for this week&apos;s match, Barry Ferguson, Craig Gordon, Alan Hutton, Ross McCormack and Gary Naysmith have recently been absent from club football because of injury and will need close monitoring before a decision is made on their participation, while Darren Fletcher has been ruled out with a knee injury. But Burley remains confident.  &apos;Our players have great belief that they can make it to the World Cup,&apos; he said. &apos;There&apos;s no reason why they shouldn&apos;t. But the key is to go into any match without fear - and that includes travelling to face Holland in March. Delivering a performance and, hopefully, a good result against Argentina would help. Of course, it will be difficult. They have players who are full of quality and experience. Javier Zanetti was playing for Milan when I was manager of Ipswich and he&apos;s still doing his stuff at Inter at the age of 35.  &apos;Yes, they could turn us over, but players and fans all want this kind of challenge. You see the best example of that in the Celtic players. We are aware that Gordon Strachan&apos;s concern involves the volume of matches his team have to tackle at the moment. We understand that and we will be mindful of it. We are allowed six substitutes and that will be utilised. But all six of the Celtic players in the squad are desperate to play against Argentina.&apos;  However Burley may idealise the status of the visitors to Hampden Park and relish the opportunity to test his squad against them, it is impossible to escape the feeling that the fixture is likely to be of limited value. The possibility of compromise in his team selection, and of manipulation of substitutes to protect certain players with important club commitments could create an artificial &apos;contest&apos; that will have no relevance to a night in Amsterdam four months from now.", "sentences": ["The possibility of compromise in his team selection, and of manipulation of substitutes to protect certain players with important club commitments could create an artificial &apos;contest&apos; that will have no relevance to a night in Amsterdam four months from now."], "title": "Scotland's George Burley looks beyond ballyhoo of Diego Maradona's visit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/16/scotland-argentina-diegomaradona", "tags": ["Scotland", "Argentina", "Diego Maradona", "Football"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-16T00:01:00Z", "article": "When Jack Kerouac first coined the term &apos;the Beats&apos; for his loose-knit group of world-weary bohemians, he meant it in the sense that they were outsiders - a dangerous, free-thinking underclass. But the Beats&apos; empathy for jazz and, in particular, the free-form bebop of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, brought with it a glamorised fancy for heroin. As with so many working musicians, the pioneers of bebop eased their pressures with the needle. And just as the misadventures of Pete Doherty would be news today, Charlie Parker made the front pages in 1946 after a Sunset Strip binge led to his being committed for electro-shock treatment. The kids loved him for it. Assuming a direct correlation between their jazz heroes&apos; habits and their inspired musical improvisations, the Beats began experimenting, too. In an era where teenagers were carving their own niche and so to be &apos;hip&apos; was everything, a fledgling youth movement was, for the first time, fuelled by narcotics. As Miles Davis noted in his autobiography: &apos;People were considered hip if they shot smack.&apos; With their subterranean fusion of radical jazz, their stream-of-consciousness compositions and their acquiescence to the languorous medications of smack, Kerouac redefined Beat&apos;s meaning to embrace the &apos;beat&apos;-ific vibe of the time, and the drowsy ambivalence of heroin&apos;s afterburn. &apos;I&apos;m beat&apos; in Fifties New York would equate to &apos;I&apos;m done in&apos; today. But the laid-back, live-and-let-live philosophy the term espouses sowed the seeds of Flower Power when the Beats went West. But before Beat turned to free love, there was an equal and opposite reaction to the Beatniks&apos; pretensions across the Atlantic in London&apos;s Soho. Annexing their moniker from the modernists first described in Colin MacInnes&apos; 1959 novel Absolute Beginners, London&apos;s original mods started to congregate among the coffee bars and clubs of Wardour Street in 1960. Eschewing the threadbare, wayfaring look of the beatniks, the mods favoured neat, tailored clothing and a correspondingly upbeat philosophy for life. They bucked the trend for binge-drinking and generally getting &apos;out of it&apos;, preferring a music, lifestyle and drug choice based on mental and sartorial acuity. Where the beatniks preferred barbiturates or downers, the mods were all about uppers. Up until 1964, amphetamines with street names like Bennies and Dexies were both legal and commonplace, often prescribed for fatigue, weight loss, and respiratory and heart complaints. Universally known as Purple Hearts, Dinaml was the most popular high street pep pill of its time. Its side-effects, as described in moralistic detail in the accompanying use and dosage leaflet of the day, might just as well have been broadcast as a come-hither to the mod community: &apos;Do not exceed the stated dose. Can cause incidence of euphoria, enhanced wakefulness, increased physical activity, decreased appetite, increased respiration and feelings of power, strength, self-assertion and enhanced motivation.&apos; All around the country, women were popping a couple with their elevenses to help chase away the cobwebs, the blues and those pesky extra pounds around their hips. All over London, their sons and daughters raided their medicine cabinets for night fuel. Above all, mods were night crawlers. They flocked to coffee bars instead of pubs, not just because they sneered at drunks but because most of these newfangled cappuccino bars boasted 2am licences (pubs shut at 10.30). They also had jukeboxes long before the boozers, allowing the young ones to wash down their Bennies with a frothy coffee and dance to the Who, Small Faces, the Kinks or the Pretty Things, whose &apos;Midnight to Six&apos; is perhaps the quintessential mod track. The mods&apos; soul brothers were the rude boys from Ladbroke Grove, Brixton and Harlesden. Nattily dressed in tonic suits and pork pie hats, the rude boys were the sons of the sticksmen - the Windrush generation, brought up on the ska and bluebeat of their parents&apos; birthplace. But in 1968, back in Jamaica, the scene was changing. Artistes like Toots Hibbert of the Maytals were slowing the backbeat right down. Reggae was lilting and gently mesmeric, as though crafted for the weed that inspired its form and theology. Reggae quickly became the soundtrack to an increasingly politicised young Jamaica. With the arrival of bands such as the Pioneers and the Wailers (featuring Peter Tosh and Bob Marley), the nascent reggae scene began to embrace sociopolitical and religious themes and, particularly, the growing influence of Rastafarianism on Jamaican youth. The smoking of cannabis in its purest form (grass, or ganja, as opposed to pot) became as intrinsic a part of the Rasta&apos;s holy trinity as the Ethiopian flag and the choppy skank of reggae&apos;s rhythm guitar. For Rastas, the smoking of herb or ganja is a spiritual act, often an accompaniment to bible-reading, with reggae the musical backbeat to both the religion and the way of life. And while the music made occasional reference to the darker practices of freebase and &apos;icing&apos; (most notably Dillinger&apos;s 1978 anthem &apos;Cocaine&apos;), reggae&apos;s constant referencing of kaya (cannabis leaf), collie men (weed dealers) and Mary Jane (marijuana) celebrates it as a spliff culture. Cannabis was helping shape the development of the North Beach hipsters in San Francisco, too. When Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady and the rest of the NY alternative community upped from Greenwich Village to San Francisco in 1962, they found a melange of counter-cultural ideas, individuals and music. A whole new scene was springing up around the ornate but dilapidated Haight-Ashbury area: clubs, &apos;happenings&apos; and young bands with grandiose names like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and the Quicksilver Messenger Service. Something was afoot. There was also a folk scene based around The Cabale Creamery in Berkeley that began to fuse the anti-war philosophies of its regulars with a general drift towards Native American spiritualism and the kind of back-to-nature frugality espoused in Henry Thoreau&apos;s utopian classic Walden. The Creamery&apos;s co-founder, Chandler Laughlin, favoured free-flowing garments and headbands in the Native American tradition, and the younger followers of the folk scene began dressing similarly. One of their number was Owsley Stanley, a studious young man who spent his time manufacturing a drug whose complex name - lysergic acid diethylamide -was quickly abbreviated to three initials: LSD. And while pot served its purpose, often hallucinogenic, LSD was the drug the foundling hippy communities had been waiting for. Laughlin discovered The Red Dog Saloon, an isolated club in the desert, and brought his followers out for what would turn out to be the world&apos;s first hippy &apos;happening&apos;. Projecting Bill Ham&apos;s surreal oil and colour lightshow against the walls, and encouraging the notion that no boundary should exist between performers and crowd, Laughlin mixed together the best of the alt-folk scene with the emerging Haight-Ashbury bands and a load of LSD. By dawn, psychedelia was born.  The scene and its acolytes moved from the desert back to San Francisco and, on 16 October 1965, the first self-billed psychedelic rock show took place at the Longshoreman&apos;s Hall. Advertised as &apos;A Tribute to Doctor Strange&apos; and attended by 1,000 devotees, the gig featured the Marbles and Jefferson Airplane, who invited their followers on stage to sip acid-spiked punch from a gigantic chalice. By January 1966 such gigs, hosted by Ken Kesey under his banner the Trips, were bringing in 10,000 hippies a night, with thousands more turned away. Kids were descending on San Francisco expressly to join the commune of peace, love and experimentation as it moved onwards to bigger and bigger homes, such as The Fillmore and The Avalon Ballroom.  The tentacles and tenets of hippydom reverberated all around the world, but as with every bolshy new scene that drags itself kicking and screaming into the world with all the brio, vim and attitude of the here and now, hippies and their music inevitably became a sad parody of themselves. Instead of the vibrant terrorism of Jimi Hendrix or the astral psychedelia of Sergeant Pepper, we had soppy long-hair bands who happened to smoke pot and down mushrooms, culling the sixth-form imagery and iconography of Tolkien and Dungeons and Dragons. We had Yes. We had Gong. But, as Jean-Jacques Burnel warned, &apos;Something better change.&apos; The punks were coming. From the first three-chord blasts of the Ramones, Sex Pistols and the Clash, punk was shock-treatment for the disaffected teens. It was fast, furious, short and bittersweet. Songs were the antithesis of those 20-minute aural symphonies the likes of ELP and Rick Wakeman had been getting away with in the early to mid-Seventies. Most proto-punk anthems were two-minute garage thrash-bangs and the drugs of choice, too, were fast, cheap and often DIY. Amphetamine sulphate, speed, was everywhere, its crushed-tight powder geometrically folded into Stanley blade-sized wraps. Amyl nitrate, too (called rush before the gay community coined poppers, after its pupil-dilating effects), sniffed straight from the 10-bob bottle. Anything that would induce an immediate energetic charge to complement the adrenalised urgency of the music would fit the bill. Anything sluggish or introspective was condemned as hippy shit.  Yet, for all the similarities in the two scenes&apos; backgrounds and fanbases, punk&apos;s drugging was quite unlike the pill-popping hedonism of the mod world. Mod was, generally, an aspirational and forward-looking code, whereas punk was rebellious and nihilistic, kicking against the system with youthful fury. Punk&apos;s narcotic sideshow was scuzzy, cheap and often home-made. Prior to a Psychedelic Furs gig at Eric&apos;s Club, Liverpool, a young man dumped a plastic bag on to a table top, with thick, crystalline powder spilling out. After the slightest hesitation, a dozen eager fingers began dabbing, licking, slurping, dabbing again. That man, now one of the foremost backline technicians on the live-band circuit, laughed: &apos;Go easy, will you. That&apos;s only just out the oven!&apos; The club was raided by the drugs squad later that night and was closed down, never to re-open. The fast times were, for the time being at least, brought to a halt. Just as particular sociopolitical climates stimulated the special musical/narcotic relationships that led to the growth of reggae culture, for example, or punk, so too can economic conditions depress a generation&apos;s creative output. A direct product of the youth unemployment that accompanied Margaret Thatcher&apos;s first term in office was a country-wide heroin epidemic among the young. Heroin is an opiate, a soporific and it&apos;s no co-incidence that much of what passed for youth culture in the early to mid-Eighties was retrospective and nostalgic. Yet one of the Eighties&apos; more idiosyncratic underground scenes grew exponentially from the inertia of dole-life. Bored and listless, eking their giro out over its fortnightly dawdle, teenagers fell back on the consolations of smack and pot. This was a life spent lying down, waiting for a better day and its curious soundtrack was a pick-and-mix culled from the catalogues of Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Soft Machine, Peter Gabriel&apos;s Genesis and, curiously, Chris de Burgh. The progeny of the former working classes were now hitting the bong.  But while this was, in the main, a passive and slow-travelling phenomenon, mainly confined to the northwest, at weekends it grew wings. In the form of jobbing cabaret bands such as Groundpig, the Munchies and Drama, the first of our tribute super-groups were starting to find a huge and grateful constituency among a young, under-waged crowd who simply wanted to let off steam among themselves. At its primal core, this was the tribal precursor to acid house. For a scene to be genuinely innovative, it needs its own high-octane fuel. It needs that all-too-rare synthesis of right time, right place, right crowd, right music. And above all, it needs the right drug. So when ecstasy filtered its sinuous way through basement clubs of London in 1986, it lit the well-laid gunpowder trail to one of the UK&apos;s great cultural explosions. So many diverse yet empathetic little subcultures were waiting to be dragged in under that one great star-spangled panoply as 1986 became 1987. Warehouse parties, house music, rock bands such as New Order using DJs and samplers, the disco revival, the Wag-club-led return of working-class football dandies to the dance floor - and not just here but in Amsterdam, in Chicago and in Ibiza, of course. All these crazy little strands, waiting to explode, and ecstasy threw the switch. From its earliest incarnations with Daryll Pandy, Baby Ford, S-Express and Bomb The Bass, right through to the golden age of Madchester, it was the acid in acid house that made the genre sparkle. Ecstasy, or MDMA, was unusual in that the drug had been developed by Merck not to cure anything specific, but to make people talk to one another. In its earliest trials, MDMA was intended to help revive marriages that had hit a stale patch. But ecstasy&apos;s ability to induce communal euphoria allied to coruscating light shows, and a new tribe of DJs who came from the dance floor themselves and knew how to build a crowd&apos;s delirium, meant acid house was an overnight phenomenon. And where punk grew roots at its own pace, developing its notoriety through fanzines, word of mouth and specialist night-time radio, gradually spreading nationwide, acid was the stuff of tabloid furore. But this time the copycat rave syndrome didn&apos;t kill the genre dead. As quickly as the tabloid version of acid house filtered down to youth clubs and high-street pulling palaces, the sheer invention fostered by the drug itself and the communities it inspired led to side movements, subtle shifts in the tempo and the nuances of dance music from Balearic to New Beat. And it all led inexorably to indie dance. Of all the great pop repercussions to result from the marriage of MDMA and disco music, the gurning faces of Happy Mondays&apos; Bez, stage left and Barry Mooncult of Flowered Up, stage right, best crystallise its inspired lunacy. Here were bands who took the purest ethic of punk - get guitar, make stuff up, play - mashed it all up with seductive drum loops, throbbing bass samples and irresistible dance-floor &apos;riddims&apos;, then asked their mates to dance on stage. It was back to the days of Aquarius, where nothing could ever be deemed excessive, no contribution lesser in value than another. So when Bez began regularly to lope onstage with the Ryder brothers, bug-eyed and slack-jawed, shaking his maracas like an electrocuted grasshopper, it was going to take something magnificent, and some industrial dosage of drugs, to trump his act. Barry Mooncult, who donned an all-in-one planet suit and proceeded to walk up and down in front of the band, smiling, was that ace. One of the century&apos;s last great &apos;happenings&apos;, set to a repetitive four-four beat as Shoreditch Town Hall rioted, felt like a moment that might never be bettered.  And it still feels that way. Maybe grime and dubstep wouldn&apos;t sound as alien and paranoid as it does without the stupefying effects of powerful hydroponic skunk. New rave seemed briefly to get its kicks out of ketamine. Rod Stanley, editor of Dazed &amp; Confused magazine, has a thought: &apos;No one has really &quot;invented&quot; or discovered a new drug for a while. Every time one has been found over the decades, young people swiftly work out the best music experience to go with it,&apos; he says. &apos;If a new drug were discovered today, a new music scene would spring up overnight.&apos; But with scenes like techtonik making a virtue of being wholly drug- and alcohol-free, one has to wonder whether the links between music and drugs are finally breaking down.", "sentences": ["Warehouse parties, house music, rock bands such as New Order using DJs and samplers, the disco revival, the Wag-club-led return of working-class football dandies to the dance floor - and not just here but in Amsterdam, in Chicago and in Ibiza, of course."], "title": "Drugs uncovered: The link between drugs and music", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/nov/16/drugs-music-link", "tags": ["Society", "Music", "Culture", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-17T12:13:38Z", "article": "PSV striker Danko Lazovic&apos;s frustrated tirade toward his own bench after setting up his side&apos;s only goal of the weekend said it all. After a very premature elimination from the Dutch cup, a hopelessly lost Champions League campaign and a 4-1 defeat to Ajax yesterday, PSV are well and truly in trouble. In trouble and troubled. On Wednesday PSV failed to make it to the last 16 in the cup after going down to AZ 1-0 in extra-time despite a valiant effort. Yesterday a raucous second half saw Ajax score three goals in the last 16 minutes - which said more about PSV&apos;s defence than Ajax&apos;s injury-ravaged attack. &quot;I still think we&apos;re on the right path,&quot; said PSV manager Huub Stevens, whose credibility is waning. &quot;Not in terms of results but we&apos;re taking steps.&quot; &quot;The way back from the Amsterdam Arena to Eindhoven was a joyous ride for any PSV squad in previous years,&quot; De Volkskrant&apos;s Charles Bromet wrote, referring to Ajax&apos;s failure to win more than once at home to PSV in the previous 11 years. &quot;This season \u2026 they have awoken in a new reality that is hardly conceivable. PSV have shrivelled to a predicatable collection.&quot; The Ajax manager Marco van Basten rubbed salt in the wound by proclaiming that &quot;when looking at the standings we need to focus on AZ and NAC&quot;, slighting his opponents by ommission. PSV have now lost four games in a row, five times in the league and seven of 16 matches this season, after considerable success in Europe and seven Dutch championships in the past nine years. Tellingly, the last time the club struggled this badly was after Sir Bobby Robson&apos;s ill-advised re-appointment as manager in 1998. So PSV are quite rightfully doing what any club in their situation would do: panicking. But they&apos;re going about it in the wrong way. There is a right and a wrong way to panic in football. Ask me not what the right way is - if I knew how to salvage a sinking football club I wouldn&apos;t be writing this; I&apos;d be the Dutch Harry Redknapp, going from club to club, putting out fires. But I can tell you what the wrong way is. It is trying to recreate the past. PSV have earmarked funds to bring Mark van Bommel and Andre Ooijer back to the club in January. Van Bommel, 31, is riding the bench and an expiring contract at Bayern Munich despite officially being their skipper. He left PSV and their captaincy after their stunning run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2004-05. But since the current captain Timmy Simons and Edison Mendez have a firm grip on the holding midfielder roles and Ibrahim Afellay has a stranglehold on the playmaker&apos;s spot, exactly what Van Bommel is expected to do in Eindhoven is unclear. Ooijer would be a much more useful addition, despite his advancing years. The 34-year-old can no longer rely on Paul Ince to play him at Blackburn and could be allowed to return to the club he served for nine years before forcing a transfer to England by going on strike. He would solidify a defence that can count only Dirk Marcellis as an asset. But with history as a guide, neither of these transfers will be that helpful. Clubs have tried this before, you see. It&apos;s a common knee-jerk reaction to try to re-establish the golden days by bringing back the same old players. In the late 1990s, Ajax attempted to halt their downward spiral by bringing back their 80s stars Aron Winter, Richard Witschge and Frank Verlaat, while they just missed out on Bryan Roy - who would have kept one Rafael van der Vaart out of the team. It didn&apos;t work. Last year, Feyenoord tried to rearrange their fortunes by bringing Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Kevin Hofland, Tim de Cler, Denny Landzaat and Roy Makaay back to Holland. It doesn&apos;t appear to be working. While at Barcelona, Louis van Gaal tried to bolster his squad by bringing as many parts of his all-conquering Ajax side of the mid-90s to Catalunya as possible. Frank and Ronald de Boer, Patrick Kluivert, Jari Litmanen, Winston Bogarde and Michael Reiziger had varying degrees of success at Camp Nou, but the squad was not the same. It didn&apos;t work. It never works. Football teams are not like ruins. You can&apos;t simply disassemble them and put them back together in another space and time and expect them to be the same. Even with the addition of the stellar Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, the Barcelona-incarnation of Ajax wasn&apos;t a better side. A crowded midfield forced Litmanen, Ajax&apos;s control room, off to the right or the bench. The whole was no longer much greater than the sum of its parts, the way it had been at Ajax. The sum of the parts was greater than the whole. The present-day Ajax meanwhile also managed to eliminate themselves from the cup competition by losing to lowly FC Volendam last week. The Amsterdammers showed little and scored even less, despite a few decent chances. They and the viewers were put out of their misery by Jack Tuyp&apos;s goal in extra-time. But Ajax v PSV wasn&apos;t the only big clash of the weekend. There was also Feyenoord&apos;s visit to FC Twente. Eljero Elia, who is understandably desired by any club that plays with a left winger, was a terror to Feyenoord&apos;s defence and drew a penalty which Blaise N&apos;Kufo converted. A Makaay penalty at the other end capped a 1-1 draw which sold Twente short. &quot;The Rotterdammers could consider themselves lucky with a draw,&quot; Sjoerd Mossou said in Algemeen Dagblad. &quot;With another heavily damaged squad Feyenoord struggled to contain FC Twente, who dominated three-quarters of the game.&quot; Feyenoord&apos;s Henk Timmer confirmed his status as the worst keeper in the Netherlands, but what he lacks in skill he makes up for in humour. &quot;When you consider that we&apos;re playing with guys that have to be home at seven, we did fine,&quot; he said of the toddler-brigade from Rotterdam. &quot;When you look at their bench \u2026 and at ours, [ours] are 15 years old.&quot; After 11 rounds, the Eredivisie still lacks a clear title-favorite. Or a deserving one for that matter. We should know more after AZ v Ajax next Sunday though.

When it was put to Smith that this was unfair, she replied: &quot;I will tell you what I think is more unfair. That&apos;s that there are women in this country who are effectively being held in slavery. There would not be this exploitation, there would not be this slavery of women, controlled in the way that they are, if there was not the demand for prostitution.&quot; She said that in the past the government has concentrated on addressing the &quot;supply side&quot; issues relating to prostitution. Now the government wanted to curtail the demand. &quot;At the end what we also need to recognise is that if there is no demand for sex with women, there will be less trafficking,&quot; she said. Smith also explained why the government had decided not to adopt the approach taken in Sweden, where the government introduced a total ban on men paying for sex. She said that in Sweden there were only around 1,500 prostitutes, compared with around 80,000 in Britain, and that there was &quot;no strong support at the moment&quot; for a total ban in Britain.

A reported figure of \u00a3800,000 brought Argentina and Diego Maradona to Glasgow; the visitors had rendered what can be a raucous venue at times about as noisy as a library before many fans had even taken their seats. This was worryingly straightforward for Argentina. Carlos Tevez tormented and teased the Scots; Sir Alex Ferguson would have been concerned by a first-half lunge by Gary Caldwell on his forward&apos;s left ankle but Tevez appeared to bear no lasting effects. Scotland, albeit depleted, remain a footballing world away from Argentina. There will be far tougher tests to come for Maradona. In blunt terms this was a competitive non-event with little for the Scotland management team to glean in a positive sense. To add insult to injury, a confirmed crowd of less than 35,000 means the SFA will not have broken financially even on the event. &quot;It was a very good experience,&quot; said the Scotland manager, George Burley, obviously an eternal optimist. &quot;In the first 15 minutes they overran us but after that we got amongst them.&quot; The manager will not admit it but this was a match selected by people who don blazers rather than training ground apparel. Burley probably regarded the circus which had surrounded Maradona&apos;s arrival in Glasgow as something of a blessing. After all, it had deflected from Scotland&apos;s miserable home international record. The Scots had failed to record a victory in 11 outings at Hampden prior to last night; not in 12 years have they won a friendly in Glasgow. It was soon apparent that Argentina would show little compassion. Javier Mascherano had already watched a 20-yard volley clawed away by Allan McGregor by the time Maxi Rodr\u00edguez sauntered through the home rearguard and finished from close range. The build-up passing from Tevez and Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez was typically exquisite, sufficiently so to pull Kirk Broadfoot fatally out of position and expose the Scotland central defence. Within 12 minutes the Tartan Army were ironically hailing even a brief sequence of passes between Burley&apos;s players. Scotland&apos;s best hope, it seemed, was either floodlight failure and match abandonment or an unlikely loss of interest from the South Americans. There was neither. Burley had called on the services of his captain, Barry Ferguson, for the first time after a succession of injuries stalled the midfielder&apos;s international career. Like his team-mates, Ferguson took half an hour to catch his breath; this was hardly a welcoming environment for a player who has played only two full games this season. The 30-year-old lasted 59 minutes, by which time he had probably chased quite enough shadows for one night. Tevez, the outstanding performer, was the subject of a series of heavy tackles from the Scottish players, with Caldwell booked for his illegal attempts at halting the former West Ham United striker. It was, indeed, a minor surprise that Tevez appeared at all for the second half and James McFadden was the next to clatter him, a matter which would surely have had a certain Scot in the Lancashire area again bemoaning the inconvenience of international friendly matches. Yet Tevez remained unbowed, continuing with his moments of brilliance until full-time. Scotland enjoyed their most effective spell of the match as the second period opened but without forcing Juan Carrizo into anything resembling meaningful action. Niggling fouls, diving and needle had also become the order of the day before Tevez should have settled matters, driving through the Scotland defence and sending a shot high on the hour mark. The ineffectual McFadden followed his captain down the tunnel shortly after, Burley at least attempting to breathe life into a stagnant contest by re-arranging his forward players. Unlike their opponents, though, Scotland never looked a viable threat when crossing the half-way line. Burley has four months to contemplate his next move. A World Cup qualifier in Amsterdam is hardly a comforting prospect this morning. His desire to employ an attacking style is admirable, yet it remains obvious he lacks the required talent. It must be hoped that by March 28 Scotland&apos;s fans will have regained their appetite for watching a side in navy blue.

I ask what motivated it. &quot;I thought it was important to continue to look at the way in which we tackle prostitution,&quot; she says, &quot;and we had not, until this point, looked at the impact demand has made on the sex industry.&quot; She explains that demand is one of the main reasons so many women are involved in the sex industry, including those who have been trafficked here to service the market. &quot;We need to send out a message to men and to society in general, that most women do not choose to be in prostitution, whereas the buyers have free choice.&quot;  The proposals follow a six-month governmental review of the demand side of the sex trade. It should soon be a criminal offence to pay for sex with someone who is controlled for another person&apos;s gain - and it will be no defence for buyers to claim that they were unaware that a person was trafficked, pimped, or debt-bonded to their drug dealer or landlord. Kerb crawlers will also be penalised more than they have been: police currently have few powers to deal with a kerb crawler on a first offence, but the expected new law will remove the need to prove repeat violations. Police will also be given powers to close premises associated with sexual exploitation.  An estimated 80,000 women are involved in street, escort and brothel prostitution in the UK. According to government statistics, 4,000 women and children have been trafficked into prostitution in the UK at any one time, but the police suggest the real figure is far higher - sources have found that at least 70% of women working in UK brothels are trafficked from places such as Africa, Asia and eastern Europe. The fact is that a thriving sex industry, left to operate largely without government or police interference, is naturally a green light for traffickers keen to make easy profits in a welcoming environment. The proposed new legislation has attracted both approving and angry attention from commentators, but one of the interesting aspects of this move is that it reflects an international trend. Lithuania and Finland both have laws similar to Britain&apos;s new approach, making it illegal to pay for sex with a trafficked woman. In Norway - where procuring, pimping and human trafficking are already illegal - the government is in the process of introducing legislation that will outlaw the buying of sex, but not the sale. This follows the lead set by Sweden, which criminalised all buying of sex almost 10 years ago, after a feminist campaign prompted by the suspected murder of a street prostitute called Catrine da Costa. The law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services in Sweden came into force in 1999 as part of the larger Violence Against Women Act, with the parliament defining prostitution as a serious form of male violence against women and children - harmful not only to the individuals involved, but also to society at large.  When this law was introduced, there were an estimated 2,500 women in prostitution in Sweden. Today there are around 500. And what is particularly impressive is that the number of women trafficked into Sweden is now between 200 and 500 a year - the lowest tally in Europe. Some anti-prostitution activists in the UK are disappointed that Smith has not followed Sweden and criminalised paying for sex in all circumstances. I ask why she has taken what might look like a half measure, and she cites a recent Mori poll which found that the majority of people do not support a blanket ban - but well over half agreed that paying for sex with a trafficked woman should be criminalised. &quot;It is best to go with the grain of public opinion,&quot; she says, &quot;rather than try to do something which may be met with resistance at this moment.&quot; Another country that has targeted punters is South Korea. Here, the move towards criminalisation began in 2002 after brothel fires in which 14 women died - it transpired that the brothel doors had been locked from the outside by pimps and were only ever opened to allow buyers entry. In 2004 the South Korean government criminalised the demand side of the sex trade, with punters facing a year in jail or a fine if caught paying for sex. This has massively reduced the sex trade in a country where prostitution once brought in an estimated $21bn a year - 4% of the gross domestic product. Now the red light areas are largely deserted, and bed spaces in the many government-funded refuges for former prostitutes are usually full. (The South Korean government has dedicated substantial resources to helping women leave the industry, something Britain has yet to do.) Even the Dutch - long notorious for their legalised brothels - are moving towards increased regulation of prostitution. For years, the story given by the Dutch was that legalising brothels had been a solution to the myriad problems associated with the sex industry. Then last year, Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen admitted that legalisation had been a failure. &quot;We want in part to reverse it,&quot; he said, &quot;especially with regard to the exploitation of women in the sex industry. Lately we&apos;ve received more and more signals that abuse still continues.&quot; Members of the UK government visited Amsterdam in 2007 as part of the demand review, and did not like what they found. &quot;Ministers came back clear that the problems of illegality and abuse are not solved by legalisation,&quot; says Smith. &quot;On the contrary, there were still problems with organised crime and trafficking.&quot; Many of the Amsterdam brothels where women pose in windows are now being closed by police, as are the street tolerance zones where men could once buy sex without threat of arrest.  As the Netherlands has found, legalisation doesn&apos;t seem to be the answer, and the reason for this international push towards criminalisation seems to stem, at least in part, from the experiences of other countries where the sex trade has been liberalised. In 1984, for instance, Victoria was the first Australian state to legalise prostitution, and the main arguments put forward for the move (including by pimps and brothel owners) were that this would sever prostitution from organised crime and make the trade much safer for the women involved. The reality does not match that early promise, as underlined by the occupational health and safety advice that is handed out to women by states that have legalised the trade. Women are advised to pretend they have a stomach upset if a buyer &quot;insists on anal sex without a condom&quot;; they are told to be careful when injecting local anaesthetic into their vagina, as it can mask more &quot;serious injuries&quot;. (The idea that anyone would inject anaesthetic into their vagina is a stark reminder of the trade&apos;s brutality.) Then there is the advice that women should &quot;learn basic self-defence&quot;, &quot;be aware some clients can be rough&quot; and that, when visiting a buyer&apos;s home, they should check for signs of a planned gang-rape, including loud music and too many cars in the drive. This suggests that legalisation has been far from successful in protecting women&apos;s health and safety, and there is also good evidence that it has failed to stop the illegal sex trade. There are about 400 legal brothels in Victoria, and far more illegal ones. This reflects the situation in Nevada, the only US state to legalise brothels, where the illegal prostitution industry is currently nine times larger than the legal one. The fact is that anywhere that liberalises prostitution quickly becomes a prime destination for punters - many more pimps will set up business there than are legally approved. In the UK, Smith is bracing herself for more criticism from those who consider the new laws part of a &quot;nanny state&quot; approach to government. One man wrote on this newspaper&apos;s website that he was so appalled at the legislation that he would never again &quot;vote for a female in ANY election, local or general&quot;. Smith laughs at this, and tells me that she believes she is doing the right thing. &quot;We are trying to get the vast majority of the law-abiding public to help protect vulnerable women,&quot; she says. &quot;I am willing to accept that there are women out there who say they have chosen to sell sex, but they are in the minority, and laws are there to protect the majority. In this case, the majority of women in prostitution want to get out, and suffer violence and exploitation. If there are women who have made a free choice, there are more who have had no choice.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday December 9 2008.

But this time, they hope it will be indestructible. The EU yesterday launched the prototype of Europeana, its bold project to digitise millions of books, artworks, manuscripts, maps, objects and films from the most important libraries, museums and archives, and provide them free to download from one website. The EU commission&apos;s head, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, called it a Renaissance moment, as Europe plans to outdo commercial search engines in the staggering scope of its collection. But demand for europeana.eu was so great that by 10.30am yesterday it had to be temporarily closed after crashing under 10m hits an hour. Last night, the site was still experiencing problems and was again taken offline. The project was born of a fear among European leaders and culture bosses that Google was dominating the web, with its Book Search project scanning millions of books from dozens of world libraries to boost its traffic. Europeana goes further by providing interactive content, audio and video, ranging from original texts of Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy and the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man, to footage of the fall of the Berlin wall or 1970s documentaries on the pornographic film market in France. The site will feature pieces such as the 1215 Magna Carta and a painting by Domenico di Michelino - Dante illuminating Florence with his Poem - as well as 80,000 broadcasts from French national archives, including footage from the first world war. But it will also offer audio pieces from the British Library, such as recordings of wildlife and every birdcall in Britain, as well as the complete range of dialects in the UK. Around 1,000 European national libraries, museums and institutions, including the Louvre and Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum, have contributed. &quot;It is unique,&quot; said Jill Cousins, Europeana&apos;s executive director. &quot;A search engine cannot do what we can. For example, a search [on Europeana] for Mozart brings together letters he wrote to his father, musical scores, and film and sound recordings of his music.&quot; She said she was grateful to Google for setting a precedent. &quot;Part of the reason our site exists is because Google Book Search kicked off a debate about the presence of European cultural heritage on the web. That allowed us to mobilise.&quot; One of the people most incensed by Google Book Search was the former French president Jacques Chirac, who started a race with the Anglo-Saxons to digitalise French content led by institutions such as the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France. France accounts for around a half of the content of the Europeana site, followed by Britain and the Netherlands. Other countries will slowly add more content. Currently there are around 2m items available, and the site is expected to reach 10m items by 2010. Stephen Bury, head of European and American collections at the British library, said: &quot;The reason the French have such a presence is the French government gave money to digitalise, which we never had. While we funded our digitalisation by collaborating with private bodies or higher education organisations, the French have more things digitalised than they can use. It was a political drive by the French.&quot; The site will reopen the question of whether governments should give more funding to ambitious plans to put books online. In 2009-2010 \u20ac69m (\u00a359m) in EU funds will be available for research on digital libraries. With 14 staff and at an annual cost of around \u20ac2.5m, Europeana is still in its early stages. Funding for online libraries can be daunting, even for private firms. Microsoft has abandoned its online library projects after digitalising around 750,000 works. Santiago de la Mora from Google&apos;s European office welcomed the Europeana launch, saying Google hoped to collaborate with it &quot;taking part in what could become the biggest technological leap in disseminating knowledge since Gutenberg invented the printing press&quot;. Last month Google agreed to pay $125m in a legal settlement with authors and major publishers so that readers can browse millions of copyrighted books online. Europeana, trying to avoid similar problems, will initially offer access mainly to items in the public domain. From Magna Carta to Mozart Vermeer Dutch collections have provided a large number of Vermeers, including Girl with a Pearl Earring, from the Mauritshuis in The Hague. The site will enable users to view the painting in the same, if not greater, detail than they could in a museum Magna Carta of 1215 Provided by the British Library Beethoven&apos;s 9th Symphony Germany provided the score as well as images of the composer.

The accent is more Essex than Essen, but no one seems to mind. After all, it belongs to Jamie Oliver, and this - Das Jamie Oliver Dinner (&quot;Ein kulinarisches Theater-Spektakel&quot;) - is his latest show. Premiering last night in a tent pitched by the side of a road in Frankfurt&apos;s exhibition district, Das Jamie Oliver Dinner is not actually Germany&apos;s answer to MasterChef. Instead, it is a rather curious, big-budget cabaret show endorsed by the 33-year-old chef, who has received a fat fee in return for making a tiny, pre-recorded cameo and allowing his name and face to be plastered on Warhol-style posters all over the city. It&apos;s all a long way from teaching young mums to cook in Rotherham. Ostensibly a pastiche of German cookery programmes, the show is part circus, part musical, part panto and part fan convention. Guests pay between \u20ac89 (\u00a375.34) and \u20ac129 for tickets to the 3\u00bd-hour show, which includes a four-course menu designed by Oliver, who is a huge star in Germany, where he has sold more than 2m cookbooks. It is quite a departure from the philanthropic work Oliver has been doing in Britain of late, sorting out Rotherham&apos;s eating habits and appearing in front of a select committee telling the government how to curb the nation&apos;s obesity crisis. &quot;He&apos;s very popular in Germany and when this was suggested, everyone thought it would be a fun way of bringing something different to the lovely audiences in Germany,&quot; said Peter Berry, Oliver&apos;s spokesman, when asked to explain the chef&apos;s involvement. &quot;He&apos;s involved in all aspects of the menu creation and ongoing consultation on the food side. He&apos;s also had input on the creative side,&quot; Berry added. But one fan attending a preview of Das Jamie Oliver Dinner in Frankfurt this week was disappointed at how little Oliver appeared to be involved. &quot;I love Jamie, I really love him,&quot; said Nicole Pittelkow, who attended with husband Eric. &quot;But if it&apos;s called Das Jamie Oliver Dinner you expect him to do more than just pop up a few times and read from a script. I do wonder how much creative control Jamie had over it. I really enjoyed the food, but the play was silly.&quot; The script for Das Jamie Oliver Dinner was written by Michael Kunze, who has written several German musicals. But according to the director, Karl-Heinz Helmschrot, Oliver was consulted, and insisted that a scene featuring the Queen was cut. &quot;I met Jamie three times, and he checked everything to make sure it was good for his image. He wanted to make sure it embodied his philosophy,&quot; said Helmschrot. But as he can&apos;t speak German, it is unclear quite how much Oliver understood when he attended last night&apos;s premiere alongside a score of German celebrities - and, curiously, Larry Hagman from Dallas. The idea for Das Jamie Oliver Dinner came from Matthias Hoffmann, a well-known German promoter, who has recently had a worldwide hit with the circus show Afrika! Afrika! Das Jamie Oliver Dinner is scheduled to run until May in Frankfurt, then move on to Hamburg. With the wages of nine actors, seven acrobats, a band, at least 15 waiters and a kitchen of chefs to pay (plus Oliver himself), it is an expensive show. The producers are hoping to do brisk business with office Christmas parties. Das Jamie Oliver Dinner is just one of the many projects Oliver is juggling. He has just signed up to design kitchens at a luxury development in Dubai, he is filming a show about travelling across America, and then there are his long-term projects - branches of his social enterprise restaurant, Fifteen, in London, Melbourne, Amsterdam and Cornwall and his Jamie&apos;s Italian chain.

Not my words, but those of Gramophone magazine, whose December edition is out today and contains a chart of the 20 finest symphony orchestras in the world - have a look at the complete list here.  There&apos;s a self-consciously international feel to the list, as well as the panel, with critics from the US, China, Korea and Europe. Alas, there is no other British representative in this pointless-but-fun pantheon. Should we be worried? Not really. Inevitably the list is as subjective as the panel&apos;s proclivities. The Saito Kinen Orchestra is at 19th, but no place for the resurgent London Philharmonic? The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra is 18th, but the Royal Opera House Orchestra - at least as good on its day - is nowhere.  On the international stage, the questions go on: is the Dresden Staatskapelle really almost twice as good as the Leipzig Gewandhaus (10th v 17th)? Should the New York Philharmonic be more highly-ranked than the San Francisco Symphony when Michael Tilson Thomas&apos;s reign in San Francisco has been infinitely more interesting than Lorin Maazel&apos;s at Lincoln Centre? And there&apos;s a definite American bias in the mid-range, as three US orchestras beat three Russian orchestras. Maybe that&apos;s just because there wasn&apos;t a Russian critic on the panel.  Of course, all this is idle interval chatter: most orchestras, on an inspired night with an inspired conductor, are capable of hitting revelatory heights of music-making. The reverse is true, too, as Wilhelm Sinkovicz, who writes for Die Presse in Austria, says of third-placed Vienna Philharmonic: they sound &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; when they&apos;re conducted by Valery Gergiev or Daniel Harding. Ouch. And they&apos;re really the third best?  Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw Orchestra is the &quot;winner&quot; of this orchestral beauty contest, but perhaps the real victor is conductor Mariss Jansons, who is in charge of two orchestras inside the top 10: the Concertgebouw and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, sixth on the list. The Bavarians are coming to the Southbank with Jansons next Saturday with Mozart and Bruckner - if it wasn&apos;t a hot-enough ticket already, it just got hotter.  A more interesting orchestral hall of fame would be a list of British orchestras, based not just on the relative glamour of various principal conductors, but how much the ensemble involves itself in the community.

Before De Kooning I had no real interest in art. Constable was for the top of cake tins and Warhol seemed no more than a competent graphic designer. I took a very literal view of art, whereas I found movies, music and books transformative \u2013 all of which would have been quite normal if I was 12-years-old, or even 17. But I wasn&apos;t: I was 25. I had managed to live a quarter of a century without art making any notable impression on me. And, to be honest, the circumstances which started this late journey were only brought about through ulterior motives. I had organised a weekend away in Amsterdam with my girlfriend and had drawn up what I thought was a pretty fun itinerary. I planned to sample the local speciality and nightlife, leaving the daytime as a recovery zone. It was a well-researched plan, one that I was hugely looking forward to implementing. Unbeknown to me, though, my girlfriend had other ideas. She wanted to visit Amsterdam&apos;s great museums, eat in good restaurants and \u2013 if time allowed \u2013 to go for a long walk \u2026 boring. This was a potential disaster that needed to be avoided. Cunningly, I suggested a compromise: one of her activities, followed by one of mine. I figured that once we had started on my itinerary there&apos;d be no going back, and for the sake of a little goodwill, there wasn&apos;t any harm in a quick museum visit. So, we went to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam&apos;s modern art gallery. As soon as I stepped over the threshold I got a nagging ache in my lower spine accompanied by uncontrollable yawning. By the time we had gone round the first gallery, I desperately needed a sit down. I sank heavy-legged on to a pine bench and wiped the tears of boredom from my cheeks. A frosty glare suggested that I was not making a very favourable impression with the girl. Feigning interest, I upped my game. We looked at a painting with yellow splodges that appeared to be a child&apos;s effort at a fried egg and I started to feel nauseous. My girlfriend liked it, though. She did that tilting your head thing you see art connoisseurs do.  I made a big deal of looking at it again for signs of poetic life. To be fair, it wasn&apos;t quite as bad as I had originally thought. There was a sumptuousness to the brushstrokes that was beguiling. The pink element was fabulously flesh-like and the white section in the middle had a roughness that hinted at sun shining through a broken cloud. It was also true that the more I looked at the painting, the more I saw in it. I continued to stare, but this time out of choice. It was actually very beautiful, and harmonious. I began to find it calming and a little sensual, warming, optimistic. The girlfriend had said it was like poetry. She was wrong: it was poetry.  I bent down to see who had painted this masterpiece. It was by Willem de Kooning and the work was called Rosy-Fingered Dawn at Louse Point. We spent the next four hours in the Stedelijk playing spot-the-De Kooning. Then, after lunch and on my insistence, we went back. I was on a mission. I wanted to know about this painterly genius and what had provoked him to such sublime heights.  Willlem de Kooning was born in Rotterdam in 1904. At the age of 12 he went to study at the Rotterdam Academy of Arts. In 1926, after a brief stint as a store sign-writer and art director, he left for America and settled in New York. De Kooning loved the freedom and excitement of New York, but saw it through the eyes of a man steeped in the traditional painting techniques of the Renaissance. He was also heavily influenced by the European masters from the generation before: Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and his fellow countryman, Vincent Van Gogh. And it was at this precise time, between the mid-20s and the late-60s, that the clash of cultures \u2013 between the flash, brash, America and the more earnest and genteel Europe \u2013 created the ingredients for one of the most important developments in the history of art. De Kooning was at the centre of it all. To begin with, the main protagonist was a Russian exile called Arshile Gorky, who had also found refuge and artistic sustenance in New York. Like De Kooning, Gorky was heavily influenced by the surrealist movement that had been created by Andr\u00e9 Breton in Paris. And like almost all artists of the time he studied the pioneering work of C\u00e9zanne, which had led Picasso and Braque on to cubism. De Kooning and Gorky wanted to take the figurative form beyond impressionism, beyond cubism and into total abstraction: to create paintings that felt like the subject, although the subject wasn&apos;t discernible. This meant combining the surrealists&apos; Freudian exploration into the unconscious with the painterly techniques of Monet, C\u00e9zanne, Picasso and Braque. The upshot of which was a starring role in the New York School. The New York School was the avant garde of the world. Its members included the Beat poets, the composer John Cage, choreographer Merce Cunningham and musicians such as Miles Davies, Stan Getz and John Coltrane. And at the centre of all this were a group of artists who came under the banner abstract expressionists. This was a group of New York artists \u2013 among them were Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Franz Kline and De Kooning - who had found a new way to paint that made no attempt to depict the subject, but aimed to communicate a feeling for a subject simply through the imaginative application of paint. And it worked. De Kooning&apos;s painting, Rosy-Fingered Dawn at Louse Point is as beautiful, evocative a landscape painting as I have ever seen, but there&apos;s not a tree or hill in sight. It makes no attempt to represent a real scene, merely to capture the feelings you might have when looking at such a scene. And this discovery and the subsequent journey to find out how such a painting came about, truly did change my life. The girlfriend is now my wife and my interest in art \u2013 dormant for so long \u2013 is now so great that I work for an art gallery.

That was 50 years ago when, after the publication of Dr Fredric Wertham&apos;s Seduction of the Innocent (which claimed children the world over were being corrupted by comics), the reputation of the comic book was at its lowest ebb.  Nowadays, try plagiarising Batman and you&apos;ll have an injunction from Warner Brothers the next morning. Go into a smart bookshop and ask for comics and you&apos;ll be directed to a stack of expensively produced works prominently displayed in shelves marked Graphic Novels.  Three of the most extraordinary films of the past six months have been animated movies, all doing something like justice to major themes. Only one of them, Wall-E, Pixar&apos;s SF comedy about global warming, is marketed as family entertainment. The other two are the work of film-makers from the Middle East: Iranian cartoonist Marjane Satrapi&apos;s superbly comic Persepolis, about growing up under the Shah and the ayatollahs, and Israeli documentarist Ari Folman&apos;s sombre Waltz With Bashir, a memoir about his experiences as an Israeli national service soldier during the 1982 incursion into Lebanon. Four years in the making, Waltz With Bashir was assembled as a live-action documentary based on interviews and newsreel footage. It was then transformed into an animated film with the assistance of a director of animation, Yoni Goodman, and an art director, David Polonsky. Instead of using the clumsy Rotoscope process by which the original images are painted over, a storyboard was created and broken down into 2,300 illustrations. The effect of this is that what would have been an intrusive variety of textures becomes graphically uniform so that interviews, battle scenes, dreams and hazy memories become part of the whole, all of it somehow surreal. The effect is gripping and hypnotic.  The movie opens with a nightmare - a pack of 26 fierce dogs running through the empty night streets heading for the home of Boaz, a former soldier. He relates this recurrent dream to Folman as a possible subject for a movie and its source is his time as a soldier. Because he refused to shoot people, Boaz was charged with killing dogs on the outskirts of Lebanese villages that warned Palestinian militants of the approaching Israelis. Now these animals have come back to haunt him.  What puzzles Folman is that he has no such dreams of the time 20 years earlier when he fought on the beaches of Lebanon and was part of the force that stood back in August 1982 while the Phalangist Christian militia massacred innocent Palestinians, including women and children, at the refugee camps at Sabra and Shatila. This was a savage revenge for the still unsolved assassination of Bashir Gemayel, their charismatic leader. Gemayel was Israel&apos;s principal ally in Lebanon and was playing a key role in the covert plan of Defence Minister Ariel Sharon to extend the front against Syria. The film is Folman&apos;s search for his past which he conducts through conversations with two psychiatrists, one his best friend, the other an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder, and with half-a-dozen fellow soldiers. His comrades in arms share their own nightmares and the guilt some of them bear. His friend Carmi, now living in Amsterdam where he&apos;s made a fortune selling falafels, recounts a dream he had aboard a boat before landing in Lebanon. A teenage virgin obsessed with proving his manhood, he&apos;s taken into the sea and comforted by a giant naked woman.  Others talk of the exhilarated feeling of driving tanks across the border and then their disenchantment when transporting comrades back to base in bodybags. There&apos;s an extraordinary story of the sole survivor of a tank crew swimming home down the coast, then feeling guilt as a deserter. In one bizarre incident, an Israeli officer, occupying a smart Lebanese apartment, gives an order to attack while watching a porn movie. In another, there is a tragic memory of a herd of fine Arab horses wounded and dying. One soldier, a natural leader, called Frankel, uses the pungent perfume patchouli so his platoon can recognise his position during night raids and it is he who provides the film&apos;s title in an image of the madness of war. During the street fighting in Beirut when his men are pinned down by snipers, he seizes a machine gun and waltzes in the night street, seemingly invulnerable to the enemies&apos; bullets, with a gigantic poster of Bashir behind him.  Gradually, the film edges towards the massacres. How much did the national leaders know? We see Begin and Sharon eating hearty breakfasts on balconies back home while the men struggle at the front. There are reports from eyewitnesses that go unheeded. What we have here are atrocities comparable with many on the Eastern Front in the Second World War that form part of the Holocaust and, eventually, after Israel&apos;s General Amos intervenes, the slaughter ends. Only then does Folman abandon animation. For a few final minutes, we see grainy newsreel footage of the massacre victims. The effect is devastating.  The inquiry into the massacres found Sharon guilty of gross neglect of duty and the committee ordered that he should never serve as Defence Minister. Two decades later, he became Prime Minister. But we must note that a similar inquiry could not have taken place in any Arab country, nor a film like Ari Folman&apos;s be made there.", "sentences": ["His friend Carmi, now living in Amsterdam where he&apos;s made a fortune selling falafels, recounts a dream he had aboard a boat before landing in Lebanon."], "title": "Film review: Waltz With Bashit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/23/waltz-with-bashir-review", "tags": ["Animation", "Film", "Culture", "Waltz With Bashir"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-23T00:01:00Z", "article": "Returning home from the cinema after Zack and Miri Make a Porno last week, I looked up the reviews online. I never read them in advance; in theory, they help you decide what to see, but if the critics say something&apos;s brilliant, then you&apos;ll only be disappointed. I suspect that the elderly couple sitting next to me for Zack and Miri hadn&apos;t read anything about it either. When the lights went up after 100 minutes of anal sex, flying excrement and more C-words than you&apos;d find in volume three of the OED, they wore the expressions you might see on the faces of two people who were sitting comfortably in their living room when a lorry ploughed through the wall. With Fred West at the wheel. Clutching one of their grandchildren. I doubt the old couple rushed home and fired up their MacBooks to see if Philip French had enjoyed it. They seemed content for their Zack and Miri journey to end there. Besides, they were probably hungry; their popcorn had been placed quietly aside during the &apos;rear entry is a great cure for constipation&apos; sequence. But I went off to Google Peter Bradshaw, who summarised the plot thus: &apos;[Seth] Rogen plays Zack, the goofy loser who improbably lives with his platonic best friend, played by Elizabeth Banks... desperate for cash, they hit on an idea: they will make a porn film together, using funding improbably borrowed...&apos; Hang on, what&apos;s with all the improbables, already? Doesn&apos;t everyone make a porn film with their platonic best friend? I know I did. This movie plunged me back into 2002 when my mate Charlie and I borrowed some money, ran away to Amsterdam and made a skinflick. Our experience differed slightly from what happens in this Hollywood version. Zack and Miri have no trouble finding experienced porn actors; we ended up casting a florist, a law student and the man who came to fix my internet connection. Zack and Miri have no problems (ethical or technical) in getting immediate humping on camera; our male lead was too nervous to perform, our female lead had cystitis and four of our minor characters got stuck in a traffic jam near Groningen and never turned up. Zack and Miri seem able to pay the cast, shoot the film and edit the rushes for the price of a flat-screen TV; we had to fund ours by selling a whole book about it (which, I hope you don&apos;t mind my pointing out, is still available on Amazon at a very reasonable price, plenty of jokes and not nearly as rude as you&apos;d think). We ended up giving all the book revenue away to our actors; we may be the only people in history who went into the sex trade in order to earn less money for greater job satisfaction. Also, Zack and Miri make their own costumes, while we bought ours from the Cancer Research shop on Balham High Street. Broadly speaking, though, I found nothing implausible in the concept, because I&apos;ve done it. What I absolutely don&apos;t buy is the relationship between Zack and Miri. It is an interesting sign of where we are culturally that, even in a dirty slacker comedy, with a modern reliance on the possibilities of digicams and websites, and a modern moral framework where no qualms are applied (or even raised) to the principle of buying and broadcasting sex, the main characters still have to fall in love at the end. That is the one rule they will not break. This is a film that fights with incomprehensible ferocity to throw out &apos;old-fashioned&apos; ideas like social conscience, gentle language, interpersonal ethics and sexual privacy, but still insists on delivering a twee, conservative, simplistic, neatly tied-up love story in which Man And Woman Are Together So Everything&apos;s Fine. They&apos;ve kept the exasperating theory of When Harry Met Sally, but lost all the nice bits. For the first half hour, I was delighted to see something extremely unusual in cinema: a true reflection of a platonic relationship between male and female. Zack and Miri are unflirtatious, frank, teasing, totally sexless with each other. Mainstream culture would have us believe that such a thing is impossible between heterosexuals, but it isn&apos;t. It can be the most rewarding friendship there is. At last, I thought. That is what my relationship with Charlie is like; that is why boyfriends have never needed to be suspicious; that is how male/female friendships can be, rather than the ghastly &apos;sex always gets in the way&apos; theory, as if we were all animals and had to start sniffing at anything that may lead to an impregnation. Hurray for a positive reflection of platonic friends. And then... what&apos;s happening? Zack and Miri are having sex in their own blue movie? (Charlie and my directorial cameos were restricted to the sound of me, off-camera, making myself a cup of tea during a sex scene, which should answer the two key questions: &apos;Is making porn an erotic thing to do?&apos; and: &apos;Did you have enough money for a sound edit?&apos;) And now they are falling in love and staying together for ever? I kicked the seat in front of me, terrifying the old couple even more. For all that this film pretends to show sex workers in a kindly light, they remain &apos;the Other&apos;: recreational sex, and long-term singledom, is restricted to these comical bit players; it&apos;s not good enough for our heroes. The hookers, strippers and porn stars can stay alone, but the people we care about must be married off. And to each other. Because men and women can&apos;t be friends: a hoary old motto, still propounded even in a film that wants so desperately to be radical. Well, that&apos;s nonsense. My best friend married somebody else and it was a very happy ending. victoriacoren.com", "sentences": ["This movie plunged me back into 2002 when my mate Charlie and I borrowed some money, ran away to Amsterdam and made a skinflick."], "title": "It certainly wasn't like this when I made a porn movie", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/23/victoria-coren", "tags": ["Pornography", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-24T16:23:45Z", "article": "     Cache Deluxe and K-Liber: Het Is Tijd When I was 15 I got a pair of Stanton STR8-80 turntables which had three speed settings: 33, 45 and 78 rpm. For the first few months I couldn&apos;t have had less of a clue how to use them - I don&apos;t think I had even heard of beat matching - so I would spend my time aimlessly speeding up and slowing down dancehall seven-inches. I would start by putting on, say, an Elephant Man 45 at 33 rpm so his voice became a demonic drawl before quickly flicking a switch to speed the record up to 78 rpm so it sounded like he&apos;d suddenly turned into a tiny mouse with helium balloons for lungs, and repeat the same routine over and over until the song ended. (No, I didn&apos;t have many friends.) To my surprise I recently found that there is a type of music that was built on this exact same principle. Well, kind of. The Dutch genre of bubbling began in 1988 when Moortje, a DJ from Curacao (one of the islands in the Dutch Antilles), accidentally played a track on a dancehall LP at 45 rpm instead of 33 in Club Voltage. Rather than booing and shouting the Dutch equivalent of Oi! It&apos;s all gone Pete Tong, mate&quot;, the crowd loved what they heard. Inspired by this moment, Moortje started making beats with sped-up ragga vocal loops, percussion influenced by traditional Antillean tambu music and rave-esque synths. The result was something not too far away from early jungle. Initially this new sound was well received, but there were some objectors. &quot;There is a story that Cutty Ranks visited the Escape Club in Amsterdam and heard DJ Moortje playing one of his songs but got mad because it was too fast,&quot; says Griff who runs dutchreggae.blogspot.com. Moortje often played live alongside MCs Pester and Pret, who were also instrumental in the early progression of the bubbling scene. To begin with, the content of the lyrics was often quite sexual and the dance moves associated with the music reflected this. MC Pester&apos;s song Balia Sanka (Shake Your Ass) gave its name to a regular party at Club Voltage where girls would win money for their provocative dancing. Owing to Moortje&apos;s Antillean roots, the music quickly spread back to his homeland. But MCs such as Pester had anti-establishment lyrics and spoke out about the government, so police in Curacao would seize and destroy any bubbling tapes they found. The scene was also held back in Holland by club violence associated with the genre - it got so bad that Moortje was banned from performing in certain cities. &quot;The bubbling scene is almost dead these days in the Netherlands,&quot; says Leon Rodrigues, who has a YouTube channel devoted to bubbling classics by people such as DJ Sharief. Latin America&apos;s similar-sounding reggaeton has pretty much taken its place, but there are still a few clubs where you can hear bubbling - Club Hollywood in Rotterdam and Club Voltage in the Hague. Plus, now and then there are songs which break through to the mainstream in the Netherlands, such as Viben by Antillean group K-Liber. Last month Diplo commissioned a bubbling mix for his highly influential Mad Decent podcast series. Could this spark a mini-renaissance (that will last no longer than a few months)?

The state-owned rail group has pulled its long-promised stockmarket float of a 24.99% state in its passenger and freight/logistics business. This was due to go ahead in late October and raise up to \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.25bn): with equal thirds of the proceeds going to the federal budget, the network of track, signals and stations and &quot;future growth&quot;. The planned IPO was always controversial, not least because it came with prospective bonuses for the DB executive team headed by Hartmut Mehdorn, and because it was heavily opposed by members of Transnet, the main rail union. The union, which is shedding its pro-privatisation general secretary, reaffirmed this at its congress this week. But DB, which wants to become top dog when the EU market for passenger services is fully liberalised in 2010 and overtake France&apos;s state-owned SNCF, is undaunted. It knows it has perhaps just six or seven months to revive the IPO next year. There are federal elections in September and much uncertainty about the outcome, notably for the deeply divided grand coalition of centre-right CDU and centre-left SPD. The political scene in Germany is frozen \u2013 and the capital markets even more so in the unfolding financial and economic crisis. The worst recession since 1993 is taking hold. But Hedderich insists DB&apos;s business model remains intact and forecasts a small increase in passenger traffic next year as the car and aviation markets slump. At most he can envisage a 1% decline on the rails. Even so, nobody outside DB&apos;s headquarters near the Potsdamer Platz believes the float will go ahead next year. So Mehdorn and his team have developed an alternative strategy and claim the backing of chancellor Angela Merkel and her CDU, attracting capital from sovereign wealth funds in an initial stage. Mehdorn has spoken about DB being &quot;an ice-breaker&quot; in a Germany highly wary of state-controlled foreign investors. Andreas Hamprecht, head of international business at DB Long-distance, insisted during a high-speed ICE journey from Hanover to Berlin that talks with funds in the Middle East, Russia, China and elsewhere in the Far East, including Singapore, have gone down well. &quot;It gives us the perspective of fulfilling our growth strategy,&quot; he said. Hedderich added that much less than the 25% equity stake in the &quot;mobility and logistics&quot; business for sale in the IPO was on offer, with no single investor offered more than 10% and, most likely, no more than 5%. It could be the Saudis, for instance, as they&apos;re planning enormous investments in rail and need European (preferably German) expert help. But there&apos;s considerable scepticism about the wisdom of accepting capital from state-owned Russian Railways even though Hedderich insisted no investor was excluded a priori. DB is working with the Russians on speeding up journey times on the 20-day rail transit for container trains from China to Hamburg, an expansionist project already used by PC-makers Fujitsu Siemens and designed to offer a cheaper, more eco-friendly service than sea or air freight. Hedderich suggested DB could, in a second stage of its capital raising, return to the postponed IPO. Either way, the group wants to raise capital rather than increase its \u20ac15bn debt to finance its expansion, including in the UK, France and eastern Europe. DB paid around \u00a3130m in January for Chiltern Railways, which operates services from London to Birmingham and Aylesbury, after previously buying freight company EWS. It has half of the new service to Shropshire and Wrexham and 50% of Lorol, the above-ground former North London Line expanding to the east. Executives made plain that the Chiltern acquisition was a springboard to bidding for more franchises when they become available, probably including the west coast mainline operated by Virgin. There&apos;s even the distant possibility of running ICE trains through the Channel tunnel in competition with Eurostar, but that would require huge investment in compatible traction, safety and security controls at German stations. What is certain is that EWS, which already runs a pilot freight service from Wembley to Cologne, is the front-line force for an assault against SNCF in France&apos;s freight market. Axel Marschall, an executive vice-president at DB Schenker, the freight and logistics business, said the goal was to capture up to 25% of the French market. Through its holding in Spanish freight operator Transfesa, DB plans to dominate the north-south European axis from Britain \u2014 and Denmark/Sweden \u2014 to Spain. We&apos;re witnessing a new front in the Franco-German battle for supremacy in Europe&apos;s rail network.

The French film journal Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma proclaimed the 100 best films of all time. How many British films got in? None. Not a single one was thought worthy of being in the top one hundred. What an outrage. What an injustice. Who were these nincompoops whose views were canvassed when this insulting list was devised? There were, I discovered, 78 of them, every one of them a film critic or historian. Oh, I nearly forgot, all of them were French. That explains it. An anglophobic conspiracy to deny Britain its rightful place in cinematic excellence. Then I studied the list. Not bad, I thought. They hadn&apos;t, after all, packed it with French films. On the contrary. If anything, they had included too many American films (more than 40, including five by Charlie Chaplin and three by Alfred Hitchcock, both of whom are English, as was Charles Laughton, director of the film that came joint second, The Night of the Hunter). What I particularly liked about the conservative list was that it contained very few recent films. The top 20 - led by Citizen Kane - had all been made by 1963.  Then I thought about the British films that should have been included, fighting for a place against other omissions, as well as the chosen 100. The Third Man, certainly. Some might demand Lawrence of Arabia, though not me. I haven&apos;t finished my search for others, but I&apos;ve already decided that there wasn&apos;t a French conspiracy after all.  The other British setback was handed out by Gramophone magazine&apos;s list of the 20 best symphony orchestras. No excuses this time: there were three British critics - the largest national representation - among the 11 who chose. Only the London Symphony Orchestra, in fourth place, made the list. There were seven American orchestras in the 20, which seems excessively generous; only two of the judging critics came from there. The top three were Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw, Berlin (under Rattle, an Englishman) and Vienna, a perfectly reasonable order. It seems as if the British judges might just have been honest about their choices instead of flying the flag. It won&apos;t do. How else can the British get high up on all these &quot;best&quot; lists, unless British judges play the game and put their country before fair play?  I live very near an area where young people wearing brightly coloured anoraks and carrying clipboards urge passersby to sign up to give money to a charity. It&apos;s on a busy shopping street, with a wide pavement and an overhanging building providing shelter from the rain, and I used to be importuned whenever I ventured there. No longer. I have developed a special look - part Godfather, part Mandelson - that I use only when walking down that block, which confers total immunity from being approached. It&apos;s not that I have had any bad experiences with chuggers (an unfair and unwarrantedly pejorative term - charity plus muggers - which I will not use again), just that politely saying &quot;no&quot; took up too much of my time. This week the organisation Intelligent Giving urged a boycott of such street persuaders, after its survey had shown that many of them didn&apos;t reveal that they were paid commission on what they raised or that they didn&apos;t seem to know much about the charity they were supposedly representing, or were over-insistent in their manner. The extent of their shortcomings has been challenged by charities satisfied with their work but, whatever the true picture, boycotts are surely not the answer.  In particular, a spokesman for Intelligent Giving urged people to donate their money directly to the charity, online, instead of signing up on the street. But people won&apos;t. Even if they&apos;re impressed by the charity&apos;s work after their street chat, they will get home with their enthusiasm faded; most will not get around to giving their donation. Besides, how will the young persuaders make their money if no one takes up their offer to sign on the spot? Bright anoraks and clipboards will disappear. How will that help the charities? I confess I was unaware quite how important street fundraising was to some charities - a quarter of Shelter&apos;s income, for instance. All the more reason, especially in these straitened times, for them to be free to find donors in whatever way they can. By all means try to ensure that those who raise money in the streets conform to the law and a code of conduct. But the call for a boycott can only harm charities already facing difficult years ahead.  Walter Bagehot wrote it all - in 1859. There isn&apos;t a word that doesn&apos;t apply today. &quot;At particular times a great deal of stupid people have a great deal of stupid money ... At intervals ... the money of these people ... is particularly large and craving; it seeks for someone to devour it, and there is a &apos;plethora&apos;; it finds someone, and there is &apos;speculation&apos;; it is devoured, and there is &apos;panic&apos;.&quot; And then this timely lesson: &quot;Each separate panic has had its own distinctive features, but all have resembled each other in occurring immediately after a period of apparent prosperity, the hollowness of which it has exposed. So uniform is this sequence, that whenever we find ourselves under circumstances that enable the acquisition of rapid fortunes, otherwise than by the road of plodding industry, we may almost be justified in auguring that the time for panic is at hand.&quot; \u2022 This week Marcel went to Leonard Cohen&apos;s concert at London&apos;s Royal Albert Hall: &quot;I have never been a great fan of his gloom, but I have to admit that the 74-year-old delivered an electric performance; three hours on stage, not a suicidal thought in sight.&quot; He saw Agn\u00e8s Jaoui&apos;s film Let&apos;s Talk About the Rain: &quot;A witty, wry, quirky French comedy of manners.&quot;", "sentences": ["The top three were Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw, Berlin (under Rattle, an Englishman) and Vienna, a perfectly reasonable order."], "title": "Marcel Berlins: A list of the best 100 films, without a single British movie - is there an anglophobic conspiracy?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/26/features-comment-films", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-26T23:06:50Z", "article": "When he was asked to nominate his favourite goal, Steven Gerrard chose not the thunderous, edge-of-the box drive that helped Liverpool win the FA Cup but the kind of close-range header that he buried against Marseille. It came in the Ataturk Stadium on the night in which Rafael Ben\u00edtez was propelled into immortality and marked the start of a comeback in the European Cup final that even at a distance of three years appears extraordinary. Without that victory over Milan, it is impossible to believe that Ben\u00edtez would enjoy the kind of fervent backing that he received in the wake of Marseille&apos;s 1-0 victory here at Anfield last year that made it seem unlikely Liverpool would qualify from the group stages and triggered the decision by the club&apos;s owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, to interview J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann chose Bayern Munich and but for John Arne Riise&apos;s own-goal in the final moments against Chelsea, Liverpool would have reached their third European Cup final under Ben\u00edtez. Here, they qualified for the knockout phases without having dominated any game bar the 3-1 defeat of PSV Eindhoven. Even if Gerrard had not won the stoppage-time penalty against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid that led to the Swedish referee, Martin Hansson, receiving death threats, Liverpool would still have qualified with a game to spare. But for his European successes, Ben\u00edtez would probably already have left Anfield and, even were he still in office, the Spaniard would not have been regarded as an improvement on G\u00e9rard Houllier&apos;s regime. And yet even when Gerrard scored for the 30th time Europe last night, it still felt slightly anti-climactic because, however hard the Kop chant about their five European Cups, this year it is the thoughts of a first championship since Kenny Dalglish ruled this ground that consumes Liverpool. The game was not killed off and Marseille left Merseyside deserving something more than an honourable defeat. In the wake of the crisis created by Marseille&apos;s victory last year at Anfield, heightened by the 2-1 defeat by Besiktas that followed it, Liverpool supporters literally took to the streets in support of Ben\u00edtez, carrying a portrait of their manager like an icon to the Paisley Gateway before they faced Porto. Last night&apos;s laboured defeat of Marseille equalled the 39 European victories earned by Liverpool under Bob Paisley, whose achievements Ben\u00edtez is hardly likely to emulate, and was his 66th game in Europe, surpassing the number of games they played in Europe under Bill Shankly. Although he is revered, although photographs of him are sold like icons on Anfield Road, the glory of the European Cup never touched Shankly as it caressed Jock Stein and Matt Busby, managers like him hewn from the Scottish coalfields. When in Lisbon, in the wake of Celtic&apos;s triumph of 1967, he turned to Stein and said &quot;John, you&apos;re immortal now&quot; there was a touch of regret in his voice. Had Liverpool not been, in his eyes, cheated out of their semi-final by Internazionale two years before, he not Stein would have become the first British manager to win the European Cup. He was never to go remotely close again. Liverpool&apos;s 5-1 disembowelling by Ajax in a fog-bound Amsterdam in December 1966, is remembered for his quip to a reporter that: &quot;They&apos;re the most defensive bloody team we&apos;ve ever played, son.&quot; His last chance of the trophy disappeared in 1973 with a slapdash, casual defeat at Anfield by Red Star Belgrade. The previous round had seen them stutter to a 1-1 draw with Jeunesse Esch of Luxembourg. Those who believe Shankly did no wrong \u2014 and that is most of the red half of Merseyside \u2014 would point to his winning of the Uefa Cup, Liverpool&apos;s first European trophy, and the fact that in those naive, faraway days, it was considered necessary to have won your own championship before you were allowed to compete for the European Champion Clubs&apos; Cup. By that definition, Liverpool would not have played for the trophy since the Heysel disaster, although had the top four in the old First Division been eligible for a Champions League in Shankly&apos;s day, Liverpool would have failed to qualify in five of his 12 top-flight seasons at Anfield. When Liverpool under Paisley dominated European football it was believed, most notably by Shankly, that this was merely a continuation of his predecessor&apos;s work. History suggests otherwise. Chelsea&apos;s qualification hopes in the balance Meanwhile, Chelsea stuttered to a 1-1 draw with Bordeaux in France and will go into the final round of group games still unsure of qualification. Despite his media-savvy persona and his side&apos;s impressive Premier League performances Luiz Felipe Scolari has yet to mould Chelsea into a Champions League force and they now lie second to Roma in Group A. It will take a set of unthinkable results to stop Chelsea&apos;s passage into the next round, but Scolari still has a long way to go if he is to replicate last season&apos;s run to the final.", "sentences": ["Liverpool&apos;s 5-1 disembowelling by Ajax in a fog-bound Amsterdam in December 1966, is remembered for his quip to a reporter that: &quot;They&apos;re the most defensive bloody team we&apos;ve ever played, son.&quot; His last chance of the trophy disappeared in 1973 with a slapdash, casual defeat at Anfield by Red Star Belgrade."], "title": "Champions League: Liverpool make hard work of qualification but Chelsea forced to wait", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/nov/26/liverpool", "tags": ["Champions League 2008-09", "Champions League", "Chelsea", "Liverpool", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-11-27T12:51:28Z", "article": "THE QUESTION How does Michelin rate the Benelux countries?

The 23-year-old made his international comeback in last week&apos;s friendly against Argentina, playing the full 90 minutes at Hampden Park. Hutton had also been back in action for Spurs for the last month after missing the start of the Premier League season with the same injury. The return of one of his key players had been regarded as a major boost for the Scotland manager, who will now have to rethink his preparations for the visit to Amsterdam having taken just four points from their first three games. &quot;This is obviously very bad news for Alan, his club and for Scotland,&quot; said Burley. &quot;When he was coming back from the injury the last time, we kept in touch with him throughout his rehabilitation and it was great to have him back for the Argentina match. It&apos;s a massive blow for us that he looks like he will need an operation. He&apos;s a big player for us and we wish him a speedy recovery.&quot; Steven Whittaker is determined to hold on to his place in the Rangers team for this weekend&apos;s trip to Hearts. The Ibrox utility man admits, however, that he would be happier if he did not have to remain in the left-back position. The 24-year-old has filled the role in the last two weeks in the absence of the injured Sasa Papac, who is back in contention for the Premier League clash at Tynecastle. Whittaker, who can also play in midfield, is now hoping his versatility will work to his advantage and allow him to remain in Walter Smith&apos;s plans. &quot;With the strength of the squad it is taking a player to be injured for others to get their chance so when you are called upon you have to do your best,&quot; he said. &quot;I have recovered from injury and I have kept my head down. I have now managed to play a couple of games in a row and hopefully I can go on a run now and manage to stay in the team. Playing left-back is a position I can fill in. It&apos;s not one of my favourite positions. I prefer to be on the other side of the pitch but I&apos;m just happy to be in the starting XI.&quot; Rangers head into the weekend action trailing Celtic by four points in the title race and well aware that any further slip-ups could prove costly. &quot;Hearts are going well at the moment so we are expecting a tough game,&quot; said Whittaker. It&apos;s always difficult there and we will need to take our best game with us and hopefully come away with three points. Hearts gave us a tough game at Ibrox earlier this season and I&apos;m sure it will be equally testing at Tynecastle. We played well the last time we were there. Hearts couldn&apos;t handle the pace we played at that day and hopefully it&apos;s the same this weekend.&quot; Marseille&apos;s left-back Taye Taiwo, meanwhile, claims that Manchester City are one of a host of English clubs looking to sign him. The Nigeria international has been linked with a move away from Marseille all year and City, who are expected to spend extravagantly in the January transfer window, are believed to have been tracking the defender for a while. He insists that he is happy at the Mediterranean side but claims he has been the subject of a number of inquiries, especially from English teams. &quot;I know a lot of clubs, notably English ones, are following me,&quot; the 23-year-old said in L&apos;Equipe. &quot;Manchester City? Yes, that is a club who would like me, like other clubs I have heard about here and there. But once again, it is up to the directors at OM to decide.

But we Russians have always got money hidden away somewhere, often in the refrigerator,&quot; Aivazov said, strolling off to look at designer skis. Nearby was a stand selling Gulfstream private jets; around the corner a property company was offering a private island. Other items on sale included an 18-metre yacht at \u00a31m. Welcome to Moscow&apos;s millionaire fair - a luxury goods and entertainment event in a giant exhibition hall on the edge of the capital. The fair is a sort of one-stop supermarket for the super-rich, where you can simultaneously purchase a beachside villa and a helicopter to take you there. The problem this year is that Russia&apos;s \u00fcber-wealthy have fallen on hard times. Since the summer, the country&apos;s economy has been badly hit by the global economic crisis. The rouble has taken a battering, while the Russian stock market has fallen by more than 70%.  Suddenly the country that redefined the word oligarch is feeling the pinch. This month Russia&apos;s richest man, Oleg Deripaska, was forced to borrow $4.5bn from the state to pay his debts. Other capitalist frontrunners are rumoured to be down to their last $100m. And instead of buying a new Aston Martin (on sale here for 11,637,795 roubles, or \u00a3260,000), Aivazov yesterday bought himself a lawnmower - albeit an expensive one. &quot;It cost $4,000,&quot; he said.  Like most male visitors to the show, Aivazov was wearing a tuxedo. Nearby, young women were pouring Laurent Perrier champagne while hanging upside down from a hoop. Being a millionaire - there are at least 103,000 of them across Russia - gets you a free invitation. Non-millionaires can visit if they stump up $64 for a ticket, and put on a suitable frock.  Many of those who turned up to Thursday&apos;s opening gala were young, attractive, female, and wearing cocktail dresses. Though not millionaires themselves, it appeared they were quite keen to meet some. &quot;I&apos;m not looking for a rich husband. I&apos;m looking for someone with a big personality,&quot; said Irina, 26, photographing her friend Olga in an Aston Martin. After a few seconds of reflection she conceded: &quot;Obviously if he was an oligarch with a big personality that would be OK.&quot; More than 200 brands are represented at the fair, ranging from a German dental clinic to a sculptor selling bronze female nudes. For \u20ac12m you could buy a helicopter with a Versace interior. Other items include Iranian silk carpets and a diamond-encrusted laptop. A Dutch entrepreneur, Yves Gijrath, founded the event, which is now in its fourth year in Moscow and also takes place in Amsterdam and Shanghai. According to Gijrath, Russians have a more prodigal attitude to money than many Europeans.  &quot;Russian customers like to buy, like to live and like to spend,&quot; he said. The Russian economy was &quot;stronger than ever&quot;, he insisted. Over the past eight years Russians have experienced unprecedented economic growth under former president Vladimir Putin. While most have seen only a modest increase in their prosperity, a few have become dazzlingly rich. This spring Russia had 110 billionaires, more than any other country apart from the US. Since then, however, the price of Russia&apos;s main export, oil, has collapsed. There is now a growing fear that the country could be lurching towards a repeat of the 1998 crash, which saw the rouble devalued and the savings of millions of ordinary Russians wiped out overnight. At the yacht display, Yevgeny Kochman was taking potential customers on a tour of a sleek white Princess yacht. The boat, made in Plymouth, looked like a dinky penthouse, complete with plasma TVs, comfy double beds and a kitchenette. The only thing missing was a British politician. Given the dreadful state of relations between London and the Kremlin, though, wouldn&apos;t Russians be wary of buying anything British? &quot;The politics is bad, yes,&quot; said Kochman. &quot;But among normal people it&apos;s fine. We buy your yachts and you buy our gas.&quot; Roman Abramovich had bought a boat from the British firm Nordmarine, he pointed out - although &quot;that was a long time ago.

A search of the boot revealed not the contraband that might have been expected - drugs or smuggled cigarettes, perhaps - but the body of a small child, and a shovel. Savanna was three years old, but weighed only 10kg, as a one-year-old might. She was severely undernourished, and covered in bruises. It was later established that she had probably died the day before, when her mother, Sonja de J, then 32, stuffed her mouth with a washcloth and taped it over. Savanna had a cold and couldn&apos;t breathe through her nose. She suffocated.  The lines that the case then followed will, post-Victoria Climbi\u00e9, post-Baby P, be familiar. Stories began to appear in the Dutch papers about a little girl from Alphen aan den Rijn, a small city near The Hague. Neighbours, friends and family spoke of ongoing abuse. The girl got hardly any food, they said. She was tied to a bed, she was hit, she was forced to have cold showers. Everyone was worried. So worried that they asked social services to intervene. In fact, the family had been in close contact with social services for a long time. It emerged that Sonja de J&apos;s two older children (born in 1992 and 1993) were already in care. A younger baby was taken away after Savanna was found. Savanna herself was put on the child protection register when she was 11 months old. A family guardian - a specialist social worker - was appointed and visited the family regularly.  In April 2002 the then one-year-old Savanna was taken away from her mother and placed into temporary care. According to the Dutch newspaper Trouw, which went through the child protection reports, she was malnourished and neglected, and the mother was refusing to accept the advice of youth welfare services. But in July, Savanna was returned to her mother. Why, exactly, remains unclear. Then the guardian fell ill, so in November 2002 another guardian, Mieke A, was appointed. According to her lawyer, Simeon Burmeister, she visited every two weeks, and reviewed the case more often than that. Sometimes she visited in her spare time, &quot;because she felt that the family was a real problem. But not as bad as they turned out to be&quot;. Then, in May 2004, the new baby was born. In the Netherlands, a maternity nurse, or kraamverzorgster, is assigned to a family and helps out all day, for the first eight days. The nurse who went to see Sonja de J was alarmed by the way she was treating Savanna. The child seemed to be kept in her room all the time, and wasn&apos;t eating properly. She seemed bruised and cowed. So the kraamverzorgster raised the alarm. In fact, several professionals involved with the children raised their concerns and reported suspected abuse. They were not, however, aware that there was a family guardian because she had never been in touch. Information obtained by the public prosecutor indicates that legal measures were immediately put in place, on May 14 2004, to take Savanna into care. However, Mieke A (who was 46 at the time, so not a novice), decided that this wasn&apos;t necessary and overruled them; a paediatrician who visited in July concurred. Two months later Savanna was dead. On October 4, 350 people marched silently through Alphen aan den Rijn in her memory.  For the first time in the history of Dutch law, a guardian was charged in criminal court. Initially, says her lawyer, the charge was accessory to murder; at the last minute this was changed to negligence leading to grievous bodily harm. She should have listened to others more, said the prosecution; she should have picked up the signs that things were going horribly wrong. They did not ask for a prison sentence but for a suspended sentence of 150 hours of &quot;work punishment&quot;. &quot;The prosecutor tried to argue that there was a deal between mother and guardian to kill the child,&quot; says Burmeister. &quot;The guardian did her work, but actions like this can always happen. She could not have known - she only had two hours every second week to visit the family. In these two hours they have to see everything. Maybe she didn&apos;t do her work very well but in Holland that&apos;s not a criminal offence.&quot; During the trial, a picture emerged of a care worker who was too ready to listen to the mother. Sonja de J was known to have a borderline personality disorder - and although the guardian knew this, she seems not to have taken sufficient notice of it. But under such circumstances it would have been difficult to extrapolate a norm from brief meetings; Sonja de J could, presumably, often be quite charming. Mieke A was interrogated by the police for six days. She was charged on March 18 2005, and was finally brought to what would become an enormously high-profile trial on May 31 2007. She was acquitted on November 16, 2007, three years after Savanna died. The court decided the death was not the guardian&apos;s fault and that she did work hard for the family. However, the judge censured her for believing her own findings to be more important than anyone else&apos;s. Sonja de J was sentenced to six years in prison for manslaughter, while her boyfriend, Mario B, got two years for GBH. When they finish their sentences, they will be transferred to a secure psychiatric unit on an order that lasts until the doctors say the inmate can be released back into society. It can be indefinite.  Childcare services in the Netherlands now recognise two periods: before Savanna, and after Savanna. As with Victoria Climbi\u00e9, as will be with Baby P, the aftermath is rarely as simple as imprisonment for the perpetrators. It reverberates through systems, through countries, through professions, and through the lives of vulnerable children all over the country. In the Netherlands the first evidence of a Savanna effect was a spike in the numbers of children being put on to child protection registers, or into care. As there are 15 different regional jurisdictions, there are no reliable national figures. Estimates based on anecdotal evidence veer from 5% to 40%, but Arne Theunissen, who began his career as a guardian, and is now a researcher in the department of clinical child studies at the Free University of Amsterdam, also points to the figures for Amsterdam, the largest agency in Holland. In 2004, 1,620 children were taken into care; in 2005, after Savanna, there were 2,891, an almost 75% increase. (There is also a growing demand for foster parents. According to a spokesperson for the Dutch Organisation for Foster Parents, there were 14,000 Dutch foster children in 2002 and 20,000 in 2007 - a 30% increase. &quot;Many people say it&apos;s because of the Savanna effect,&quot; said the spokesperson, who declined to be named. &quot;It could be. But it&apos;s more complicated than that, it has to do with the difficulties of being foster parents.&quot;) In Britain, says Kieron Hatton, head of the Centre for Social Work at the University of Portsmouth, the trend was already going that way. The Climbi\u00e9 case simply &quot;reinforced a trend towards risk-aversion in social work caused by inquiries over previous years. Social work in the UK is quite risk-averse - in fact, it&apos;s too risk-averse.&quot; As for Baby P, the Observer reported last week that there had been as much as a three-fold increase in applications for child protection orders in the previous fortnight. Where the Inner London Court would normally expect to receive between two and three applications a day for children to be placed in care, staff said they were receiving between eight and 10 applications a day. According to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), there was a 26.4% increase in applications for all forms of child protection orders made between November 10 and November 20 across England this year, compared with the same period in 2007. Usually a case like this has a mostly local effect, says Anthony Douglas, chief executive of Cafcass. This time,&quot;There is some sign of a genuine national effect, and all local authorities are reviewing their cases, and putting in early applications when they hadn&apos;t before.&quot; Jos Aalders is a volunteer ombudsman for children in the Netherlands. He can be controversial (rather like members of Fathers4Justice, he has been known to dress up as Zorro) but he is nevertheless trusted by countless families, who contact him with complaints about children and the social services. He says that these have risen by about 30%. &quot;The trend has become that it is better to place a child into care then to take any risk whatsoever. And since complaints about abuse can be anonymous and come from anyone, children are taken away too soon in some cases. There is a case at the moment of a baby that was taken from his parents the day after the birth. The parents have very low IQs but they take care of themselves, work, have friends and family to help them. They did not even get a chance to do it right, the child was taken away immediately. I think that&apos;s typical of what is going on in child services.&quot; Mirjam, 36, who worked as a family guardian in a city near Amsterdam for 10 years before resigning a couple of months ago, agrees. (She wouldn&apos;t give her last name or place of work; she was unusual, however, in that she is willing to talk.) &quot;I felt there was a lot of fear in how people acted in the months afterwards. Everyone was so afraid it could happen on their watch. Cases proceeded faster; children would be put on the child protection register sooner. And for a while there would be a request every Friday to go and get a child that needed to be taken away from their parents before the weekend.&quot; It wasn&apos;t just the guardians. Everyone was being more careful, starting with the person reporting abuse, through to the agency registering the complaints and the guardian&apos;s employers.  &quot;Better safe than sorry is the trend now,&quot; says Ton Moolenaar, a social worker for 30 years who now chairs a group for youth welfare workers. &quot;And children aren&apos;t placed back with their parents as easily as before.&quot; He points out that the large spike in numbers seems to be over. But other &quot;Savanna effects&quot; have endured. &quot;For one thing, the emphasis on the safety of the child is more than it was before. We used to work with a threefold principle: try to intervene as little as possible, try to get children back home as soon as possible and try to let them stay near their homes when they are temporarily taken into care. Only after all of that would we start actually taking a kid away from home and really placing them into care.&quot; (Because state care is not necessarily the best solution; in fact, Hatton says bluntly, of the UK, &quot;our care system isn&apos;t that great. The outcomes in other countries, such as Denmark and Germany, are much better.&quot; ) &quot;Because of this,&quot; continues Moolenaar, &quot;there are more safety precautions. We have to fill in long lists about the parents, the children, the interaction between the parents and between the parents and the children, which are then reviewed by behavioural scientists. It is very formal and has lead to a bigger workload. The underlying principle is fine though, it is all about the safety of the child.&quot; But, as happened with the Climbi\u00e9 case, where new computer systems meant social workers spent more time staring at a screen than visiting clients, and were progressively being robbed of independent judgment, these new requirements have unintended consequences. According to the spokeswoman for the Dutch Organisation for Foster Parents, welfare workers now &quot;check and double-check everything, have to put it past the team, can&apos;t confirm anything. And even though being careful is good, this means the children who are already in a very difficult situation have even more insecurity. They don&apos;t know what will happen to them and because social services don&apos;t dare to decide, they are left in limbo for longer.&quot; The second major factor was the chilling effect the criminal trial had on guardians, who could not believe that things could come to that. &quot;I, and many colleagues, protested in Utrecht,&quot; says Piet Bleeker, 34, who has worked as a family guardian for five years in Friesland, in the north of the Netherlands.&quot;It was a horrendous incident, but criminal prosecution for mistakes made in your job is quite disturbing. We did not want to be seen as criminals. I sat in the court during the case and it was horrible. The guardian got the blame for everything, while so many others were involved. I do understand it; she was the one responsible for placing Savanna in care or not in the end. But it was still hard to watch. Afterwards I ran through all my own cases in my mind. What child could be at risk, where did I have even the remotest doubt?&quot; It was already difficult to find people willing to work as family guardians, but the prosecution, and vituperative media coverage of it, made it much harder. Sarah, 25, a social worker from Zwolle, was in training during the case. &quot;The negative attention did get to us at school. You read about a case like this in the paper and it&apos;s about life and death. Plus the fact that the social worker was brought to court. As a 22-year-old you don&apos;t easily choose to go into that field. We discussed it often and me and my friends were just more reluctant to specialise as family guardians.&quot; A similar thing has happened here in the UK over the past few weeks. &quot;We&apos;ve had to do quite a lot of work with students to talk them through it,&quot; says Hatton, who blames the singling-out of social workers in media reports in particular. &quot;We try to help the students understand that once they go into practice they&apos;ll be encouraged to enhance their training, that really people who are newly qualified shouldn&apos;t be working on very complex child protection cases.&quot; The problem is though, as he well knows, that there are so many vacancies, and such large caseloads, that this is often inevitable - which, of course, increases the chances of naive or bad decisions, and the cycle starting again. Since Savanna, the Netherlands has put various safeguards in place, many of which could be instructive here too. According to Jos Andriessen of the MOgroep, an umbrella agency for the 15 separate youth welfare agencies, there are to be fewer children assigned to each guardian; 15-17 by halfway through next year, down from 25. Decisions must be made by a team, rather by individuals. Risk-analysis is now a priority. There is now a 24-hour crisis number that people can ring. By 2010 there should be disciplinary board for social workers, so incidents can be referred there, instead of to the criminal courts. Agencies are cooperating more effectively and are clearer about each other&apos;s responsibilities. However, Theunissen believes they could go further. At the moment, the decision to remove a child from its family is overseen by a judge. He believes that the same rigour should be applied to the decision not to remove a child because &quot;the decision to do nothing is as important as the decision to do something&quot;. In the UK, Douglas believes that in the most serious cases, where social workers are concerned but unable to prove anything, it should be possible to turn to methods used by the police - hidden cameras, for example. &quot;It&apos;s a high-risk decision, because lots of organisations would cite human rights issues. But without identifying real dangerousness you won&apos;t get anywhere.&quot; But in the end, as Theunissen puts it, &quot;however professional you are, you can never be sure what&apos;s going on in the night, behind the doors&quot;. It does not help to demonise those whose job it is to find out - rather, there should be collective investigations, collective decisions, and an earned trust, in the idealism of those who work with the most vulnerable children in society. &quot;I never doubted my job,&quot; says Bleeker. &quot;I never wanted to quit. I don&apos;t know many people who did. There is a lot of bad publicity; I still get it sometimes, people being almost aggressive when you say where you work. Then I take a deep breath and I sit down to explain my work to them. There is so much good in it, but we can&apos;t talk about cases, everything is confidential, so it&apos;s hard to explain. People in this field can&apos;t let it go easily. You can&apos;t just quit and leave your 15 cases&quot;.", "sentences": ["Estimates based on anecdotal evidence veer from 5% to 40%, but Arne Theunissen, who began his career as a guardian, and is now a researcher in the department of clinical child studies at the Free University of Amsterdam, also points to the figures for Amsterdam, the largest agency in Holland.", "I think that&apos;s typical of what is going on in child services.&quot; Mirjam, 36, who worked as a family guardian in a city near Amsterdam for 10 years before resigning a couple of months ago, agrees."], "title": "After Savanna: The child protection case that rocked the Netherlands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/dec/01/child-protection-baby-p-netherlands", "tags": ["Child protection", "Netherlands", "Society", "World news", "Baby P", "London", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-01T11:33:09Z", "article": "Ten unsigned bands will be given the opportunity to tour major US stadiums next year as part of the community site Sellaband&apos;s &quot;live social networking&quot; venture. The Netherlands-based music site invites fans to invest in new, unsigned bands and when they reach $50,000 [\u00a333,000] in funding, the bands can record an album with professional producers. Previous Sellaband artists have worked with Tony Platt, producer of AC/DC&apos;s Back in Black and the former Kate Bush producer Haydn Bendall. So far 29 bands and musicians - including Japanese heavy metal artists and Argentine singer-songwriters - have recorded albums through investment on the site so far, equivalent to one a month since it launched in 2006. Along with a website relaunch and new incentives for the site&apos;s users, Sellaband has partnered the US stadium management firm ArenaFest on a tour described as &quot;live social networking&quot;, combining gaming, dating, sports, modelling contests and live music. &quot;These are very large arenas that very few artists could fill on their own,&quot; said the Sellaband chief executive, Johan Vosmeijer, adding that the initiative was not about making money.  &quot;Once a band has managed to fund their album, market and distribute it, they ask: &apos;Now what?&apos; What they need is to get out there and tour it, so what is the best way to do that?&quot; he added. Vosmeijer, a former Sony BMG executive, said there would be 180 slots for Sellaband musicians during the US tour next summer, divided between 10 bands to be chosen through a competition on the site from today.  The tour will be funded by half a dozen sponsors, including the city council of Amsterdam. Vosmeijer said that although the tour was a big financial undertaking, the site would not be threatened by the economic downturn. &quot;We think there will always be a demand for toys and for entertainment. This is not something we decided to do overnight - this is is well prepared and well funded, so the only uncertainty is the bands. That&apos;s quite limiting - playing in front of 10,000 people is not for everyone,&quot; he added. Bands can make their money via the Sellaband site when they raise enough to record an album and then begin to sell it, taking home, after costs, around $2.50 per unit sold.  Sellaband also takes $2.50 from each sale of an album, which are sold through mainstream music download sites including Amazon in the UK, but does not take any advertising. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

If you find that Facebook is becoming less about how you manage a complicated social life, and more the only social life you have, don&apos;t, whatever you do, make this obvious. Image is everything. So let&apos;s start with your chosen picture. Cute as it is to have you as a baby, this may be cuter than some potential friends can handle. And don&apos;t overdo the sultry sex bomb, or mad party animal look either - unless you really are one, and then remember to change it when you revert to faithful and studious, sometime in year two. Then there&apos;s the number of friends question. Too many and it looks like you&apos;re showing off, too few and it looks like you&apos;re a loser. Mike Thelwall, professor of information science at the University of Wolverhampton, suggests aiming for around 100 and trying to keep below 300. And think about the games you play and the groups you join. Signing up for the group &quot;Pitbulls Rock&quot; will give one impression, &quot;Soft Toys are Kool&quot; another. Decide who you are hoping to impress and choose accordingly. While it&apos;s rarely true that lecturers and future employers comb the sites to catch out students who&apos;ve lied about their sudden pre-assignment illness or sober lifestyle, you can&apos;t be too careful. Check your privacy settings, and be as discreet as possible about your alcohol intake. And while employers may restrain their nosiness, potential love interests certainly won&apos;t, so don&apos;t boast too enthusiastically about your conquests. Bear in mind that your ex is likely to be keeping a close eye on your movements too, through friends&apos; profiles if not your own. You also need to be sensitive about what you write on other people&apos;s walls. Resist reminiscing about your friend&apos;s forgotten weekend in Amsterdam, especially if he&apos;s included his mother among his Facebook friends. Incidentally, if you think that telling your parents to track what you&apos;re up to through Facebook will save you ever actually having to talk to them, bear in mind that you will still have to see them at Christmas. Also, they may have rather more to discuss with you than before they became Facebook addicts. On the other hand, don&apos;t get too paranoid about who might be watching. Don&apos;t treat your Facebook profile as a permanent covering letter. If you find yourself writing about your plans &quot;going forward&quot;, stop. In fact, it&apos;s worth having a bit of a think about language. If most of your friends are using textspeak, you&apos;ll look an oddball if you insist on perfect grammar and footnotes. Don&apos;t just use Facebook for social purposes. It can be a useful way of conducting discussions about your academic work, and of helping you settle into university, so it&apos;s worth exploring all the groups related to your institution or subject. Asking round-robin questions of all your Facebook friends can also be invaluable. However, don&apos;t kid yourself that you&apos;re working just because you&apos;re staring at a screen and you&apos;ve got a document open somewhere. Be realistic about the amount of time you spend browsing through the friends of your boyfriend&apos;s ex. Finally, resist getting so obsessed with a particular site that you fail to realise when it&apos;s time to move on, and that all the really cool people are busy social networking somewhere completely different.", "sentences": ["Resist reminiscing about your friend&apos;s forgotten weekend in Amsterdam, especially if he&apos;s included his mother among his Facebook friends."], "title": "How to be a student: The art of using Facebook", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/dec/02/student-using-facebook", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Education", "Social networking", "Technology", "Facebook", "Media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-03T12:09:14Z", "article": "Guido van der Werve has been described as the love child of German romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich and the Dutch conceptualist Bas Jan Ader. He has that northern European preoccupation with isolation, sadness and introspection, compounded by an absurd sense of humour.  His films are sonnets to alienation. The sublime Everything is Going to be Alright depicts the artist trudging through a frozen wilderness dogged by a vast icebreaker ship that splinters the ice like rice paper. It is the heroic futility of this act that puts us in mind of Ader, in particular that last tragic voyage in search of the miraculous that led him to a watery grave.  Van der Werve is not afraid of romance in the way so many conceptual artists are. He immerses his viewers in duende \u2013 that eerie, inexplicable sadness at the heart of certain works of art \u2013 before gracefully re-introducing reality through slapstick. It is not surprising to learn the artist is a fan of Leonard Cohen, who can sing about lonesome heroes and beautiful losers in that smoky rumble while flipping dry one-liners. Van der Werve originally trained as a classical pianist at the Rotterdam Conservatoire, and he credits his ability to manipulate our emotions to his classical music education.  In his film Nummer zes: Steinway grand piano, wake me up to go to sleep and all the colours of the rainbow, the opening shot is of a night sky, which is revealed to be the dirt on Van der Werve&apos;s kitchen floor. It is a metaphor we cling to, as a surreal Pythonesque narrative unfolds featuring a Steinway grand piano craned through a second storey window into Van der Werve&apos;s tiny kitchen in Amsterdam. Once inside he plays Chopin&apos;s Piano Concerto No.1 in E minor Op.11, accompanied by an orchestra and watched by a select audience. When the performance is over, the piano is removed, and all that is left is an empty room with a rainbow shimmering on the wall, leaving us with the disconcerting sensation that the entire scenario was imagined.  Why we like him? It&apos;s hard to choose a single example - all of his films are mesmerising, but perhaps the most simple is Nummer negen, The day I didn&apos;t turn with the world, in which he stands on the axis of the Earth at the north pole, and turns counter clockwise to the Earth&apos;s rotation. As a study in futility, it&apos;s up there with the best of them. We are family: Van der Werve wanted to avoid following in the footsteps of his artist father and brother, planning instead to become an industrial designer. This changed in 1998 when he went to study at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam.

But all that may be about to change. As part of a major &apos;clean-up&apos; of the city centre, the local authorities yesterday unveiled plans to close half of the brothels and the little coffee shops where cannabis can be bought and smoked, prompting warnings that they will cost the city dear as visitors head elsewhere.  Although prostitution has been legal for eight years, and possession of small amounts of drugs has long been tolerated, the latest moves mark an escalation in the culture wars in a country that many of its people believe has become too liberal. At the heart of the new initiative is the city&apos;s drive against the organised crime that it claims gravitates to the areas with high concentrations of &apos;coffee shops&apos;, brothels and the &apos;windows&apos; where women advertise themselves. While Amsterdam has long been held up as a model of the argument in favour of the legalisation of soft drugs and the sex trade, its critics counter that the windows and coffee shops mask the violent reality of organised crime. &apos;By reduction and zoning of these kinds of functions, we will be able to manage and tackle the criminal infrastructure better,&apos; the city said in a statement. Opponents of the clean-up - including coffee-shop owners and the prostitutes&apos; union, De Rode Draad (Red Thread), which represents 20,000 Dutch prostitutes - told The Observer yesterday that they believed that, far from reducing crime, it would encourage drug dealers and prostitutes to go underground in areas where they were banned. They also warned that the new clampdown on drugs and the sex industry would have a profound effect on the economics of a city famous for both things. &apos;Amsterdam is the city of sex and drugs and rock &apos;n&apos; roll,&apos; said Metje Blaak, a spokeswoman for De Rode Draad, which provides health screening and other training for its members.  &apos;Now we have no sex. No drugs. The women will go on the streets and to the hotels. It is very bad, not least in terms of women&apos;s health and safety. The mayor has not listened to the women or the coffee shops,&apos; she added. She also blamed the European Union for pressurising Holland into tightening its laws. &apos;Once we were a free country,&apos; she said. &apos;Now they tell us what to do.&apos; Prostitution will now be permitted in only two areas, including De Wallen (The Walls) - a web of streets and alleys around the city&apos;s medieval retaining dam walls. The area has been a centre of prostitution since before the city&apos;s golden shipping age in the 17th century. The city said yesterday it would offer retraining to prostitutes and coffee-shop employees who lost their jobs. &apos;Money laundering, extortion and human trafficking are things you do not see, but they are hurting people and the city. The new reality will be more in line with our image as a tolerant and crazy place, rather than a free zone for criminals,&apos; said Alderman Lodewijk Asscher, one of the main proponents of the plan. &apos;We can still have sex and drugs, but in a way that shows the city is in control. &apos;It&apos;ll be a place with 200 windows and 30 coffee shops, which you can&apos;t find anywhere else in the world - very exciting, but also with cultural attractions. You won&apos;t have to be embarrassed to say you came,&apos; he said. Merlijn Boshuizen of Plan A, one of the biggest organisers of stag and hen trips to the city, is not convinced. &apos;We have had 7,000 people, mainly from the UK and Ireland, this year. This is won&apos;t be good for tourism. People come here because of the drugs and the windows.&apos;  The coffee-shop owners and workers are as sceptical of the new clampdown as De Rode Draad and Boshuizen. Although cannabis is technically illegal in the Netherlands, prosecutors do not press charges for possession of small amounts and the coffee shops are able to sell it openly. However, in the last year, authorities in Amsterdam and elsewhere have subjected the coffee shops to ever-more stringent checks. &apos;Marco&apos;, owner of the Rastababy Caf\u00e9 in Prins Hendrikkade, near the city&apos;s Centraal Station, said yesterday: &apos;It is really shitty. We want to make money and they want to close us down. The city will lose money. People come here for the coffee shops. To smoke.&apos; The same dismay was evident at the Reefer Caf\u00e9 in St Antoniesbreestraat, not far from the Rembrandt Museum, where patrons can buy a pre-rolled &apos;White Widow&apos; spliff for \u20ac3, or a muffin laced with skunk resin.  \u2022 Additional reporting by Mimis Chrysomallis in Amsterdam.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam has long been famed for its relaxed approach to prostitution and soft drugs, making the Dutch city one of the most popular destinations for tens of thousands of Britons on stag and hen parties.", "While Amsterdam has long been held up as a model of the argument in favour of the legalisation of soft drugs and the sex trade, its critics counter that the windows and coffee shops mask the violent reality of organised crime.", "&apos;Amsterdam is the city of sex and drugs and rock &apos;n&apos; roll,&apos; said Metje Blaak, a spokeswoman for De Rode Draad, which provides health screening and other training for its members.", "However, in the last year, authorities in Amsterdam and elsewhere have subjected the coffee shops to ever-more stringent checks.", "\u2022 Additional reporting by Mimis Chrysomallis in Amsterdam."], "title": "Amsterdam's brothels and cannabis caf\u00e9s furious over mayor's 'clean-up'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/07/amsterdam-crackdown-prostitution-drugs-crime", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Amsterdam holidays", "World news", "Travel", "Organised crime", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-07T00:01:00Z", "article": "The decision last week by Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon to delay a ruling on Heathrow&apos;s third runway until early in 2009 has been cited as evidence of a possible government retreat from the project.

Anti-runway adherents today include many backbench Labour MPs and ministers, including Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and the Conservative party. All have made it clear they believe that a third Heathrow runway and the resulting expansion of Britain&apos;s aviation industry do not represent sensible use of resources. Mr Hoon should spend his festive season in careful contemplation of these views. Heading the arguments he will study is the simple issue of the government&apos;s commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions in Britain by 80 per cent by the year 2050. It is one of the most ambitious goals set by a Western nation in tackling climate change and the government deserves praise for establishing that target. But it will not be easily reached. It will require a radical programme of wave and wind turbine construction, nuclear industry expansion and the building of underground vaults to store the carbon dioxide that currently pours from the nation&apos;s coal, oil and gas power plants. New eco-friendly houses will have to be built and cutbacks made in the driving of standard, petrol-burning cars. Every source of carbon dioxide in this country will have to be scrutinised and curtailed where possible. Margins will be tight and the burning of aviation fuel cannot be exempt from this process. As campaigners have pointed out, between 1990 and 2005, a period in which the rest of Britain achieved cuts in emissions, those from aviation fuel doubled. Meanwhile, the government predicts UK air passenger numbers will rise from 180 million to 475 million by 2030, triggering further increases in aviation fuel emissions. The go-ahead for a third Heathrow runway would alone see a rise in numbers of planes taking off from the airport from 480,000 to 700,000 a year. The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research recently warned that, left unchecked, this sort of expansion will see aviation fuel account for almost all the nation&apos;s permitted carbon output by the year 2050.  In other words, our cars, homes, factories and power plants will all have to become carbon neutral just to accommodate the aviation industry&apos;s desire for unbridled expansion. This is simply unacceptable. The burden of carbon reduction must be shared evenly. The government must therefore acknowledge the inevitable and set limits on the burning of aviation fuel. It must also abandon Heathrow&apos;s third runway. Business lobbyists will argue this decision will let airports in Amsterdam and Paris expand as international hubs at London&apos;s expense. The construction industry will bemoan a major loss of jobs at a time of recession. Neither argument is convincing. Airport expansions in France and Holland are not assured as these countries consider their own climate policies, while other civic construction projects - high-speed rail, for example - are far worthier of government investment than the expansion of Heathrow. Most important of all, Britain&apos;s aspiration to play a leading role in the fight against global warming would be sabotaged if it were seen by others to be refusing to place limits on its own aviation industry.

Then she vanished. For 36 years she made no further public appearances - until last week when, in the furtherance of some cheap political point-scoring during an education debate at Croydon council, a Labour member thought it might be amusing to reveal that Councillor Maria Gatland, the Tories&apos; education chief, had once been known as Maria McGuire and had written a book called To Take Arms: A Year in the Provisional IRA I suppose Maria McGuire&apos;s journey from elfin Irish rebel, then defector and courageous whistleblower, to Councillor Gatland from leafy Selsdon started in the August of 1971. At the beginning of that month, Edward Heath&apos;s government had used the Special Powers Act to introduce internment without trial in Northern Ireland, rounding up 342 people suspected of supporting terrorism. Now the Provos were claiming that the British had netted little of its hard core and that outrage over internment had resulted in a wave of fresh volunteers to their colours. Furthermore, many were not from &apos;traditional republican backgrounds&apos;. The Observer news desk asked me to see if there was anything in it. IRA operations in the North were still, nominally at least, being directed from Dublin. In command were men in shiny suits who had been hibernating there since 1962 when their last campaign, five years of regular attacks on British police and customs posts along the Republic&apos;s meandering frontier with the Six Counties, had failed to shift the border a single inch. One of these introduced me to the eldest daughter of a Dublin civil servant who sprang from a neat semi in genteel Churchtown. She was, he said, an example of the new middle-class volunteers, though he had the grace to admit that they were still a bit thin on the ground. Maria McGuire was 23 years old, a petite young woman with a Spanish style about her hair and clothes, and a stomach ulcer for which she was being treated at a small private hospital, in whose grounds we met. She seemed a little young for this complaint. &apos;Highly strung?&apos; I wrote in my notebook. Later, I learnt that before she passed her finals in English literature at University College Dublin, she had made a convincing effort to kill herself and been saved by blood transfusions and a stomach pump. There was no tradition of militant republicanism in her family. Unlike most Provisionals, she was not a practising Catholic. Apart from Irish politics, her main interests seemed to be languages - she spoke French and Spanish - and theatre. As a student, she had helped out at Dublin&apos;s Abbey Theatre.  She had spent the last three years in Spain, where she had learnt the language well enough to start a diploma course in psychology. In Madrid, she had belonged to a mostly British amateur theatre company and was briefly married to one of its members.  During the early Seventies, most people of her age and background would have opted for the Official IRA, the revolutionary socialist rump left after the IRA split in 1969. But when McGuire returned from Spain she was determined to join the Provisionals, whose theoretical agenda for a reformed, united Ireland she felt was more realistic than &apos;workers of the world, unite&apos;. Even so, miniskirted and sometimes hot-panted, she confessed that some of the old guard were not that impressed. &apos;Somebody asked me what a dolly bird was doing with them - was I bored?&apos; She told me she was mainly working &apos;on the information side&apos; and helping to set up a pirate radio station. Before I left she allowed me to take her photograph, sitting demurely on a bench in the hospital grounds. Considering her new commitments, this, to say the least, was silly of her. The picture was not used immediately. But a few weeks later I took it to Amsterdam to confirm with hotel staff the identity of the companion of Fifties veteran David O&apos;Connell, who had been attempting to smuggle Czech arms into Ireland through Schiphol airport. After a tip-off, the crated weapons - more than 60 automatic rifles, four handheld anti-tank rockets and 500 grenades - had been discovered before the pair had time to transfer them to Rotterdam and a ship bound for Ireland.  The Troubles were in their third year, this was the biggest gun-running attempt to date, and the British put considerable pressure on the Dutch to catch O&apos;Connell. Yet, holding hands with McGuire, he managed to walk through a huge police dragnet. &apos;There&apos;s always a good explanation if there&apos;s a pretty girl,&apos; a weary detective told me when I showed him the picture.  Back in Dublin, McGuire discovered there was more interest in her personal relationship with the married O&apos;Connell than the lost weapons and she had to give a press conference denying they were anything other than comrades in arms. To her relief most of the reporters - &apos;being good Irish boys&apos; - were too embarrassed to ask any questions. Although we had unmasked her as O&apos;Connell&apos;s companion, The Observer&apos;s relations with McGuire, who sometimes gave reporters off-the-record briefings on internal republican politics, remained cordial. She settled back into her Dublin role - though, having been identified as an active Provo volunteer, she now carried a gun in her handbag, a fact I did not know at the time. But it did sometimes occur to me that there was a theatrical element about it all, that she might be enjoying her notoriety. Certainly the Amsterdam business had given her status. She was closer than ever to what was emerging as the moderate wing of the Provos&apos; Dublin hierarchy: David O&apos;Connell (although they ended their affair), and the O&apos;Bradaigh brothers, Ruari and Sean. The only one she did not get on with was the most important, the strange half-Englishman - his mother was from Belfast - John Stephenson, who had done his national service in the RAF and his time in Wormwood Scrubs, where he changed his name to Sean MacStiofain and learnt the Gaelic.  In theory, MacStiofain was head of the Provisional IRA, its chief of staff, and the ultimate controller of its resources. In practice, the tail was wagging the dog. If MacStiofain wanted to stay in power, he had to please the young men in the North who were doing the fighting; the emerging leaders such as Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams. In 1972 they regarded compromise and peace talks as betrayal and were beginning to believe they could bomb the British and its loyalist minority into submission. Civilian casualties were mounting. &apos;What does it matter if Protestants are killed? They&apos;re all bigots, aren&apos;t they?&apos; thundered MacStiofain at one Army Council meeting. For McGuire, sickened by the almost nightly slaughter on the nine o&apos;clock news, this was the last straw. She had long realised that MacStiofain had outmanoeuvred O&apos;Connell and the O&apos;Bradaighs. At one point she tried to persuade them to assassinate him. By the summer of 1972, following the breakdown of a ceasefire that lasted for all of 17 days, she had decided to drop out of the Provisional IRA. In August, when I returned to London from Belfast where I covered the city&apos;s Bloody Friday bombings which killed another 11 civilians, I discovered a brief note from Maria McGuire. It had been posted three weeks earlier in Madrid, where she gone for a few days&apos; rest. It suggested a chat in Dublin the next time I was over.  I booked a seat on the next plane. But before I left I told David Astor, then The Observer&apos;s editor and proprietor, what I thought was going to happen. He agreed to talk to William Whitelaw, then Northern Ireland Secretary, to see if he would arrange police protection and guarantee that no charges would be levelled against her. The last was quite easy because she had never committed any criminal offences in the UK. She had never asked for money, but it was agreed that we would pay a fee for the story. Once she made the decision to defect, she was calmer about it than I was. The worst moment came on our way to the airport when we stopped at a remote country inn from where I was trying to contact David Astor through a slow switchboard. When I returned to the bar I discovered my scoop was engaged in conversation with John Kelly, a well-known Belfast Provo. After some desultory conversation about Belfast politics, he left, but I was shaken. Were we being followed? Was this a desperate signal from her old friends? Don&apos;t do it, Maria. She was carrying her Walther 7.65 automatic in her handbag. She used to hide it in her mother&apos;s laundry basket in Churchtown. Girls with guns make strong pictures and I had persuaded her to pose with it, carefully removing its magazine, for I didn&apos;t trust Maria&apos;s weapon-handling skills. She had certainly never fired a shot in anger. There were no airport metal detectors in those days, but just in case Astor&apos;s charm had not entirely worked with Whitelaw I did not want to give the police an excuse to hold her. So Maria gave me the magazine and dumped the gun in the sanitary bin in the ladies&apos; lavatory. Ten days later, the first of the articles - which I helped her to write, although they were by no means entirely ghosted - appeared in The Observer A few months later, her book was published by Macmillan in London and New York. Most of it had gone through the pen of Peter Gilman, a Sunday Times journalist who introduced her to Mervyn Gatland, a Croydon businessman involved in local politics. At the time of his death, four years ago, he had been her husband for almost 30 years. They did not have any children.  As we speak, she walks her two rescue dogs - there&apos;s a cat, too - and is heartened by the support she has received from supporters. The Surrey woods are unlikely to close over her quite so thickly a second time and, although there has been a ceasefire in Ireland for some time, the spotlight is obviously unsettling, the ignorance of people who have not read her book breathtaking.  &apos;I was so naive,&apos; she told me in the brogue which, like her first name, she has never bothered to lose. &apos;But when you&apos;re young, you think you can change things.&apos;", "sentences": ["But a few weeks later I took it to Amsterdam to confirm with hotel staff the identity of the companion of Fifties veteran David O&apos;Connell, who had been attempting to smuggle Czech arms into Ireland through Schiphol airport.", "Certainly the Amsterdam business had given her status."], "title": "How I brought the Provos' girl with a gun in from the cold", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/07/ira-northern-ireland-conservatives", "tags": ["Conservatives", "Northern Irish politics", "Northern Ireland", "Politics", "UK news", "IRA"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-08T00:01:00Z", "article": "Ambrose Zephyr is 50 and happily married to a woman with the equally unlikely name of Zappora Ashkenazi.

Honda has appointed W&amp;K Amsterdam, following a five-way pitch, to work across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Russia.  The agency&apos;s first task in a wider, long-term strategy is to launch a new hybrid car, the Honda Insight, across Europe with a major TV, press and digital ad campaign in the new year. W&amp;K London, which started working with Honda in 2002, has created a string of award-winning TV commercials including &quot;Cog&quot;, &quot;Choir&quot; and &quot;Impossible Dream&quot;, as well as print ads such as &quot;Banana&quot; and &quot;Perfume&quot;. The agency was also responsible for the TV ad &quot;Grrr&quot;, featuring an animated eco-friendly diesel engine and the jingle &quot;Hate something, change something&quot;, and &quot;Sense&quot;, which showed lights dimming and brightening as a car drives past to dramatise a hybrid model. &quot;Where we want to be by 2015 is the environmental leader. I mean that in a credible sense, not a greenwash sense,&quot; said Chris Brown, the head of marketing for Honda Motor Europe. The car industry is facing increasing pressure to take more responsibility for its impact on the environment, with the European Parliament considering proposals including making manufacturers companies dedicate 20% of their advertising to tobacco-style warnings about CO2 emissions. In the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority has been on a crusade to stamp out misleading eco-claims in the increasing number of environmentally themed ads being run by car manufacturers. Brown said that he would accept some form of eco-rating system being introduced for car advertising. Such a system already exists for washing machines and white goods to rate efficiency. &quot;We would have no problem with that [a system], anything that makes life easier for the consumer has to be good. We may take the lead and take some of these ideas on board. People still want four wheels, it is up to us to work out a solution,&quot; he added. Brown said that Honda had run a multi-region pitch for the ad account because it was the best way to establish the company&apos;s eco-credentials in the long term across different markets and a wide product range. &quot;We want to change the conversation [about eco-ads] completely. At the moment everything is heavy-handed, preachy and overwhelming. We want it to be positive, optimistic, joyful, powerful,&quot; he added. Lee Newman, managing director of W&amp;K Amsterdam, said: &quot;In a lot of ways this [new eco-marketing project] will be a continuation of what Honda has always been about. &quot;In terms of capturing a spirit of the campaign we are looking at things like the tone and character of &apos;Grrr&apos; and extending that to other products [beyond the launch of Honda Insight].&quot;  According to Nielsen Media Research Honda spends well in excess of \u00a3100m annually on advertising across Europe and Africa. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

Tonight&apos;s minute-by-minute report comes to you from the Guardian&apos;s swanky new offices in Kings Place, where I am sitting in my brand new Freedom chair, which according to its designer Niels Diffrient, is the most advanced task chair available anywhere. With synchronous body-friendly gel arm-rests, recline tension, lumbar support height and an optional headrest (mine is present) as standard, I would say there&apos;s a very good chance I&apos;ll nod off shortly into this match, no matter how exciting it is.  Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack! The teams emerge from the tunnel, with Chelsea wearing their usual home strip, while the players of CFR Cluj are wearing white shirts, red shorts and red socks.  The visitors, whose owner has been affected by the credit crunch, are only playing for pride and moves to other clubs tonight and this is reflected in their price as 30-1 shots to win this game.  1 min: CFR Cluj kick off.  2 min: From midfield, Michael Ballack spears a long ball over the top for Nicolas Anelka to chase. The Frenchman is beated to the bouncing ball by CFR goalkeeper Nuno Claro, and gets penalised for offside into the bargain.  3 min: Chelsea win a free kick, wide on the left, about 40 yards from the Cluj goal. Deco squares it for John Mikel Obi, who sends an optimistic effort from distance flying high and wide.  4 min: Solid defending from Ashley Cole, who gets in a tangle with Cluj&apos;s right-winger Juan Culio. The latter appeals for a corner, while the former successfully appeals for a goal kick. Cluj have lined out in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Culio and Trica playing high up the pitch in support of lone striker Kone. Chelsea are playing a 4-1-4-1, with John Mikel Obi protecting the back four, Salomon Kalou and Joe Cole on the flanks and Nic Anelka ploughing a lone furrow up front.  7 min: Cluj left-back Alvaro Pereira surges forward with the ball at his feet, shoots and Petr Cech has to have his wits about him to get two strong hands down behind the Uruguayan&apos;s swewrving daisy-cutter.  10 min: Deco and Kalou combine well down the right wing for Chelsea, carving out an opening for the Portuguese to put a cross into the Cluj penalty area. Nuno Claro thunders off his line to claim comfortably.  11 min: Free-kick for Chelsea, wide on the left. Deco floats a beautifully weighted ball in to the back post, where Alex gets over it a bit too well and heads it into the ground, from where it bounces over the crossbar.  13 min: Fancy footwork from Salomon Kalou in the left channel enables the Ivorian to skip past a couple of defenders and square the ball for Nicolas Anelka. His shot from just inside the penalty area is blocked by Alvaro Pereira.  15 min: &quot;Assuming none of us know anything about Cluj and we are relying on your talents to paint the picture for us, whom should we be watching for them?&quot; asks Kyle Karinen. I love it that somebody is relying on my talent for &quot;knowing things about Cluj&quot;. If you want to know anything about Cluj, read this.  17min: Juan Culio gallops down the right wing, turning Jose Boswinga inside out down in the process. He sends a cross in to the penalty area, which is headed down at the back post by Alcantra, the centre-half. With Petr Cech in all sorts of bother, it is left to John Mikel Obi to hack the ball clear before Kone can adjust his feet and poke the ball into the gaping Chelsea goal.  21 min: Cluj goalkeeper Nuno Claro comes for a cross and misses it. Nic Anelka and a defender contest the subsequent header, the ball flies straight up in the air and Alvaro Pereira puts it out for a corner from which nothing comes.  22 min: &quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;re tired of hearing tales about the tiresome Eamon Dunphy,&quot; writes Niall Glynn, who couldn&apos;t be more wrong. &quot;However, this evening, while inexplicably talking about Roy Keane during the preview for the Chelsea match, he treated us to an embarrassingly comedic moment of Curb Your Enthusiasm-esque proportions. &apos;Great players never, ever, make great managers,&apos; he espoused as his colleagues Graeme Souness and John Giles shuffled uneasily in their seats. Dunphy&apos;s subsequent glance and realisation was quite the picture.&quot;  25 min: Michael Ballack tips out to the left wing to pick up a through-ball from Salomon Kalou, which he subsequently drives across the edge of the penalty area. It rolls straight into the path of the onrushing Joe Cole, who lashes it on the fly. Wide, but not by much.  Stat-attack: Possession: Chelsea 60% - 40% CFR Cluj.  28 min: Jim Adamson wants to know if it would &quot;be more entertaining to see England&apos;s Brave John Tiny Tears stoically cry his eyes out as Chelsea fail to make the knockout stages tonight, or wait and hope to see EBJTT miss a penalty in a shoot-out and go out within touching distance of winning the trophy again?&quot;  30 min: I must confess that I would certainly find a repeat of last year&apos;s farce more entertaining.  31 min: &quot;Cluj is actually in the Transylvania region of Romania,&quot; writes Brian Cruickshank. &quot;I had a neighbour from there and his wife, also from Transylvania, was studying, get this, haematology.&quot; A Salomon Kalou shot is deflected over the bar for a Chelsea corner. Nothing comes from it. Kalou&apos;s playing well tonight.  34 min: It&apos;s still scoreless in the other Group A game between Roma and Bordeaux, which is good news for Chelsea. If Bordeaux were to go a goal up, Chelsea would be third in the group in-running.  37 min: With Cluj right-back Panin down injured after being accidentally cracked on the back of the head by Michael Ballack&apos;s knee, Chelsea break and attack the space he&apos;s left behind. Cluj&apos;s fans and players are unhappy that the ball wasn&apos;t put out of play to allow medics on, but I think that kind of fannying around is a mug&apos;s game unless you hear an actual limb snap.  GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 CFR Cluj (Kalou 39) Deco swings a free-kick into the Cluj penalty area. With assorted players pushing and shoving, there&apos;s a horrific mix-up between midfielder Muresan and one of the centre-backs, and the ball drops beautifully for the unmarked Kalou on the edge of the six-yard box. His job is an easy one and he does it well.  42 min: With Chelsea a goal up and Bordeaux and Roma drawing 0-0 in Rome, the English side are currently top of Group A in-running, with Roma in second spot and Bordeaux third.  44 min: Deco&apos;s been playing some marvellous passes tonight and the latest, a perfectly weighted diagonal ball into the corner, allows Salomon Kalou to send a low cross fizzing across the edge of the Cluj six-yard box. With the goalkeeper committed, there&apos;s nobody in a Chelsea shirt present to prod the ball home and make qualification for the next group stages a formality.  45 min: Alvaro Pereira tries an ambitious shot from distance with hilarious consequences. Cue lots of ironic cheering from the uber-witty home fans as the ball flies 40 yards wide.  Half-time  Half-time request: &quot;Perhaps you could ask the Cluj fans currently following your minute-by-minute report whether the nightclub Blanco Y Negro is still open in Transylvania&apos;s largest town,&quot; asks Robert Sowler. &quot;Watching about a thousand shell-suited punters there, dancing to the Rednex classic Cotton-Eye Joe has to be one of my favourite memories of 1995.&quot;  45 min: The second half is underway, although ITV missed the kick-off as their man in the tunnel was conducting an interview with Chelsea&apos;s first-team coach Ray Wilkins, who spoke plenty but said very little, as is customary in these ridiculous half-time chats team officials clearly have no interest in participating in. &quot;Cluj have nothing to lose so we expect them to have a go ... there&apos;s no doubt Didier will make an appearance ... we have to control the game ... rumours about Kevin Hitchcock teabagging me for a prank while I was asleep on a li-lo on a Watford away trip have been greatly exaggerated.&quot; That kind of thing.  49 min: Move along, nothing to see here. Didier Drogba is warming up on the touchline and being warmly applauded by his public for his amazing ability for jogging up and down in a straight line. Imagine how pleased they&apos;ll be if he removes his tracksuit and accomplishes something difficult.  50 min: &quot;Robert Sowler clearly had one godawful year in 1995!&quot; writes the marvellously-monikered Donato Jaggers. John Mikel Obi clatters Dubarbier and concedes a free-kick in midfield. The ball is sent into the Chelsea penalty area, Alex heads clear and finds Michael Ballack. He attempts to put Joe Cole through for a one-on-one with the Cluj goalkeeper, but centre-half Alcantara does well to protect the man between the sticks.  54 min: From the edge of the penalty area, John Mikel Obi dinks the ball through to the feet of Nic Anelka, who brings a smart save out of Claro from a narrow angle. But what&apos;s this ...  GOAL! Chelsea 1-1 CFR Cluj (Kone)  That&apos;s a wonderfully worked goal from the visitors. Cluj break, Juan Culio feeds Panin on the right wing and he curls a corss to the back post where, unmarked, Kone hangs in the air before heading in to the top corner from a very tight angle.  57 min: Deco takes out three Cluj defenders with a marvellous cross-field pass to Nicolas Anelka in the Cluj right-back position. He miscontrols, enabling Panin to clear. Moments previously, Joe Cole had brought a smart save out of Nuno Claro when he really should have scored.   59 min: As things stand, Chelsea would qualify from Group A in second place behind Roma. But if this game stays 1-1 and Bordeaux beat Roma, we could all look forward to the delightful prospect of seeing Frank Lampard and John Terry trying to feign enthusiasm for the Uefa Cup.  62 min: Roma have taken the lead against Bordeaux. ITV&apos;s commentator, whose name escapes me, seems to think this is good news for all English football fans, not just Chelsea&apos;s. Why?   64 min: Chelsea substitution: Didier Drogba on, Salomon Kalou off. Cluj substitution: Emmanuel Kone (no relation to the goalscorer) on, Dubarbier off.  66 min: Great ball from Mikel to Drogba, who returns from an offside position before volleying the ball straight at Claro in the Cluj goal. Free-kick for the visitors.  69 min: It&apos;s all Chelsea at the moment - they&apos;re peppering the Cluj penalty area with crosses and through -balls without creating too much in the way of shots on goal.  GOAL! Chelsea 2-1 CFR Cluj (Drogba 70 min) Great break out of defence by Chelsea, courtesy of Mikel, who chips the ball towards Joe Cole in the right channel. He dinks a delicate, perfectly weighted pass between two defenders and into the path of Drogba, who prods it past Claro before the goalkeeper had time to settle himself.  73 min: Chelsea substitution: Joe Cole off, Juliano Belletti on. There&apos;s been a Cluj substitution too, but I managed to miss it.  74 min: Mikel tries another shot from 40 or more yards, but skews it horribly wide.  75 min: Juliano Belletti, who has missed Chelsea&apos;s last five games with an ankle injury, gets booked for a late tackle on Alvaro Perreira. He&apos;s not happy, but it was a fair cop.  77 min: &quot;The singer from Rednex tried to pull my then girlfriend, now wife, in 2002 in a gym in Amsterdam,&quot; writes Patrick Finch. That knocks the story about Ryan Giggs trying to pull my girlfriend, now ex-girlfriend (although not because of anything Ryan Giggs did ... I think), in a Dublin pub in 1997 into a cocked hat. I reckon the only thing that prevented her from going off with Giggs was her complete ignorance of football, the men who play it and the amount of money they earn.  80 min: Roma go 2-0 up against Bordeaux, in the process nailing shut the lid of the box marked Chances Of Some Last-Minute Excitement Tonight. The name of John Mikel Obi goes into the book for a late challenge on Dani.  82 min: At the behest of a crowd who are clearly familiar with his work, Juliano Belletti tries a long-range effort from 35 yards. It stings the palms of Claro in the Cluj goal, who spills the ball then does well to prevent it from going out for a corner.  84 min: The heads of the Cluj players have well and truly dropped. They&apos;re just going though the motions at this stage, trying to play down the clock. They&apos;ve put on a decent show tonight, but they&apos;re well aware that, as far as their chances of causing an upset is concerned, the jig is up.  86 min: Chelsea substitution: John Mikel off, Wayne Bridge on. Ah, here we go. A Cluj player goes down injured, their players appeal to Chelsea&apos;s to put the ball out of play, Deco does so ... eventually, the medics come on, the player is absolutely fine, Cluj take the throw-in and give the ball to a Chelsea player who is then obliged to welly the ball 60 yards backwards to Petr Cech, who is then &quot;allowed&quot; to launch an attack. What ... is ... the ... point ... of ... all ... this ... nonsense?  89 min: One minute to go, along with whatever few minutes the referee allotts for injury-time. Chelsea will be in the runners-up pot in the draw for the next group stages of this year&apos;s Champions League. Dead rubbers, pots of balls, gluttonous lunches in the dormant volcano that - I presume - serves as Uefa&apos;s lair in Switzerland. This tournament just never stops giving, does it?   90 min: There&apos;ll be four minutes of added time. Cluj win a free-kick right of centre, about 30 yards out. Murasan tries his luck, but hits a powerful bending shot too high to cause Petr Cech any concern.  90+3 min: Didier Drogba showcases his strength and skill, holding off a defender as he chests down Petr Cech&apos;s kick-out, traps the ball dead on his foot, turns, beats his marker and plays it forward to Nicolas Anelka. The Frenchman undoes all Drogba&apos;s hard work with a very feeble shot straight at the keeper.  90+4min: The referee blows for full time and brings a reasonably entertaining game to a close. Roma beat Bordeaux 2-0 in Rome and go into the draw for the second group stages as group winners, with Chelsea runners-up.

Sources close to Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr have confirmed the American owners have agreed in principle to extend Ben\u00edtez&apos;s contract until 2013. From the outset the Liverpool manager&apos;s priority has been a significant extension rather than a dramatic increase on his \u00a33.5m-a-year salary, from a deal that has 18 months to run, and so the offer of a new four-and-a-half year contract is unlikely to meet any resistance. Financial bonuses in the package have still to be ironed out, but even without a considerable pay rise the deal will be worth at least \u00a316m to Ben\u00edtez. From employers who 13 months ago were touting J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann as his successor, and initially wanted to follow the US sports-model of a one year extension for their manager, the offer represents a significant victory for the Spaniard. It also reflects the Liverpool hierarchy&apos;s determination to prevent off-field issues distracting from the team&apos;s pursuit of the Premier League title. Whether it signals a long-term commitment to Liverpool from Hicks and Gillett themselves, with interest from Dubai cooling, remains to be seen. As for the task of negotiating first place at the expense of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, PSV Eindhoven were as accommodating to Liverpool&apos;s needs as the Americans have been to Ben\u00edtez. Already assured of a place in the knock-out phase, Liverpool \u00adreshuffled their pack, fell behind and did not exert themselves, but triumphed convincingly on the effort of those with a point to prove. Robbie Keane returned to the side following his demotion at Blackburn Rovers and produced another tireless display that was short on chances but notably, playing off another striker, generated plenty of opportunity for those around him. Others with a mandate to impress included Ryan Babel, the former Ajax winger who has asked for \u2014 and been denied \u2014 a loan move back to Amsterdam given his lack of opportunity this term, the Brazilian midfielder Lucas, jeered by Liverpool supporters during his last start against Fulham, and the French striker David Ngog. All three impressed against PSV, although the calibre of their opponents was far weaker than they face in the Premier League. &quot;We spoke about how important it is to have the second leg of the knockout round at Anfield and I&apos;m pleased we&apos;ve managed to secure that,&quot; the Liverpool manager said. &quot;There were also a lot of positives in the game. Ngog and Lucas are the two who deserve most credit, I think Ngog has a good future here. He is only young but he is clever and has good movement. Babel and Keane also worked hard. Of course strikers always want to score but Robbie worked extremely hard for us up front.&quot; A casual, sterile first half got the goal it deserved when PSV took the lead in the 36th minute, Javier Mascherano&apos;s attempted clearance from a corner hitting Dirk Marcellis on the hand and falling to Danko Lazovic to convert from close range beyond Liverpool reserve goalkeeper, Diego Cavalieri. Despite Babel&apos;s prompting down the right, Liverpool rarely stretched the PSV defence before the interval yet equalised with remarkable ease when the Dutchman scored only his second goal of the campaign. Lucas was the provider from a free-kick out on the right, and Babel ensured further invective from the PSV support by ghosting away from Otman Bakkal and glancing a header through the suspect guard of Andreas Isaksson. Liverpool were comfortable throughout the second period; the goals that secured their progress as group winners exquisite. Albert Riera drove the visitors ahead for the first time when invited to attack a retreating PSV defence and obliged with a stunning strike into the top corner from 25 yards. Again, Isaksson should have done better. Keane had spent most of a frustrating evening shaking his head at errant passes from his team-mates, selfless play that brought no reward and some harsh treatment from the Russian referee, but finally gained the reward his display deserved with his part in Liverpool&apos;s third. The Republic of Ireland captain volleyed a superb pass through the PSV rearguard for Ngog to sprint clear and finish expertly under Isaksson, delivering another milestone for Ben\u00edtez in the process. This was Ben\u00edtez&apos;s 40th win in 67 European games as manager, taking him beyond Bob Paisley&apos;s record of 39 continental triumphs. The word from the US is that there will be many more.", "sentences": ["Others with a mandate to impress included Ryan Babel, the former Ajax winger who has asked for \u2014 and been denied \u2014 a loan move back to Amsterdam given his lack of opportunity this term, the Brazilian midfielder Lucas, jeered by Liverpool supporters during his last start against Fulham, and the French striker David Ngog."], "title": "Champions League: PSV Eindhoven 1-3 Liverpool", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/09/rafa-benitez-liverpool-eindhoven-champions-league", "tags": ["Champions League 2008-09", "Champions League", "Liverpool", "PSV Eindhoven", "Rafael Ben\u00edtez", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-11T00:01:00Z", "article": "Microsoft has built three huge businesses using the same technique: it packages together a suite of software, simplifies it and sells it at a low price. This has worked on the desktop with Windows (worth $17bn [\u00a311.4bn] in 2008) and Office ($19bn), and in the data centre with Windows Server and back-office tools ($13bn). Now it&apos;s trying to do it again online, with last week&apos;s launch of Wave 3. Windows packaged MS DOS, the Windows user interface, a video player, a web browser and other applications. Wave 3 is packaging MSN Messenger and Hotmail with a broad collection of software and online services, although the new versions are called Windows Live Messenger and Windows Live Mail. If you use one of these - and more than 460 million people use Messenger - then Microsoft hopes to get you to use all the others &quot;by making it easy to keep your life in sync&quot;, in the words of Microsoft Live&apos;s Brian Groth. &quot;That&apos;s our vision.&quot; Wave 3 aims to consolidate your online life via a home page that looks quite like Facebook, and also offers social networking and photo-sharing. You can post a profile, see your mail, messages, notes, news and events, and you can also start small groups. The Live Services package provides generous mail storage (5GB at the moment), 25GB of space for your photo gallery, the chance to blog on Spaces, plus Events, Groups, a calendar and a simple contacts book. The same contacts are available to all the applications, your desktop PC and your mobile phone (via Active Sync). And you can get to all your stuff with one Live ID password, aka Passport. To support all these Live Services from Windows, there&apos;s a suite of Live Essentials software. This includes the Mail, Messenger, Writer (for blogging) and Photo Gallery applications, plus a toolbar. These desktop programs synchronise with the online applications, so you get the best of both worlds. Finally, to support the whole infrastructure, there&apos;s Windows Azure, Microsoft&apos;s cloud computing platform, running on a network of giant data centres. Like Windows and Office, Wave 3 is also a &quot;platform play&quot;. Microsoft wants other companies to develop applications for Live, or plug in their existing applications. There&apos;s a list of the Live Framework services that external developers can use at dev.live.com. Jumpstart 2009 developer training events are being organised in places as far afield as Amsterdam, Warsaw, Seoul, Sydney and Beijing.  Microsoft says it is already working with Twitter, Flickr, iLike, Yelp, StumbleUpon, WordPress and other suppliers. The appeal, of course, is easy access to Live&apos;s 500 million or so users. So far, Microsoft&apos;s online division has not been very successful: in 2008, for example, it lost $1.2bn on revenues of just $3.2bn. With Wave 3, however, Microsoft is on more familiar ground. It&apos;s good at building platforms, and it has the money and the will to tackle huge projects like Wave 3 that nobody else would attempt.  But in this case, there&apos;s a flaw in the strategy of &quot;pile &apos;em high, sell &apos;em cheap&quot;. With Wave 3, the rival offerings from Google, Yahoo and others are already free. With Windows and Office, Microsoft was able to turn market share into long-term profits. With Wave 3, it may just be investing a lot of money to create long-term losses.

Tagging, Maldives style. Photograph: nattu/Flickr/Some rights reserved This is just one part of an increasingly brutal plan to thin the company down. 1,500 jobs are going (that&apos;s 10% of the workforce, though Kara Swisher earlier reported that say the figure could go up to 2,000. A Yahoo spokesman told the New York Times that there could be &quot;additional staff reductions next year - it depends on the decisions we make about prioritistions, and on things we can&apos;t predict in the economy&quot;. (Update: See the remarkable &apos;how to sack employees guide&apos; for managers, as leaked to Valleywag.) Offices are being closed in Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Oslo and Copenhagen. And the severance package for executives that was hastily rejigged in February to put off Microsoft, was been rejigged again. All this is an effort to cut down &apos;company bloat&apos; and make the company more attractive for a buyer. But Brickhouse? Valleywag says estate agents have &quot;tromped through&quot; the office in South Park, San Francisco, suggesting an imminent sale of the Brickhouse home, and rather unfairly says &quot;nothing memorably has issued&quot; from the division, which is just not true. Former BBC developer Tom Coates has been leading the location aggregator Fire Eagle - an extremely clever, versatile and simple product with huge potential. This is exactly the kind of product that Yahoo&apos;s innovation wing should be producing and extremely popular with the development community. &quot;Although Brickhouse is gone, be reassured Fire Eagle is still here and we&apos;ll keep working. Case in point,&quot; Coates Tweeted last night, linking to the project&apos;s Facebook app. Another extremely popular project was Yahoo Pipes, which provides a range of tools for mashing together content feeds. ReadWriteWeb called it &quot;one of the coolest ways to mashup the RSS feeds of sites to get the data you want&quot;. Pipes has powered a filtered Digg feed, aggregated search results, a FriendFeed stream without Twitter and plenty of mainstream media services too - including the New York Times&apos; Flickr mashup. The real advantage is that you don&apos;t need to be technical, so it&apos;s a brilliant way to experiment with mixing together different media and different formats. Brickhouse has suffered with the departure of a series of executives Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake headed the division first with Salim Ismail, then Chad Dickerson - all of whom have now left. Born in March 2007, it was supposed to be a way of allowing that weekend-long hack day spirit to live on and become part of the working process. It&apos;s a given that firms have to clamp down on costs. But innovation? That&apos;s the future. Brickhouse was supposed to be Yahoo&apos;s answer to the nimble and creative startup community, putting small, talented teams of developers away from the corporate HQ to invent new, exciting services. Given the intensity of competition they face, and the fact the market is about to demand that companies prove their strength and uniqueness, you&apos;d have thought that remained a priority. After all, two of Yahoo&apos;s most popular services were both startups it bought in: Flickr and Delicious. If some of Brickhouse&apos;s projects failed, that should be accepted as part of the process of developing experimental projects - without testing and failing you can&apos;t learn what really works.

Are you easily bored? Do you regularly find yourself bemoaning the lack of variety and personality in an increasingly homogenised world?  If so, then Word of Mouth has some good news for you, albeit temporarily. For in Flash, the North Pole and the Double Club, Britain is currently witnessing a small, welcome renaissance of the guerrilla bar-restaurant.  It&apos;s like winter 2006 revisited - when, if you cast your mind back, the arrival of Reindeer at the Truman Brewery seemed to confirm a global appetite for short-lived restaurants in weird locations. At the time, you couldn&apos;t open a Sunday supplement without reading about Antwerp&apos;s Mist; California&apos;s unlicensed, unpredictable Blind Pig; or Amsterdam&apos;s mass takeaway eat-in, Food Facility. Restaurants, excitable trend analysts babbled, were the new warehouse raves; edgy pop-up spaces for the modern urban explorer. Only with profiteroles instead of disco biscuits.  And then? Well, nothing. The hype was so loud that no authentic grassroots movement could grow. The great guerrilla restaurant insurgency fizzled out and, but for a few random spurts of activity - Paul Kitching&apos;s brief return to his Geordie homeland, as part of Eat! Newcastle; this painfully fashion-looking &apos;happening&apos; in New York; a blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it vegan cafe in Tokyo - we all went back to eating in proper restaurants with four walls and long leases.  Until now, that is. For once again, we have some substantive guerrilla activity to get our teeth into. Flash, part of a contemporary art event at the Royal Academy of Arts, open until January 19, is the work of restaurateurs Pablo Flack and David Waddington. Like their previous creation, Reindeer, and their long-standing restaurant, Bistrotheque, Flash exists at an intersection of ideas in art, fashion, cabaret and food. Like Belgian artist Carsten H\u00f6ller&apos;s Double Club, an art installation, nightclub and restaurant serving Congolese and seasonal European food, it is a concept which many people will find - how would Waldemar Januszczak put it? - unbearably wanky.  Personally, I don&apos;t. I think lots of interesting and valuable things happen in environments which unimaginative people too easily dub pretentious. But that&apos;s an argument for another time and blog. So, let&apos;s focus, instead, on the North Pole in Manchester, a guerrilla opening that I&apos;ve actually been to, and one which, unless I missed something, isn&apos;t attempting to make any points about western cultural chauvinism.  Housed in a giant tepee behind Urbis, and supported by Manchester City Council, it&apos;s the work of local events company Ear To The Ground. I can&apos;t think of anything I less want to drink than warm winter cocktails (\u00a33.50), with names like Chocolate Wunder Warmer; the beer selection is boring; and at least one blogger seems to think that the whole thing sums up the elaborate con that is modern Manchester, but I like the place.  I like the quietly quirky all-white space (Christmas trees hung-upside down from the lighting rig; a frost-bitten polar explorer perched in the rafters), and I like the fact that it&apos;s attracting a good mixed crowd - curious shoppers and commuters transiting nearby Victoria station, as well as the expected students and Northern Quarter creatives, and in such numbers that, even at 4pm last Friday, there was a nice (dare I say, Christmassy) buzz to the place. But, most of all, I love the food.  Kept simple and relatively cheap, there&apos;s a choice of cockle-warming meat (\u00a34.95) and veggie (\u00a33.95) stews on offer, made by the team at the Angel. Someone needs to point out to the staff that, in terms of difficulty, attempting to spread rock hard butter onto a floury bap with a tiny plastic knife is second only to actually trekking to the North Pole, but my chicken, smoked pancetta and slow roasted tomato stew hit the spot. It was full of good, texturally firm chicken, had a rich, satisfying depth of flavour, and it certainly lifted my spirits on a sub-zero afternoon. Even if I was eating stood up, from a disposable paper bowl, using a plastic spoon.  But isn&apos;t that what guerrilla restaurants should be? That is, rough, ready and democratic places; eateries that dispense with the expensive bells and whistles of eating out. Places that offer simple, filling food, in entertaining, off-beat DIY spaces. Which isn&apos;t to choose the North Pole over Flash or the Double Club. To my mind, all inject a little spontaneity and colour into what can often be the fairly formulaic experience of eating out in a restaurant. The more the merrier.  But what about you? Would you love to see more impromptu eateries? Or are guerrilla restaurants - the chefs inevitably working in unfamiliar, temporary kitchens - always going to be a poor substitute for the real thing? Do you despair at this preference for baubles and novelty over true gastronomic quality? Or do you have fond memories of guerrilla restaurants gone by?

What will be this year&apos;s Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves, or Schott&apos;s Miscellany, or the Dangerous Book for Boys? Which book will loom largest, most sparklingly, on the festive mid-horizon?

And Matthew Parris, updating his Scorn: The Anthology (Max Press, \u00a310.99). And Sam Jordison, with his Sod That! 103 Things Not to Do Before You Die (Orion, \u00a39.99). And the New Scientist, doing their best to repeat the success of Does Anything Eat Wasps? with Do Polar Bears Get Lonely? (Profile Books, \u00a37.99). Success breeds not success, but boredom. Gardeners, meanwhile, will be receiving something like Louise Hampden&apos;s Top Tips: A Treasury of Garden Wisdom (BBC Books, \u00a39.99). Typical tip: &quot;Don&apos;t buy plants from a nursery or garden centre if the pot has weeds or moss growing on it.&quot; Oh, and don&apos;t eat dirt. Cooks, meanwhile, might like to receive the very fine A Food Lover&apos;s Treasury (Frances Lincoln, \u00a39.99) by Julie Rugg and Lynda Murphy, but given the current economic climate they might find more useful The Workhouse Cookbook (The History Press, \u00a312.99) by Peter Higginbotham, which includes recipes for Hotch-Potch Stew, Flummery, and Beef Tea. Winebibbers may wish for Is This Bottle Corked? The Secret Life of Wine (Faber, \u00a312.99), by Kathleen Burk and Michael Bywater, which answers questions such as &quot;What was Falstaff expecting when he called for more sack?&quot; (sherry); and &quot;What wines did Chaucer&apos;s pilgrims drink?&quot; (something good from Spain). The traditional radio and TV tie-ins range this year from the high end of James Walton&apos;s Sonnets, Bonnets &amp; Bennetts: A Literary Quiz Book (Faber, \u00a312.99), based on the Radio 4 programme The Write Stuff, to Fighting Talk: Flimsy Facts, Sweeping Statements and Inspired Sporting Hunches (Hodder, \u00a312.99), a compilation of anecdotes from Radio 5 Live. &quot;Have you ever wondered whether there is any link between England&apos;s performance in football tournaments and the chart position of the official song? If you answer yes, then this is the book for you.&quot;  I answered no. And turned instead to Dr Robert Vanderplank&apos;s Uglier Than a Monkey&apos;s Armpit (Pan Macmillan, \u00a37.99), a book of foreign-language insults and curses, which is useful if you find yourself in Amsterdam wishing to say &quot;Go get cancer behind your heart so the doctor can&apos;t reach it&quot; (krijg de kanker achter je hart zodat de dokter er niet bij kan!).

If you prefer maths to English, then you may be intrigued by John D Barrow&apos;s 100 Essential Things You Didn&apos;t Know You Didn&apos;t Know (Bodley Head, \u00a310). Barrow is director of the millennium mathematics project at Cambridge University, and undoubtedly incredibly smart, but some of the things he thinks we didn&apos;t know we didn&apos;t know surely we do know, such as &quot;The only way to be sure of winning a lottery is to buy all the tickets.&quot; In competition with Barrow is Ian Stewart, with his Cabinet of Mathematical Curiosities (Profile, \u00a310.99). Stewart is professor of mathematics at the University of Warwick. Studying maths at Warwick sounds like a lot of fun. &quot;Marigold Mouse has a cube of cheese and a carving-knife. She wishes to slice the cheese along a flat plane, to obtain a cross-section that is a regular hexagon. Can she do this, and if so, how?&quot; And so on to the genuine contenders for the likely big Christmas blimp. Mark Crick&apos;s Sartre&apos;s Sink: The Great Writers&apos; Complete Book of DIY (Granta, \u00a310.99) is hands-down droll. Crick offers chapters including &quot;Hanging Wallpaper&quot; with Ernest Hemingway, &quot;Tiling a Bathroom&quot; with Dostoevsky and &quot;Painting a Room&quot; with Haruki Murakami: &quot;I looked across at Aoko standing on the steps so she could reach up into the corners ... My imagination kicked in and I thought of her body, naked against mine.&quot; Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall out-cutes all-comers with The Good Granny Companion (Short Books, \u00a312.99), a book so full of hair-in-a-bun goodness that it seems a shame to restrict it only to grannies. Miles Kington&apos;s How Shall I Tell the Dog? (Profile, \u00a39.99) is the book that Kington was writing shortly before his death, and consists of a series of letters to his agent, pitching absurd books about cancer: grimtastic. The Complete Peanuts: 1957 to 1958 (Canongate, \u00a315), the fourth volume of the complete Peanuts series, is, obviously, exquisite, and Redstone Press, as is their wont, have produced another couple of classic unclassifiables, Psychogames and the Play Box (both \u00a315.95), tests and puzzles that might make a nice alternative to post-Christmas dinner Monopoly. And finally, I can think of no higher praise for The Mighty Book of Boosh (Canongate, \u00a319.99) than to say that it is almost as good as a mid-70s Goodies annual. It has lots of pictures, and is shiny. And as PG Wodehouse memorably remarks (as quoted in The Wit and Wisdom of PG Wodehouse, Arrow Books, \u00a37.99), &quot;The first rule in buying Christmas presents is to select something shiny ...

And not the kind of broke that football clubs sometimes claim to be before bringing in a fresh batch of expensive players anyway. They&apos;re proper broke. They&apos;re also bad. Very bad. They&apos;re in 12th place, only four points above the drop zone, having won just five times in 20 league and Uefa Cup games. But, as several members of the club&apos;s board have confirmed, they can&apos;t even afford to pay off their manager if they sack him. So they&apos;re stuck with him. &quot;He won&apos;t just make this Christmas, he&apos;ll make the next one too,&quot; the club director Eric Gudde said, claiming that this is all part of a carefully scripted masterplan. Verbeek built up an impressive track record in four years at Heracles and another four at Heerenveen but this season, his first at Feyenoord, has been a disaster. Injuries and a supersized portion of bad luck have plagued the squad. The defender Kevin Hofland rolled his ankle walking his dog and injured his thigh getting up from his dinner table. Verbeek is, if nothing else, a manager&apos;s manager. At 24, nine years before his active playing career ended, he began coaching several of Heerenveen&apos;s youth teams. He looks the part too. His explanations are unflinchingly clear and his demeanour is Louis van Gaal-esquely even-keeled. He is uniquely qualified for the unenviable task of rebuilding Feyenoord. So why isn&apos;t it working? Because often a manager&apos;s compatibility with a squad is a matter of dumb luck. Verbeek started off well, getting the hopelessly outdated training centre upgraded. But the older players are said to have quickly grown annoyed with his harsh training schedule. Not used to training twice a day and with such intensity, many of them blamed their injuries on the manager. However, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Real Madrid&apos;s new striker, who played under Verbeek at Heerenveen, told the Studio Voetbal talkshow last week that Verbeek&apos;s regime was by no means exceptional or, in fact, that tough. A straw poll inside the dressing room found 80% of players to have given up on Verbeek, according to De Telegraaf. Algemeen Dagblad put it at 14 votes to four. Allegedly the squad lodged a formal complaint to the board too. &quot;That is absolutely not true,&quot; said the captain, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, one of those veteran players constantly getting injured, on Friday. &quot;There&apos;s no rift between young and old or players and manager. We don&apos;t complain about weight-training either.&quot; Tellingly, Verbeek, whose tactics have been questioned too, pronounced himself pleasantly surprised at the show of support. In return he agreed to no longer conclude Friday training with a match, as per the players&apos; request. Saturday offered Feyenoord a chance at redemption against the league leaders, AZ. An intense, high-paced game saw AZ win 1\u20130 through Ari&apos;s seventh goal in six matches on a Mounir El Hamdaoui breakaway. Justifying interest from Barcelona, Arsenal and his former employers Tottenham, El Hamdaoui, 24, and valued at about \u00a318m, once again showed that he has developed that rare ability to alter the outcome of a match with just a few touches. Ahead of the game, Feyenoord&apos;s notoriously acerbic and unforgiving supporters showed their support for Verbeek. His side certainly showed improvement on the day. &quot;If you can play well against AZ you have to be able to against anybody,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;We tried our best and that&apos;s all you can do,&quot; Verbeek concluded as credits and a corny theme song wrapped up another mirthless episode of the Feyenoord sitcom. But if nothing else, Feyenoord&apos;s misadventure has uncovered at least one gem: Georginio Wijnaldum. The gifted midfielder, who looks destined to grace the Oranje shirt for a long, long time, has flashed maturity and consistency belying his mere 18 years. Leroy Fer, Diego Biseswar and Luigi Bruins, aged 18, 20 and 21 respectively, have shown occassional signs of significant promise. Luckily for Feyenoord, co-Big Three-ers Ajax and PSV, have problems of their own to deal with. On Friday, Ajax were lucky to ease past NAC 3\u20130 , after the visitors from Breda took themselves out of the game through a penalty and a red card. Luis Su\u00e1rez converted to add to a first-ever Ajax goal by Dario Cvitanich, who likes spiking his Uruguayan team-mates Bruno Silva and Su\u00e1rez&apos;s mate (a South American tea) with a banana. Cvitanich, who is likened to Javier Saviola in his native Argentina, is now formally Huntelaar&apos;s successor. Rasmus Lindgren, who has only 30 Ajax appearances but is captain anyway, scored the third. &quot;The Amsterdam attacks are slow and devoid of strokes of genius,&quot; Willem Vissers wrote in De Volkskrant. &quot;In midfield Ajax currently have as much creativity as an old Soviet factory conveyor-belt worker.&quot; &quot;The first half was weak, poor,&quot; the manager, Marco van Basten, said in his all-purpose analysis. &quot;We failed to entertained the crowd,&quot; he added. &quot;That needs to be discussed.&quot; Van Basten has scrapped win bonuses and replaced them with a one-time \u00a3250,000 a player if they win the title. The most exciting thing to happen in Arnhem was the retractable roof of Vitesse&apos;s stadium breaking down before their match with PSV. In a half-open stadium the sides played out a poor 1\u20131 draw, with Nordin Amrabat putting PSV ahead before Niklas Tarvaj\u00e4rvi (with lots of help from the PSV keeper Andreas Issakson) equalised. Steve McClaren looked happy before FC Twente&apos;s match at FC Groningen and even happier afterwards, as his side won 4\u20131 . FC Twente now sit in third place. McClaren&apos;s happiness was such that it caused him to slip in and out of his fake Dutch accent at the press conference. Feyenoord travel to PSV next week. Which they could choose to look at as another shot at redemption.

Emissions trading will become a reality in three years&apos; time and advances in engine and airframe technology, lower carbon fuels and operational changes will all have major effects on the industry&apos;s carbon footprint. Global warming is an urgent, complex issue, which many environmental scientists admit they do not fully understand. I make no claims for a full understanding. What I do know is that global warming is global. Which is why I question the view that expansion of one airport, Heathrow, means catastrophe for the planet.  Heathrow is our national hub. It is a big airport for the UK, but its runway capacity is much smaller than rival hubs in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. That is why it offers a smaller route network, and is more vulnerable to delays. A third runway at Heathrow would not open before 2020. By then, the EU emissions trading scheme will have applied to airlines for eight years. Carbon emissions will have been capped at 2005 levels \u2013 and if airlines want to fly more (from Heathrow or any other airport in Europe), they will be able to do so only if they pay for equivalent emissions reductions elsewhere. Net C02 emissions in the atmosphere will not increase as a result of expansion at Heathrow. It is absolutely right that aviation should meet its full environmental costs. In fact, through the UK&apos;s uniquely heavy and rising level of air travel taxation (air passenger duty), UK airlines already do \u2013 with something to spare. We must see things in perspective. If we closed every UK airport tomorrow, we would reduce global C02 emissions by 0.1%.  And if we decide not to build a third runway at Heathrow, we will not reduce absolute emissions one iota.  As the economy recovers, demand for travel will grow. If that demand cannot be met at Heathrow, it will simply transfer to rival international hubs such as Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam (which already have four or five runways each).  Lack of runway slots at Heathrow will force people living in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to fly long-haul via continental hubs. So emissions will grow at those airports instead. For residents of the south-east, the lack of new runway capacity will mean that the direct long-haul network will continue to wither \u2013 and they too will have to become accustomed to inconvenient indirect flights via overseas hubs. And as we buckle our straitjacket, other countries will laugh. France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain already have their extra capacity. Dubai will continue progress on its new six-runway hub, and China with building its 97 new airports in the next 12 years. There are many other examples. Let&apos;s face reality. Rejecting growth at Heathrow would not make the slightest practical difference to the future of the planet. It would make a huge difference to the ability of UK employers to win and maintain business in a global economy. Multi-national businesses do not have to locate in Britain. If global connections look permanently better elsewhere, they will move. I want to beat climate change. Aviation is on the brink of neutralising its climate change impacts, and will go on to reduce them. Global warming is global.

The US company has changed hands twice since then and the European venture has failed to capitalise on the online ads boom - though it still trumpets recent product releases like Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) Answers clone Lycos iQ, it had been losing money at a particularly chronic rate in the last two years. Emblematic of the state of affairs, Lycos Europe last year paid Lycos Inc $5.2m to renew its license to use the brand name, while entering the US itself under a completely different name, Jubii. The company started a strategic review in April but, though Mohn suggested AOL (NYSE: TWX) and German ad net Tomorrow Focus were keen to bid around \u20ac200m, it&apos;s clear the sale process was flailing.

Skiers are off to the Alps while sun seekers head for the warm respite of Tenerife, Egypt, Turkey, Dubai and the Caribbean. Saturday 27 December will be the busiest day at airports as holidaymakers take short breaks in cities ranging from the now-more-expensive Eurozone favourites such as Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid and Dublin, to out-of-Eurozone destinations such as Warsaw, Dubai and New York, despite its stronger dollar. The figures are thought to be on a par with last year and came hours after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released tourism figures for October showing substantial falls in overseas travel both into and out of Britain compared with last year. Last week, BAA revealed its seven UK airports handled a total of 9.8 million passengers in November, a drop of nearly 9% on the same period year. Abta said the Christmas break would see more than 2 million people leaving the UK through Heathrow and other BAA airports alone. About 210,000 people will travel with Eurostar and a similar number would take their car by rail under the sea or travel by ferry. The ONS figures also showed fewer overseas visitors arrived in Britain in October, but they spent more than they did during the same period last year. Visitor numbers fell 5% to 2.7 million, but they spent \u00a31.5bn - up 1% from last year. The visitor figures for January to October this year - 27.57 million - matched the same period last year, with spending up 4% at \u00a314.1bn. Trips abroad by UK residents in October fell to 5.9m, down on 6.58m in October last year, while spending also fell from \u00a33.1bn to \u00a32.9bn. In the first 10 months of this year Britons made 60.7m trips abroad - 1% down on the previous year - but they spent \u00a332.3bn, 4% more than last year. Christopher Rodrigues, chairman of VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, said the figures were slightly better than expected. He said that &quot;for Britain, the weakening of the pound against the euro and US dollar could mean increasing numbers of visitors on short shopping or theatre breaks over the festive season. &quot;With the world heading into recession, the work needed to defend and promote the visitor economy - Britain&apos;s fifth largest industry - is nothing short of vital.&quot; Meanwhile, the overseas tourism industry is bracing itself for a tough time next year since many bookings for holidays being taken now were made before the economic crisis really bit. The Guardian understands that although numbers of winter season packages, which began in November, have fallen slightly on last year, their overall value is slightly higher.

And when a mirror is not at hand there is always Sir Allen Stanford. Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, is first and foremost an entrepreneur, a bright gambler who financed his Oxford education playing backgammon and bridge, a committee member of the Society of Merchant Venturers. And in Stanford he sees a man made in his own enterprising image, a taker of calculated risks. Stanford has made a multimillion-pound investment in English cricket but Clarke, in another sense, has also invested heavily in the Texan billionaire. If the deal falters it is not only the ECB&apos;s bean-counters who would be counting the cost; Clarke&apos;s chances of winning re-election in March would be wounded, perhaps fatally. His enemies, and he has a few, would be reinvigorated. A few counties have formed &quot;the ABC party&quot; \u2014 Anyone But Clarke \u2014 as the election approaches. Rod Bransgrove, the Hampshire chairman, called on the board to resign en masse over the Stanford deal. Graham Gooch likened the Stanford Super Series to the film Indecent Proposal. One of the great West Indies cricketers, who did not want to be named, told me: &quot;The ECB should move their offices to the red-light district in Amsterdam because they have prostituted themselves.&quot; The ability to blush at precisely the right moment is a great asset, Oscar Wilde maintained, and one Clarke clearly did not possess last summer when Stanford&apos;s cash-laden helicopter landed at Lord&apos;s, a moment of unforgettable vulgarity. Yesterday, one county chairman said: &quot;Clarke is a clown and a pompous one, and David Collier is a poor chief executive. There is no plan. No strategy. Everything is done off the hoof. Clarke should go.&quot; It is bad enough, such people suggest, to sell one&apos;s soul to the devil. But when the cheque bounces it is a special kind of humiliation. There is certainly a hauteur about Clarke that sometimes can be interpreted as arrogance. He polarises opinions. But Jim May, of Sussex, spoke for a number of other chairmen yesterday when he said: &quot;I think Giles is doing a good job in difficult circumstances. We&apos;re going through a very difficult time and sport is not immune from it. There is a very real concern about commercial income.&quot; And money is where Clarke comes in. Or departs. He was brought in to do deals. The former Surrey chairman Mike Soper, who was more popular with his fellows, was favourite to win the vote last year but as another former chairman said: &quot;While Mike, a lovely man, was wining and dining everyone, Giles was telling us how much money he would bring in. They voted for Giles.&quot; Neil Davidson, the chairman of Leicestershire who has not been shy about criticising the ECB in the past, said last night: &quot;He will be judged on his track record. He&apos;s had a very difficult year but this is a full-time, unpaid job, which is in his favour. Harold Macmillan used to talk about &apos;events&apos;. Well, Giles has already had a lot of events to contend with this year. But I don&apos;t know one county chairman who is prepared to stand against him in March.&quot; Clarke has been making headlines since last spring, when he rejected the impudent notion that England&apos;s leading players might play in the Indian Premier League. Last summer he annoyed the bigger counties by brusquely dismissing a franchise system for the English Premier League. He has also been guilty of over-milking the cash cow that is Twenty20 cricket, a form of the game specifically invented to appeal to a new audience whose loyalty, by definition, cannot be predicted. But, even without Stanford, Clarke has delivered the money. He was doing so before he became chairman when, as leader of the marketing committee, he sold all live TV rights to Sky. John Perera, the ECB&apos;s commercial director, said yesterday: &quot;Overall, we&apos;re in a pretty strong position. Our four-year broadcasting deal, worth \u00a3300m, does not start until 2010 and we have sold Asian broadcasting rights for \u00a340m, though we can expect some turmoil with sponsorship, which represents 14-15% of our income.&quot; Ultimately, Clarke will be judged on the money he brings in.

The prospect of tomorrow&apos;s final against Liga de Quito of Ecuador, however, may interrupt his tranquility a little. &quot;You don&apos;t get many chances to become world champions and we really want to take it,&quot; Rooney said. &quot;It is an ambition of mine to have the complete set of winners&apos; medals in my trophy cabinet. I&apos;ve got a Champions League, two Premier Leagues, a Carling Cup and Community Shield already. And I want to add the Club World Cup to that. I was really disappointed to lose the European Super Cup earlier in the season and I have lost two FA Cup finals so it is a trophy I&apos;m desperate to win. This is another great opportunity for us all.&quot; His United team-mates concur. Edwin van der Sar won what was then the Toyota Cup with a penalty shoot-out victory over Gremio Porto Alegre in 1995, with the star-studded Ajax team of the De Boer twins, Edgar Davids and Patrick Kluivert. His memories suggest the disregard for the event may be more of an English problem than a European one. &quot;There was a big celebration in Amsterdam when we won it in 1995 and about 100,000 people welcomed us back,&quot; the United keeper recalled. &quot;It was a big thing for Ajax to win it in 1995. We didn&apos;t lose a game for 18 months so we were really in the flow. It is not the same as winning the Champions League but I never became a world champion with the national team so it is important to me.&quot; Sir Alex Ferguson and his players admit to knowing little of Liga de Quito but neither are United blind to the threat posed to their ambitions of becoming the first British club to win this tournament in its current guise. Having beaten Fluminense in Brazil to win the Copa Libertadores for the first time in Ecuadorean football history, the South Americans had proven their worth long before United&apos;s coaching team took in their semi-final defeat of the Mexican team Pachuca here on Wednesday. &quot;I played for France against Ecuador so I know they have good players. Quito are a good team,&quot; Evra said. &quot;In the past a lot of big teams like Liverpool and Barcelona have won their first games out here but have lost the final. It is very important because we can do the treble this year. We need to play this game like the final of the Champions League.&quot; Only time will reveal what impact this 12,000-mile round trip and a fixture backlog will have on United&apos;s attempts to win a third successive Premier League title. Rooney, however, believes victory tomorrow will ensure the Club World Cup serves as to help and not hinder that cause. &quot;If we can win this tournament it will give us a real spur for the second half of the season. It would send out a powerful message to the rest of the Premier League,&quot; Rooney said. &quot;We are in a strong position in the league and if we can go back as world champions it would be a great boost and give us a great platform to kick on from. &quot;In the semi-final you could hear the fans singing &apos;Champions of England, Champions of Europe&apos; so it will be great if they can add &apos;Champions of the World&apos; to that. That would sound even better. We want to win it for them, for ourselves and the club.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;There was a big celebration in Amsterdam when we won it in 1995 and about 100,000 people welcomed us back,&quot; the United keeper recalled."], "title": "Football: Wayne Rooney looking to avenge Manchester United's Super Cup loss", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/20/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-world-club", "tags": ["Club World Cup", "Manchester United", "Wayne Rooney", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-20T03:30:00Z", "article": " Hello. It&apos;s not good morning, it&apos;s great morning*. Once upon a time, a 2.30am start would have meant technical problems galore at GU Towers. But not in our plush new abode, oh no. While Glendenning, Murray and the rest were doing Foucault at a meeja party in Bayswater last night, I was tucked away in a remarkable little hotel just round the corner: at \u00a330, it still managed to represent poor value for money. No TV, no sink to p- sorry wash my hands in, and mercifully, given that we&apos;re in Kings Cross, no Lost In Translation-style knocks at the door. Just me, an iPod, an increasingly debilitating dose of man-flu, and a slightly unsettling dream about Ian Bell presenting Sky Sports News with Natalie Sawyer. I did venture to the bar, hoping perhaps for a Lost In Translation-style meeting with a beautifully weary young lady.  There was no bar, but they did have a PC (at least I think it was, although it had the functionality of a ZX81) available to use at a \u00a31 a pop. I didn&apos;t meet any ladies on there. What can I say: if it&apos;s not meant to be it&apos;s not meant to be. *It&apos;s not great morning. It&apos;s not even good morning. I&apos;m only just sure that it&apos;s even morning.  So, no technical problems here, but plenty for England: technically, they are simply not as good technically as India. They hid that superbly for the first three-and-a-half days in Chennai, before inevitably regressing to the mean, but yesterday it was, at times, painfully apparent. However the biggest difference, as is so often the case in sport, is in the mind: India have the certainty of champions, and are in that wonderful zone where everything they do just perpetuates itself, whereas the scab of England&apos;s post-Ashes insecurity is picked all too easily. India resume on 179 for one, needing only a draw to win the series. And if they don&apos;t bat all day today to completely close the door on England, I&apos;ll run naked down Oxford Street or, worse still, spend another night in Hotel Serotonin down the road.  Play will begin at 3.30am because we finished earlier last night, so.  In Perth, Australia are 254 for eight in that wonderful Test against South Africa, a lead of 348. They have lost the offspinner Jason Donovan, whose name I still can&apos;t quite spell, for 32, but a - yes - Gilchristian innings from Brad Haddin (51 not out) has pushed them into a position from which they should win maybe 8.5 times out of 10.  Un email &quot;Ungodly hour greeting (&apos;morning&apos; doesn&apos;t really cover it),&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Surmising that I feel England might get some of the luck today that did not go their way yesterday is a bit like saying that Thom Yorke singing about wishing to be pulled from an air crash was an expression of renewed optimism in the band&apos;s outlook. Swann to get some wickets then.&quot;  In defence of Ian Copestake, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s the type of man who uses the word &apos;surmising&apos;, at least not at this hour. I changed it to that from &apos;saying&apos;, because at first I added a comma after &apos;saying that&apos;, which was entirely erroneous, but it confused me so much that I possibly erroneously assumed that both our other readers are also afflicted by the small brain/man-flu double whammy currently enveloping me. Can a whammy envelop something? I don&apos;t give one and anyone who says otherwise will get a 3am infernal. That doesn&apos;t even make sense does it? I blame the Benylin.  Things that emphatically will perk you up at 3.26.44am Rob Key&apos;s in the Sky studio! Love ya, big guy. Key makes a good point immediately: &quot;England have to be prepared to lose the game to try to win it.&quot; &quot;Do you think he will?&quot; replies Ian Ward. &quot;No.&quot; He&apos;s right, isn&apos;t he. They&apos;ll play just like they did at The Oval in 2007.  73rd over: India 179-1 (Gambhir 106, Dravid 65) So, here we go. The early start gives England an extra half-an-hour&apos;s juice, and you suspect it&apos;s now or never. That means you throw the ball to Freddie, although it&apos;s a surprise to see that he only has one slip. Ah, two balls later he has an extra slips, but Gambhir is rightly happy to leave everything he can and does so to all six deliveries. Here&apos;s Matthew Sackman. &quot;Seeing as it&apos;s 3:20am, and you have just one other poor sucker reading your OBO (which is *fantastic* btw), any chance you could give a public &apos;well done&apos; to Bryn for getting into the RCM starting in September?&quot; I&apos;m too tired to point out that this isn&apos;t 106.4FM, so: well done Bryn.  74th over: India 179-1 (Gambhir 106, Dravid 65) There is barely anybody in the ground, so you don&apos;t need a stump-mic to hear the throaty chatter of England&apos;s fielders. With Matt Prior in the side, this might be a mixed blessing. As Mike Atherton says, the game has an eerie feeling because the ground is so empty. Anyway it&apos;s Broad rather than Anderson, and it&apos;s a much better over than Flintoff&apos;s in that he makes Dravid play at five of the six deliveries, but there&apos;s no discernible sideways movement - that&apos;s a big blow to England - and Dravid survives comfortably. &quot;Key?&quot; sniffs Eamonn Maloney. &quot;Is that overnourished boffin still pushing them through the covers? Looked OK when we last saw him down here, but a little underdone, rather like a Christmas pork after five minutes in the microwave.&quot;  75th over: India 183-1 (Gambhir 110, Dravid 65) Flintoff, having failed to make Gambhir touch leather, switches to over the wicket. But it&apos;s more of the same until Gambhir chooses to play at the third delivery, cutting it crisply for four. It&apos;s interesting how Duncan Fletcher, whose word is gospel in my house, increasingly refers to Andrew Flintoff as a defensive bowler. I suppose he has to be in such a poor side, but imagine if he was a strike bowler, four-over spells maximum, in a really good side? He&apos;s the bowling equivalent of Mike Atherton, forced to sacrifice himself because of the poverty of the resources around him. And just as Atherton&apos;s batting average (37?) doesn&apos;t do him justice, so Flintoff&apos;s bowling average, which will probably sit in the thirties when he retires, will be in no way representative of his splendid talent. I&apos;d take him over any English bowler since early Botham, with the possible exception of Gough and McCague. What do both of you think? Who is the best English fast bowler of the last 25 years? WELL? &quot;3am infernal?&quot; sniffs Alex Hughes. &quot;Isn&apos;t it 3am Eternal with Dravid batting us further into MuMu land? Reading that back I&apos;m betting my Beijing Man-Flu is stronger than your London strain.&quot; Wrong: I&apos;ve just died. Bad luck. I win.  76th over: India 187-1 (Gambhir 110, Dravid 69) I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s good or bad for England: Dravid is beaten on the inside by a vicious grubber that just missed off stump. Broad, excited by that, overcompensates next ball, spearing a low full-toss onto the pads; Dravid does the necessary without thinking, flipping it through midwicket. India look pretty watertight just now. &quot;Any chance you could persuade Dravid to nick one?&quot; asks Pranav Sharma. &quot;Much as I like him, I fear I will surely fall asleep following him plod his way through the first session. What I need to stay awake is some shot-making from Sachin.&quot; I know what you mean, but it&apos;s wonderful to see this man, a champion and a wonderful human being, coming back into form. One of my saddest memories of watching cricket is Graham Gooch&apos;s last series in Australia in 1994-95, when he was a joke with a moustache; no great player should go out like that.  77th over: India 187-1 (Gambhir 110, Dravid 69) A quick blast of the newish iPod ad between overs, containing the wonderful &apos;Bruises&apos; by Chairlift, injects a bit of serotonin into the eyeballs. Anyway, Flintoff forces Gambhir to jack-knife with a sharp and very well-directed bouncer. Flintoff is switching over and around the wicket, but Gambhir is leaving him often and well. He looks a serious find. &quot;Talking of hotel-based fun,&quot; begins Kat Petersen, &quot;how is this for a set-up - we are in the back of a van on a caravan site in western Mexico, with a laptop that is slowly turning the van into a sauna, but can&apos;t open the windows for all the mosquitos outside. My friend is sick, so I&apos;ve had to cook instant sweetcorn soup on a camping stove while trying to come up with examples of sports that England are best at. Any ideas? Apparently Canada have ice hockey, curling, lacrosse and snow boarding covered. On top of that we had our bags stolen about a week ago, so I am currently without a passport and my copy of Cricket Lovely Cricket which is now in some Mexican bandit&apos;s hands. On the plus side, it is about 27 degrees here during the day . . . and the cricket is on at a reasonably civilised time (currently 8.40 p.m.).&quot; At 8.40pm last night I was in hell or purgatory; like Chris Moltisanti, I can&apos;t tell them apart. But I know they are both to be found within the walls of Hotel Serotonin, Kings Cross. As for sports, is self-hate a sport?  78th over: India 188-1 (Gambhir 110, Dravid 70) Dravid gets the first single of the morning. England haven&apos;t bowled full enough to get significant reverse, although the moisture would probably have precluded it anyway, so you suspect they will take the new ball at the first opportunity, in two overs&apos; time. That really is it: if England don&apos;t take two quick wickets then, it&apos;s over.  In Perth, Australia have really got away: they are 288 for nine, a lead of 382. Remember, they were 162 for seven at one point. A generous man would say South Africa have let the tortoise get away from them; a harsh man would say they are the biggest bottlers in the history of sport.  79th over: India 190-1 (Gambhir 111, Dravid 71) Graeme Swann is on, a quick roll of the dice before the new ball. There&apos;s a tentative shout for a bat-pad catch at slip off Dravid when Swann rips one through the gate, but Asad Rauf is having none of it, and rightly so. &quot;Best England fast bowler of the last 25 years would, but for injury, have been Simon Jones,&quot; says Mac Millings. Jones, excellent as he is, is a great example of a player who improved when he didn&apos;t play. Don&apos;t forget, he was dropped four Tests before the Ashes of 2005; a couple of clean-up jobs on the Australian tail later and he was a legend. He&apos;s a really good bowler, but in my humble one he&apos;s not fit to shine Gough&apos;s Kookaburra.  80th over: India 198-1 (Gambhir 119, Dravid 71) It&apos;s Panesar at the other end, but India for the most part play spinners with the effortlessness of a lothario holding eye contact for that crucial extra split-second. Gambhir rocks back to cut authoritatively for four, not once but twice.  &quot;Self-hate is apparently not a sport,&quot; says Kat Petersen, &quot;under the currently accepted definition that sports are only activities that can&apos;t be done in dress shoes.&quot; Mac Millings concurs: &quot;No, self-hate is not a sport, because anything that the English are good at cannot, by definition, be a sport.&quot; We&apos;re back to that wretched default setting: gallows humour. Remember that marvellous 18 months of cricket when the only think we joked about was the opposition. It feels like a mirage, although so do most things now that I&apos;ve necked a half-bottle on Benylin.  81st over: India 207-1 (Gambhir 119, Dravid 80) Jimmy Anderson takes the new ball, and it&apos;s an eventful over: nine runs and two near misses. First he almost gets through Dravid with his second delivery. Dravid went back and played the ball into the ground, from where it slipped between his legs and just wide of leg stump. The next ball leg-cuts late and turns Dravid round completely, but the edge flies low to third man for four. The next ball also goes for four to third man, squeezed deliberately this time. This is now India&apos;s record second-wicket partnership against England. Finally Gambhir tries to cut a ball that is far too close for the shot, but he manages to just get enough bat on it to stop it from rearranging his furniture.  82nd over: India 215-1 (Gambhir 119, Dravid 88) It&apos;s Broad at the other end, and it&apos;s another eventful over. Dravid waves the first, wide delivery through the covers for four. The second ball is a gem: full, drawing Dravid forward into the corridor, and them moves a long way and late to beat the outside edge. The third ball is garbage - short, wide, and deliberately whooshed over the cordon for four. &quot;Didn&apos;t you folks win gold in Bottling Up Emotions and Avoiding EmbarrassingScenes in Beijing? (Yes that and so many more medals than Australia, blah blah blah...)&quot; says Eamonn Maloney, weeping into his Ashes 06-07 dvd.  83rd over: India 216-1 (Gambhir 120, Dravid 88) Anderson beats a groping Dravid with another nice awayswinger. England simply must strike now or it&apos;s over. For South Africa, however, it&apos;s probably too late: Australia&apos;s lead is past 400, and Brad Haddin, who has just welted Paul Harris for 16 runs in three deliveries, is within six runs of a life-changing century. (Yes I know he got one in his last Test, but that was, y&apos;know, New Zealand.) &quot;Dull start so far, but just thought I&apos;d brighten your darkness by letting you know that not only have I traversed the frozen wastes to make it to the living room for the OBO, but am about to get my cricketing morning off to a cracking start with a combination of a certain supermarket&apos;s own version of Red Bull and a bacon sarnie,&quot; says Clare Davies, rubbing salt in my weeping wounds as I nurse a cold cup of coffee and a half-eaten Lion bar. &quot;Yum. Far more exciting than the start of play, I would venture to suggest.&quot;  84th over: India 222-1 (Gambhir 126, Dravid 88) Broad leaps up and down for an LBW when a big inswinger thunders into Gambhir&apos;s pads, but it pitched outside leg and then swung further away. Good decision by Daryl Harper. Later in the over, Broad knocks Gambhir off his feet with another inswinger. Gambhir responds with a delicious push-drive through mid-off four four. In Perth, Brad Haddin has been stumped for 94, presumably trying to reach his century in the grand manner, so Australia are all out for 319 and South Africa will need 414. Good luck with that.  85th over: India 226-1 (Gambhir 126, Dravid 92) Anderson turns Dravid round again, and the edge flies low to gully. This has been a very decent spell from Anderson, and he&apos;s unlucky with the final ball of the over, which finds the edge but flies low for four. In Dravid&apos;s defence, he played with feather-light hands. &quot;You&apos;re looking at it all wrong (80th over),&quot; says Mac Millings, poking a finger into my eye to make the point. &quot;During &apos;that marvellous 18 months&apos; when England were good at cricket, cricket was not a sport, because England were good at it. Other times that well-known sports were, briefly, not sports include: July 30th, 1966; November 22nd, 2003; and for around 15 minutes (too little, too late) on June 22nd, 1986.&quot; Is that when Neal Radford made his Test debut?  86th over: India 226-1 (Gambhir 126, Dravid 92) Flintoff is on for Broad, who mixes good and bad deliveries in his two-over spell, and he beats Gambhir with a booming outswinger that started wide and went wider. Then he beats him with another wide delivery that invited the cut; Gambhir fresh-aired it. &quot;Flintoff is the best English paceman for 25 years, but we haven&apos;t got the most from him because he has had to bat No6,&quot; says Gary Naylor, who is actually emailing this in his sleep you know. &quot;This means that he has seldom had a new ball in hand and has often bowled to set batsmen. Mind you, by that reasoning, Jacques Kallis should have 700 Test wickets. PS Brad Haddin is batting superbly with a frighteningly competent Australian tail.&quot; Do we really attribute him not taking the new ball to batting No6? Even when he has batted No7 he hasn&apos;t taken it much. I don&apos;t think he fancies it.  87th over: India 230-1 (Gambhir 127, Dravid 95) Dravid forces Anderson through the covers for three. He&apos;s nearly there.  88th over: India 236-1 (Gambhir 131, Dravid 96) A brute of a bouncer from Flintoff, over the wicket and on the line of leg stump, has Gambhir recoiling as dramatically as a man who&apos;s just whiffed the wrong paint. Gambhir, rattled, waves unconvincingly at the next ball, short but slanted across him, and it flies through the vacant third-slip area for four. Gambhir does the sensible thing and gets off strike next ball. &quot;Mac&apos;s argument (85th over) is seductive,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Is it why darts and snooker aren&apos;t in the Olympics?&quot; That and the fact they are games played by men whose only exercise in the last 30 years has been jumping to conclusions.  Long email, probably too long to put mid-over &quot;Graeme Hick may disagree, but that six runs Haddin fell short of his century will mean little to him sitting on a 400+ lead,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;The difference between the Saffers and the Aussies at the end of that Test is likely to be fewer runs than the difference between the last four wickets on each side. Matt Prior really should be as good as Haddin (who looked terrible vs India) but he has a long way to go before he can play an innings like that. Like many England players, Prior appears to get better coaching at his county than he gets with England.&quot; Naylor bangs on about runs from the bottom four, but he is right: in the late 90s and early 00s, Booth did the stats round-up for Wisden Cricket Monthly after every Ashes series, and in every series the top six averaged around the same. The difference was the bottom five: not just GIlchrist/Healy, but people like Damien Fleming getting 70s. As for Haddin, it&apos;s just a state of mind, isn&apos;t it? England are uptight, and it&apos;s unthinkable that, with a game in the balance, they could counter-attack with the certainty shown by Flintoff and Jones in 2004-05 or, too use a specific example, Vaughan and Trescothick at Johannesburg. That was one of the mentally toughest partnerships I&apos;ve ever seen from an England team.  89th over: India 239-1 (Gambhir 131, Dravid 98) Dravid moves to 98 with a work off the pads for two, but the nervousness of the nineties is more acute than usual and he is squared up twice by Anderson. That&apos;s drinks, so I&apos;m off to score some Colombian. &quot;Gary Naylor&apos;s right about the Australian tail; they have three No8s and a No9,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;The good news is that cricket will remain a sport throughout next summer.&quot;  90th over: India 240-1 (Gambhir 131, Dravid 99) Flintoff is bowling a really marvellous spell here, and he beats Dravid with a deliberately wide outswinger. Has any bowler in history ever had a higher moral victories/wickets ratio? The pitch, the Sky boys reckon, has quickened up today, and Prior is taking the ball higher than he was in the final session yesterday (I didn&apos;t see the first two). Dravid tucks the penultimate ball off his pads to reach 99. &quot;Not wanting to question Mr. Naylor, but could he explain how batting at No6 has meant Fred not having the new ball?&quot; says Alex Hughes. &quot;I don&apos;t get it. Is the inference that he has to concentrate more on batting in practice so he doesn&apos;t bowl enough to warrant it?&quot; It&apos;s a huge burden. He did it a lot in Australia in 2006-07, when he also captained, and it broke him. Very few players have batted six and opened the bowling: Imran and Sobers spring to mind, but they didn&apos;t do it as much as people think.  91st over: India 241-1 (Gambhir 131, Dravid 100) There it is! Dravid works Anderson to fine leg to reach his 26th Test hundred, and his first for 11 Tests. It hasn&apos;t been a classic innings, but it&apos;s been a wonderfully resilient one. File this only a notch below Mark Taylor at Edgbaston in 1997 as one of the great career-saving centuries, and salute one of the good guys of world sport. He has been in woeful form since his last century, and it&apos;s a pleasure to see him back among the runs. It&apos;s a really nice celebration, too: muted, businesslike, dripping dignity. He&apos;s just a class act in every respect.  92nd over: India 243-1 (Gambhir 132, Dravid 101) You wonder whether India will even attempt to kick on - their current scoring rate is 2.65 per over - or whether these two will just bat and bat and bat and bat and bat. I certainly don&apos;t see them declaring today, or until they reach 10 million. Flintoff beats Dravid for the 947th time, and then unsettles him with a nasty lifter that Dravid eventually does well to glove safely into the leg side. Gee he&apos;s bowling well, and he&apos;s doing it with a smile on his face and some friendly banter with Dravid.  93rd over: India 247-1 (Gambhir 136, Dravid 101) Anderson beats Gambhir with consecutive deliveries. England have deserved a wicket with the new ball; both Anderson and Flintoff have been excellent. Saying which, the last ball is short, wide, and cut for four by Gambhir. &quot;I suspect you&apos;re right about Flintoff not fancying the new ball, but by batting at six or even seven, he&apos;s been indulged,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;There&apos;s no reason why Flintoff shouldn&apos;t be a new-ball bowler. In a parallel universe, James Foster would have kicked on and nailed down the No7 slot, Andrew Symonds would have opted for England and played 100 Tests at No6 and Flintoff would have been the best No8 we&apos;d ever had.&quot; Now that I do like: imagine Symmo and Flintoff coming in at 350 for six. I wonder whether England should have taken a risk and put Symonds in the full squad rather than the A squad in 1995, to really test how much he loved the Baggy Green. I know that&apos;s not how you should really go about picking your teams but, well, we do, don&apos;t we. I don&apos;t, incidentally, buy it that Flintoff wasn&apos;t good enough for No6 - he averaged 43 there between 2003 and 2006 - but that&apos;s another argument for another day. I do think Flintoff is affected by mood and conditions more than almost any other batsmen in modern history, which has created selection problems.  94th over: India 248-1 (Gambhir 136, Dravid 101) I remember reading something about Roy Keane once. When Nottm Forest signed him, apparently what impressed the scout the most was that, with the score 0-5 or something, Keane was still demanding the ball, cajoling players and doing everything properly when all his teammates had thrown it in. You learn a lot about people in these situations, and in that respect England will learn a lot here. The game and the series has gone, but they will find out a lot about Broad, Swann, Panesar and Anderson. There is nothing more to know about the marvellous Flintoff, who gets no reward for another challenging over there. &quot;A prediction,&quot; begins Joe Meredith. &quot;A monumental Test, and England to win. And if not, I&apos;d better win this enormous Spanish lottery I paid 10 euros for.&quot; A prediction: Meredith to be hungover in approximately two hours&apos; time.  95th over: India 252-1 (Gambhir 136, Dravid 105) Broad replaces Anderson and Dravid pushes his first ball deliciously through mid-off for four. England are doing some seriously hard yards here, but they&apos;re doing it with a smile on their face, which I suppose is to their credit. If you can&apos;t enjoy life when you&apos;re having your nose ground into the dust, when can you enjoy it? &quot;Bumble mumbles that what England are lacking io a pitch like this is someone like Kumble,&quot; says Anand. &quot;The closest England has gotten to having a good leggie is when Warney played county cricket! Any other contenders?&quot; Adil Rashid has promise, but after the premature promotion of Chris Schofield it is almost inevitable that he will be overcooked rather than undercooked. He should make his debut sometime around 2021, in a dead rubber.  96th over: India 252-1 (Gambhir 136, Dravid 105) Flintoff, who has a monopoly on great nought-fors in India (he&apos;s 21-6-43-0 here) takes a break, so KP turns to his premier spinner, Graeme Swann. Gambhir tries to use his feet, first down the track and then backing to leg, but it&apos;s not convincing: he scuffs an atttempted lofted drive off the bottom of the bat and not a million miles wide of Swann. A maiden. &quot;Dravid&apos;s a class act in every respect bar one - &apos;entertainer&apos;,&quot; says Eamonn Maloney. &quot;Ruined my day at Adelaide a few years ago when he made 200 off about 1,836 deliveries. Having a good defence is fine, but too often he treats mediocre deliveries with far too much respect.&quot; Remind me who won that Adelaide Test.  97th over: India 259-1 (Gambhir 141, Dravid 107) Broad drops one in short and Gambhir cracks a pull stroke for four. He was off balance, head jerking around like a coked-up Max Headroom, but he absolutely laced it through midwicket. Broad still bowls too many four-balls, although in fairness that was more a good shot than a bad ball. &quot;Flintoff is clearly England&apos;s best bowler,&quot; says Rana. &quot;He will be with new ball or old. But the reason he should bat at number 7 or lower is because he should have freedom to bat without care. It really shouldn&apos;t matter whether he scores 5 or 105, he&apos;ll still be first pick in the team for bowling alone. And without pressure runs generally come easier. &quot; I&apos;m not sure about this. I think he has done his best work when he has played as a batsman rather than a hitter. His century at Trent Bridge in 2005 was the most glorious innings. He didn&apos;t hit a ball all day, but he stroked umpteen boundaries. I know he was in a once-in-a-lifetime zone then, and I suspect he might be past his best as a batsman, but whether he&apos;s sufficiently past it to say, &apos;just go and swing&apos;, I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s all about balance, and at the moment he&apos;s clearly gone too far into his shell.  98th over: India 261-1 (Gambhir 141, Dravid 109) Half an hour to lunch, which I intend to celebrate by making myself puke in the hope I&apos;ll feel better as a result. In an unrelated development, Swann switches around the wicket to Dravid. It almost brings a wicket, as Dravid drags an ugly smear just wide of the diving Strauss at midwicket. That was so unlike a class act like Dravid, like seeing Cate Blanchett with two fags dangling from the side of her mouth. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you who the winner of that Test was - not &apos;Cricket&apos;,&quot; says Eamonn Maloney, inexplicably capitalising cricket. &quot;An utter boredom fest. And nor was it the team who are currently cruising to victory against the second-best Test team in the world in Perth.&quot; Tell it to Judge Wisden, Maloney.  99th over: India 263-1 (Gambhir 143, Dravid 109) Paul Collingwood is on in place of Broad, and Gambhir tucks him off the pads for two to reach 1000 Test runs for the year, a milestone that was clearly on his mind. I&apos;m with Mike Atherton: why should such an irrelevant milestone mean so much?  Anyway, there&apos;s a temptation to feel that this game is drifting towards a draw, so languorous has it been, but there are still 11 sessions left. Factor in a pitch that is doing a bit, weight of runs and the fact that England will be batting in the peculiarly soul-crushing environment of having to save a Test you needed to win to level a series, and you have to feel that India are big favourites.  In Perth, South Africa have got off to a blistering start in pursuit of 414 to win the match: they are 2 for 0 after 4.5 overs.  100th over: India 263-1 (Gambhir 143, Dravid 110) &quot;Speaking of poor No6s, Botham averaged 33.54 over his career, but29.23 at No6,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;I loved him when I was a kid, but looking back, wasn&apos;t he the most overrated cricketer of all time? And while I&apos;m ranting, it took Gatting until his 31st Test to make his first hundred, and he ended his career of 79 Tests with an average of 35.55. He would have been a huge waste of space even if he hadn&apos;t been so fat. No relevance to today&apos;s action - it&apos;s just annoyed me for going on 20 years.&quot; I agree that the eighties, a supposed golden age of English cricket, was hilariously overrated and probably even worse than the supposedly shambolic nineties (Scyld Berry wrote a great piece on this in the very first Wisden Cricketer). But Botham less so. He&apos;s one of those players, like Gilchrist, who you shouldn&apos;t really judge by statistics, and he won a helluva lot of matches. That said, he was finished as a bowler by, what, 25, and his record against the Windies deserves more criticism than it gets. The annoying thing is that, when his bowling went to seed, he didn&apos;t become a No5, because technically he was a wonderful batsman.  101st over: India 272-1 (Gambhir 149, Dravid 111) Pietersen is off the field, with Strauss in charge, and he watches Gambhir cream a pull shot to the fence off Collingwood&apos;s lolloping bouncer. England are helping themselves, and there is nothing England can do. &quot;What makes Flintoff such a good bowler - his imposing physical presence and &apos;heavy ball&apos; - is what makes his Test batting short of true all-rounder status,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;At the batting crease, his inability to be keep his movements short and light means that he has to rely too often on a good, but not great, eye. KP and Graeme Smith are big men too, but there&apos;s a naturalness in their movements that Flintoff lacks. This flaw is masked by ODI cricket which has kept us believing that Flintoff is a true all-rounder for too long.&quot; Again, though, I think this comes back to form: when Flintoff is out of it he looks awful, lumbering and hard-handed, but when he&apos;s in nick (certainly for much of that 03-06 period) he looks limber and flexible. Or am I guilty of nostalgic imagining?  102nd over: India 285-1 (Gambhir 158, Dravid 116) Thirteen from the over. First Gambhir reaches his 150 with an emphatic slog-sweep for four off Swann. What a superb innings this has been from the second-best find of the cricketing year, after the extraordinary Ajantha Mendis. Gambhir celebrates with a remarkable shot, dancing miles to drive inside-out through extra-cover for four. He&apos;s slipped gears now, and no mistake. Dravid may have too: he crashes a long hop from Swann for four to end a profitable over.  103rd over: India 290-1 (Gambhir 159, Dravid 120) Panesar is on for only his second over of the day. He&apos;s shot. He&apos;s going through the motions, like Sarah Polley scanning the shopping in the film Go, eyes glazed and staring off into the distance. His third ball is short and wide and cut with consummate ease for four by Dravid. Clearly it isn&apos;t the end for Monty, as he has far too much raw talent, but maybe the time has come for a break from Test cricket. &quot;Hangover fodder I may be, but all this No7 or lower talk makes me angry,&quot; says Joe Meredith. &quot;Why pick Flintoff as a bowler, when it&apos;s as an all-rounder that teams are scared of him? It&apos;s like de-clawing him.&quot;  104th over: India 298-1 (Gambhir 167, Dravid 120) It&apos;s almost a shot a ball from Gambhir now, and he drags a sweep for four off Swann&apos;s first ball, and then makes room to blast the final ball over cover for four more. It&apos;s going to be a chastening, leather-chasing afternoon session for England all right. &quot;I&apos;m liking Smith and McKenzie, leaving as much as they can in Perth,&quot; says Gary Naylor (they are currently 8 for 0 after nine overs). &quot;If the Saffers can bat out a draw over the next five sessions, it&apos;ll feel like a win for them and a defeat for Aus - going to Melbourne, that&apos;s no bad result for Smith and co. Test cricket rewards more than just T20-lite batting, and rightly so.&quot; If there&apos;s any top six that can bat the best part of five sessions, it&apos;s this cold-minded South African line-up. Smith and McKenzie, of course, did a wonderful job in not dissimilar circumstances at Lord&apos;s in the summer. (It sounds absurd, but I&apos;d love to see McGrath bowling to McKenzie: it would be the first game of who-blinks-first that actually never ends.) Mind you, beware moral victories: England claimed one after batting five sessions in Johannesburg in 1995-96, and look what happened then.  105th over: India 302-1 (Gambhir 167, Dravid 124) That&apos;s lunch. It was emphatically India&apos;s session: 33 overs, 123 runs, no wickets. England bowled well enough, particularly with the new ball, but they are simply being outplayed by a much better team. See you in 40 minutes for more of the same.  LUNCH  Lunchtime email &quot;Botham overrated?&quot; sniffs Gary Naylor. &quot;More a case of supreme talent wasted. In his early twenties, he was the best English bowler I&apos;ve ever seen. Post 1982, he was an ordinary bowler who could do what Flintoff can&apos;t - take wickets whilst bowling pie after pie after pie. His attitude to practice tells you all you need to know about what he thought of batting. He had the talent to match Imran&apos;s late career batting (Imran averaged 60 in his last 28 Tests!), but Sir Iron Bottom seemed to prefer not to bother.&quot; Imran is a remarkable character: in his last 10 years of Test cricket, he averaged 50 with the bat and 21 with the ball. On figures alone (being such a cherubic figure, you&apos;ll realise I didn&apos;t really see either man play), I&apos;m surprised people don&apos;t at least question his right to be bracketed above Sobers.  Another lunchtime email &quot;Rob, over 90,&quot; says Ray S. &quot;Kapil Dev opened the bowling and batted at 6 for much of his career. Well he had to as we had nothing better to offer by way of fast bowling for decades. Returning to Flintoff, what he really needs is some support at the other end. This England side reminds me of the 1980s India side, which had only two world-class players - a top order batsman and an all-rounder. Minus the World Cup of course.&quot; Ha, thanks for that. Did Kapil not bat No7 a lot more than he did No6, though?  In Perth, South Africa are 18 for none after 14 overs, and Channel 9&apos;s three-way commentary team of Mark Nicholas, Ian Chappell and Ian Healy are all getting rightly funky about the fact that the numbers on South Africa&apos;s shirts to denote which number Test player you are only began with their readmission in 1992. What is that about? Chappell calls it a &quot;joke&quot; and Nicholas a &quot;damn insult&quot;. Damn right. The three-way team, which seems like far too much of a good thing, actually works pretty well in my admittedly limited experience. The quality and variety of the commentators helps, mind. It&apos;s such a shame that Nicholas doesn&apos;t commentate on our winter Tests, because he is marvellous. That Channel 4 2005 team - Benaud, Nicholas, Boycott, Greig, Atherton, Slater - was as good as it gets. Awp, Neil McKenzie has gone, snicking a good off-cutter from Mitchell Johnson to Brad Haddin. This will be a big victory for Australia: not only in the obvious sense, but because two players - Johnson and Haddin - have come of age in the process. They will win the Ashes by at least two Tests next summer, probably three. \u00a310 of my bank-charges fund says so.  I wonder how Guardian Sport&apos;s finest got on at their party last night. They&apos;re probably still there, monged out, listening to Spiritualized, stirring occasionally to snort a line of Persil, thinking it&apos;s Ariel. Losers.  Right, here we go England really are entering a world of pain now, with India resuming on 302 for one. &quot;Morning Smyth,&quot; chirps Jeremy Theobald. &quot;Hotel-related fun. Bashforth and I were staying at the Great John St Hotel in Manchester this year for the Old Trafford Test. We retired to the lounge with the esteemed sports writer and colleague of yours, Jonathan Wilson, for a few digestivs after dinner. Bashforth and Wilson on the sofa failed to see the large man sitting in the corner with a tattoo over half his head who was surrounded by no fewer than eight ladies of indubitable reputation, and so missed Mike Tyson who was staying there for the Hatton fight against Juan Lazcano that weekend. Try to keep off the Benylin.&quot; Wilson was probably too busy espousing his theory of how 4-6-0 is symptomatic of an increasingly anarchic society*. Actually, to tie up both your points, I saw all sorts of famous people - Ian Bell, Victoria Pendleton, Johnny from Menswear, Mrs Doyle and even you, Theobald - in my hotel last night. But I think that was the Benylin hallucinations. * I jest. Wilson&apos;s newish book is quite outstanding and unequivocally recommended. He&apos;s wrong about the &quot;emphatic&quot; 3-2 at Old Trafford in 2000, mind.  106th over: India 309-1 (Gambhir 169, Dravid 129) Swann starts after lunch, and is milked for three singles and then whipped crisply to the midwicket fence by Dravid.  107th over: India 310-1 (Gambhir 170, Dravid 129) In recent times, England have faced some brutal experiences in the field in the final Test of a series on the subcontinent - Sri Lanka 2003-04, Pakistan 2005-06 - and this is right up there. It&apos;s hard to be too critical, and that reflects his circumstances rather than an innate lack of fight. Only Panesar has dropped his head. It&apos;s just that they are not good enough. Anyway, Anderson starts at the other end. Bumble jokes about India batting four days but, seriously, why not try to break Sri Lanka&apos;s world record score here? I suppose there are ICC Test Championship points for winning the Test, but it would be a hell of a statement from a side that is very close to being, at least unofficially, the world&apos;s best. Obviously it would drive me and all the other OBOers to a Lisbon sisters-style party, but you can&apos;t have everything.  108th over: India 313-1 (Gambhir 173, Dravid 129) Swann is back over the wicket to Gambhir, who inside-edges a big yahoo down to fine leg for three. &quot;Wilson was actually too busy moaning about the numpty Mancunian barmaid who had just put ice in our XO Remy Martin,&quot; says Jeremy Theobald. &apos;Numpty&apos; is a word that needs reviving, along with &apos;frenchie&apos;, &apos;crud&apos; and &apos;McCague&apos;.  109th over: India 319-1 (Gambhir 179, Dravid 129) Gambhir is looking a bit skittish, and misses a flail at a wide delivery from the increasingly exasperated Anderson. He gets hold of the next ball, however, flapping a pull shot for two. Then he slaps a cut over backward point for four, prompting Anderson to have a few words, at least one of which was &quot;off&quot;. Dear me; he&apos;s on 179 man!  WICKET! India 320-2 (Gambhir c Cook b Swann 179) In hindsight, that was coming. Gambhir has been a bit airy-fairy since lunch, and he&apos;s missed a great chance for another double-hundred. He came down the track to drive a length delivery from Swann inside-out over extra-cover, but it gripped enough to take the edge and looped gently to Cook, running back from gully. It&apos;s a wicket that Swann deserves, but in the grand scheme it means nothing.  110th over: India 320-2 (Dravid 130, Tendulkar 0) &quot;Look who&apos;s just turned up for dinner&quot; says Bumble, as Sachin Tendulkar marches purposefully to the crease.  111th over: India 326-2 (Dravid 136, Tendulkar 0) Dravid tucks Anderson off the pads for two and then back-cuts beautifully for four. If his first 100 runs were largely scratchy, he has played very fluently since.  112th over: India 327-2 (Dravid 136, Tendulkar 1) Tendulkar gets off the mark. The average pulse-rate in India doubles. &quot;Just setting off from Tonbridge to see Heart of Mid-Lothian play Dundee United,&quot; says Davy Allan. &quot;There will be a minute&apos;s silence for John Cumming, Hearts&apos; most honoured player. So we&apos;ll be following you on the train assuming WIFI is working. Maybe a wicket or two will have fallen by 9:00 PM.&quot; A nice slip. Even if they were bowling till 9pm I&apos;m not sure two wickets would have fallen.  113th over: India 328-2 (Dravid 136, Tendulkar 2) Tendulkar is dutifully playing himself in. There&apos;s no rush here, and at the moment both sides are playing fairly defensively, which means the game has stopped for a bit. Dravid has an unwise nibble at Anderson and is beaten.  WICKET! India 329-3 (Dravid c Panesar b Swann 136) Top-class spin bowling from Graeme Swann. He beat Dravid in flight and lack of pace, and Dravid&apos;s checked stroke - which was originally intended to go over the leg side - looped high to deep mid-off, where Monty Panesar took a simple catch. It&apos;s quite an achievement to do Rahul Dravid like that at the best of times, even more so when he has been batting for 474 hours.  114th over: India 329-3 (Tendulkar 3, Laxman 0) England have to get Flintoff on for Anderson now and have one last burst. You just never know*. &quot;In Perth, Aus look as toothless as a bowling unit as England do in Mohali.. with one exception,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Mitchell Johnson has match figures of nine for 67 off 31 overs, but his teammates have two for 313 which is about right. The Aus bowling unit is reliant on old pacers (Clark and Lee), punts like Krejza and Siddle, batting all-rounders (Watson and Symonds) and one class act (Johnson). India are well ahead of Aus as the best team in the world right now and if Mendis can bowl away from the sub-continent the way he bowls on it, they&apos;ll be behind the Lankans too.&quot; With Sri Lanka, it&apos;s about more than Mendis. They haven&apos;t won a series outside the subcontinent (and Zimbabwe) since 1995, a truly pathetic statistic.  * You do know.  115th over: India 329-3 (Tendulkar 3, Laxman 0) It&apos;s still Anderson, banging it in back of a length to the new batsman Laxman, who defends fairly comfortably.  &quot;I will see your Martin McCague and raise you Scott Muller,&quot; says Eamonn Maloney. &quot;A numpty. That frenchie was absolute crud.&quot; I felt really sorry for Muller. That ostracism was pretty nasty, no?  116th over: India 330-3 (Tendulkar 4, Laxman 0) That&apos;s lovely from Swann, who beats Tendulkar with a quicker arm ball. Then Tendulkar scuffs a slightly ungainly sweep for a single. I get very few things right, but I did predict before the series that Swann would outbowl Monty. I. Am. Skill. Actually Swann and Flintoff are the only England bowlers averaging under 70 in this series, which is pretty bad.  117th over: India 331-3 (Tendulkar 5, Laxman 0) Tendulkar turns Anderson a fraction short of Flintoff of midwicket. That looked like it stopped on the pitch. In other news, South Africa are doing okay in Perth: they have reached tea on 64 for one. They need another 350 runs or, more probably, have to bat four sessions for the draw.  118th over: India 336-3 (Tendulkar 10, Laxman 0) Tendulkar laces a short delivery from Swann through the covers for four.  Mike Boulton may or may not have a better life than me. You decide. &quot;It&apos;s a pleasant 30c here in Adelaide and we&apos;re just watching Australia do some cleaning up in Perth before heading down to the beach for a barbecue a let the dog have a run after the ball. Speaking of dogs chasing balls perhaps they need to adopt the idea of loan players in Test cricket - a bit like in the premier league. England might have wanted to borrow one M Johnson for this game.&quot; Was it Terry Alderman who suggested that a few years ago? It&apos;s a daft idea, obviously, but then it&apos;s not a million miles removed from taking players on a dual-passport.  119th over: India 337-3 (Tendulkar 11, Laxman 0) Flintoff replaces Anderson and immediately starts pounding the middle of the pitch. Tendulkar leaps onto the back foot and, at the first realistic opportunity, follows The Geoff Boycott Guide To Facing Good Bowlers and gets down the other end. &quot;It was nasty,&quot; says Eamonn Maloney of Scott Muller&apos;s ostracism, &quot;but no-one was going to make Warnie a pariah. But he is deserving of a sort of vicarious derision in that he was another product of those errant selection policies - there was no way he was ready for, or deserving of, a spot in the Test team.&quot; He&apos;s hardly alone in that, though. Remember Matt Nicholson? Peter McIntyre? Simon Cook?  WICKET! India 337-4 (Tendulkar LBW b Swann 11) Swann gets his third wicket. Tendulkar tries to play a peculiar paddle stroke to a ball that turned and hit him on the front pad in front of off and middle. Daryl Harper took a long time before raising the finger, but it just looked out, and Hawkeye confirms it would have hit the top of middle.  120th over: India 339-4 (Laxman 0, Yuvraj 2) Do England have a sniff here? Almost certainly not, but you still have to admire the zest and intelligence of Swann&apos;s work, given that he came on at 300-odd for one. His figures are 29-5-77-3.  WICKET! India 339-5 (Laxman LBW b Flintoff 0) Laxman, becalmed for 23 balls, falls to his 24th. It&apos;s a richly deserved wicket for Flintoff, who jagged one back to strike the pads, and Asad Rauf raised the finger. At first I thought there was an inside-edge, but replays didn&apos;t really suggest one and it was certainly hitting the top of leg. Flintoff doesn&apos;t celebrate, instead putting his hands on his hips as if to say, &quot;About effing time&quot;. It was, as Howard Swains to my left points out, all a bit Cantonaesque.  121st over: India 339-5 (Yuvraj 2, Dhoni 0) India have lost four wickets for 19 now. That was a peculiar innings from Laxman. Languorous at the best of times, he looked half asleep here.  122nd over: India 345-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 0) Yuvraj takes Swann for four and then two, and is then beaten by a pitch that spins from off and middle to beat the edge.  123rd over: India 346-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 1) No chat between Flintoff and Yuvraj yet. It has started drizzling in Mohali, but for now play goes on. &quot;You have to admire Swanny&apos;s ticker,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;He&apos;s almost an exact like-for-like for Ashley Giles, who lost just 12 of the 54 Tests he played (Monty has already lost 11 of his 35, with this one to add). Swanny may never have Monty&apos;s talent, but he&apos;ll always find a way to contribute - and that goes a long way in Test cricket.&quot;  124th over: India 346-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 1) To be honest, I&apos;ve completely lost my rag here. In the last two hours, Soura Dasgupta has sent 30 emails calling me a racist and a &quot;wanker&quot;, mainly referring to the first email of his that I deleted having originally posted earlier in the session. And all this started because I chose not to post his first email, this insightful gem: &quot;Its nice to see a captain like Kevin Pietersen. Civilized and a warm human being like Brearly. Unlike the neanderthals from down under.&quot; Originally I thought Mr Dasgupta was just some sad kid in his bedroom, but no, it&apos;s this respectable gentleman. After two hours&apos; sleep and with the flu, this is really what I need. What a life this is!  125th over: India 347-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 1) And now I&apos;ve lost my rag even more, because Cook at gully has dropped an absolute sitter. Yuvraj tried a crooked back-foot force at Flintoff that went straight to Cook, and not especially quickly either, but he put it down. That&apos;s an absolute sitter. Apart from that one Test in New Zealand, when he was catching everything, Cook has been pretty dismal in the field since he came into the side in 2006. Somehow, Flintoff is able to smile. I&apos;ll have what he&apos;s having.  Rain has stopped play in Perth, with South Africa 97 for one chasing 414. Graeme Smith is on 63.  126th over: India 347-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 1) Swann to Dhoni. Maiden. From England&apos;s point of view, India&apos;s scoreline is okay in terms of them being able to win a modern Test match, but so far this has advanced at the pace of an 80s Test match, so England have very little chance of victory. It&apos;s crucial that Flintoff, who is bowling splendidly, takes another wicket in this spell, which I suspect will only last two more overs.  127th over: India 347-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 1) Flintoff is between 147-151kph in that over, but Yuvraj withstands an excellent over. Maiden. Flintoff has bowled wonderfully well. &quot;Cook drops an awful lot of straightforward catches for a professional cricketer,&quot; says Gary Naylor, from whom I&apos;ve never been more relieved to receive an email. &quot;As a teenager, I barely dropped a catch at all (&apos;tis true!) but having not played for eight years, when I started again in my late twenties, the ball kept hitting my hands as I shelled plenty. A visit to the optician showed that I needed the minimum possible subscription - and that was the difference between catching everything and missing some. So, do England players have their eyes tested regularly? If they do, there must be a lot using contacts, as there are none with Zaheer Abbas/Big Clive-style spectacles.&quot; Interesting point. I think Alec Stewart went for an eye Test after the Edgbaston Test of 1999, when he got 1 and 0 (I think) and everybody said his eyes had gone. The test showed they were fine and he played Tests for four more years.  128th over: India 349-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 3) &quot;I suspect Botham knew his best was behind him by 1983 and his attitude to practice was designed to insulate him against failure,&quot; says Luke Richardson, revisiting an earlier topic. &quot;Failure was more acceptable if it was played for and he could live off his admittedly astonishing achievements up to going to Australia in 82-83. By all accounts he was a diligent professional on the Lord&apos;s ground staff when he started out. Botham&apos;s personality was often what was selected in the end and the Australian&apos;s really feared him, Before Hohns. Flintoff&apos;s a different case. He sees himself as a batsman and I think he&apos;s indulged but he can only play at No7 if it&apos;s part of a strong four-man attack, and the keeper&apos;s contributing. I think what else he brings to the side does count for him but if he was that much of a team man he wouldn&apos;t go through these massive bouts of introspection that significantly reduce his impact.&quot; I agree with that, up to a point. I don&apos;t see that strong a relationship between introspection (uncontrollable) and selfishness (controllable), but Flintoff&apos;s self-interest might be the truth that dare not speak its name. The trouble is that we don&apos;t really know what goes on behind the scenes - there have plenty of whispers, especially in terms of the captaincy for the 2006-07 Ashes - and in the field he is as beyond reproach as any player could ever be.  129th over: India 349-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 3) Flintoff switches to around the wicket to Yuvraj, and India are very much batting for tea. That&apos;s another maiden and, between them, these two dashing batsmen have 11 runs from 51 balls. Flintoff&apos;s figures are an heroic 27-9-46-1.  130th over: India 349-5 (Yuvraj 8, Dhoni 3) Dhoni misses a violent sweep at Swann but it strikes the pad outside the line of off stump, so cannot be LBW. It&apos;s another maiden.  131st over: India 353-5 (Yuvraj 12, Dhoni 3) I didn&apos;t realise that Yuvraj&apos;s father also played for India. Flintoff gets a rest after an absurdly good spell of one for three from six overs, and the first ball from his replacement Stuart Broad is cut flamboyantly for four.  132nd over: India 356-5 (Yuvraj 12, Dhoni 6) Swann scoots an arm ball between bat and pad as Yuvraj attempts an ambitious cut. One more over to tea.  133rd over: India 356-5 (Yuvraj 12, Dhoni 6) That&apos;s tea. England had a superb session, taking four wickets for 54 runs in 27 overs, but they still have a huge amount of work to do if they are to square the series. Join Howard Swains for the final session in 10 minutes&apos; time. Thanks for all the emails. No, really.  TEA  Morning all. Welcome to tea. A couple of emails have dropped in during the interval, and what better way to get this going: Sensible email: &quot;I imagine that Monty is kicking himself,&quot; imagines Tom v d Gucht. He&apos;d probably miss these days, Tom. &quot;Having laid his claim on the England spinner position he has spent his entire England career looking over his shoulder at the steady progress of Rashid. Hearing whispers about his wicket taking abilities, batting skills and fielding nous he must have been dreading the day that Rashid&apos;s name was listed on the touring party fearing his days were numbered. Then unexpectedly the chirpy perennial also-ran Swann, who Monty had apparently left for dust years back at Northants, has galloped up on the inside and is now out in front.&quot; Sensible, but more light-hearted email: &quot;Greetings from Italy,&quot; oi-ois Finbar Anslow. &quot;Just zapped through the TV guide for the weekend, not even one cricket based Christmas film!&quot; Come on folks. Cricket-based Christmas films.  &quot;Well that worked well,&quot; hics Davy Allan, in an email entitled &apos;Update from Kings X to Edinburgh&apos;. &quot;See 112th over. 3 wickets eh, not a bad haul. Indulging in a bottle of Alfred Gratien. Another 5 wickets by York would be good.&quot; You must be one of those shady characters I saw at Kings Cross this morning, waiting for trains to take them home for Christmas. There were an unnerving number of characters looking like Paddy Considine in Dead Man&apos;s Shoes, I thought, but little did I know there was a champagne quaffing Hearts fan among them. A true novelty.  134th over: India 356-5 (Yuvraj 12, Dhoni 6)And we&apos;re back. And it&apos;s a convenient maiden from Graeme Swann, of which I saw precisely nothing.  135th over: India 361-5 (Yuvraj 12, Dhoni 11)Stuart Broad to continue, who didn&apos;t seem to be posing anything like the threat that Flintoff offered in his fiery short burst. Indeed, Dhoni slashes a slightly wider one through the covers for his first four of his innings: all arms and powerfully cuffed away.  136th over: India 361-5 (Yuvraj 12, Dhoni 11)A lot of wrist but not much penetration from Swann to Yuvraj, the story of most adolescents. A maiden. OK, a Christmas quiz, no prizes. Questions are about the new Guardian offices, which still amaze, confuse and upset me slightly every time I step into them. Question one: List five of the motivational words pasted on the doors of the glass-fronted offices around the floor. I&apos;ll give you two to kick off: &quot;Unclouded&quot; and &quot;Soul&quot;.  137th over: India 366-5 (Yuvraj 17, Dhoni 11)Here&apos;s Monty Panesar, who gets the Barmy Army chanting, but gets Yuvraj sweeping imperiously from way outside off speeding over the leg-side boundary. Terrific shot.  138th over: India 372-5 (Yuvraj 23, Dhoni 11)Spin at both ends - and Graeme Swann gets the yips. He serves up a woeful full toss to Yuvraj, who gives it everything it deserves, spanking it high, clear and free over long on and into the crowd for six. Swann&apos;s still in credit for his display here, but that&apos;s horrible.  139th over: India 374-5 (Yuvraj 24, Dhoni 12)One each from Panesar&apos;s over. Chris Bourne on cricketing movies: &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth? Jiminy Cricket&apos;s Christmas? Wrong crickets, sadly. I would just as soon as watch Lagaan on Christmas Day instead of - what is it this year? Oklahoma! and Harry Potter? Surely this is the best motivational cricket song ever filmed and just what Dhoni and Yuvraj could do with right now to steady the innings.&quot;  And Eamonn Maloney on the Christmas quiz: &quot;Is one of them &apos;sanctimonious&apos;?&quot; No. No it isn&apos;t.  140th over: India 378-5 (Yuvraj 27, Dhoni 13)The batsmen keep it ticking over with another single each from a tight opening five from Swann. But he&apos;s wide on the final ball and Yuvraj reaches for it to prod through the on side for a couple.  WICKET! Yuvraj Singh c Prior b Panesar 27Got him. Panesar feels the weight of the world slide from his shoulders as he lands one in the rough outside off-stump, it turns onto first the gloves, then the pad of Yuvraj Singh - playing no kind of shot really - and lofts up offering a simple catch to Prior. Six down, Harbhajan to the crease.  141st over: India 379-6 (Dhoni 13 Harbhajan 0)Panesar had bowled 47 overs between that wicket and his last, according to Michael Atherton, who knows. Another Guardian new offices quiz question: One week after moving in, how many of seven cubicles in the second floor men&apos;s toilets are out of order?  142nd over: India 386-6 (Dhoni 15 Harbhajan 6)Harbhajan sets his stall: he&apos;s not going to hang around. He thumps a meaty sweep away for four through midwicket, then turns another one round the corner more delicately for another couple. Swann learns his lesson, and bowls wider outside off. No run.  143rd over: India 388-6 (Dhoni 16 Harbhajan 7)Encouragement for Panesar, but even more for India. The England bowler gets one to turn from straight, off the top edge of Dhoni&apos;s bat and just short of the slip fielder. A lot more turn now than earlier in the innings, which will have Harbhajan licking his lips. John Stonestreet on the Christmas quiz: &quot;Relentless, Spellcheck, Energy, Vision, Harmony.&quot; Remarkably they&apos;re all wrong, but we&apos;re entering the ballpark.  144th over: India 395-6 (Dhoni 16 Harbhajan 14)Harbhajan dismisses the first Swann delivery with a thunderous smite over long on for six. Shot. The bowler tightens up, bowls a better length for the remainder of the over.  145th over: India 405-6 (Dhoni 17 Harbhajan 23)Harbhajan races past Dhoni&apos;s ponderous total, and steers India past 400. He guides one past slip, he sweeps for four, he sweeps for three and although the second of those hit the pad and should have been either byes or maybe even lbw, he gets the runs from umpire Rauf.  146th over: India 410-6 (Dhoni 21 Harbhajan 24)Harbhajan delays Swann&apos;s over as he hobbles around Mohali with what looks like some kind of shoulder injury. Difficult to know precisely what. Swann continues to Dhoni who dances a couple of paces outside his off stump in the attempt to paddle a sweep away. He misses it - a hint of wood? Glove? Pad? - and Prior snatches it. But appeals are half-hearted. Meanwhile in Perth Graeme Smith has passed 100 and South Africa are 162 for one, needing 252 more to win. A perfect way to tee up Rod Lyall in Amsterdam&apos;s email: &quot;India did it in Chennai; are South Africa going to do it at the WACA? It&apos;ll change all our assumptions - and possibly the shape of Test matches - if sides start regularly making 350+ to win in the fourth innings.&quot; Aye.  147th over: India 418-7 (Harbhajan 24 Zaheer 0)Jimmy Anderson returns, and there&apos;s none as delighted as MS Dhoni, who spanks two through the off-side for a couple of fours. But hold on! OUT! WICKET: Dhoni c sub (Shah) b Anderson 29Dhoni loses the run of himself and attempts to hoist one over the onside from outside off. But he times it horribly and picks out Owais Shah at midwicket, who takes a sharp but comfortable catch above his head. Drinks now, and the chatter in the commentary box is that India might be wanting to declare and give England a difficult eight overs tonight. That could breathe fresh life into this Test, and I&apos;m momentarily excited about the next couple of days.  WICKET! Harbhajan c Pietersen b Panesar 24Two wickets now for the resurgent Panesar. Harbhajan, looking to press on quickly, dollies an attempted slog to Swann at mid off. Panesar got more flight and more dip on that delivery, but Harbhajan got himself out, attempting to race this total close to 450. India now 418-8.  148th over: India 419-8 (Zaheer Khan 0 Mishra 1)These are going to be a fun few overs as the tail-enders have clearly been told to swing the bat a bit and get England in this evening. Provided the light holds, that might not be a bad ploy. There&apos;s plenty of turn too for tomorrow.  149th over: India 420-8 (Zaheer Khan 0 Mishra 2)One from Anderson&apos;s over, who isn&apos;t getting quite as much swing as this time yesterday. Meanwhile Rob Ades isn&apos;t getting any in Mexico: &quot;Though it&apos;s 10am in London some of us are still burning the midnight filament - it&apos;s 4am in frankly quite chilly Mexico. I&apos;m up alone because my girlfriend (late 20s) isn&apos;t allowed to stay with me overnight (!).&quot; Still, it allowed Rob to have a stab at the Christmas quiz (gotta have a stab at something, huh, huh): &quot;How about: &quot;croissant&quot;, &quot;comfort break&quot; and &quot;only following orders&quot; in the offices, 3/7 toilets out of order, and Boycott is not a dream commentator (Lunch chat) - my heart sinks every time he comes on moaning and whining like a pensioner whose pint no longer comes in a thick mug, in the a pub whose clientele are spoilt by indoor toilet. No really - in the offices &quot;hope&quot;, &quot;aspiration&quot;, &quot;chlamydia&quot;.&quot; Not at all bad - how about &quot;cooperation, unity, educate&quot;.  150th over: India 430-8 (Zaheer Khan 0 Mishra 12)Mishra clobbers Panesar back over his head for six. But at the Waca, Graeme Smith is out, surely giving Australia the advantage again.  151st over: India 436-8 (Zaheer Khan 5 Mishra 13)Khan belatedly gets off the mark with a cut past point for four. Then umpire Rauf is brought in to mediate between Zaheer Khan and James Anderson as the bowler gets the mouth on with the batsman. KP is &quot;informed&quot;.  152nd over: India 438-8 (Zaheer Khan 5 Mishra 19)KP turns to Flintoff to finish this one off. No real talk of the light, although it must be getting dark in Mohali by now. Still, Freddie is allowed a charge at these two, and Mishra deliberately helps a shorter one over Paul Collingwood at slip for four. Good shot actually. And, aah, a steam train chugs out of Kings Cross station and away up north somewhere, cloaking a crowd of well-wishers bedecked in Santa hats in plumes of smoke. It&apos;s Christmas folks, and there&apos;s nothing we can do about it.  153rd over: India 438-8 (Zaheer Khan 5 Mishra 19)Maiden for Jimmy Anderson, with talk continuing of India&apos;s tactics here. There are a scheduled 17 overs remaining and the light is good. Do they declare? Do they get themselves out swinging? Do they go for a target of 475 or something by the end? Bumble reckons 450 is enough to have England batted out of this match. To be honest, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll even need that much: this pitch is turning in the bowlers&apos; favour now. &quot;How about &apos;Deadbeat&apos;, &apos;Drunk&apos; and &apos;Dilettante&apos; as motivational mantras,&quot; suggests Russel Turner. &quot;All transcendent states a Guardian hack would aspire to. Allegedly.&quot; No allegedly about it, Russell.  154th over: India 446-8 (Zaheer Khan 7 Mishra 21)Swann back for Flintoff, who looks like he&apos;s changing ends. There&apos;s a trickle of singles.  WICKET! Zaheer Khan b Flintoff 7Excellent bowling from Flintoff, who gets his just reward for a strenuous day of fast bowling in tough conditions. First up, he clatters Khan&apos;s pads, with one that is just too high, but then another fuller one nicks the inside edge and takes out the leg stump, with Khan attempting a clumsy drive. One left for India.  155th over: India 446-9 (Mishra 21 Sharma 0)The umpires&apos; light metre shows a reading of 9.6, which encourages an ET impression from the commentary box: &quot;Bright light!&quot; A good over from Flintoff, with Ishant Sharma now at the crease.  156th over: India 447-9 (Mishra 22 Sharma 0)Single from Swann&apos;s over, and a blaze of late afternoon sunshine in Mohali. Meanwhile my inbox has been full to bursting with queries of Davy Allan, Hearts&apos; only champagne-guzzling London-based season-ticket holder&apos;s progress to Edinburgh for the big match against Dundee United*. Well, &quot;WIFI dropped out until Retford,&quot; he says. &quot;Two of us quaffing the champagne. We do this journey on a regular basis being season ticket holders at Tynecastle. Back up on the 30th Dec for the Derby versus Hibs and yet again for the Cup game versus Hibs on the 10th Jan. The oldest mention of Heart of Mid-Lothian it a sporting context is acricket report from 20 July 1864. PS - Now onto a bottle of Lis Neris 2008 Pinot Grigio from Venice.&quot; Buckfast for the way home, right? * My inbox has not been full to bursting with queries of Davy Allan, Hearts&apos; only champagne-guzzling London-based season-ticket holder&apos;s progress to Edinburgh for the big match against Dundee United.  157th over: India 453-9 (Mishra 23 Sharma 1)Singles each for Mishra and Sharma, and four byes as Misra takes a swipe at a feisty one from Flintoff, misses it, misses leg stump and it flies past Prior&apos;s despairing dive. Gary Naylor and Japaljarri have a difference of opinion over Australia&apos;s bowling: &quot;Over in Aus, bowlers not called Mitchell Johnson are paying 100+ runs for each of their wickets - which is what you might expect from a has-been and two men playing their second Tests,&quot; says Naylor. &quot;For all of the criticism of England&apos;s attack here and in Chennai, I wouldn&apos;t swap our unit for the Aussies&apos; right now.&quot; But: &quot;l hate to disappoint those who make judgements based on perusal of statistics but Brett Lee has bowled beautifully today and without luck,&quot; jabs Japaljarri. &quot;Rumours (read wishful thinking) of his demise are much exaggerated. In the middle of a superb spell and was excellent to Graeme Smith at the the start of the day (great battle).&quot;  158th over: India 449-9 (Mishra 23 Sharma 1)Ishant Sharma is facing up to Graeme Swann from about two paces outside his leg stump, then shuffling over when the ball is in the air. It&apos;s a bizarre tactic, made even more so on the final delivery, which he allows to rattle his pads once he&apos;s moved in line. Actually, Hawkeye says it hit him just outside off stump. A maiden.  WICKET! Mishra b Flintoff 23This innings has been beautifully mopped up by Flintoff, who finishes with three for 54 from 30 overs, and England can feel about as happy as they could possibly have hoped when they looked at India 179 for one at the start of play and 302 for one at lunch. That&apos;s nine wickets for 151. The final one is a straight ball that Mishra simply misses; it clips his pad on its way through to clatter the top of the stumps.  Innings change emails: Gary Naylor versus Australia, with the help of South Africa: &quot;Lee to Smith was fine Test cricket, but Smith won. He had not previously scored a century vs Aus, but he has now, and injured to boot. The guard is changing, and Kallis is slaughtering Siddle here to underline the point.&quot;Derek Adamson (Hibs) versus champagne-guzzling Hearts fans:&quot;Far be it for me to interrupt the long-awaited success of England&apos;s bowlers with parochial snipes as between fans of Scotland&apos;s capital&apos;s football teams but I just had to comment that it is a long time since I read the words &quot;Hearts &quot; and &quot; champagne&quot; in the same sentence and also, unless they sort their finances out, they will probably have to go back to being an amateur cricket team!&quot;  So what can we expect now? England have a handful of overs to see out tonight, and India have a monstrous total, a 1-0 series lead, and the likely assistance of fading light. Alec Stewart thinks India are nailed on for a draw at least, and few would disagree, but he also thinks that provided England can avoid the follow on, they might declare behind and hope to put the pressure (some pressure?) on the hosts. Obviously, India might well have had many more than they did manage here, but 453 is still a mighty total to chase.  Oh. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook stride to the crease and find the umpires wielding light-metres. It looked plenty bright enough a few overs back, but now they umpires have offered the light to England, and they immediately take it, marching off again. Two seconds later confirmation comes through that that&apos;s stumps. End of. Well, thanks for that and thanks for your emails. Andy Bull will be back in the wee hours for the start of day three.

Yet they are connected - along with 100 other UK companies and organisations - over a single controversial cause: the need for a third runway at Heathrow airport.  The group, which also includes Tate &amp; Lyle, Hilton Hotels and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, recently published a statement urging that the government approve the \u00a312bn project, which would see a 2,200-metre runway as well as a sixth passenger terminal constructed on Heathrow&apos;s northern perimeter. &quot;Heathrow is vital for business,&quot; the group claimed. &quot;It offers the direct connections which make our companies globally successful and which will be all the more important as India and China grow.&quot; The move allies British industry and trade unions with runway supporters that include the prime minister, the construction industry, engineers and aviation experts. All believe Heathrow&apos;s expansion is vital for Britain - but are opposed by the entire green movement, more than 100 backbench MPs, cabinet ministers that include energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband and environment secretary Hilary Benn, and a great many scientists and analysts. They say the runway - which would see flights rise from 480,000 to 702,000 a year - would trigger a major expansion of the UK aviation industry and completely undermine Britain&apos;s commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.  Emissions from aircraft are our fastest-rising source of carbon dioxide and by 2050 could account for or almost all the nation&apos;s permitted carbon output. Cars, homes, factories and power plants would have to become carbon neutral just to accommodate the aviation industry&apos;s desire for unbridled expansion. A third runway is incompatible with the fight against climate change, the most pressing issue facing the nation, it is claimed. But runway supporters claim that lighter materials, changes in aviation control procedures and more powerful jet engines will curtail fuel use and keep emissions in check. Aircraft will soon be carbon efficient and their increased use made acceptable. Thus technology will rescue the environment and keep British business in a competitive state.  But will it? That question goes right to the heart of the Heathrow debate. Can aircraft emissions be curtailed significantly over the next few decades and aviation continue to expand? Are our business leaders right to pin complete faith on the ability of innovative technologies to ensure aircraft no longer pollute the skies?  &quot;I think a new runway will be crucial because it will allow aircraft to be taken out of the air,&quot; said Strathclyde University&apos;s Professor William Banks, president of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. &quot;At present, enormous amounts of fuel are wasted at Heathrow because it is running at maximum capacity.  &quot;Every take-off and landing slot is precious, so planes wait, with their engines running, for long periods to get one. On Thursday, my plane waited out at the edge of a runway for 30 minutes before it got a chance to take off - and all the time it was burning fuel and emitting carbon. It&apos;s the same with landing. Aircraft stack for anything up to 30 minutes while waiting for a slot.&quot; This dramatic use of fuel is necessary when you have a busy, cramped airport running on a very tight schedule. At present, Heathrow&apos;s two runways run at 99% capacity, with the result that even a relatively minor weather problems, mist or heavy rain, can cause serious disruption. Add a new runway and these problems will disappear, Banks argues. Planes will not have to keep their engines running constantly in a scrap to take off and land, a clear boost in the battle against global warming.  But the idea that a third, \u00a312bn runway would be built purely to ease Heathrow&apos;s current congestion is remote, retort opponents, for it is unquestionably allied to aviation expansion in the UK. As runway supporters point out, Heathrow - Britain&apos;s only hub airport - now offers 50 fewer destinations than Amsterdam, 60 fewer than Paris and 100 fewer than Frankfurt. A new runway would let it add to its destination list: in other words, an expansion in UK aviation that would be crucial &apos;for continued job security and new employment&quot;, according to Steve Turner of the union, Unite. But could this expansion be compatible with carbon emission controls? Banks believes so: &quot;A new range of carbon-fibre reinforced plastics, very strong and of very low weight, are being developed which could cut aircraft weights significantly. This in turn would permit major reductions in the miles per gallon of kerosene of an aircraft and, of course, in its carbon emissions.&quot; Aircraft such as the Airbus A340 are already constructed of 10% carbon composite material. The double-decker airbus A380, which is about to come into service, will be 30% composite, while the wide-bodied Airbus A350 and Boeing&apos;s 787 Dreamliner, which are set for flights around 2020, will be more than 50% composite.  Runway supporters also point out that changes in civil aviation procedures could bring major emission cuts. At present, planes fly into land on long, low trajectories that consume large amounts of fuel. If they were to plunge far more steeply, this would cut down on fuel use, it is argued. In addition, air traffic control measures could be changed so planes no longer fly on routes laid down by individual countries, forcing them to dog-leg over borders across Europe, wasting fuel use. Instead, routes would be rationalised so that planes flew in straight, energy-efficient lines.  But such ideas would require changes to international aviation regulations and could take decades to implement. Nevertheless, the suggestion reveals the kind of simple changes that could be introduced to make significant fuel and carbon emission cuts, it is argued.  Other changes in the pipeline are more radical, but are still likely to make a major impact. Manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce, are developing generations of engines that will have greatly improved power-to-weight ratios and will be able to propel planes using far less fuel than at present. Thus, a package of lighter materials, improved aviation practices and more powerful engines should ensure that major cuts can be made in aircraft carbon emissions. Nor are these the only measures being contemplated by the industry. Two other key changes could bring significant emission improvements, according to Charles Miller, of the aviation industry&apos;s Greener by Design group. &quot;The first is biofuels, grown from algae, and the second is the use of blended-wing jets,&quot; he said. &quot;Both have the capacity to make an enormous difference when it comes to carbon emissions.&quot; Biofuels do not contain fossil carbon so don&apos;t add to the atmosphere&apos;s emissions inventory, while a blended-wing jet - an aircraft built as a giant, single wing so that the whole structure helps lift it off the ground - has such low air resistance that it burns a quarter less fuel than a conventional aircraft.  Its an impressive technological package, but opponents of runway three say it is very suspect. An example is provided by the blended-wing plane, said transport expert Professor Robert Noland, of Rutgers University, New Jersey. &quot;A blended-wing jet is an utterly new concept and has not been tested in any significant way,&quot; he said. &quot;They are also associated with all sorts of problems, particularly concerned with safety. According to aviation regulations, you must be able to empty a plane of passengers in two minutes in an emergency. That can be done if you have lots of exits along a fuselage, but a blended-wing plane won&apos;t have one. How will you get people out?&quot; In addition, critics say that biofuels suffer from a major flaw. These are essentially alcohol, which burns at the wrong temperature for aircraft engines. Coal could be used to make kerosene, of course, but that would scarcely help with the issue of global warming. Then there is the fact that carbon emissions have a disproportionate effect at high altitudes. Thanks to an effect known as &quot;radiative forcing&quot;, carbon in the upper atmosphere produces 2.7 times more warming than emissions near the ground. That produces a major skewing of figures and makes it far less likely that the UK aviation industry, currently expanding at 5% a year, could avoid increasing, significantly, its carbon output over the decades. And that, in turn, has consequences. &quot;There is no way you can decarbonise the aviation industry,&quot; said Dr Sam Fankhauser, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change in London. &quot;That means if we are to make an overall 80% cut in emissions by 2050, some sectors of life will have to reduce their carbon output by 100% to accommodate aviation&apos;s increase.  &quot;That will involve not just turning over our electricity generation to nuclear plants and wind and wave turbines, but making major changes in transport, land use, domestic heating and the insulation of homes across the country. And that assumes that all the improvements promised by the aviation industry, but which have yet to be developed and tested, work as promised. &quot;At present, people decide to fly off on holiday if they can afford the cost. Soon they will have to work out if they can afford the carbon as well.&quot; History of air travel \u2022 A British company &apos;Aircraft Transport and Travel&apos; offered the world&apos;s first regular international flight, a London to Paris service, in 1919. \u2022 In 2007, the number of passengers at UK airports rose to 315 million, compared with 4 million in 1954.  \u2022 The number of passenger kilometres flown by UK airlines increased from 80 billion in 1985 to 287 billion in 2005. Around 97% of the 2005 total involved international travel. \u2022 The country with which the United Kingdom exchanges the most air traffic is Spain. There were 34 million passenger movements between the countries in 2005. \u2022 Heathrow is the busiest airport in the UK, with 68 million passengers in 2005. Estimates from the Department for Transport suggest that the number of terminal passengers at UK airports will grow to 500 million by 2030. Cars or planes? \u2022 Driving a relatively fuel-efficient car generates fewer greenhouse-gas emissions per passenger mile than flying.  \u2022 Environmental website Grist.org calculates that driving 300 miles in an average-sized car generates some 105kg of carbon dioxide (CO2). Flying the same distance on a commercial jet, however, would produce some 182kg of CO2 per passenger. \u2022 Long-haul flights are more efficient than short-haul flights as a high proportion of the energy is required to climb to cruising altitude. Flying the 2,708 miles from San Francisco to Boston would generate 1,300kg of CO2 per passenger, while driving would account for only 930kg per vehicle.  \u2022 In addition to CO2, planes emit other gases that contribute to global warming. Some estimates suggest that this means their overall greenhouse gas emissions are some 2.7 times higher than their carbon dioxide footprint.", "sentences": ["As runway supporters point out, Heathrow - Britain&apos;s only hub airport - now offers 50 fewer destinations than Amsterdam, 60 fewer than Paris and 100 fewer than Frankfurt."], "title": "Could climate goals survive Heathrow's third runway?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/21/heathrow-third-runway2", "tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Airline industry", "Heathrow", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "Environment", "UK news", "Business", "Travel", "Heathrow third runway", "Air transport", "Heathrow airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-21T00:01:00Z", "article": "At first glance, British American Tobacco, Friends Provident, Pirelli and the Trades Union Congress seem unlikely allies, straddling a vast political divide.

This in turn would permit major reductions in the miles per gallon of kerosene of an aircraft and, of course, in its carbon emissions.&quot; Aircraft such as the Airbus A340 are already constructed of 10% carbon composite material. The double-decker airbus A380, which is about to come into service, will be 30% composite, while the wide-bodied Airbus A350 and Boeing&apos;s 787 Dreamliner, which are set for flights around 2020, will be more than 50% composite.  Runway supporters also point out that changes in civil aviation procedures could bring major emission cuts. At present, planes fly into land on long, low trajectories that consume large amounts of fuel. If they were to plunge far more steeply, this would cut down on fuel use, it is argued. In addition, air traffic control measures could be changed so planes no longer fly on routes laid down by individual countries, forcing them to dog-leg over borders across Europe, wasting fuel use. Instead, routes would be rationalised so that planes flew in straight, energy-efficient lines.  But such ideas would require changes to international aviation regulations and could take decades to implement. Nevertheless, the suggestion reveals the kind of simple changes that could be introduced to make significant fuel and carbon emission cuts, it is argued.  Other changes in the pipeline are more radical, but are still likely to make a major impact. Manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce, are developing generations of engines that will have greatly improved power-to-weight ratios and will be able to propel planes using far less fuel than at present. Thus, a package of lighter materials, improved aviation practices and more powerful engines should ensure that major cuts can be made in aircraft carbon emissions. Nor are these the only measures being contemplated by the industry. Two other key changes could bring significant emission improvements, according to Charles Miller, of the aviation industry&apos;s Greener by Design group. &quot;The first is biofuels, grown from algae, and the second is the use of blended-wing jets,&quot; he said. &quot;Both have the capacity to make an enormous difference when it comes to carbon emissions.&quot; Biofuels do not contain fossil carbon so don&apos;t add to the atmosphere&apos;s emissions inventory, while a blended-wing jet - an aircraft built as a giant, single wing so that the whole structure helps lift it off the ground - has such low air resistance that it burns a quarter less fuel than a conventional aircraft.  Its an impressive technological package, but opponents of runway three say it is very suspect. An example is provided by the blended-wing plane, said transport expert Professor Robert Noland, of Rutgers University, New Jersey. &quot;A blended-wing jet is an utterly new concept and has not been tested in any significant way,&quot; he said. &quot;They are also associated with all sorts of problems, particularly concerned with safety. According to aviation regulations, you must be able to empty a plane of passengers in two minutes in an emergency. That can be done if you have lots of exits along a fuselage, but a blended-wing plane won&apos;t have one. How will you get people out?&quot; In addition, critics say that biofuels suffer from a major flaw. These are essentially alcohol, which burns at the wrong temperature for aircraft engines. Coal could be used to make kerosene, of course, but that would scarcely help with the issue of global warming. Then there is the fact that carbon emissions have a disproportionate effect at high altitudes. Thanks to an effect known as &quot;radiative forcing&quot;, carbon in the upper atmosphere produces 2.7 times more warming than emissions near the ground. That produces a major skewing of figures and makes it far less likely that the UK aviation industry, currently expanding at 5% a year, could avoid increasing, significantly, its carbon output over the decades. And that, in turn, has consequences. &quot;There is no way you can decarbonise the aviation industry,&quot; said Dr Sam Fankhauser, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change in London. &quot;That means if we are to make an overall 80% cut in emissions by 2050, some sectors of life will have to reduce their carbon output by 100% to accommodate aviation&apos;s increase.  &quot;That will involve not just turning over our electricity generation to nuclear plants and wind and wave turbines, but making major changes in transport, land use, domestic heating and the insulation of homes across the country. And that assumes that all the improvements promised by the aviation industry, but which have yet to be developed and tested, work as promised. &quot;At present, people decide to fly off on holiday if they can afford the cost. Soon they will have to work out if they can afford the carbon as well.&quot; History of air travel \u2022 A British company &apos;Aircraft Transport and Travel&apos; offered the world&apos;s first regular international flight, a London to Paris service, in 1919. \u2022 In 2007, the number of passengers at UK airports rose to 315 million, compared with 4 million in 1954.  \u2022 The number of passenger kilometres flown by UK airlines increased from 80 billion in 1985 to 287 billion in 2005. Around 97% of the 2005 total involved international travel. \u2022 The country with which the United Kingdom exchanges the most air traffic is Spain. There were 34 million passenger movements between the countries in 2005. \u2022 Heathrow is the busiest airport in the UK, with 68 million passengers in 2005. Estimates from the Department for Transport suggest that the number of terminal passengers at UK airports will grow to 500 million by 2030. Cars or planes? \u2022 Driving a relatively fuel-efficient car generates fewer greenhouse-gas emissions per passenger mile than flying.  \u2022 Environmental website Grist.org calculates that driving 300 miles in an average-sized car generates some 105kg of carbon dioxide (CO2). Flying the same distance on a commercial jet, however, would produce some 182kg of CO2 per passenger. \u2022 Long-haul flights are more efficient than short-haul flights as a high proportion of the energy is required to climb to cruising altitude. Flying the 2,708 miles from San Francisco to Boston would generate 1,300kg of CO2 per passenger, while driving would account for only 930kg per vehicle.  \u2022 In addition to CO2, planes emit other gases that contribute to global warming. Some estimates suggest that this means their overall greenhouse gas emissions are some 2.7 times higher than their carbon dioxide footprint.", "sentences": ["As runway supporters point out, Heathrow - Britain&apos;s only hub airport - now offers 50 fewer destinations than Amsterdam, 60 fewer than Paris and 100 fewer than Frankfurt."], "title": "Could climate goals survive Heathrow's third runway?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/21/heathrow-third-runway2", "tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Airline industry", "Heathrow", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "Environment", "UK news", "Business", "Travel", "Heathrow third runway", "Air transport", "Heathrow airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-22T13:56:01Z", "article": "To the disappointment of children and romantics \u2013 and the relief of bookmakers \u2013 there is virtually no chance of snow falling on Christmas Day in the UK this year. Freezing temperatures earlier this month prompted what is believed to be the biggest ever gamble on a white Christmas \u2013 with bookmakers standing to lose up to \u00a32m if a single snowflake, grain of snow or sleet falls within the 24 hours of Christmas Day. Locations more than 250 metres above sea level and lying snow do not count for the purposes of the bet. But forecasters are predicting mild, dry weather caused by westerly winds from the Atlantic, with little chance of a white Christmas. &quot;The latest forecast comes as a huge relief,&quot; said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams. Robin Hutchison, a spokesman for Ladbrokes, said: &quot;We never say never when it comes to the great British weather, but we&apos;ve never offered longer odds at this time of year.&quot; The Met Office&apos;s forecast for Christmas Day is for &quot;mainly dry and generally rather cloudy&quot; weather across the UK, with some sunshine in places. London, the south-east of England and the Midlands can expect average seasonal temperatures of around 6C to 7C. Asked about the chances of snow, a spokeswoman replied: &quot;Zero. There&apos;s just nothing to indicate that we&apos;re likely to get any in the next few days.&quot; The mild weather is good news for motorists, who will also benefit from one of the longest Christmas breaks in recent years, with many firms \u2013 including 500,000 small businesses \u2013 shutting down last Friday for two weeks over the festive period. The AA said its research suggested that the roads look set to be quieter than usual over the next two weeks. Almost one fifth of people (18%) who travelled over Christmas last year told the motoring organisation that they have decided to change their plans and stay at home for Christmas 2008. Trafficlink, which provides real-time traffic and travel information, said traffic this morning had been light but predicted it would get busier throughout the day, albeit at Sunday rather than weekday levels. Predicted traffic hotspots to avoid include the M25 in Kent at the Dartford river crossing, the M25 in Essex at Bell Common tunnel, junctions 25-27 of the M1 in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, junctions 28-32 of the M4 in Cardiff, and junctions 21-28 of the M8 in Glasgow. BAA, which owns and operates seven of the main UK airports, said 359,000 passengers were expected to pass through its airports today, with a further 356,000 tomorrow and 281,000 on Christmas Eve. Around 100,000 will fly out of UK airports on Christmas Day. The busiest day of the festive period so far was on Saturday, when 395,000 flew out, but that figure is expected to be topped on Monday 29 December, when 408,000 passengers are due to go through the main UK airports. Travel organisation Abta said Christmas getaway numbers did not appear to have been affected by the economic downturn, with more than 3 million people heading overseas for sunshine, snow or city breaks. &quot;When people book for Christmas they usually do so well in advance so they may not have been aware of the full effects of the recession,&quot; said a spokeswoman. New York, Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam and Dubai are the top five destinations for travellers leaving from Heathrow airport. Network Rail will be hoping to avoid the costly engineering work overruns that caused travel chaos last new year and which led to the company being fined a record \u00a314m. Except for some airport express services, there will be no mainline train services on Christmas Day, but there will be some services on Boxing Day.

The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin Great title sequences should capture the mood of an entire programme in an instant. And the BBC&apos;s comedy department didn&apos;t get where it is today without such title sequences. Anthony Aloysius Hancock&apos;s bumbling pomposity was laid bare with one tuba trill and his elongated &quot;hhhhhaitch&quot;. The playful spirit of Harry Worth&apos;s loveable eejit was encapsulated by that trick by the window. And the whole point of Dad&apos;s Army could be found at the end of that little Union Jack arrow, which prodded impotently at the Nazi menace across the water. It&apos;s a grand tradition, and one which was perhaps best served by Reggie Perrin. Has there ever been a better depiction of helpless existential angst than a middle-ranking businessman taking his kit off on the beach, then heading straight out to sea? Kierkegaard and Nietzsche had nothing on Nobbs and Rossiter. These days, however, modern BBC comedies more often than not simply flash up the name of the programme and get straight down to the action, betraying a lack of love for the project as a whole. Witness current productions such as the shamefully undervalued Pulling, or the woefully over-rated Gavin &amp; Stacey. A far from great and super state of affairs, and a bit of a cock-up on the titles front. 2. The Good Life            Another classic BBC comedy, another classic set of titles. The graphics at the start of the gently subversive allotment-com \u2013 a bird flying round the petals of a flower to reveal the programme&apos;s name \u2013 arguably stands alongside anything ever created by Saul Bass. Which is pretty much the biggest compliment anyone could give them. 3. Hawaii Five-O            British television hasn&apos;t been so prolific when it comes to banging out great titles for its dramas, though. There was a fair bit of ambition during the 1960s and early 1970s. The Avengers is a camp classic. Adam Adamant Lives! is James Bond multiplied by the first side of Scott 2 on the end of an ostentatiously flourished stick. And as for The Persuaders, well, you can&apos;t go wrong with either shots of scantily-clad women in Monaco, or John Barry, can you? But the genre in Britain soon lost its collective confidence. Since the early 1970s, many of Britain&apos;s best dramatic productions \u2013 Boys from the Black Stuff, Prime Suspect, Cracker \u2013 seemed quite happy just to flash up the programme name to moody music, like miserablist versions of Gavin and bloody Stacey. This was probably because US drama was busy opening a can of whoop-ass all over us. Dynasty was grand. Dallas was grander. Quincy was witty. And Hawaii Five-O simply dripped with supercool, achingly so when the camera zooms in on Jack Lord at the top of a high-rise giving it The Full Elvis (on 18 seconds here). In the face of all this decadent (though admittedly ersatz) glamour, Britain responded, filming this action-packed sequence somewhere between Gothenburg, Amsterdam and Felixstowe. You can see why we usually don&apos;t bother, can&apos;t you. 4. Dee Time            The only closing titles in our list, but an exception worth making, as they stand as arguably the most iconic piece of television from the entire 1960s, summing up the Sixties Dream. They depict trendy chatshow host Simon Dee drawing to the kerb in an open-top E-Type Jag, picking up a leggy blonde from the foyer of a swish hotel, then wheelspinning off to drive around at high speed in front of some exceptionally modern brutalist architecture. (You can see a few seconds of them here, 5 min 10 seconds in.) It was all very swinging and hip, and Simon looked like he was enjoying being himself very much. Sadly not long after the decade was out, Dee was yesterday&apos;s man and signing on the dole \u2013 which took a while, as his real name was Cyril Nicholas Henty-Dodd. Still, at least his career made it to 1971 \u2013 we&apos;re guessing most of the buildings in this clip were probably diagnosed with concrete cancer by 1969. And anyway, Dee&apos;s brush with fame, much like the Sixties Dream, looked like fun while it lasted. 5. Picture Box            From the 1960s dream to a 1970s nightmare. And anyone unfortunate enough to be a child during the latter decade will take this one to their grave. The exception that proves the must-impart-information rule, the title sequence to Picture Box has proved unshakable to all who witnessed it, despite nobody ever remembering what was actually in the programme. This is because it was a most hellish work, an utterly hypnotic film of a revolving jewellery box set to a pipe-organ waltz banged out by the hooves of Diablo himself. (Thankfully the theme music was heavily edited: listen to it in its entirety, if you dare. &lt;I&gt;[Legal disclaimer: guardian.co.uk is not responsible for any resulting earworms which will never go away, or subsequent nervous breakdowns.]&lt;/I&gt;) The box may also have been shot snapping in and out of focus, though that may have just been the light refracting in the tears. There is one bit of Picture Box as a programme you may remember, though \u2013 the jug-eared presenter who said &quot;hello&quot; in a way which simply wouldn&apos;t be given police clearance these days. Years later, he would crop up in Brookside, where his character pawned all his wife&apos;s gear, then suffered a fatal thumping heroin overdose in a park. He seemed much more avuncular doing that. 6. BBC News and Newsreel            Back to imparting information in a flash, and you can&apos;t get much more literal than this. It&apos;s a transmitter, and it&apos;s transmitting stuff. Genius. It&apos;s still the all-time best-remembered news sequence to this day, despite not having been used for more than half a century. (The BBC gave a nod to their Ally Pally years in the early 1990s, but the new titles were a half-arsed waste of time.) So iconic were these 1950s titles, that if you were to ask anyone to describe a BBC sequence dating before the days of Hancock&apos;s Half Hour, you can bet your bottom dollar this will be the only one they&apos;d come up with. To create something with such long-lasting resonance is some feat: after all, nobody&apos;s going to remember this dog&apos;s dinner in 2036, are they?", "sentences": ["In the face of all this decadent (though admittedly ersatz) glamour, Britain responded, filming this action-packed sequence somewhere between Gothenburg, Amsterdam and Felixstowe."], "title": "Joy of Six: TV title sequences", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/dec/23/tv-title-sequences", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media", "Television", "Culture", "Television & radio"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-24T09:00:00Z", "article": "With parliament prematurely prorogued and a spate of wild winter weather dubbed &quot;Snowmaggedon&quot;, Canada isn&apos;t currently as awesome a country to live in as that Economist cover with the moose wearing sunglasses made it out to be. Still, 2008 wasn&apos;t a half-bad year to be a theatre critic here. Here are a few of my favourite offbeat moments ... Best Leonard Cohen cover version: Forget the overwrought vocal stylings of both Buckley and Burke; Calgary&apos;s experimental One Yellow Rabbit theatre company mined the sexuality and humour of Laughing Len&apos;s early work in a revival of their hit production Doing Leonard Cohen. Denise Clarke&apos;s intoxicating rendition of Suzanne breathed new life into a poem almost as overanalysed as Hallelujah, while the play&apos;s second-act adaptation of Beautiful Losers transformed Cohen&apos;s obscure 1966 novel into a ribald, riotous crowd-pleaser.  Messiest performance of the year: Wajdi Mouawad using his body as a paintbrush to cover the stage in gallons of paint at the daring and delirious climax of Seuls (which played in Paris, Montreal and Ottawa). The Lebanese-Quebecois playwright&apos;s audacious solo show delved deep into the subconscious of Harwan, a student writing his PhD thesis on Robert Lepage \u2013 and ended up rivalling some of the best of Lepage&apos;s one-man work. Best Canadian circus that wasn&apos;t Cirque de Soleil: Anyone looking for a human-scale, intimate three-ring experience that eschews new-age music should try Montreal&apos;s Les 7 Doigts de la Main. My favourite part of the exhilarating Loft, which I saw on tour in Vancouver, was Meaghan Wegg&apos;s aerial hoop routine to Coldplay&apos;s Amsterdam, one of the most moving pieces of movement I saw this year. (Les 7 doigts are in Paris right now and tour to Sadler&apos;s Wells in London in March.) Most impressive feat of meta-puppetry: Master puppeteer Ronnie Burkett&apos;s latest show for adults, Billy Twinkle: Requiem for a Golden Boy, may not rank up there with his finest work, but it certainly contains some of his most virtuoso puppetry. The semi-autobiographical show about a washed-up cruise-ship puppeteer features long-strung marionettes that operate tiny short-strung marionettes of their own, and even a scene in which a sock puppet teaches Burkett how to manipulate a puppet. (Billy Twinkle hits the Barbican in March, then tours around the UK.) Most inadvertent evening of postdramatic theatre: Donna Feore&apos;s colourful production of It&apos;s A Wonderful Life, adapted into a staged radio play by Phillip Grecian, at Toronto&apos;s Canadian Stage Company. Set in a retro radio studio, the Wonderful Life ensemble milled about in character in the background, eating sandwiches, knitting, reading books or sneaking &quot;outside&quot; for a cheeky smoke. The voyeurism of it all, strangely enough, reminded me of the National Theatre&apos;s production of Peter Handke&apos;s The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other.  Best premiere delayed by 84 years: Githa Sowerby&apos;s 1924 play The Stepmother had its public premiere at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake after spending the better part of a century boxed in the basement of Samuel French in London. Jackie Maxwell&apos;s sure-footed production highlighted the best of an entertaining play about a businesswoman scammed out of an inheritance by her gold-digging, spendthrift husband. Best performance 78 years in the making: Christopher Plummer returned to Canada&apos;s Stratford Shakespeare Festival to star in Shaw&apos;s Caesar and Cleopatra. At turns impish and imperial, the septuagenarian&apos;s charismatic Caesar veni, vici, vidi-ed the audiences and will soon be coming to screens big and small in North America. Most twisted sex life of the year: In Hannah Moscovitch&apos;s East of Berlin, the son of a Nazi concentration camp doctor tries to assuage his inherited guilt by having a homosexual tryst in his father&apos;s study \u2013 on Hitler&apos;s birthday. He then rebels by proposing to the daughter of Holocaust survivors. It&apos;s startling scenarios like this, and not her pyjama-clad pillow-fighting antics, that make Moscovitch Canada&apos;s hottest young playwright. Best illustration of Henri Bergson&apos;s theory that laughter stems from &quot;something mechanical encrusted on the living&quot;: Toronto veteran Matt Baram as a robotic rebel named CO2PO with anger management issues in the ridiculous climate-change comedy An Inconvenient Musical. You really had to be there. And finally, the one that isn&apos;t Canadian but gets an honourable mention anyway ... Snarkiest playwright: Neil LaBute. He made a recent appearance here on the Guardian site, but my favourite of his 2008 forays into the blogosphere was when Labute took on one West End Whingers commenter who didn&apos;t like Fat Pig. &quot;It&apos;s so easy to bitch, Betsy.

Aggrieved parents were angry because the teacher had shattered all those childhood illusions of a jolly ho-ho-ho superhero who has apparently found a way, equipped with only a few reindeer and a flying sleigh, to bend the time-space continuum, and like a weird quantum particle, be in millions of places at once.  For her transgression, the poor teacher got the sack \u2013 and not the one containing Santa&apos;s toys \u2013 which is unfair considering that she was only telling the truth. Besides, should seven or eight-year-olds continue to live in a never never land of infantile fantasy, and how many of them truly believe in Father Christmas anyway?  Having grown up in a Muslim household, I never did, and many of my friends at that age either knew or suspected that it was an elaborate game of make believe. And childhood, after all is about make believe: suspending disbelief for the fun of it. An American friend says that, by the age of five, two glaring clues led him to deduce the non-existence of Santa: that it was physically impossible for him to visit every house in the world at midnight, and his workshop seemed to churn out branded toys he saw in the shops. At about the same age, an Australian friend decided Father Christmas was a hoax because he rode through suburbia on a tandem trailer and bore a striking, and sweaty, resemblance to a bloke who lived down the road.  However, in a generous seasonal gesture of damage limitation, I have some good news for the kids at Blackshaw Lane primary school: Santa Claus is real and, in many ways, is far more interesting than the hyped-up, fairytale version we know today.  Once upon a time (in the 3rd century), in a land far, far away (Byzantine Anatolia, to be precise), there lived a man called Nicholas (270-345) who was so saintly that the church canonised him within a century of his death \u2013 hence, &quot;Santa Claus&quot;. As Bishop of Myra, his devoutness led him to use his significant inheritance to help the poor while leading a life of austerity himself. One story tells of how the goodly bishop anonymously helped an old man with the dowry for his three daughters by tossing bags of gold through their open window which landed in stockings hanging up to dry by the hearth (sound familiar?).  But the man had a less pleasant and more militant side. He lived around the time when Christians, like so many other movements, were about to go from being the  persecuted to becoming the persecutors.  Bishop Nicholas is believed to have attended this First Ecumenical Council which stamped out competing views of the nature of Christ, such as  Arianism, which held that Jesus was not of the same substance, i.e. &quot;consubstantial&quot;, as God, undermining the Trinity.  Like a present-day Talib destroying &quot;pagan&quot; statues of Buddha, Saint Nicholas is also attributed with razing numerous pre-Christian temples, including that of the Roman goddess Diana.  Interestingly, Diana&apos;s birthday is on December 6, which later became the Saint&apos;s own day. Some historians believe this is no coincidence and was intended as a way of giving a Christian identity to an ancient festival that refused to die away \u2013 much like Christmas as a substitute for popular pagan mid-winter festivals.  So, what caused Saint Nicholas to drift nearly three weeks down the calendar? Well, in Belgium and the Netherlands, &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;, as it is known locally, is still celebrated on December 6, with a lot of fanfare, including the Saint&apos;s eagerly awaited  arrival with his Moorish helpers from Spain, where he is believed to have lived.  In England, the personification of Christmas as a jolly old man \u2013 known as Sir, Lord or Father Christmas \u2013 began in the 17th century to resist party-pooper Puritans. In fact, unlike the annual tabloid rumours of local councils prohibiting Christmas, Oliver Cromwell  actually did ban the observance of the feast in 1644. The original personification of Christmas was not as a gift-bearer for children. This idea arrived in Victorian times from the United States, in whose melting pot, Saint Nicholas, brought by Dutch immigrants to New Amsterdam (now New York), was merged with the Anglo-Saxon Father Christmas. Interestingly, the Netherlands and Belgium recently reimported this tradition from the United States and now have a &quot;kerstman&quot; (the Christmas Man) on Christmas Eve, in addition to their Sinterklaas. Going even further back, Santa Claus seems to borrow heavily from pre-Christian Germanic beliefs, such as the chief Norse god Odin, who would  ride at the head of a celestial hunting party. Moreover, Norse children would place their boots, filled with carrots, straw, or sugar, near the chimney for Odin&apos;s flying horse, Sleipnir, to eat. In return, they were rewarded with a gift. Santa as we know him may not be real, but the story of the man and the myth is more fascinating than a pot-bellied old man in a red suit crying out &quot;Ho, ho, ho&quot;.

You might not like his sport for a start. Right now formula one looks like a slightly crazed activity, the last great carbon-guzzling beano. It&apos;s also easy to take for granted Hamilton&apos;s relentless excellence. Last month, at 23, he became the youngest ever formula one champion. Currently he is tipped, grotesquely, to become British sport&apos;s first billionaire.  Look closer, though, and you notice Hamilton is also cast fascinatingly against type. Partly, of course, as formula one&apos;s first mixed-race champion. This is something he mostly wears lightly, but not all the time: in November formula one boss Bennie Ecclestone described racist abuse Hamilton had suffered in Spain last February as &quot;a bit of a joke&quot;. Hamilton publicly disagreed. Ecclestone squirmed. It was impressive.  Hamilton is also unusual because he&apos;s British and he&apos;s a fearless winner. This year he took the title on the final corner of season, having lost it in the same race in 2007. A chance to take up the mantle of the perennial almost-but-not-quite champion had presented itself. It was swatted aside. You still might not like formula one much. But this year Hamilton, a true original, became its single most interesting figure.Barney Ronay Georgina Downs On a bright morning in November, Georgina Downs exited the high court clutching a landmark ruling, following a seven-year battle against what she claims is &quot;one of the biggest health scandals of our times&quot;. Downs, 35, successfully argued, with the backing of what Mr Justice Collins described as &quot;cogent arguments and evidence&quot; - which included a two-hour, home-made DVD showing footage of shop mannequins standing at the end of her garden being soaked in chemicals by passing crop sprayers - that the government&apos;s pesticides policy was unlawful and did not adequately protect the health of residents living adjacent to sprayed fields. The government is expected to appeal, but the ruling could prove to be the biggest setback for the pesticides industry in this country since the so-called &quot;green revolution&quot; in agriculture began over half a century ago. Downs has lived in the same home abutting fields near Chichester, West Sussex, since the age of 11 and all that time she has suffered a wide range of illnesses including rashes, blistering, headaches and various debilitating symptoms that she attributes to her close proximity to sprayed crops. In 2001, she took on her crusade full-time after being forced to abandon her career as a actor on account of her persistent symptoms. Unsurprisingly, she has been nicknamed the &quot;British Erin Brockovich&quot;, although her friends now call her the &quot;Pesticide Nun&quot; because she covers herself head-to-toe in clothing when at home.Leo Hickman Robert Peston &quot;Like a Dalek attempting an impression of Kenneth Williams&quot; is how comedian Andy Hamilton describes the BBC&apos;s business editor, and while his adenoidal on-air delivery is certainly an acquired taste, there is no doubt that the credit crunch has been the making of the former City editor of the Sunday Telegraph. After a rather faltering start three years ago, Peston, 48, became the poster boy of the financial crisis that engulfed the UK in September 2007 and made the City realise how powerful the BBC can be when it stops feigning confusion and ignorance about business matters and tackles a story head on. After Peston announced that Northern Rock was technically insolvent, savers lined up outside its branches as the UK witnessed its first run on a bank in 140 years. It won him a Royal Television Society award for scoop of the year and has been followed this year by exclusives including Lloyd TSB&apos;s rescue takeover of struggling rival HBOS. Peston himself has increasingly become part of the story. Just last month Richard Pym, executive chairman of Bradford &amp; Bingley, another failed bank that has had to be bailed out by the British taxpayer, told a committee of MPs that Peston had been instrumental in the collapse of his company. He said a blog posted by Peston on 26 September, which raised the possibility of B&amp;B being nationalised, played a key role in proceedings: &quot;We saw [his] blog ... and realised that things weren&apos;t looking too good,&quot; he told the Treasury select committee. In banking-speak that&apos;s the equivalent of calling Peston the harbinger of doom.Richard Wray Damien Hirst He is almost departing the realms of mortality and entering the uplands of myth. In September, on the day that Lehman Brothers fell, the 43-year-old artist cleared \u00a395.7m in a pair of auctions at Sotheby&apos;s to which he had consigned a large number of his own works. The sale&apos;s success, which seemed astounding at the time, appears even more incredible in retrospect, given the steadily diminishing health of the art market. But is the party over for Hirst? Last month, his Beautiful Artemis Thor Neptune Odin Delusional Sapphic Inspirational Hypnosis Painting, estimated at \u00a32m, failed to sell at auction in New York, inciting Hirst to remark, with characteristic chutzpah, that it was &quot;overpriced&quot;. He has also let go some of the assistants who help produce his butterfly paintings and accoutrements for his medicine cabinets, while fellow artists seem readier than hitherto to dismiss his work openly. (&quot;Not art&quot;, said Anish Kapoor this year; &quot;trite&quot;, said Turner prize-winner Mark Leckey.) It is said that art-market booms favour artistic over-producers such as Hirst. Those with long memories, however, will recall that it was in the last serious economic downturn that he first made his mark. Hirst, one suspects, is here to stay.Charlotte Higgins Rebecca Adlington Often when a new star swims into the public ken, they find themselves pigeonholed with a convenient superlative. This happened to Rebecca Adlington, Britain&apos;s 19-year-old double-gold-medal-winning swimmer at the Beijing Olympics. For Adlington, it was all about being normal. That was the big thing: her extraordinary ordinariness. Adlington&apos;s success spawned a landslide of newspaper profiles all riffing on this notion of an un-styled, could-be-working-in-Boots homeliness. She loves Strictly Come Dancing! She talks about shoes! She&apos;s not oppressively beautiful! One tabloid provided a frothing dissection of all that&apos;s wrong in the world based on canonising Adlington (after seeing her on TV a couple of times) while burning as a witch poor Peaches Geldof (the link: they were both 19).  The fetishising of Adlington&apos;s normalness was grating, not to mention patronising (she&apos;s from Mansfield!). But mainly it missed the point. Adlington is a brilliant sportswoman, the first British swimmer to win two Olympic golds since 1908. She broke a 19-year-old world record in the 800m final. This is not normal. Perhaps she should go out and pour a pint of alcopops over her head at a film premiere. We might focus on it a little more.Barney Ronay David Blanchflower The economist known as &quot;Danny&quot; to everyone but his mother has had a much better end to his year than he might have expected. In January he told the Guardian that his colleagues on the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee (MPC) were &quot;fiddling while Rome burns&quot; by holding interest rates at 5.5% while the economy was about to slump. At every monthly MPC meeting this year, he voted for a cut while his eight colleagues generally voted either for no change or even a rise.  Blanchflower - 56, British-born but based at Dartmouth college, New Hampshire - saw the economic meltdown in the US and calculated, correctly, that the same thing was heading in Britain&apos;s direction. He warned repeatedly that &quot;something horrible&quot; was about to happen to the UK economy. The MPC finally came round to his point of view after the banking sector turmoil of September and October. In the space of just two months, the Bank reduced borrowing costs from 5% to just 2% - the lowest since 1951 and the joint lowest ever. Blanchflower was vindicated and his critics - including some former MPC members - now look foolish. They had repeatedly portrayed him as an arch-dove who didn&apos;t know what he was talking about. Except he did. Blanchflower has recently decided not to renew his contract at the MPC and will leave in May.Ashley Seager  Cheryl Cole It takes a special kinda lady to be able to turn a year around that started with revelations about her husband Ashley&apos;s alcohol-fuelled and vomit-spattered one-night stand and then end it with tabloid headlines dubbing her the &quot;Angel of the North&quot;. Cynics might say that the former incident played some part in the latter: would the nation have loved Cheryl, 25, so much as a judge on The X Factor if they hadn&apos;t watched her go through the obligatory humiliation-by-tabloid (and by crap footballer husband)? Are you kidding? Before the show, she was the pretty one from Girls Aloud who had meekly stayed with Cole after having once vowed that she would never put up with infidelity. Afterwards, she was the gorgeous (if slightly lachrymose) one whose empathy with the contestants was matched by her sharp tongue. And we haven&apos;t even mentioned that the woman easily has the best hair since Farrah Fawcett. Hadley Freeman  Vince Cable A question on Radio 5 Live the other day to Vince Cable: &quot;In political circles, people from all parties seem to credit you as the person who predicted first this economic downturn. Given that widely held respect you have politically, what would you urge Gordon Brown to do regarding the banks passing on these rate reductions?&quot; These days that is about as close as you can get to the &quot;Is there anything else you&apos;d like to tell the nation?&quot; approach of yesteryear. Cable, of the gurgled vowels that make him seem perpetually in need of a good Lemsip, is the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman and his party&apos;s greatest asset. He was right about the end of the boom, right about the debt mountain, prescient about Northern Rock (he said nationalise, the government later did) and clamping down on speculators, he was even right about the crisis in the Icelandic banking system. He&apos;s got excellent timing, in more than one way - an accomplished ballroom dancer at a time when Strictly Come Dancing is all the rage. When Ming Campbell resigned as Lib Dem leader last year because of his age, Cable, then 64, took the hint and did not stand. But then he triumphed at prime minister&apos;s questions during a brief spell as acting leader and since returning to his deputy role at the end of last year, his profile has continued to soar. Meanwhile his new boss, Nick Clegg, has struggled. Many Lib Dems think they have the timing problem: it should have been cometh the hour, cometh the old guy, after all.Will Woodward Jamie Oliver He began the year with an apology to his corporate advertising paymaster Sainsbury&apos;s for criticising it in his programme about the iniquities of industrialised chicken, and ended with both a bang and a whimper: the 33-year-old celebrity chef turned government scourge marked December with the launch of a glossy magazine under the cheerfully self-affirming title Jamie, and with a promise to reduce the amount of swearing in his programmes in future.  But the triumph of his year was his autumn Channel 4 series, Jamie&apos;s Ministry of Food, whose mission was to teach a nation of junk-food addicts how to cook. The people of Rotherham were his guinea pigs, and not all were pleased. Some carped about the quality of the book that went with it; others thought his ambition overweaning, it would never work, and so missed the point. His reality TV drama was entertaining but its lasting impact was the glimpse it offered into real lives. A document of our times, it showed just how bad diets among the most disadvantaged could be. Given how little politicians are doing about it, one could argue that his 23 uses of the F word in one episode seems about right. Felicity Lawrence  Peter Mandelson In a year when most of the shocks have been economic, the return of the twice-departed Peter Mandelson, 55, to the cabinet was the jaw-dropping political moment of the year. If Gordon Brown has made a more imaginative or daring move in his 18-month premiership we don&apos;t know about it. Mandelson and Brown were once the best of friends, then - when Mandy became &quot;Bobby&quot;, the secret mastermind of Tony Blair&apos;s leadership campaign in 1994 - the worst of enemies. The breakdown in their relationship damaged and at times scleroticised Blair&apos;s government. Its repair has galvanised Brown&apos;s. One fellow cabinet minister offers two reasons: Mandelson&apos;s return has killed off any chance of a leadership challenge from or inspired by those half a dozen or so cabinet ministers loosely still described as &quot;Blairites&quot;. And more than that, he is &quot;another confident voice around the cabinet table&quot; when they were in short supply. Mandelson himself says: &quot;New Labour and the party were approaching something akin to a political nervous breakdown and I felt my role was to bring people together.&quot; The row over who said what on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska&apos;s yacht over the summer threatened to derail him once again, but instead it served only to stop the seemingly irrepressible rise of his fellow guest George Osborne, the shadow chancellor. This time last year Mandelson was a respected EU trade commissioner and British political history. Now he is the minister the Conservatives most fear and would most like to bring down. Again.Will Woodward Thomas Ad\u00e8s He continues to bestride British musical life, as a multitalented composer, conductor, pianist and programmer. The spring saw the premiere of his multimedia piano concerto In Seven Days, a collaboration with his partner, the video artist Tal Rosner. The last couple of months have seen him become a musical collaborator, performing as accompanist to violinist Anthony Marwood and cellist Steven Isserlis; and conducting two large-scale works of his, Tevot and America: A Prophecy, in the Frank Gehry-designed Disney Hall in Los Angeles. But it was this summer that a decade-long era gently came to an end, as he completed his tenure as artistic director of the Aldeburgh festival. It was in Suffolk that Ad\u00e8s, 37, had, for two weeks every June, shown audiences the workings of his mercurial musical brain. He championed composers such as the astonishingly talented Gerald Barry and Richard Ayres, bringing their music to wider view. He had a gift for inspired juxapositions: no one who was there will forget the startling experience that was hearing Barry&apos;s rebarbative, violent Chevaux-de-frise alongside Morton Feldman&apos;s soft, almost stationary work Coptic Light in 2002. The highlight this year was a vintage Ad\u00e8s programme given by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group of music by Ligeti, Barry, Kurt\u00e1g and his own early piece Living Toys. He goes from strength to strength.Charlotte Higgins Leona Lewis With the best will imaginable, it isn&apos;t Leona Lewis&apos;s music that is remarkable - while her records are certainly a vast improvement on those of previous X Factor winners, whether the world really needs a pop-soul cover of Snow Patrol&apos;s grisly stadium anthem Run seems a very moot point indeed. Nevertheless, it&apos;s hard not to be wowed by the level of success she has attained. Everyone who wins a TV talent show gets a degree of commercial success, but in 2008, Lewis, 23, outstripped all of them by becoming a star in the US: her album entered the Billboard charts at No 1, she was the first British female singer to reach the top of the US singles chart for 21 years and she has been nominated for three Grammys.  It seems all the more remarkable given the amount of homegrown competition she faced: Americans are hardly rioting in the streets over the national shortage of pretty, black female singers. Painful though this may be to admit, the credit is probably due to Simon Cowell. He has previously seemed to work entirely on the principle that that it is impossible to overestimate the public&apos;s gullibility, but actually appeared to put some effort in with Lewis, teaming her with blue-chip pop songwriters and working with legendary US record executive Clive Davis to further her career. Alexis Petridis Steve McQueen What a year it has been for the 39-year-old London-born, Amsterdam-based artist, who won the Turner prize in 1999. May saw the premiere of his debut feature film, Hunger, at Cannes. The film took as its focus the 1981 blanket protest in the Maze prison, but, though it does not lack in political force, this is hardly a conventional political drama. It opens with a sequence adumbrating the numbingly mundane daily routines of a prison officer, then, in more detail, casts its gaze on the protestors, with Bobby Sands, magnificently played by Michael Fassbender, coming into sharp focus. Harrowing and gruesome in parts, this is also a beautifully observed film, with painterly touches and scenes that recall artists from the Old Master painters of Christ&apos;s passion to Richard Hamilton. McQueen&apos;s Queen and Country, meanwhile, a powerful installation that takes the form of postage stamps bearing the heads of British soldiers killed in Iraq, continues to move those who see it (it is currently at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh). The campaign continues to persuade the Royal Mail to adopt the idea for an issue. McQueen will represent Britain at the Venice Biennale next year. Charlotte Higgins Olivia Chessell When 56 Plane Stupid campaigners were arrested earlier this month for breaching the perimeter fence at Stansted airport to protest against plans to build a second runway, much of the resulting press attention focused on 20-year-old Olivia Chessell. After all, it wasn&apos;t the first time this year she had been arrested. In February, she was among five protesters from the same group who scaled the roof of Parliament and spent three hours fielding live broadcast interviews via mobile phone and unfurling banners before finally being led down by police. Chessell represents the young, agitating wing of the anti-aviation movement, which for many years has seen veteran campaigners such as John Stewart, who is the figurehead of the No Third Runway Heathrow campaign, dictate the tactics and agenda. Much of the press, though, seemed to be more interested in the social background of the Plane Stupid campaigners, a number of whom have been labelled &quot;upper crusties&quot;. Tamsin Omond, for example, has been labelled a &quot;Cambridge-educated trainee priest&quot; and &quot;baronet&apos;s granddaughter&quot;. All they&apos;ve managed to get on Chessell, however, is that she&apos;s from &quot;posh&quot; East Dulwich, London and that she once attended the Brit School, whose alumni include Amy Winehouse and Leona Lewis. Evidently, she was paying attention the day Grabbing Headlines was being taught.Leo Hickman Alan Bennett Those of us who are paid-up members of the Alan Bennett fanclub may ask ourselves if there is any year that passes without his making a noteworthy contribution to our culture, simply through his very existence. Last year came the joy of his hilarious miniature fantasy, The Uncommon Reader, about the Queen&apos;s developing a literary habit. This year, however, was special by any standards, for Bennett, 74, donated his papers to the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford - an old-fashioned and honourable gesture of &quot;giving back&quot; to the institution where he received his free, state-funded education. &quot;I shall be rubbing shoulders with Thomas Hardy and Philip Larkin - they might not be all that pleased, but I am,&quot; was his typically wry, modest way of framing the gesture. Too often regarded as &quot;cuddly&quot;, Bennett&apos;s real contribution to British cultural life is his political engagement, and, often, political anger - always offset and tempered by deep empathy, sympathy and humanity, as it should be.Charlotte Higgins Alistair Darling &quot;Now Alistair, tell her everything,&quot; beseeched Darling&apos;s special adviser. He had an image problem - which is to say, he didn&apos;t have an image. Almost no one knew anything about him. Fine when you are transport secretary but, as Darling reluctantly acknowledged, not so good when you are the second most important minister in the government and have, among other things, begun nationalising major parts of the banking system. And so, in his Scottish island croft in August, Darling, 55, did tell her (the Guardian&apos;s Decca Aitkenhead) everything: about how he hates public kissing and Cherie Blair&apos;s memoirs; how other people want his job and reshuffles are a rotten idea; how he realised quite how bad the economic crisis was when he picked up the FT in a supermarket in Majorca; and er, that he reckoned that crisis was the worst for 60 years.  At first - in fact at first, second and third - it looked like a disastrous attempt to personalise him, the interview equivalent of losing 25m names and addresses on a revenue and customs database (Darling had to announce that too). But, a few months on, it feels like a success. Sure, he was wrong about the reshuffle, and time will tell whether his pre-budget report in December (the VAT holiday, higher rate of tax up to 45%) will revive or kill off Labour&apos;s electoral fortunes. But the Darling of that interview may just be the Darling that has entered into the public mind: likable, dry-witted, unhistrionic, astute, competent. He has had plenty of bad moments. The economy is a spectacular problem. But he, Darling, is not.Will Woodward Guy Garvey He doesn&apos;t look much like a rock star. Pudgy, 34 and possessed of features that seem to naturally arrange themselves in a crestfallen expression, he has a face that fits his band: Elbow&apos;s music is careworn and mature and, up until this year, carried the tang of perennial commercial disappointment. Like their three previous albums, The Seldom Seen Kid garnered good reviews, but it was their appearance at Glastonbury that seemed to shift public perception of Elbow from lauded unaderachievers to national treasures.  It was dumb luck that Elbow happened to be playing as a beautiful sunset crowned a day that had begun in rain-sodden misery, and the mood of the troubled festival appeared to suddenly turn from disappointment to triumph, but they undoubtedly had the right song for the moment in One Day Like This, a slowly building, singalong expression of boundless optimism. It was an authentic Glastonbury moment: had Noel Gallagher kept his trap shut about Jay-Z, people would have talked of nothing else.  The Seldom Seen Kid went on to win the Mercury prize and Elbow began selling out tours and shifting albums in quantities that would have been unthinkable 12 months ago. In a year when big musical success stories such as Duffy seemed almost sinisterly premeditated, accompanied by so much advance publicity that actually selling records appeared to be a formality, Garvey&apos;s was a victory against the odds, a genuinely unpredictable feat. Alexis Petridis  Alex Ross Whoever would have thought that one of the runaway successes of the publishing year would be a chunky history of 20th-century classical music written by an American nerd? But Alex Ross, 40, is not really a nerd. As well as being music critic for the New Yorker, he is an innovative blogger and counts Radiohead among his friends. The Rest is Noise steers a course from the golden age of Strauss and the fin de siecle to the postminimalist composition of the late 20th century. By putting composers in their historical and cultural context, he makes complicated music seem accessible, while underlining its human dimension. By the time you have finished this book you&apos;ll be as baffled by Ross himself as to why abstract art should be so popular when abstract music is a no-no (it all came from the same New York hangouts back in the 60s). Mind you, it takes a while to get there, because you keep having to rush off to get the music. Through the noise of the century, two themes come through loud and clear - no music is so extreme or revolutionary that it doesn&apos;t eventually become part of mainstream culture, and &quot;at the start of the 21st century the impulse to pit classical music against pop culture no longer makes intellectual or emotional sense.&quot;Claire Armitstead Fiona Shackleton She is a rags-to-riches story, in terms of public image in 2008. Shackleton, 52, is a very private individual, who elicits praise so sincere from other lawyers in her field that it is almost baffling. But publicly, she was less well-regarded. Her biggest case until Macca-Mills was representing Prince Charles in his divorce from Diana, in 1996. The Private Eye photo caption (Diana, walking away from court, saying &quot;I got custody of the quids&quot;) was enough to make a layman assume a victory for her lawyer, Anthony Julius; in fact, that is just the power of droll wordplay. Shackleton&apos;s deal-making on Charles&apos;s part was described in family-law circles as &quot;creditable&quot;, which is lawyer speak for &quot;Go sister!&quot; Plus, in 2000, her wardrobe was in Vogue and featured 36 suits, 24 dresses, 85 scarves and a pair of shooting shoes. That kind of thing is always going to take a while to claw your way back from.  The victory for Paul McCartney, whom she represented, was her rehabilitation: it was clear-cut and satisfying - an obvious goodie, an obvious baddie, and enough details to make you chortle as you read about them but not feel sullied by the whole experience. And of course it ended with Mills drenching Shackleton with a glass of water, whereupon it was revealed that, with wet hair, she looks a bit like Joan Cusack. So apart from getting wet, that was really win-win for her. She also represented Madonna in Rich versus Ritchie. Madge met the Steel Magnolia (for such is Shackleton&apos;s nickname). Imagine how good that was to watch. Zoe Williams Alexa Chung By rights, she should be intolerable. A pretty TV presenter who was once best known for fronting the embarrassingly bad music show Popworld after its original and much loved presenters had left. She hangs out with the Uberbrats (les filles Geldof and Jagger) and she has an unfortunate penchant for telling the world how much she loves her Arctic Monkey boyfriend.  And yet Chung, 25, is an interesting lesson that one should never underestimate a patently ambitious young thing, even if she does hang out with Peaches Geldof. Her style, for a start, is telling: whereas her friends favour the any-length-as-long-as-it&apos;s-micro-mini approach to dressing, Chung goes for a lower-key, cooler approach. Her fondness for penny loafers (as opposed to Peaches&apos; ballet pumps or Pixie&apos;s towering ankle boots) and high-waisted vintage-style dresses shows she wisely knows that going for the obvious doesn&apos;t get results. Most surprisingly of all, she turned out to be funny. Once she got out from under the Popworld yoke and was made a presenter in her own right on T4, Channel 4&apos;s youth weekend strand, she turned out to be witty and confident and more than able to hold her own against her dominating fellow presenters, Steve Jones and Miquita Oliver. A fashion icon with a personality - you don&apos;t get one of those every year. Hadley Freeman Gary McKinnon For the past year, the US, with the acquiesence of our own Home Office, has been attempting to extradite Gary McKinnon, a 42-year-old computer hacker from north London. More than seven years ago, McKinnon, a self-confessed &quot;bumbling computer nerd&quot;, who was curious about UFOs, had hacked into the computer systems of Nasa and the Pentagon. While taking a virtual stroll there, had left rude messages behind him such as, &quot;Your security is crap.&quot; When he was initially arrested, the (British) police told McKinnon, who has Asperger&apos;s syndrome, the likeliest penalty for his hacking activities would be a community sentence and he has indicated his willingness to plead guilty if charged in the UK, where the offence was committed. The US authorities, however, furious that an amateur had cracked their system and embarrassed them so royally, are not having it and would like to see him in the slammer in the States. One of the prosecuting team even remarked that he would like to &quot;see him fry&quot;. In reality, he would face a few years in jail but, tarred with a &quot;cyber-terrorist&quot; brush, thanks to the nature of the charges, it would be a hellish time for a vulnerable man. McKinnon and his ragtag army of supporters, lawyers and family members are fighting the extradition every inch of the way and refusing to go gently. He has one final judicial review to go in January and growing cross-party support in his bid to be allowed to face trial here. Duncan Campbell  Sarah Brown Even as late as July this year, Sarah Brown&apos;s stock was low. Following President Sarkozy&apos;s visit, she was compared unfavourably to Carla Bruni. &quot;I was standing next to a supermodel,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought that whatever I wore, it didn&apos;t matter.&quot; Totally fair point, but not fair enough for those uncomplicated times, when the heel-height and general sartorial judgment of a first lady seemed to be just about the most important thing about her. Brown, 45, then came off worse against Samantha Cameron, following the politician-on-holiday photos, in which Brown looked fine (nice clothes and all that), but like she would rather be reading a book somewhere, instead of pretending to point out something interesting to her gesticulating husband. And wouldn&apos;t we all? (Cameron, meanwhile, managed to pull off being kissed by her husband and looking like she enjoyed it; so, you know, it&apos;s been a good year for her too, if you want to talk about loyalty).  What&apos;s changed since? First, the Labour conference, and Sarah Brown&apos;s exemplary introduction for Gordon, which was moving for a number of reasons. She is a person of conviction, who has given up a meaningful career out of belief in her husband, and she said as much; and she is a warm person, a human being - it says a lot for him that she wants to be married to him, and even more for her that she can convey that so simply and without artifice. Second, Michelle Obama brought substance to the first-lady role; she underlined the importance of a leader&apos;s private face, for intelligent and not just emotional reasons. Third, the whole world collapsed and Gordon Brown went quite literally from zero to hero. Sarah Brown wasn&apos;t just on the side of the angels, all of a sudden. She was friend to the angels, PR to the angels, she was the Max Clifford of angelkind. The image-turnaround is amazing, though well-deserved.Zoe Williams Amanda Staveley One day Amanda Staveley&apos;s prince did come (Prince Andrew proposed to her in 2003), and she turned him down. Instead, she carved herself out a career in high finance and emerged this year as a deal-broker for some of the hugely wealthy royal families in the Middle East. She earned \u00a340m for advising a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family in a deal to pump billions of pounds into Barclays Bank in November. She pocketed another \u00a310m after fronting the same sheikh&apos;s takeover of Manchester City football club just weeks earlier.  In the business pages Staveley, 35 and a former model, cuts a glamorous figure; cue a series of breathless profiles from male reporters more used to interviewing drab middle-aged men in suits. The Daily Mail became feverishly excited last month when Staveley was spotted at dinner in Mayfair with old pal Philip Green and newly single Simon Cowell. Green insisted that he was not playing cupid and joked that, with the credit crunch, the enormously wealthy trio had decided to go Dutch and all ate chips and mushy peas. Fans suggest Staveley is quite the Cinderella. She is repeatedly described as a &quot;Yorkshire lass&quot; who has made good. Albeit one with a wealthy landowning father and champion showjumping mother who boarded at an exclusive private school.David Teather Dawn French This has been the year of the undead for French and Saunders, who have spent months hoofing around the country with what they promise will be their final show as a duo, Still Alive. But proving that there is indeed life after death, French, 51, has meanwhile taken a giant leap into a new career, as a memoirist. And not just any memoirist, but quite possibly - in sales terms, at least - the memoirist of the year. Reviewers have generally been dismissive, so why she done so well? The obvious answer is that she&apos;s a crossover star, with a fanbase of vicars and Dibleys as well as stand-up stalwarts. But that&apos;s not quite fair since, framed as a series of letters to everyone from Madonna to her dead father, Dear Fatty is also the most unusual celebrity memoir of the year, which manages to combine laugh-out-loud observational comedy with cringeworthy intimacies, in a writing style so haphazard that it just has to be for real.Claire Armitstead Brian Cox There was a time when scientists tried hard, embarrassingly hard, to persuade the public that science is fun, lucrative and a surefire way to boost your sexual success. It was an awful sight. Pretty women in lab coats were paraded in magazines to prove not all scientists are mingers. Anyone who earned a few quid after studying physics became a career case study. And in the regions, science fairs popped to sound of exploding custard powder. Trust scientists to compound the very problem they set out to solve. In Brian Cox, the image of science has a saviour. In September, the 40-year-old professor of particle physics and straight-talking northern lad enthused the nation by describing the mysteries of the universe that would be probed by the world&apos;s most complex machine, the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva. Dubbed &quot;Lord of the Ring&quot; by the US magazine Seed, he skilfully dismissed suggestions that the machine might create a black hole and wipe out humanity, by declaring bluntly: &quot;Anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world is a twat.&quot;  Cox doesn&apos;t have to try to be a rockstar scientist, because he&apos;s already done that. He quit the 1990s band D:Ream, which gave us the New Labour anthem Things Can Only Get Better, to finish his degree at Manchester. Since then, the Liam Gallagher of physics has become Britain&apos;s most engaging voice in science, his passion and clarity effortless and uncontrived. He is not afraid of a scrap either, last year wading in to attack government over swingeing cuts to physics funding.Ian Sample", "sentences": ["Alexis Petridis Steve McQueen What a year it has been for the 39-year-old London-born, Amsterdam-based artist, who won the Turner prize in 1999."], "title": "Class of 2008: Here are 25 Brits who intrigued, inspired and entertained us this year", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/2008-review-uk-celebrity", "tags": ["Life and style", "Celebrity", "Culture", "Sport", "Politics", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-30T12:52:44Z", "article": "The search for an environmentally friendly fuel for airplanes took a leap forward today with the world&apos;s first flight powered by a second-generation biofuel, derived from plants that do not compete with food crops. An Air New Zealand jumbo jet left Auckland just before midnight GMT with a 50-50 mix of jet fuel and oil from jatropha trees in one of its four engines. The two-hour test flight, which took the Boeing 747 over the Hauraki Gulf, showed that the jatropha biofuel was suitable for use in airplanes without the need for any modifications of the engines. It forms part of the airline&apos;s plan to source 10% of its fuel from sustainable sources by 2013. &quot;At an emotional level, it was an exciting day today,&quot; said Air New Zealand&apos;s chief pilot, David Morgan, who was on the test flight. &quot;We achieved everything we wanted to achieve and it as a significant milestone for the aviation industry, doing the very first jatropha-fuelled flight. We&apos;re thrilled.&quot; The flight was completed as the US airline Continental announced its own plans to test second-generation biofuels: next week it will fly a plane over the Gulf of Mexico with fuel derived from algae. Air travel contributes 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and is one of the fastest rising contributors to climate change, but the search for a greener alternative to kerosene jet fuel has been problematic. Airlines cannot use standard first-generation biofuels such as ethanol because these would freeze at high altitude. In addition, environmentalists argue that manufacturing biofuels can produce more emissions than they absorb when growing, and can also displace agricultural crops and push up the price of food. Air New Zealand&apos;s biofuel was made from jatropha nuts, which are up to 40% oil, harvested from trees grown on marginal land in India, Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania. The fuel was pre-tested to show that it was suitable for airplanes, freezing at -47C and burning at 38C. The flight included a series of tests to assess how the biofuel-powered engine operated compared to the ones running on kerosene at different speeds and at different stages of a normal flight. &quot;The flight was notable for the lack of any surprises \u2013 everything ran normally and as expected,&quot; said Morgan. &quot;The fuel was indistinguishable from jet A1, a true drop-in fuel. You could not see a difference in the four engines.&quot; Continental&apos;s forthcoming demonstration flight will use a mixture of jatropha-derived biofuel and fuel made from algae, supplied by the San Diego company Sapphire Energy, seen as leaders in the search to make useful oil from micro-organisms. In the first commercial test flight of biofuels in the US, one of the engines on a Boeing 737-800 will be filled with a 50-50 mix of biofuel and traditional jet fuel. &quot;One of the reasons we chose algae and jatropha is that both are not food sources and can be grown in arid regions and virtually anywhere,&quot; said Leah Rayne, managing director of global affairs at Continental. &quot;So they do not compete with food crops for water.&quot; She added that, although the jatropha and algae fuels did not require any modifications to current aircraft engines, it would take several years of test flights for the biofuels to be certified for general use by airlines. Robin Oakley, head of Greenpeace UK&apos;s climate change campaign, warned against overinterpreting the results of the test flights. When Air New Zealand announced its biofuel plans in November, he said: &quot;We need a dose of realism here, because this test flight does not mean an end to the use of kerosene in jet engines. The amount of jatropha that would be needed to power the world&apos;s entire aviation sector cannot be produced in anything like a sustainable way, and even if large volumes could be grown, planes are an incredibly wasteful way of using it.&quot; Environmentalists argue that curbing flights is the only true solution. The Air New Zealand and Continental planes are not the first to use biofuels: in February, Virgin Atlantic successfully tried a mixture of 80% jet fuel and 20% biofuel - made from coconut oil and babassu palm oil - in one engine of a Boeing 747 on a flight between London and Amsterdam.", "sentences": ["The Air New Zealand and Continental planes are not the first to use biofuels: in February, Virgin Atlantic successfully tried a mixture of 80% jet fuel and 20% biofuel - made from coconut oil and babassu palm oil - in one engine of a Boeing 747 on a flight between London and Amsterdam."], "title": "Air New Zealand jet completes world's first second-generation biofuel flight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/30/biofuel-test-plane", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Biofuels", "Environment", "World news", "New Zealand", "Business", "Airline industry", "Transport", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2008-12-30T18:12:05Z", "article": "Allotment people tend to slow down on the gardening front in January. If you are digging when the ground is wet and icy you are likely to do more harm than good. If mud sticks to your boots, the soil is too wet to work. Turning over frozen ground only serves to move the cold soil from top to bottom so that it takes longer to warm up in spring.  One advantage of a good freeze is that your wheelbarrow will glide over frozen ground effortlessly, so it&apos;s a good opportunity to drop heaps of organic compost at strategic points ready to spread later. Another useful warming exercise is to shred any woody prunings. Gather a group or lobby your committee to hire the biggest shredder out there (worth every penny) and you can all pitch in. Don&apos;t forget your goggles and gloves. Woody prunings make a great mulch to keep weeds down and keep moisture in later in the year. Pile them up for at least six weeks before using them however.  No matter what the weather brings you can get on with fence mending, path making or throwing together another compost bin. While you are out there take a good look at the site. Check for frost pockets \u2013 always at the lowest level \u2013 wind tunnels and wet sodden areas. You may need to organize some wind breaks, or think about raised beds or putting in drainage. Make a rotation plan ready for spring.  Include catch crops to make maximum use of the precious space under cloches. A neat plan I found in a postwar smallholder&apos;s book (The Complete Market Gardener by J O Baker, 1949) is ideal for January in a cold greenhouse or February outside under cloches. The key is to choose vegetables that have the same cultural requirements but will fit together comfortably as neighbours in terms of the space they require and their maturing times. This is a Jack Spratt arrangement where nothing is wasted.      Plant supplers send out seed potatoes from now    The plan is to a sow winter carrots (eg, &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos;) under cloches interspersed with winter lettuce (eg, &apos;Winter Density&apos;). This makes most use of space as the carrots need room for roots but little for shoots while the needs of the lettuce are the opposite. The lettuce will be harvested in March, when you can sow some turnips (eg, &apos;Demi Longue&apos;). Up until this point little or no watering is needed but once the turnips are in it&apos;s time for a good watering and feed (e.g. liquid seaweed). The covers are taken off on fine days as both carrots and turnips like plenty of air. The delectable golf ball sized turnips will be ready mid-April when all covers can come off. The dainty finger carrots will be ready by the end of April. If you want to add radish choose an early variety like &apos;French Breakfast Forcing&apos; to go in and out with the lettuce. These are an extra as they don&apos;t really need the special conditions. Plant suppliers send out seed potatoes from January onwards. Typically allotments will have had potatoes planted year in year out on the same ground making disease highly probable. Top of the list for disease resistance is the baking potato, &apos;Lady Balfour&apos;, named after the founder of the Soil Association.  Others with Soil Association organic certification include &apos;Cara&apos; a late baking potato and &apos;Orla&apos;, an early performer and which is claimed to have the &apos;highest blight resistance ever seen&apos; as well as resistance to scab and blackleg.      Our first earlies came from the London Potato Fair    Some merchants do collections of blight resistant potatoes which will include these and the breakthrough &apos;blight proof&apos; &apos;Sarpo&apos; range. It is also possible to get heritage varieties now as &apos;minitubers&apos;. These are guaranteed to be disease free as they are micropropagated in vitro under laboratory conditions. While this may smack of genetic engineering, it will serve to save many old and distinguished varieties from being wiped out by disease. Keeping in mind that potatoes originated somewhere around Peru, don&apos;t let them get too cold. Unpack them as soon as they arrive and keep them in a frost free but cool spot. Though not strictly essential, chitting (letting them sprout for a few weeks) should give them a head start and produce a heavier crop. Though hardly an exact science, potatoes are ideally planted out when the sprouts are around 5cm long and when the weather is mild \u2013 usually sometime between early and late March though you can plant them as late as April. The first earlies, which need to be eaten straight away, will take ten weeks to mature. The late maincrops take twice as long but can be stored through the winter.  If you want home grown potatoes all year round you will need to plant a good selection of earlies, mids and lates. You get a surprising amount of potatoes from each tuber , so, to avoid gluts, it&apos;s worth looking at the collections of different types with a just a few of each for different seasons.", "sentences": ["Plant supplers send out seed potatoes from now    The plan is to a sow winter carrots (eg, &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos;) under cloches interspersed with winter lettuce (eg, &apos;Winter Density&apos;)."], "title": "Things to do in January", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/allotment/2008/dec/30/gardens-gardeningadvice", "tags": ["Gardens", "Gardening advice", "Organic gardening"]}]}
