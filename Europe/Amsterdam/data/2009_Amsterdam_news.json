Photograph: David Levene/Guardian    Joseph Haydn&apos;s problem is that he didn&apos;t die young or go deaf. He survived until he was 77 and seems to have led a largely blameless life, give or take the odd mistress. Film-makers are unlikely to make a Haydn biopic. There is the additional complication that he didn&apos;t write Don Giovanni or the Choral Symphony, but he did write the Creation, the Seasons, 15 operas, 106 mould-breaking symphonies, 70 pioneering string quartets, 45 piano trios, and 51 piano sonatas that are more than a match for Mozart and pointed the way to Beethoven, as well as the tune for the German national anthem. It is a formidable oeuvre, but still Haydn lives in the shadow of Mozart and Beethoven. His critics would say he was the faceless producer of immensely polished music, a relic of an aristocratic age. Other great composers have what might be called a signature: there is Bach&apos;s serenity, Mozart&apos;s ethereal perfection, Beethoven&apos;s grandeur, Schubert&apos;s lyricism, Wagner&apos;s transcendent musical climaxes. Haydn is more elusive. With the possible exception of the Creation, his late choral masterpiece, there is no defining work. Everything is extraordinary. Or, the sceptics might say, none of it is extraordinary. His admirers hope that the celebrations planned for this year, the bicentenary of his death, will put those sceptics to flight. For a start, Radio 3 will be playing all 104 of Haydn&apos;s numbered symphonies (there are two others, wrongly catalogued as string quartets), two a week starting tomorrow morning. I have never really engaged with the symphonies, finding the few I have heard formulaic compared with, say, Beethoven&apos;s epic constructions. So I set myself a challenge: to listen to the symphonies in their entirety, over a fortnight rather than a year. I plan to start at Haydn&apos;s birthplace in Rohrau, close to the point at which Austria, Hungary and Slovakia meet, and I will be lugging around a small suitcase filled with Haydn CDs. I am not one of the iPod generation and stick to a portable CD player.  In the taxi to Rohrau from the little Austrian town of Hainburg, where Haydn studied music as a child, the radio is playing Supertramp&apos;s Breakfast in America. The thatched farmhouse in which Haydn was born is well kept, and the two-page guide describes it as &quot;one of Austria&apos;s most significant memorials&quot;. But no one else arrives during my two-hour stay, and the last entry in the visitors&apos; book was made four days previously. I listen to Haydn&apos;s Symphony No 5 on a small bench beside the room in which he was born - very moving. The following day, I travel to Eisenstadt in southern Austria - &quot;Haydnstadt&quot;, as it is nicknamed. This was the principal seat of Haydn&apos;s patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy, and there are traces of the composer everywhere. I would have stayed in the Haydn hotel, but it is closed for Christmas. Large letters on a wall and a huge arrow point to the Haydn caf\u00e9, but the establishment is long gone. However, I do manage a vast Wiener Schnitzel in the Haydnbr\u00e4u restaurant. Haydn was originally buried in Vienna, but the Esterh\u00e1zy family felt they owned him in death, as in life, and, in 1820, had him dug up and brought to Eisenstadt. It was discovered that the skull was missing, Haydn&apos;s head having been stolen by a servant when he died. The skull was eventually passed to the Society of the Friends of Music in Vienna, and the parts were not reunited until 1954. A funeral is just ending when I reach the Bergkirche, but an attendant opens the mausoleum for me to gaze at Haydn&apos;s marble tomb. She also introduces me to Josef Bauer, a music teacher who has been organist at the Bergkirche for 32 years. He takes me up to the organ loft, shows me the organ Haydn himself played, and plays the benedictus from Haydn&apos;s Little Organ Mass and the hymn from the &quot;Emperor&quot; string quartet which evolved into Deutschland Uber Alles. Is it a responsibility, playing Haydn&apos;s own organ, with the composer entombed below? &quot;Of course,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes I think he must be spinning.&quot; All my Haydn-spotting means I have barely started on the symphonies. Nos 6, 7 and 8, his first symphonies for the Esterh\u00e1zy family, are delightful concerto-like works with the deftness and transparency of chamber music. Once he had access to Esterh\u00e1zy&apos;s excellent orchestra, he quickly got to know his players and wrote sinuous solos for the principals. Haydn&apos;s romantic critics saw patronage as enslavement, but it offered him financial security and artistic freedom. The Esterh\u00e1zys supplied a splendid concert hall in Eisenstadt, and two small opera houses in the palace of Eszterh\u00e1za, the family&apos;s summer home in present-day Hungary. While Mozart starved, Haydn drew his salary, and made music in extraordinarily user-friendly conditions.  Of course, listening to the symphonies back to back is not very sensible. The finales all sound the same, though the slow movements rarely disappoint; among the early symphonies, the adagio of No 13 is especially gorgeous. Adam Fischer, whose recordings I am principally relying on, tells me when I meet him a few days later that while occasional movements can be routine, every symphony has some spark of genius. But he warns me not to set too much store by his recordings of the later (and best known) symphonies, which he recorded first and feels are the weakest of the set. &quot;By the time I got halfway through I wanted to start again.&quot; Fischer, the only living conductor to have recorded all the Haydn symphonies, can chart his life by them. &quot;My daughter went to school with No 35; my son did his final school exams with 82; my niece got married with 32, had a baby with 41 and got divorced with 53.&quot; Another Hungarian, the late Antal Dor\u00e1ti, was the first to complete the marathon, but three other conductors - Roy Goodman, Christopher Hogwood and Bruno Weil - abandoned the project, thwarted by disappointing sales.  At the record shop in Eisenstadt, the owner says Haydn holds his own here; elsewhere in Austria, he is outsold 10 to 1 by Mozart and Beethoven. I am beginning to feel sorry for this marginalised genius - and for myself, as I plough on into the 40s (though No 49, &quot;La Passione&quot;, is magnificent). Can the Haydn problem ever be solved? Will Haydn-Jahr, which is being loudly proclaimed in Eisenstadt, do the job? &quot;It&apos;s a terrific opportunity,&quot; says musicologist Denis McCaldin, who has been director of the Haydn Society of Great Britain for 30 years. &quot;In a recent Classic FM poll of favourite composers, Haydn wasn&apos;t even in the first 10 - that&apos;s telling. He doesn&apos;t come at you with complete charm, even though he was a wonderfully charming man. His work is extremely rich, but you have to know it a bit.&quot; McCaldin suggests listening to one symphony from each phase: the early works; the Sturm und Drang period (from No 39 to those in the upper 60s); the later, more expansive symphonies composed for larger orchestras. &quot;Choose the ones with nicknames,&quot; he advises, &quot;because nearly always the nickname is about something interesting, like the Philosopher [No 22] or the Horn Signal [no 31], with four horns blasting away - it&apos;s great fun.&quot;  I travel on to Vienna, where the degree to which Mozart eclipses the man he called &quot;Papa Haydn&quot; is palpable. Everywhere there is Mozartiana - shopping bags, T-shirts, postcards, mugs, plates, ashtrays. Haydn is lucky to get the odd tiny faux-marble bust. It all seems grossly unfair, given that Haydn helped mould the modern symphony, taking the Italian overture and investing it with new power and structural ingenuity, constantly widening its scope and thus preparing the way for Beethoven and the romantics. The latter, especially Berlioz, repaid Haydn by instantly consigning him to history.  A key part of the Haydn problem is his musical style. &quot;Sometimes Haydn writes pretty things,&quot; says the conductor Roger Norrington, &quot;but on the whole, like Beethoven, he doesn&apos;t write the greatest tunes. Mozart&apos;s the tunesmith. Haydn&apos;s world is embattled, and that&apos;s where Beethoven got his music from. Beethoven got his music from Haydn, not from Mozart.&quot;  In the wrong hands, Norrington says, Haydn can sound lifeless. &quot;He is enormously challenging - another reason why he gets a raw deal. Mozart is very sexy, very warm; Haydn less so. People call him intellectual, which he isn&apos;t really, but he&apos;s very hard to perform. The andantes are often played too slowly; you have to be able to feel you can move to them, perhaps dance to them. The audience in the 18th century listened to music with their feet. Get all that right and then you have to add your interpretation. The cornflakes are there and they&apos;re delicious, but you have to provide the cream and sugar. It&apos;s funny and it&apos;s tragic and it&apos;s terrific. If you&apos;re bored with Haydn, shoot the conductor.&quot; Haydn has been accused of lacking emotion, but Fischer rejects that charge. &quot;It&apos;s stupid to call Haydn emotionless. This is very lively music, and you have to laugh and weep and show all your emotions. Much more than in Tchaikovsky, yet we think that Tchaikovsky is emotional and Haydn is elegant.&quot; Fischer stresses Haydn&apos;s humanity. &quot;It&apos;s not holy music, it&apos;s like you and me; it&apos;s very human and shows very normal feelings. More so than Beethoven. I feel better as a person and better in my life when I play Haydn. All art is about searching for answers about what happens after death. Haydn is the one who says, &apos;I don&apos;t have the answer, but it&apos;s good, so who cares?&apos;&quot; As I write, Haydn&apos;s Symphony No 93, the first of his 12 London symphonies - composed during two lengthy visits to England in the 1790s - is playing. The &quot;Surprise&quot;, &quot;Miracle&quot;, &quot;Clock&quot; and &quot;Drumroll&quot; still await me; Haydn saved the best till last, writing these in his 60s. Listening to 106 symphonies in a fortnight is probably an insult to him. As McCaldin says, far better to get to know half a dozen than skim the lot. But something seems to have registered, because today I went out and spent my Christmas vouchers on Paul McCreesh&apos;s recording of the Creation and Ren\u00e9 Jacobs&apos; disc of the Seasons. I&apos;ve also bought the late Richard Hickox&apos;s acclaimed eight-disc set of the complete masses. It seems my symphonic odyssey was just a beginning. Happy Haydn-Jahr!  Andrew Clement&apos;s guide to the essential symphonies on record Nos 6, 7 and 8 Hanover Band/Goodman (Hyperion Helios) Roy Goodman&apos;s Haydn series with the period instruments of the Hanover Band stopped short of becoming a complete cycle, but includes collections covering every phase of his long symphonic career. The linked trilogy of early symphonies called Le Matin, Le Midi and Le Soir, composed in 1761, is a good example of Goodman&apos;s intensely dramatic style. Nos 30, 53 and 69; 31, 59 and 63 Vienna Concentus Musicus/Harnoncourt (Warner Apex) Nikolaus Harnoncourt was one of the pioneers of the period-instrument movement in the 1950s and at their best his performances still have that missionary zeal and zest. There&apos;s real lightness and humour in this selection from the late 1760s and 70s. Nos 43, 44, 49, 52, 59 Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orch/Fischer  (Nimbus) Adam Fischer&apos;s survey of all 104 symphonies, recorded in the Esterh\u00e1zy Palace, and performed by players from the Budapest Festival Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic. This collection of works from Haydn&apos;s Sturm und Drang period of the early 1770s is wonderfully responsive, with deeply expressive slow movements and bracingly athletic faster ones. Nos 82-87Philharmonia Hungarica/Dor\u00e1ti (Decca, two CDs) Antal Dorati&apos;s complete survey was years ahead of its time even in the early 1970s. The brisk, no-nonsense playing and clean crisp textures from the modern instruments of the Hungarian orchestra make the Paris symphonies still seem thoroughly up to date.  Nos 88-92Berlin Phil/Rattle (EMI) Simon Rattle has always commuted happily between modern instruments and period bands when conducting Haydn. This set of live recordings shows how compelling Rattle&apos;s hybrid approach can be. The London Symphonies(Nos 93-104)Orchestra of the 18th Century/Br\u00fcggen (Philips) Haydn&apos;s last and grandest symphonies were composed for the concerts put on by London impresario Salomon in the 1790s. Frans Br\u00fcggen&apos;s performances from the 1990s with his Amsterdam-based period band are fabulously satisfying, full of wit and stylish detail. \u2022 Radio 3&apos;s broadcast of all Haydn&apos;s symphonies begins tomorrow morning with Symphony No 1, and will continue on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year. The final movement of Haydn&apos;s &quot;Farewell&quot; Symphony will be performed in today&apos;s New Year&apos;s Day concert from Vienna on Radio 3 and BBC2.", "sentences": ["Frans Br\u00fcggen&apos;s performances from the 1990s with his Amsterdam-based period band are fabulously satisfying, full of wit and stylish detail."], "title": "The great Haydn road trip", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/01/classicalmusicandopera", "tags": ["Classical music", "Culture", "Music", "Joseph Haydn"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-03T00:01:00Z", "article": "A woman gave birth on the London underground&apos;s Jubilee line after her waters broke unexpectedly.

When paramedics arrived they decided there was not enough time to get her to hospital so moved her to a station supervisor&apos;s office where they delivered a healthy baby girl 35 minutes after she raised the alarm on 19 December. The only other recorded birth on the tube was in 1924, when Marie Cordery was born at Elephant &amp; Castle, according to Transport for London. A TfL spokesman said: &quot;At 9pm the station supervisor received a message from the control room that a woman on a northbound Jubilee line train was complaining of stomach pains. A few minutes later the station supervisor went to the platform and found the pregnant woman having contractions and called an ambulance. &quot;The woman, accompanied by her sister, was wrapped in a foil blanket to keep warm and taken to the supervisor&apos;s office, where the ambulance crew delivered a healthy baby.&quot; They were taken to Northwick Park hospital.

However, there are more serious issues on his mind. Antony&apos;s new album The Crying Light, the follow-up to 2004&apos;s Mercury Prize-winning, half-a-million-selling I Am A Bird Now, sees his gaze turn outwards from issues of gender confusion to meditations on his relationship with nature. Featuring orchestral arrangements by Nico Muhly and even guitar on a couple of tracks (&quot;I&apos;m slowly graduating from my fear and loathing of it,&quot; he jokes), songs such as Everglade imagine him &quot;in this beautiful, animist landscape where the leaves are gazing at me and the water is whispering to me and I&apos;m feeling connected to the world \u2013 and yet there&apos;s something in my mind that&apos;s still broken.&quot; Then there&apos;s the threat of impending environmental catastrophe, bleakly imagined in Another World. Antony says his new hero is Joan Pick, interviewed in the Guardian a few months ago as &quot;the woman with the tiny carbon footprint&quot;, who eats raw food, buys nothing except new trainers and hasn&apos;t driven a car since 1973. The music and themes may have changed but his voice is still the androgynous blend of gospel, art-rock and soul that&apos;s bewitched collaborators as diverse as Hercules And Love Affair and the London Symphony Orchestra, who played two extraordinary Barbican concerts with him last year at which Antony wore a Roman toga (&quot;It was actually a sandwich wrap&quot;) and covered Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s Crazy In Love, because &quot;she&apos;s gorgeous&quot;. Hercules gave him a chart hit with Blind, though his guest vocal was recorded in 2003, before he became famous. He&apos;d like to make more dance music. &quot;The challenge of getting people to dance is such a nice reason to sing,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a hoot.&quot; Not that there are any floorfillers on The Crying Light: &quot;I don&apos;t think it quite fits under this moniker. If it&apos;s miserable enough it makes its way on to my record.&quot; He&apos;s joking, of course. Antony doesn&apos;t regard his music as miserable and says, &quot;I do recommend that anyone that sees my records as miserable stops listening to them immediately, because they&apos;re not helping.&quot; He&apos;s horrified that Hope There&apos;s Someone is purportedly popular at funerals. &quot;Oh God, that sounds like a nightmare. It&apos;s a song for the living, not a tribute to the dead.&quot; He says his new lyrical desire to engage with the world at large is a consequence of him feeling &quot;more confident as a transgender person&quot;. By transgender, he means &quot;just people who are naturally gender variant. For some of us it exhibits very young, so by the time they&apos;re five some boys are pretending to shave and some boys are,&quot; he laughs, &quot;doing what they do. Being transgender is the only minority in which 99% of the time you manifest against the wishes of your family. So it&apos;s obviously a very strong impulse, because in this heterosexist society there&apos;s not a lot of room for breaking rank.&quot; His Catholic upbringing in Chichester, Sussex made him feel &quot;that I was an alien from another dimension&quot;. Formative experiences included watching Hammer horror films aged six as his babysitter passed him cigarettes, and of course Top Of The Pops: &quot;I remember being seven and watching Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads and Lena Lovich. That&apos;s so ravishing, to be that young and see subculture.&quot; Then there were his trips to visit his grandmother in London, when &quot;we&apos;d always drive down Kings Road at my insistence: &apos;Ooh look, there&apos;s someone with blue hair!&apos; It was literally like going to a safari. If my poor father had realised what he was prepping me for he would never have done it.&quot; The family moved around a lot, living in Amsterdam then Santa Cruz. His teachers weren&apos;t impressed with his singing: &quot;In second grade I was told, &apos;He loves music, if only his prowess matched his enthusiasm.&apos;&quot; He loved pop stars like Boy George, who sang with him years later on You Are My Sister from I Am A Bird Now, and to whom he&apos;s remained close. &quot;We advise each other on various matters,&quot; says Antony. &quot;George is so major. I&apos;m surprised they didn&apos;t launch nuclear weapons when he sang Do You Really Want To Hurt Me? on Top Of The Pops. It was the triumph of an invincible vulnerability, and that is so typical of a trans kid. He&apos;s been through hell, obviously, but all you have to do is look in his eyes and he&apos;s incredible.&quot; By 1990, having failed to get into London&apos;s Royal College of Art, Antony got accepted at New York University. Though he regarded himself as a performance artist in the lineage of Hot Peaches or the Cockettes, he started singing at clubs like the Pyramid and the Limelight: &quot;I would make back-up tapes with a four-track, and that&apos;s how I wrote a lot of the songs on the first album.&quot; Antony graduated from playing nightclubs to putting on plays in more conventional spaces with his new theatre group the Johnsons. By the middle of the decade, however, &quot;it became clear that there wasn&apos;t any support for that kind of work. Also I&apos;d been waiting for someone to discover me, and it didn&apos;t happen. I got this one grant and I thought, &apos;This is my ticket out \u2013 I&apos;m gonna make an album.&apos;&quot; The eponymous debut Antony And The Johnsons album was recorded in a day in 1997, eventually reaching David Tibet, of avant gardists Current 93, who released it on his own label in 2000. The next breakthrough came when Lou Reed&apos;s producer invited him to sing backing vocals on Reed&apos;s 2003 album The Raven. &quot;Lou&apos;s a lionhearted guy,&quot; says Antony of the irascible legend, &quot;but there was also a huge cultural shift that had happened during 2002 to 2005 that had made it possible for someone like me to come forward. A new generation of people like Devendra Banhart opened doors in youth culture that were more dreamy, more flexible. Their idea was, &apos;Let&apos;s just build a garden and feel a sense of joy.&apos;&quot; By the time Banhart had made Antony&apos;s The Lake the final track on his influential 2004 &quot;freak folk&quot; compilation The Golden Apples Of The Sun, a receptive audience was ready for him. Yet it was a 1980s Scottish indie star whom he believes truly paved the way. &quot;Elizabeth Fraser is the secret mother of the whole thing,&quot; he says. &quot;The last Cocteau Twins record in 1996 was an EP called Twinlights and its last words were &apos;I still care about this planet, I still feel connected to nature and to my dreams for myself, I have my friends, my family, I have myself, I still have me.&apos; And when I heard that I cried so much and changed my whole approach. I thought, &apos;OK, that&apos;s the most revolutionary thing a person could do \u2013 to hope.&apos; That&apos;s how culture works. There&apos;s a harbinger 10 years earlier, then a whole crop comes up 10 years later.&quot; Right now Antony&apos;s hopes, along with everyone else&apos;s, are invested in Barack Obama. &quot;Everyone makes such a fuss about Obama&apos;s race, but we&apos;ve had plenty of African American leaders in positions of great power,&quot; Antony points out. &quot;The difference is that Obama is a charismatic liberal with a moral authority. He introduced the spectre of hope, which no one&apos;s dared to do since the assassinations of the late-60s. There&apos;s so much that needs to be done it&apos;s almost inconceivable, the changes that we need to embrace to create a sustainable world. That&apos;s all that really matters. All the fuss about everything else is just going to be nothing but hum in 100 years.&quot; A beacon of intelligence and imagination in a drab music scene, it&apos;s tempting to conclude that Antony may well be the last of the great pop stars who rose from the subculture to weird out the mainstream. Yet the man himself is having none of it: &quot;People aren&apos;t that different from generation to generation. We&apos;re basically the same old sludge reincarnated over and over again. Every generation has all the colours \u2013 it never stops.&quot; It&apos;s just that Antony&apos;s colours are that bit bolder than everyone else&apos;s, now with a welcome preponderance of green. \u2022 The Crying Light is out on Jan 19", "sentences": ["If my poor father had realised what he was prepping me for he would never have done it.&quot; The family moved around a lot, living in Amsterdam then Santa Cruz."], "title": "Antony and the Johnsons light up 2009", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/03/antony-hegarty-and-the-johnsons", "tags": ["Antony and the Johnsons", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-05T15:59:05Z", "article": "The diary of Anne Frank, claimed to be the most widely read piece of non-fiction apart from the Bible, still resonates in the 21st century. In a corner of west London, a charity, the Anne Frank Trust, is using the powerful story of the Jewish teenager&apos;s years in hiding in a warehouse attic in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam to open the minds of young people to many of the issues around personal responsibility and prejudice that they face today. For Deirdre Higgins, pastoral manager at the study centre in Ealing, a pupil-referral unit for up to 80 children aged between 11 and 16, the diary provides a new dimension to her work on emotional literacy. &quot;I had done some work on Anne Frank before, in high school, when I was head of history \u2013 so I knew its value in a historical context,&quot; she says. &quot;But the diary has many levels, and it tied in with what we were doing in PSHE and active citizenship, and it has also been used to look at the issue of bullying.&quot; The young people at the study centre, who are on the edges of mainstream education, also have a natural empathy with Anne Frank, says Higgins. &quot;It&apos;s about the whole nature of them being here, about their feelings of not being included. It means they have been able to question that as well as other issues around cultural diversity and the right to choose, as well as human rights.&quot; The trust, set up to keep the legacy of the 15-year-old teenager alive, has so far worked with 30,000 pupils, mostly in deprived London boroughs, in the last two years but is now taking its Positive Voices \u2026 Positive Attitudes project to other parts of the UK. This year it begins working with schools in Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as Durham and the north-east. The project manager, Jamie Arden, says: &quot;At the beginning, we work with the local authority to identify what is going on locally, to help identify specific schools which are in need to the project team where there is conflict, that could be division in terms of race or schools where there is a high rate of bullying. We could also work with a school where may be there is tension in the community outside the school and the project can be used by the school as a way of bringing these communities together.&quot; The charity uses an exhibition, mostly archived pictures of Anne Frank and her family and photographs that reflect the social history of the times, such as of Nazi rallies, as the starting point for its work. It also trains some of the pupils as guides, who go on to tell the Anne Frank story in their own words to their classmates as they tour the exhibition. The project facilitator, Mark McEvoy, says: &quot;The exhibition then becomes more about their space \u2013 it&apos;s not just about us coming in and doing our thing. We deliver the exhibition through photographs. We then use the story as a backdrop to talk about the Holocaust and racism. We then relate it to their lives, with discussions around human rights, racial prejudice, knife-crime and gangs. It&apos;s always about bringing the story into the context of their lives.&quot; The exhibition remains in the school for two weeks while project workers run a series of workshops around creative writing, art and drama as well as others that look at bullying and human rights, personal responsibility, and the right to choose. The potential of the trust&apos;s work to enrich the secondary school curriculum is acknowledged by Ali Longston, community cohesion and citizenship consultant at Ealing borough council. &quot;It links in with many areas of work \u2013 conflict resolution, racism and being a citizen,&quot; she says. &quot;It fits very well with the current curriculum.&quot; This year the story of Anne Frank is being brought to television viewers in a BBC1 week-long drama, The Diary of Anne Frank, which begins today. It will be shown in five 30-minute episodes on weekday evenings before EastEnders, and the BBC hopes the series will help bring the diary to a new generation. The trust has assisted the BBC on the adaptation, and has dedicated resources on its website to coincide with the screening. The trust&apos;s executive director, and one of its founders, Gillian Walnes, says: &quot;The series will especially appeal to schools, because there are five half-hour programmes which fit comfortably with the length of classroom lessons.&quot; The trust&apos;s project for schools has evolved from its core work, which is devoted to a mobile exhibition about Anne Frank. It has been touring the UK since 1988, when the trust was set up with the blessing of Otto Frank, who wanted to see an educational trust established in the UK to build on the legacy of his daughter. So far the exhibition has been seen by 3 million people. The trust has also been working in young offender institutions and prisons. For Walnes, the appeal of Anne Frank is far-reaching because her diary makes people think about the big questions \u2013 such as our shared responsibility for humanity \u2013 but also because it speaks about that time in life between being a child and an adult. &quot;The diary is like a life speeded up; it&apos;s everybody&apos;s growing up, but Anne also represents the face of the persecuted,&quot; she says.", "sentences": ["In a corner of west London, a charity, the Anne Frank Trust, is using the powerful story of the Jewish teenager&apos;s years in hiding in a warehouse attic in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam to open the minds of young people to many of the issues around personal responsibility and prejudice that they face today."], "title": "Anne Frank's legacy helps deprived children overcome prejudice and racism", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jan/05/anne-frank-racism-schools", "tags": ["Judaism", "Schools", "Education", "UK news", "Personal, social and health education", "Religion", "Bullying", "Race issues", "Race in education", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-06T00:01:00Z", "article": "Willem Buiter is just answering a call from Time magazine.

And now he is in demand as a consultant (clients have included the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) as well as a media pundit. He also writes a feisty blog for the Financial Times - a recent example was headed &quot;Confessions of a crass Keynesian&quot;. So did he foresee the depth of the hole towards which the economy was plunging? &quot;Not in August 2007, I didn&apos;t,&quot; he says. &quot;I saw the slowdown coming, but the seizing up of credit and the drying up of capital markets didn&apos;t happen until the Lehman Brothers default [in September 2008]. That was the moment of cardiac arrest.&quot;  Attempts by the government to resuscitate the patient on this side of the Atlantic are routinely described as Keynesian, as opposed to monetarist. Is that the case and, if so, have we understood what Keynes meant? The LSE&apos;s chair in European economy just about stifles a yawn before answering: &quot;I find debates about what Keynes really meant singularly uninformative. But, yes, the government has been playing at Keynesianism by prescribing a dose of expansionary fiscal policy to try to reduce the severity of the recession. Trouble is that it was such a low dose and so cack-handedly presented that most of the public didn&apos;t recognise it as a stimulus at all. If [the government] really wanted to stimulate demand, it would have been more effective to give every adult a cheque for \u00a3500.&quot; Keynes also suggested programmes of public works to reduce unemployment and put money into otherwise empty pockets. &quot;The problem with public works is that you have to have viable projects, unless you want to commission the digging of holes in the morning and then filling them up in the afternoon,&quot; Buiter says. &quot;And the government doesn&apos;t have a list of projects that can be started immediately.&quot; What about its programme for insulating houses? &quot;That&apos;s private, not public works,&quot; he says. &quot;Give people incentives to lag their lofts by all means, but it&apos;s up to individuals whether they take up the offer. Getting public investment projects going takes far longer, partly because of Britain&apos;s esoteric planning laws. But even if you were Joe Stalin himself, it would still take time to get houses, schools or prisons off the ground. I&apos;m not saying that Britain doesn&apos;t need better infrastructure. Public transport in London, for instance, is an international disgrace. But the lead time from planning a project to somebody sinking a shovel into the ground is two to three years at the very least.&quot; The UK can&apos;t afford to wait that long, Buiter argues.  &quot;The Bank of England, with government backing, should have been far more aggressive from the start to induce banks to release the money they&apos;re hoarding.&quot; Proposals to fine banks if they refuse to lend fairly are a &quot;beginning&quot;, he says. &quot;But it won&apos;t be enough. I can foresee long and expensive court cases to decide what&apos;s &apos;fair&apos;. And by the time they&apos;ve decided, the recession will be much further down the road.&quot; Buiter would prefer to set the banks targets, and tax them on the difference between the target and what they actually lend. Shock tactics are required, he maintains, because Britain now has the most vulnerable of major European economies - partly because of our refusal to join the eurozone and partly because of our over-reliance on the financial sector. &quot;It grew from 7% to 9% of GDP in a decade,&quot; he points out. &quot;Britain began to look more and more like a bank itself. And that&apos;s a dangerous position to be in.&quot; Naive belief It is a process he traces back to Margaret Thatcher&apos;s rise to power in 1979. &quot;She introduced light-touch regulation - or soft touch as I call it. There was a further relaxation of all kinds of credit to all kinds of borrowers. And new Labour did nothing to stop it. They simply spent the tax revenues on expanding the public sector. Lax regulatory standards were coupled with a naive belief by consumers that house prices would keep on rising for ever. So when the financial crisis hit, British households were the most indebted in the world.&quot; As for the euro, don&apos;t get Buiter started. He has written about it extensively and been a staunch advocate of Britain joining from the moment the zone was created. &quot;This crisis has simply reinforced the argument,&quot; he says. &quot;Sterling is more vulnerable to bank runs than global reserve currencies like the euro and the dollar.&quot; Buiter brings to his analysis a cross-Channel as well as transatlantic breadth of experience. He was born in 1949 in Holland, the son of the first general secretary of what is now the European Trade Union Confederation.  &quot;My parents were Christian socialists,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s a rich Dutch tradition of church influencing politics, a bit like Methodism and the early Labour party here.&quot; His father&apos;s work took the family initially to Luxembourg and then to Brussels. Young Willem completed the European baccalaureate there before returning to Dutch soil to do his first degree in Amsterdam. &quot;I didn&apos;t like it much,&quot; he admits. &quot;Student revolutionaries kept occupying the buildings.&quot; (Well, it was the late 60s.)  Cambridge turned out to be more to his taste. Revolutionary activity was not unknown in the Fens, but life in Emmanuel College proved quiet enough to allow him to get on with some work. &quot;After that I just continued going west,&quot; he smiles, &quot;and drifted into academia.&quot; Well, that&apos;s one way of putting it. He acquired a PhD (with distinction) at Yale before teaching both there and at Princeton as well as Cambridge and London. His second wife, Professor Anne C Sibert, is an American and just happens to be head of economics, maths and statistics at Birkbeck College in London.  Buiter himself has dual British and American nationality and claims to be &quot;perfectly happy on either side of the Atlantic&quot;. Surely the pay, though, is better on one side than the other? &quot;Yes, but in economics you can always make fees from consulting. London&apos;s not a bad place to be for that.&quot; And, yes, despite the public transport, he enjoys living in the city. Buiter, in his 60th year, is still a passionate tennis player. &quot;I&apos;m currently out of commission with a rare variant of tennis elbow, and it&apos;s driving me mad,&quot; he grumbles. One of his regular partners is his Peruvian (adopted) son David Alejandro, 17. A bit of an age difference, then? &quot;Yes, but there&apos;s no mercy on court.&quot; In the meantime, his verbal returns remain punchy.

On a frozen December morning, nothing very much moves beyond the road&apos;s edge; a horse stamps at a trough, a tractor pushes along a narrow track. Every half mile or so, behind a stand of poplars, a neat brick farmhouse - raked gravel drive, lace curtains at the windows - slides into view. Next to it is a large, windowless and vaguely ominous shed, the size, perhaps, of a small aircraft hangar.  It will hold, almost certainly, several hundred pigs. In a country famed for the unnatural feats of its intensive farming sector (the Netherlands occupies less than one-thousandth of the world&apos;s surface, but is its third largest exporter of agricultural produce), this area, known as De Peel, is more densely populated with pigs than anywhere else on the planet. Some of the sheds are multistorey; they&apos;re called pig-flats. There&apos;s a fair chance - especially if you&apos;re partial to bacon - that you&apos;ve eaten meat from one of them. A good proportion of the 20m pigs born, fattened, sent abroad or slaughtered each year in the Netherlands come from here, and the Netherlands has become the biggest single supplier of our morning rasher. &quot;This,&quot; Hans Baij of the animal welfare group Varkens in Nood, or Pigs in Distress, had told me the day before in his office in Amsterdam, &quot;is advanced industrial pig farming. There&apos;s nothing natural about this whatsoever. It&apos;s about science, sperm selection, antibiotics, piglets per sow, grams per day, muscle-to-fat ratios. It&apos;s what this country does. Welfare doesn&apos;t come into it.&quot; Picture, for a moment, a pig. Engaging, maybe. Large, pink, ungainly, certainly (though that&apos;s not how they always were; the original pig was compact and capable of speeds up to 40mph). That strong, muscular snout was designed for rooting around in soil and undergrowth; a sense of smell acute enough to snuffle out buried truffles was plainly intended for forensic foraging. In many languages, pigs are a byword for anything gross, unpleasant, unhygienic. They&apos;re actually very clean; they hate a dirty bed, and will select a latrine area and use it. They are the most curious and intelligent farmyard animals. (A professor from Pennsylvania State University has demonstrated that pigs learn problem-solving games faster than dogs and as quickly as chimps, and will remember the lessons for three years or more.) Orwell, of course, knew that. Winston Churchill, a serious pig fancier, saw it too. &quot;I like pigs,&quot; he said. &quot;Dogs look up to you; cats look down on you; pigs treat you as equal.&quot; A shame, then, that we treat pigs the way we do. Britons ate 1.6m tonnes of pork in 2007. We&apos;re so fond of the meat that we now import more than 60%, including 40% of all fresh and frozen pork and an astonishing 80% of all bacon. In fact, our pig meat imports - mainly from Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany - have been soaring for nearly a decade; the Netherlands, and those sheds, account for almost half our bacon imports. Demand for UK pork, meanwhile, has slumped 36%.  There is one very good reason for this, say British farmers. It is that in 1999, we introduced standards on pig welfare - regarding the space in which they are reared - that have yet to come into force across the rest of the EU. They have made our pork a great deal more expensive.  &quot;To rear our pigs the way we do,&quot; says Vicky Scott, who with her sister and father, Kate and David Morgan, wean more than 500 piglets a week on their 1,000-sow intensive farm near Driffield in Yorkshire, &quot;costs us about 12p a kilo extra. Will that be reflected in the price we get for it? What do you think?&quot; Some Dutch and Danish producers do rear pigs for the UK market to UK rules. But according to the British Pig Executive, an alarming 70% of the 970,000 tonnes of pig meat we import each year does not meet British welfare standards. What&apos;s more, you are probably buying it without knowing it: retailers are perfectly entitled to label foreign meat British if it has been processed here. The pigs from which much of that foreign meat comes will have led very different lives to many of those reared in Britain. Here, for example - and in Sweden, Switzerland and Norway - the use of a particularly nasty piece of kit called a sow stall has now been outlawed; it is legal in the rest of the EU until 2013. A sow stall is a narrow metal cage, on a bare concrete and slatted floor, in which pregnant sows spend all three months, three weeks and three days of their gestation. They can move a few inches back and forwards, but not turn around. Lying down and getting up is difficult, too.  &quot;It prevents almost all their natural activities,&quot; says Phil Brooke, welfare development manager for Compassion in World Farming (CIWF). &quot;They can&apos;t forage, they can&apos;t root around, they can&apos;t prepare a nest for their young. They&apos;re subject to bone and muscle weakness, digestive and urinary illnesses, cardiovascular problems. Many display signs of severe psychological problems, stress and frustration.&quot;  In much of mainland Europe, too, and on a by no means negligible percentage of British farms, naturally boisterous and playful fattening pigs also spend their days and nights on bare concrete and slatted floors; their faeces and urine fall through and are flushed away. In theory, EU regulations require plentiful &quot;environmental enrichment&quot; - straw, in other words - for bedding and rooting, but an undercover report by CIWF last month showed that 100% of farms surveyed in Spain, 89% in Germany and 88% in the Netherlands provided none. Such rules are, it seems, not very easy to enforce when animal welfare is weighed against export earnings. If they&apos;re lucky, the animals may get a chain or a plastic football to play with. But since there is rarely enough light to see by (pigs are quieter in the dark), fighting and biting are more common than playing. To minimise the effects of this, the vast majority of piglets&apos; tails are routinely docked soon after birth, and their teeth clipped, again in breach of EU rules.  Routine tail-docking in particular, Brooke and Baaij both argue, is a good general indication of pig welfare: pigs reared on extensive farms, outdoors, with plenty of scope for foraging and rooting, rarely need their tails docked. &quot;If they&apos;ve got plenty to do, they&apos;re happy,&quot; says Baaij. Otherwise, basically, they go for each other, with tails and ears the favoured targets. And once a pen full of pigs gets the scent of blood, the consequences can be catastrophic; pigs are, after all, omnivores.  In much of Europe too, male piglets are routinely castrated. That&apos;s because the powerful flavour of male pig meat - boar taint - is distasteful to many consumers. The operation is performed without pain relief, although the Dutch plan to adopt a gas anaesthetic, voluntarily, later this year. (British pigs are not castrated because they are slaughtered younger, before the taint develops.) &quot;Across Europe, we found examples of poor welfare and excessive use of confinement systems and mutilations in lieu of good welfare practice,&quot; the CIWF report concluded, lamenting the effects of &quot;an industrial system on a highly sentient, intelligent&quot; animal. &quot;Pigs looked uncared for, they showed aggressive behaviour and there was nothing for them to do. Across Europe, pig legislation is being ignored and welfare conditions are often appalling.&quot; So is that what it&apos;s like, then, in those Dutch pig farms? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it isn&apos;t all that easy to find out. The big farms at least seem distinctly wary of allowing a journalist access. Any number of Dutch welfare groups, including the highly vocal Varkens in Nood, backed by an array of Dutch writers and artists, are now on their case. CIWF has accused them, along with most other continental pig farmers, of routinely breaking EU laws. This month they might also have to face up to Jamie Oliver, in a TV special aiming to do for intensively reared pigs what the TV chef did last year for battery chickens. At the pristine and gargantuan Houbensteyn Group in Ysselsteyn, home to a barely imaginable 25,000 pigs, a manager tells me bluntly that they can&apos;t let me in as they have too much work on in the run-up to Christmas. Another factory farm near Helmond cites stringent hygiene laws that mean no one can so much as poke a nose round the door without taking their outdoor clothes off, donning disinfected boots and laundered boiler suit, even taking a shower.  Introduced after a catastrophic outbreak of swine fever in 1997 that saw 10m Dutch pigs slaughtered, they&apos;re a useful deterrent for the curious visitor. &quot;Too much of a bloody performance,&quot; says Jaap, the chief stockman. &quot;What do you want to see, anyway? Look, everything here&apos;s spotless. You can&apos;t even smell this place from the outside. We put in a new air filtration system last year.&quot;  Smaller farms prove more open. A few have even installed neat little viewing windows so visitors can gaze into a couple of presumably carefully selected pens - Step in the Shed, the scheme is called, and it&apos;s very popular with Dutch primary schools.  John Rooijakkers, who runs a farm of 750 breeding sows with his brother Martin at Aarle-Rixtel, near Eindhoven, will not tolerate British farmers&apos; accusations of unfair competition. &quot;I&apos;m losing money,&quot; he says. &quot;Most Dutch pig farmers are. Only the most efficient 20-30% are making any. The European pig market is cut-throat, and it&apos;s swings and roundabouts - you may have tougher welfare regulations, but we have far more stringent environment and hygiene laws. Holland is much smaller, much more densely populated than Britain. Don&apos;t talk to me about regulations.&quot; Rooijakkers is unusual in the Netherlands in keeping some of his pregnant sows on a mountain of straw, because a portion of his pigs are destined for &quot;a big British supermarket&quot; which he declines to name. For the same reason, some of his male piglets are not castrated. (He does, though, dock their tails: &quot;Show me a single intensive pig farmer who doesn&apos;t.&quot;) Elsewhere, tiny piglets - Rooijakkers says proudly that he averages 15 in a litter, where a free-range sow will typically deliver 10 or 12 - scrabble around their mothers on a blue plastic grate. The sows are locked into farrowing crates, similar but slightly bigger than sow stalls and used by many intensive pig farms in Britain too. The sows find it just as difficult to move in them, but they protect the baby pigs from being crushed. &quot;I have a 0.2% mortality rate,&quot; boasts Rooijakkers. &quot;On organic farms they&apos;re lucky to get away with 16%. Where&apos;s the animal welfare there, then, when you&apos;re talking dead piglets? Anyway, you have to be realistic: today&apos;s pigs would all be sick within a week if you started raising them outside. They couldn&apos;t take it. All those germs.&quot;  But next door to the farrowing crates, weaned piglets squal and leap viciously at each other in a bare concrete pen, a punctured yellow ball their only distraction. When you open the door to the small viewing room Rooijakkers has installed, they&apos;re suddenly bathed in fluorescent light. Hang around for a while, and the light goes off: it&apos;s there for the visitors. Unless you&apos;re looking at them, the pigs live in near-total darkness. Upstairs in his office, Rooijakkers blames the system. &quot;We&apos;re supplying what the market wants,&quot; he insists. &quot;And where are we, the farmers, in the chain? The retailers tell the slaughterhouses what they&apos;ll pay, the slaughterhouses set their prices for us. Everyone takes their margin, and right at the bottom it&apos;s the farmer. People, consumers, just aren&apos;t being realistic; they want cheap meat, then they&apos;re worried about welfare. Buy organic, then! Pay twice the price. But no one will do that.&quot; A few miles down the road in Panningen, Lowie and Jeanette Kersten are similarly blunt. Their farm, Op den Haegh, is small: around 300 sows. Through their viewing windows, you can see pregnant sows lumbering around a barren concrete pen. They are fed automatically. It&apos;s an ingenious system. When each pig sticks her head round the feeder door, a computer reads an electronic chip clipped in her ear and calculates whether or not she she has had her daily fill. If she has, the door stays shut; if she hasn&apos;t, she&apos;s allowed in.  Next door are sows and piglets in spotless but desolate crates. Signs explain that the climate is computer controlled, and make much of how modern pig-farming is doing all it can to minimise the risk of disease, and reduce its impact on the environment. Weaned pigs are on stark concrete and slats; a chain swings from the ceiling and a piglet makes a desultory grab. And there is a whole long side of this big shed whose darkened windows you simply cannot see through; inside is a pale pink mass of occasionally writhing forms. And the occasional furious squeal.  The Kerstens are a charming, and plainly thoughtful, couple in their 50s. They invite me into their immaculate farmhouse kitchen for coffee. &quot;It&apos;s all a compromise,&quot; says Lowie. &quot;Everyone would like to see better conditions for pigs, but change demands time, good laws, an effort from everyone in the chain and responsibility, from the producer, the retailer, the consumer and the politician. The cold fact is that better welfare means more expensive meat. We&apos;d love to produce it; are people ready to buy it?&quot; In fact Lowie already does produce some more expensive meat. Half of his piglets are of a different race to the others. They are taken off the farm and raised, in the open air and with special feed, on the grounds of a monastery, under a new label he has developed with colleagues. &quot;The meat from my monastery pigs is tastier, with good fat - supermarkets don&apos;t want fat, they want pure lean, and modern pigs are bred to deliver that,&quot; he says. &quot;But good restaurants want flavour, and they want meat with a story. Something distinctive.&quot; Wouldn&apos;t he like to raise all his pigs that way? &quot;Look,&quot; says Jeanette firmly, gesturing at the shed behind her. &quot;We&apos;re producers. We do this to earn money. That&apos;s what I tell the schoolkids who come here. There&apos;s been a whole lot of research to see if we could produce the amount of meat we need any other way ... We&apos;re very professional. And pigs aren&apos;t people.&quot; On the whole, if you&apos;re concerned about pig welfare, you generally are better off buying British (assuming, of course, you can be sure it actually was reared in Britain). Things are not perfect here, but they are quite a lot better: CIWF&apos;s undercover inspectors found only 36% of British farms they visited did not use straw, although 54% still carried out routine tail docking. But Vicky Scott and Kate Morgan&apos;s farm in Yorkshire feels a world removed from those stifling Dutch sheds. Their pigs are reared on straw, in huge, open-sided sheds that let in all the daylight and - on another chill winter morning - the fresh air you could want.  Scott uses farrowing crates for birthing, although she prefers the term maternity units. &quot;It may look like factory farming,&quot; she says, &quot;and it&apos;s not very nice to see, but I really believe no better system&apos;s been invented.&quot; She docks her animals&apos; tails (&quot;We&apos;re planning on doing a trial without it, but if they start tailbiting, really, it&apos;s horrendous&quot;) and clips their teeth (&quot;We&apos;ve tried not doing it, but they make such a mess of their pen mates. Pigs&apos; teeth are incredibly sharp.&quot;) Both operations are done when the piglets are a day old. But the most important thing, for her, is the straw.  &quot;I would never, ever finish [fatten] pigs on slats,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve always said that. You only have to look at them. They need it, it&apos;s the way they&apos;re made. It&apos;s inconceivable to deny them it.&quot; And the family&apos;s pigs do, indeed, look pretty damn happy. But there&apos;s precious little encouragement from the market to do things that way, or to refund the extra pence per kilo of pork that the straw - and the extra labour to muck it out and replace it - costs them.  The business is tough enough as it is: when animal feed prices went through the roof last summer, Morgan and farmers like her were losing \u00a326 on every pig they sold. &quot;The retailers always say the customer likes the cheapest,&quot; she says. &quot;We say we think the customer would actually like the choice. But the bottom line is, if people don&apos;t want to pay for higher welfare, farmers will stop doing it.&quot;  The best conditions, of course, are free-range, although there is a lot of confusion about what that means. Some 40% of breeding sows in Britain are kept outdoors, compared to fewer than 1% in the Netherlands; but only 7% of the piglets born to them are reared outdoors after they&apos;re weaned and only 2% are fattened, or finished, outdoors. &quot;Outdoor bred&quot; is not the same as &quot;outdoor reared&quot;. The best guarantee of all is organic, but that comes at a considerable cost.  On a magnificent high field bordered by the Ridgeway near the Wiltshire village of Bishopstone, Helen Browning keeps her 250 saddleback sows producing some 65 piglets a week, about 3,500 a year. The pigs sleep in spacious, clean, straw-filled arks and have free access to the open field around them. Eastbrook farm is a mixed farm and the pigs are integrated into the agricultural cycle; they&apos;ll spend a couple of months trashing - and very effectively fertilising - a patch of land and then move on, to be replaced by grass or an arable crop for a few years. Unlike high-intensity systems, in which pigs are removed from their mothers at three weeks or even earlier, Browning&apos;s piglets are weaned at a more natural eight weeks. &quot;They&apos;re stronger, maturer, they don&apos;t need antibiotics,&quot; she says. Farrowing crates and the like, Browning believes, have bred the maternal instincts out of most modern sows. And the never-ending, retailer-led search for ever-leaner meat means they simply don&apos;t have enough fat on them to nurse their litters for long anyway. Browning&apos;s pigs are kept in the same family group, and they have an awful lot of room to create an unholy mess of their field. The day I was there, wading through the mud, they were positively gambolling: racing round the field, playing (there&apos;s no other word) games. In 20 years of raising pigs, Eastbrook farm has not experienced a single case of tail biting.  &quot;Pigs are clever animals, curious animals, they&apos;re clean animals, they tell you about their problems,&quot; Browning says. &quot;They&apos;re not like cows, they&apos;re not stoics, they vocalise. They wear their hearts on their sleeves. And they&apos;re funny. They have pretty simple needs, really: space, lots to do.&quot; But all this comes at a price. Tim Finney, managing director of Eastbrook&apos;s organic meats business, reckons that amounts to an extra 30 or 40p a kilo just to keep the system running, plus another 70p a kilo for the organic feed. &quot;Overall,&quot; he says, &quot;it probably costs us about double what it costs to produce a conventional pig. Although if we weren&apos;t organic, we could run the farm the same way and produce meat that was maybe 25% more expensive. That would still be a huge step forwards in welfare terms.&quot; High-welfare organic meat is of course a niche market, recession-sensitive, and Finney admits he&apos;s is budgeting for zero growth for the coming year. But the alarming thing is that today, even moderately good welfare standards are coming under pressure. When it comes to pig welfare Britain is, Browning reckons, &quot;genuinely squeaky clean&quot; compared to much of the rest of the world; &quot;probably the best in the world, in fact, for conventional pig-keeping&quot;. But what counts, it seems, is price. Some years ago, the late Lyall Watson, who devoted his last book to The Extraordinary Potential of Pigs, wrote that if you look properly behind the eyes of any pig, you will see &quot;a liveliness, an intelligence for which you are just not prepared&quot;. These are not like other animals. If it matters to us that our morning rasher or chop or pork pie does not comes from a genetically engineered fat-free pig that spent its brief life in a dark, bare, windowless shed stuffed full of antibiotics and reduced to attacking its pen-mates for entertainment - a pathetic parody, in short, of a pig - we&apos;re going to have to reach deeper into our pockets. Right now, that seems increasingly unlikely.

Mopping up after the botched launch of Heathrow Terminal 5 included fielding accusations of poor performance from British Airways and enduring a public haranguing from MPs. A self-confessed obsessive about &quot;operational stuff&quot;, the head of Britain&apos;s largest airport operator believes that the group can fend off hordes of critics if it does a better job running its main asset. &quot;If you don&apos;t have Heathrow working well your legs are chopped off at the knees in any argument you make,&quot; he says.  Environmental campaigners, politicians and thousands of local residents are hacking away at BAA and Gordon Brown over plans to expand Britain&apos;s biggest airport. The government could announce as soon as next week that it approves the construction of a third runway, accompanied by a relaxation of flight restrictions that will see more planes using the existing runways. It will unleash a backlash that will dwarf the fury over security queues, poor service and T5 that has dogged BAA since 2006. The parochial issue of improving Britain&apos;s derided international airport will collide with the global fight against climate change. Matthews, the man in the middle, discusses the emotive topic in the same direct and pragmatic manner that persuaded BAA to hire him last year to tackle irate customers and dodgy infrastructure. It is a temperament that will be tested by public and political anger over Heathrow. This time, BAA will not be confronted by airport users but a broad constituency of communities, green groups and MPs. &quot;How can anyone take pleasure in stirring up people&apos;s lives and making them move if they don&apos;t wish to move or have noise that they don&apos;t want to have? Personally, and I hope as a company generally, we are hugely sympathetic to that.&quot;  It could be read as an apology for what he hopes will be the go-ahead for a project that by 2020 would demolish 700 homes, expose 20 schools to high noise pollution and increase the annual total of flights from 480,000 to 702,000.  Staff at BAA&apos;s modest Heathrow headquarters are preparing for a decade of attrition if the government says it will back a planning application. An attempt to draw Matthews on the difficulty of reconciling economic growth with environmentally responsible policies also reveals a sensitivity over the issue of whether, in the case of Heathrow, the government is choosing financial imperatives over environmental care. &quot;You are making a false distinction, as if profits are for someone else. They fuel pension plans and provide jobs.&quot; Thin line Opponents of the runway, including senior government figures, argue that the environment should be at the fore, ahead of economic benefits. After all, Britain is committed to an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and Heathrow&apos;s expansion will push noise and air pollution standards to their limit. Matthews, treading that thin line between economic gain and environmental loss, argues that there is no point scrapping runway plans in order to meet CO2 targets if planes that would have landed or taken off from Heathrow&apos;s third runway go to Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol or Frankfurt instead. &quot;It is possible that London will be at the end of a branch line. It is possible that, in order to get to most of the world&apos;s long-haul destinations you will have to go through Paris or Schiphol. That&apos;s transferring carbon dioxide from one place to another. It imposes net damage on the UK economy and it&apos;s not a net gain for the environment.&quot;  This argument antagonises environmental campaigners, who state that CO2 reductions should be a global priority and should be backed by a moratorium on all runway construction. It also undermines the government&apos;s aim to be a leader in the global response to climate change, say opponents. The response to a question about the impact on local residents also draws a tacit admission from Matthews that the environment and the economy are awkward bedfellows.  &quot;You can have both [limited environmental impact and economic gain] and you need to have both,&quot; he says, adding that carbon trading will help mitigate Heathrow&apos;s environmental impacts. &quot;But I am not suggesting that this is an easy decision. The environment debate has various dimensions. There are climate-change dimensions and there is the impact on local communities. Local communities benefit from the jobs but don&apos;t enjoy the noise. You cannot close Heathrow in order to prevent planes flying over west London and not think about the jobs impact.&quot;  Matthews, who gained a reputation as safe pair of hands as chief executive of services group Hays and utility firm Severn Trent, is not a likely candidate for prophet of doom. However, it is an important mantle for anyone backing a third runway. Without expansion, says BAA, Heathrow will wither away and become a minor airport serving far fewer destinations than its rivals.  Heathrow is a hub airport, which means many passengers fly into it in order to take a connecting flight elsewhere, choosing from around 180 destinations. Its owner believes that without expansion the delays caused by its two congested runways will drive those passengers to other airports that offer connections to the same destinations without the &quot;Heathrow hassle&quot;.  Connectedness As a consequence, routes such as Heathrow to Bangalore and Shanghai will be rendered unprofitable and dropped, forcing passengers and airlines to look elsewhere. If that happens, says Matthews, multinational businesses will quit the UK and jobs will follow. &quot;If you are a financial services company and your headquarters is in Canary Wharf, you normally ask where your main base should be every five years. One of the issues you consider is your connectedness to the global markets you serve. Right at the top of business travellers&apos; concerns is the availability of direct flights and frequency. Heathrow provides that with its network.&quot;  So why not lift the landing fee caps on Heathrow in order to reflect its premium to business passengers? It would mean higher ticket prices as steeper fees are passed on, but business passengers are relatively immune to price changes and it would have the added benefit of freeing up much needed space by pricing out some of the leisure flights that help gum up the airport. That way, Heathrow stays a two-runway operation with the economy remaining unscathed.  Well versed in these arguments by now, Matthews points out that business passengers are not in a majority and that you need leisure passengers, supplemented by people on family visits, to keep long-haul routes viable.  Perhaps the anti-runway lobby should hire Christopher Clarke of the Competition Commission. Towards the end of the interview Matthews admits in effect that he cannot win over the chair of the commission investigation into BAA, who is likely to recommend that Stansted, Gatwick and Edinburgh airports are sold against BAA&apos;s wishes, leaving it with four airports including Heathrow.  Matthews says: &quot;There are some real issues where we disagree but I have to be realistic. We might not succeed in winning those arguments. It is one thing to have a technical argument with the commission but there is also the weight of public opinion that we are fighting.&quot;  If the government approves a third runway this month, that battle against public wrath will enter a new phase.

Ideally it should be gracious, well mannered and welcoming. It should offer something of the culture of its home country while nodding appreciatively to that of its host. It need not be old-fashioned, but nor should it attempt to be &quot;cool&quot;. Passing fads are just that. What embassy architecture really shouldn&apos;t be, is like the new US embassy in Baghdad. Opened this week, this monster of a modern fortress designed by Berger Devine Yaeger , has been described by at least one US commentator as the &quot;imperial mother ship dropping into Baghdad.&quot; It could, I suppose, be seen as a latter-day, Wild East-version of a 7th Cavalry fort, with the Iraqis playing the role of Native Americans. Whatever it might be in our imaginations, it spells &quot;undiplomatic&quot; in the kind of rough and ready capital letters found stencilled on to the side of tanks, armoured cars and military trucks. And given that this vast compound \u2013 10 times bigger than the UN complex in Manhattan and comprising over 20 buildings \u2013 has been built for the most part by humbly-paid &quot;guest&quot; workers from Bangladesh, the Philippines and elsewhere, it looks and feels like the work of a regime battling for first place with the galactic empire itself. The Baghdad embassy is a very long way indeed, in time, space and political culture from the US embassies of the 1950s and 60s. Designed at the height of the cold war, these were nevertheless fine, civilised buildings by modern architects. Walter Gropius, founding director of the Bauhaus school of architecture, designed the US embassy all light and grace in Athens; Richard Neutra, best known for his glamorous modern houses on the Californian coast, was responsible for the US consulate in Karachi ;Eero Saarinen, of JFK airport&apos;s TWA-terminal fame, shaped the controversial and soon-to-be-replaced US embassy in London; while John Johansen designed the dramatic US embassy in Dublin. The east African embassy bombings of 1998 and the infamous events of September 11 encouraged the US to rebuild its embassies and consulates as castles. While other countries have had to think hard, too, about terrorism, there have been alternatives to the 21st-century 7th Cavalry look. Take the new British embassy in Sana&apos;a, by Design Engine Architects. Set in the Yemeni highlands against the stunning backdrop of the Jebel Nuqum and Jebel Aiban mountains, it is a brave attempt to shape a building that is secure, good to look at and that, while clearly of our times, nods intelligently to local design traditions and the powerful, mud-coloured landscape it hunkers down on. This thoughtful British building is, however, quietly upstaged by the particularly fine Royal Netherlands embassy in Addis Ababa. Designed by Dick van Gameren and Bjarne Mastenbroek, it has been dug into the earth like the famous Ethiopian rock churches at Lalibela. Its rough-hewn, reddish concrete walls are at once part-and-parcel of the landscape and powerful modern architecture in their own right. The roof, modelled on an abstraction of the Dutch polder landscape, has watercourses helping to keep the building cool while delighting the wandering eye. Here is a building designed to be secure and yet as far in terms of character from the new US embassy in Baghdad as Addis Ababa itself is from Amsterdam. Many of the best new embassy buildings fit into their host cities happily while offering something a little different to local design. Two contrasting examples from the 1970s show how this has been done. Arne Jacobsen&apos;s Royal Danish embassy in London&apos;s Sloane Street [1977] is a highly popular design if the capital&apos;s annual Open House weekend is anything to go by.Here is a showcase of some of the best of late 20th-century Danish design and an institution that, as yet, feels no need to abandon central London in favour of a fortified campus in the suburbs (as the new US embassy in London will be when complete somewhere between 2012 and 2016). Basil Spence&apos;s British embassy in Rome, is a second example of how to build in a slightly exotic - yet diplomatic - fashion in a great foreign city. As the debonair Spence told the Daily Mail, &quot;I have as a neighbour on this site, a building by Michelangelo, setting an embarrassingly high standard for any architect to meet.&quot; The embassy, is a thing of well-crafted travertine, oak and yellow marble, raised on &quot;piloti&quot; [modern concrete columns]. With its rooms and corridors shaded from the Roman sun, it remains a powerful yet sensitive work by an underrated British architect. Perhaps, though, the most intriguing embassies of all are those shoehorned into existing buildings. Who today would ever guess that the Nazi German embassy in London was housed at 8-9 Carlton House Terrace, an elegant building by John Nash, today home to the Royal Society? Ultimately, though, as both the German experience in the 1940s and British-American involvement in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East prove, foreign policy and intelligent diplomacy count, in the long term, for more than guns. The world is unlikely to be one, in which people of all classes, creeds, colours and gun calibres dance to music at charming embassy balls .

In wellingtons and hard hat last week, he was touring his city&apos;s main railway station, an icy, muddy work site, on a fact-finding tour. But Ahmed Aboutaleb is no ordinary mayor. As the first immigrant mayor in the Netherlands, he is unique. He has taken charge of Rotterdam, Europe&apos;s biggest port and a multiracial melting pot. By 2020 more than half the 600,000 people of this city are predicted to be of immigrant origin. Rotterdam is also the place that gave Holland Pim Fortuyn, the maverick libertarian, poodle-loving populist politician accused of Islamophobia by critics and murdered by an animal rights activist seven years ago. Fortuyn&apos;s legacy is a right-wing party with fierce rhetoric about immigrants that still wins a third of votes. No one doubts the high stakes Aboutaleb is playing for, or the high expectations that his unprecedented appointment has engendered: inevitably he has already been dubbed &quot;Obama on the Maas [river]&quot; by one columnist. Born the son of a Moroccan prayer-leader, Aboutaleb arrived in Holland aged 15. Now 47, he told the Observer in his first interview as mayor that he hoped to be judged on results, not his &quot;origins or colour&quot;.  He said: &quot;My job is to build bridges and Rotterdam is a good place to do that. This is the city of big projects where the sky is the limit, but also a city with high levels of poverty. My job is to be mayor for everyone from the businessmen to the kid from Surinam just trying to earn a living.&quot; He has few illusions: &quot;There are many who expect me to fail.&quot; Geert Wilders, a right-wing politician with a history of provocation, has said he should be &quot;mayor of Rabat&quot;, the capital of Morocco. &quot;If I can succeed, I will be a key element in persuading immigrant communities that they can have access to power; if I fail, it will have huge consequences for those coming behind me afterwards,&quot; the mayor said.  Aboutaleb&apos;s emergence is a clear landmark in the recent improvement in community and race relations in Holland since the tense days after the murder of Fortuyn and the killing of controversial film-maker Theo van Gogh by a Muslim militant in 2004. But the new mayor is far from being a classic Dutch liberal. His message to immigrants is &quot;stop seeing yourself as victims, and if you don&apos;t want to integrate, leave&quot;. &quot;This is not about ethnicity or religion,&quot; said Dominic Schrijer, councillor for social affairs and labour in the city, &quot;it is about poverty and how to break out of poverty. For the good of everyone, immigrants need to know what is acceptable and what is not and we all need to make an effort. We are not going back to the 1950s, but in the 70s and 80s things went too far.&quot; The recent political history of Rotterdam has been turbulent. In 2002, decades of unbroken rule by the Dutch Labour party were broken when the party of Fortuyn, who called Islam a &quot;backward culture&quot; and a &quot;hostile&quot; religion, won in a landslide at local elections campaigning on a strong law and order and anti-immigration platform. His subsequent murder - like that of van Gogh - provoked a spasm of angst-ridden self-questioning in Holland. Fortuyn&apos;s party, Leefbar (Livable) Rotterdam, lost power in 2006 but still has 14 of the 45 city council seats. The current leader of Leefbar Rotterdam, Ronald Sorensen, said the party opposed Aboutaleb, who served his political apprenticeship in Amsterdam. &quot;There are whole areas of this city that have been overrun by foreigners. All the Dutch people who live in this city who have seen the city changing in a bad way... having a Moroccan-born mayor makes them feel totally overrun,&quot; the former teacher said, stressing that the mayor held dual Moroccan-Dutch nationality and that raised issues, given his responsibility for security and policing. Sorensen admitted support for Aboutaleb&apos;s tough line on integration of immigrants. &quot;If we said what he says, they&apos;d call us racists,&quot; he said. In fact, recent statistics are relatively positive. Professor Jan Latten at the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics said that, though they still lagged behind, second-generation immigrants in Holland are achieving better educational results and better jobs than before. Equally, more are speaking Dutch, watching Dutch television and &quot;feeling an emotional attachment to Holland&quot;.  The process is long, however. According to Edwin Huizing, director of the Dutch Refugee Council, &quot;it is only over generations that this will change&quot;.  Mohammed Bibi, director of the Rotterdam Immigrants&apos; Association, hopes for &quot;a beautiful multicultural society in Rotterdam where there is room for everyone regardless of colour, ethnicity and sexual orientation&quot;. In the De Grootsle Slok bar by the docks of Rotterdam&apos;s Delfthaven area, Peta van de Burg serves foaming pints of beer to an eclectic clientele. &quot;We have 60 nations drinking here from everywhere in the world, and we have two rules: no national songs and no discussion about politics or religion,&quot; she said. &quot;After all, we have English, Scots, Irish and Welsh all coming here.

Is April a good time to go? We were thinking of staying on Sicily and getting the hydrofoil out one afternoon and returning the following morning. We would also be interested in hearing of any agencies that cover self-catering accommodation in the Taormina area of Sicily.Ieuan Jones, Harpenden A April is a good time to climb steaming Stromboli volcano. It&apos;s right at the start of the season and not as warm as other times of year so take some warm gear. Organised treks run when there are enough people to justify it, so book in advance with an agency such as Magmatrek (magmatrek.it). Five-hour afternoon and evening treks leave at 4pm and cost \u20ac25. It is feasible to spend the night on the island and return in the morning, but you will need to sleep in town. Ferries to Stromboli from Milazzo in Sicily run year-round, though less frequently in April than summer. Siremar (siremar.it) runs fast boats which take less than an hour, or five-hour services.

Q My son used his credit card on holiday in Australia, but when he tried to use it a second time he discovered that it was blocked. After spending 20 minutes on his mobile phone to his UK bank, he was informed that the card had been blocked because someone in Australia was trying to withdraw cash. I encountered a similar problem when I used my credit card online in England to book a ticket to the UK from Israel. My card was blocked the next time I tried to use it, even though I hadn&apos;t left the country! Is there a new requirement that we have to notify our credit-card providers every time we travel abroad?Kay Bagon, Radlett A The unexpected blocking of bank cards is rising quickly to the top of travellers&apos; lists of pet hates. It is a side-effect of attempting to stop card fraud. Automatic fraud detection systems are looking for unusual spending patterns, especially overseas purchases on credit or debit cards or large cash withdrawals from foreign ATMs. Unless there&apos;s a note on the system that you are away, accounts can be blocked.  Increasingly banks, such as the Co-Operative and HSBC, request that you call them in advance to tell them you&apos;ll be abroad. Even if there&apos;s no stated requirement to notify your bank, doing so is a good idea, especially if you&apos;re not a frequent traveller or don&apos;t use your cards very often. When you do so, provide contact details abroad if you have them - having a mobile phone switched on for the first few days of any trip is a good idea. Also make sure you have your bank&apos;s contact numbers with you. Unblocking your card will generally involve a phone call to your bank from overseas. Banks will not compensate you for these calls as they argue they are part of the security process. However, the block should be removed promptly. The Financial Ombudsman has upheld a complaint and ordered compensation against a bank for not doing this.  Two other suggestions on the subject of cards: make sure you know the answers to your security questions in case you need to answer them while away; and make sure you are not reliant on one source of funds while travelling.  Q I am saving up to take my husband on a special holiday for his 50th birthday. I have two years to save for this but I don&apos;t earn much so I need to plan well in advance. My husband is part-Swedish and has always wanted to visit Sweden. As he does not like travelling itself, I would like to make that part as easy as possible. He does not like big airports so I&apos;d like to fly from Cardiff. I have looked at some Swedish specialist packages but they seem very expensive and not very flexible. I would like to go for a week, spending most of the time in Stockholm but visiting a country area for a couple of days to see the scenery and to ride in a horse- or reindeer-drawn sleigh. His birthday is in January so I assume it will be cold and snowy. I am planning to spend about \u00a33,000 for two of us for a week. Is this feasible or do I need to save harder? Alison Williams, by email A Experts in tailor-made Nordic travel Simply Sweden (0845 890 0300; simplysweden.co.uk) came up with a few options. One that ticks all your boxes is a seven-night break, including three nights at the three-star Columbus Hotel on the fashionable island of Sodermalm in Stockholm and four nights at the Fryksas Hotel, about 300km (190 miles) north of Stockholm in beautiful remote countryside. Husky-sledding and snowmobiling are available, as well as gourmet food. This tour costs \u00a31,100 each including car hire, but activities are extra. Alternatively, after Stockholm you can fly to Kiruna in Lapland, stay in a cabin, enjoy winter sports and try to spot the northern lights for about \u00a31,245. You could fly from Cardiff with KLM but that would involve changing planes in Amsterdam, Europe&apos;s fifth largest airport. This may or may not be preferable to making your way to Heathrow.

Barbara Cummins, Lewes A Motorhome swaps work well in theory, but owners of Australian campers are likely to want to borrow yours during our summertime, which is probably when you want to use it. Also, the well developed motorhome rental market there means swaps are uncommon. Like any holiday swap you should find out as much as possible in advance about the condition of the motorhome and work out insurance and other paperwork well in advance.

The occasion was Bruce Chatwin&apos;s memorial service, and it was attended by a large contingent of what was and remains an exceptional generation of British or British-based writers. Among them were Martin Amis, Paul Theroux and Salman Rushdie. According to Theroux, Chatwin&apos;s funeral &quot;was the high watermark of that decade&apos;s creative activity&quot;. For Amis, Chatwin, a recent convert to Greek Orthodoxy, had played a last joke on his friends by subjecting them to &quot;a religion that no one he knew could understand or respond to&quot;. If so, it was a joke destined to be overshadowed by a very different kind of theological offering that was far more of a challenge to understand or respond to. That same morning Rushdie had been informed of the fatwa issued by the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, calling for his execution for the crime of writing a novel, The Satanic Verses. Word of the death sentence had spread among the mourners. Thinking the fatwa was little more than the empty threat of a faraway tyrant, Theroux called out to Rushdie: &quot;Next week we&apos;ll be back here for you!&quot; But Khomeini&apos;s pronouncements in such matters were seldom without consequence. As far back as 1947, when merely a cleric, he had ordered the death of an Iranian education minister who within days was shot dead. And thereafter countless other political and intellectual opponents were to lose their lives on Khomeini&apos;s command. Chatwin&apos;s memorial service was to be Rushdie&apos;s last public appearance for some time. He spent the remainder of that day searching for his son, Zafar, then he went into hiding. The headline of the London evening paper read: EXECUTE RUSHDIE, ORDERS THE AYATOLLAH. &quot;Salman had disappeared into the world of block caps,&quot; wrote Amis. &quot;He had vanished into the front page.&quot; In fact he had moved with a Special Branch protection team to the Lygon Arms hotel in the Cotswolds. Apparently a tabloid reporter happened to be in the next room, conducting an adulterous affair, and missed the biggest story of the year. That same evening Channel 4 broadcast a pre-recorded interview with Rushdie on The Bandung File. &quot;It&apos;s very simple in this country,&quot; said the author, when asked about the demands that his book be withdrawn from shops. &quot;If you don&apos;t want to read a book, you don&apos;t have to read it. It&apos;s very hard to be offended by The Satanic Verses - it requires a long period of intense reading. It&apos;s a quarter of a million words.&quot;  Four days after Rushdie received his &quot;unfunny Valentine&quot;, he issued an apology: &quot;I profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam.&quot; At first the apology was rejected then accepted in Iran, before Khomeini stated that even if Rushdie repented and &quot;became the most pious man of all time&quot; it was still incumbent on every Muslim to &quot;employ everything he has got&quot; to kill him. So much for the spirit of forgiveness. What the mixed responses pointed to was that, right from the start, The Satanic Verses affair was less a theological dispute than an opportunity to exert political leverage. The background to the controversy was the struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran to be the standard bearer of global Islam. The Saudis had spent a great deal of money exporting the fundamentalist or Salafi version of Sunni Islam, while Shiite Iran, still smarting from a calamitous war and humiliating armistice with Iraq, was keen to reassert its credentials as the vanguard of the Islamic revolution. Both the Saudis and Iranians saw a new constituency, ripe for exploitation, in the small British protest groups that initially responded to The Satanic Verses with book-burning demonstrations. But in fact the protesters who took to the streets in Bradford and other mill towns were themselves the offspring of other far-off theocratic politics in the subcontinent.  The Satanic Verses was published on 26 September 1988 and, after pressure from the Janata party, banned in India by Rajiv Gandhi&apos;s government nine days later. Flushed with this success, Indians working for the Saudi-financed Islamic Foundation of Leicester suggested trying to get the book banned in Britain. According to Malise Ruthven, author of A Satanic Affair, the campaign was then orchestrated by Jamaat-i-Islami, the party founded in Pakistan by Sayyid Abul A&apos;la Maududi. A journalist-cum-theologian, Maududi preached that &quot;for the entire human race, there is only one way of life which is Right in the eyes of God and that is al-Islam&quot;. Nevertheless it was the Saudis who funded the United Kingdom Action Committee on Islamic Affairs, the protest body set up to maximise pressure on The Satanic Verses. It featured Islamists like Iqbal Sacranie, the future head of the Muslim Council of Britain. (Sacranie famously opined that &quot;death, perhaps, is a bit too easy&quot; for Rushdie. He was later knighted for services to community relations.) And it was the Saudi clerics who were planning a trial of Rushdie in absentia.  In keeping with most Muslim countries, Iran did not ban The Satanic Verses. It was even reviewed in an Iranian newspaper. But noticing the protests in India and Britain, a delegation of mullahs from the holy city of Qum read a section of the book to Khomeini, including the part featuring a mad imam in exile, which was an obvious caricature of Khomeini. As one British diplomat in Iran said: &quot;It was designed to send the old boy incandescent.&quot; So it was that the Iranians delivered the fatwa, thus winning the competition to be the greatest haters of Rushdie, and therefore the West, and all that entailed. As Khomeini put it in a speech nine days after the fatwa, The Satanic Verses was very important to what he called the &quot;world devourers&quot; because they had mobilised the &quot;entire Zionism and arrogance behind it&quot;. The book, he went on, was a &quot;calculated&quot; attack by &quot;colonialism&quot; on the greatness and honour of the clergy. It&apos;s worth noting here that the book, written by an arch anti-colonialist, was indeed in part an attack, or at least satire, on the role of the clergy, the caste of priests that has no Qur&apos;anic authority. In this newspaper, just before the fatwa, Rushdie had written: &quot;A powerful tribe of clerics has taken over Islam. These are the contemporary Thought Police.&quot; The next decade was a dangerous and isolating time for Rushdie. He was shadowed round-the-clock by bodyguards, and moved each time the security services became aware of one of the series of plots to kill him. Because there were British hostages held by Islamic extremists in Lebanon, Rushdie was advised by the authorities not to say or do anything that might antagonise their captors. Politicians remained at a safe public distance from him. Travel, once the driver of his imagination, had become a logistical and administrative nightmare. The subcontinent was ruled out. British Airways told him not to fly with them because it might endanger their staff. And when he did manage to go abroad, staying with friends was a cramped affair. As Christopher Hitchens, an old friend and staunch advocate, recently recalled of a Rushdie visit to Washington DC: &quot;When he was staying at my house back at Thanksgiving of 1993, so were about a dozen heavily armed members of the United States&apos;s finest anti-terrorist forces.&quot; In contemplating these sorts of details, it&apos;s hard to keep in mind that the person at the centre of them was just a writer. &quot;I said somewhere,&quot; he told me last year, &quot;that it was like a bad Salman Rushdie novel.&quot; The years following the fatwa were also a damaging and sometimes lethal period for many of those associated with The Satanic Verses, few of whom had any protection. In April 1989 Collets, the left-wing bookshop, and Dillons were firebombed for stocking the Rushdie novel. A month later there were explosions in High Wycombe and London&apos;s King&apos;s Road. There was a bomb in the Liberty department store which housed a Penguin Bookshop (Penguin was the publisher of The Satanic Verses) and at the York Penguin bookshop. Unexploded devices were also discovered at the Nottingham, Guildford and Peterborough branches of the store.  In August the same year Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh accidentally blew himself up in a Paddington hotel room while priming a bomb intended to kill Rushdie. Meanwhile Rushdie&apos;s marriage to the American author Marianne Wiggins did not long survive the pressures of life in hiding. Rushdie was at a low ebb and writing very little. Amis wrote: &quot;I often tell him that if the Rushdie Affair were, for instance, the Amis Affair, then I would, by now, be a tearful and tranquillised 300-pounder, with no eyelashes or nostril hairs, and covered in blotches and burns from various misadventures with the syringe and the crackpipe.&quot;  Rushdie sought another way out. On Christmas Eve 1990 he issued a statement bearing witness that &quot;there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his last prophet&quot;. Claiming to have renewed his faith in Islam, he said he did not agree with any character in The Satanic Verses who &quot;casts aspersions... upon the authenticity of the holy Qur&apos;an, or who rejects the divinity of Allah&quot;. He also said he would not release a paperback of the book. That evening he was so disgusted with himself that he was physically sick. The playwright Arnold Wesker, a Rushdie supporter, said: &quot;The religious terrorists have won.&quot; Hitchens recalls: &quot;I told Salman that it didn&apos;t make any difference to my support for him but that I didn&apos;t think it would &apos;work&apos; and that I didn&apos;t think it was dignified. I think he felt much better after he re-apostasised: it was a sort of Gethsemane - if you will forgive the expression - after which he was determined to see the whole thing through.&quot; Years later Rushdie would publicly say it was the biggest mistake of his life, a &quot;deranged&quot; moment when he had hit rock bottom. In the event, it made no difference. Though Khomeini was now dead, the Iranian clergy confirmed that Rushdie still had to be killed. The following year Hitoshi Igarashi, Rushdie&apos;s Japanese translator, was stabbed to death and Ettore Capriolo, the Italian translator, seriously injured in another knife attack. In 1993 William Nygaard, the publisher in Norway, was shot and injured, and Aziz Nesin, the Turkish translator, was the target of the Silvas massacre in Turkey that left 37 dead in an arson attack on a hotel. For years the novel was withdrawn from display in shops around the world but it still became a bestseller in several countries, including America, and was published, despite all the demands and threats, in paperback. Moreover, Rushdie has gone on to enjoy a successful career, writing seven more novels and several other books, and he has also attained a measure of normalised liberty since the Iranian government effectively withdrew its backing from the fatwa in 1998. To this extent, Khomeini&apos;s edict and the murderous campaign it engendered failed abysmally. But Rushdie and The Satanic Verses, it should be remembered, was not the only target of the fatwa. In his original statement, broadcast on Iranian radio, Khomeini not only called for the death of all those consciously associated with the book but also said they should be executed &quot;so that no one will dare to insult the Islamic sanctity&quot;. In this respect, and several others, Khomeini&apos;s terror has proved far more effective. Who would dare to write a book like The Satanic Verses nowadays? And if some brave or reckless author did dare, who would publish it? The signs in both cases are that no such writer or publisher is likely to appear, and for two reasons. The first and most obvious is fear. The Satanic Verses is a rich and complex literary novel, by turns ironic, fantastical and satirical. Despite what is often said, mostly by those who haven&apos;t read it, the book does not take direct aim at Islam or its prophet. Those sections that have caused the greatest controversy are contained within the dreams or nightmares of a character who is in the grip of psychosis. Which is to say that, even buried in the fevered subconscious of a disturbed character inside a work of fiction - a work of magical realism fiction! - there is no escape from literalist tyranny. Any sentence might turn out to be a death sentence. And few if any of even the boldest and most iconoclastic artists wish to run that risk. The recent case of The Jewel of Medina, a work by Sherry Jones which is neither bold nor iconoclastic, exemplifies the problem. In 2007 the American publishers Random House bought the rights to this historical novel about the prophet Muhammad&apos;s wife Aisha. By all accounts the book is something of a cheesy romance. Jones herself believes it is a circumspect fiction which &quot;portrays the prophet Muhammad as a gentle, compassionate, wise leader and man respectful toward women and his wives&quot;. But a professor of Middle Eastern studies named Denise Spellberg advised Random House that it might provoke violence. The publishers duly cancelled the publication.  &quot;We stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas, even those that may be construed as offensive by some,&quot; Random House explained in a statement. &quot;However, a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears, and in this instance we decided, after much deliberation, to postpone publication for the safety of the author, employees of Random House, booksellers and anyone who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel.&quot; This has become a familiar conceit in recent years: we defend the right of freedom of expression but prefer not to exercise it in situations that might endanger us. Random House publish Rushdie, and he was angered by what he saw as a capitulation to the threat of Islamic reprisals. &quot;This is censorship by fear, and it sets a very bad precedent indeed,&quot; he said. In Britain the book was taken up by the independent publisher, Gibson Square. But on 27 September last year the London home of Martin Rynja, Gibson Square&apos;s publisher, was firebombed. As things stand, the book&apos;s British publication is indefinitely postponed. Nor is this self-censorship restricted to literature. Ramin Gray, associate director of the Royal Court Theatre, recently admitted that he would be reluctant to stage a play that was critical of Islam. &quot;You would think twice,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;d have to take the play on its merits but given the time we&apos;re in, it&apos;s very hard because you&apos;d worry that if you cause offence then the whole enterprise would become buried in a sea of controversy. It does make you tread carefully.&quot; The Royal Court cancelled a new version of Aristophanes&apos;s Lysistrata last year because the play is set in Muslim paradise. The Barbican cut out sections of Tamburlaine the Great for similar reasons, and in 2006 Berlin&apos;s Deutsche Oper dropped a production of Mozart&apos;s Idomeneo because it depicted Muhammad. In 2005 Tate Britain removed God is Great, John Latham&apos;s sculpture featuring copies of a Bible, a Qur&apos;an and a Talmud, because, according to a gallery statement, it was not &quot;appropriate&quot; in the sensitive post-7/7 climate. As Kenan Malik, author of the forthcoming book From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Legacy, has written: &quot;The fatwa has in effect become internalised&quot;. Fear is not the only explanation why a global religion which, rightly or wrongly, is invoked as the inspiration for terror has become a non-subject for critical (or uncritical) works of art. The other reason is sympathy. And here Khomeini has proved prescient. Back in 1989, only the most conspiracy-minded Islamists took seriously Khomeini&apos;s claims that The Satanic Verses was part of a Zionist-imperialist plot to persecute Muslims. The world has since changed. Following the events of 11 September 2001, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the idea that the West is engaged in a military and cultural war with Islam is now far more widely entertained. A conflation has taken place in which the war in Iraq and the plight of the Palestinians has become somehow indivisible from the situation of Muslims in Britain. So that to be opposed to the war is to be, if not actively in favour of Islamism at home (the position of much of the far left), then at least not against it. And by extension, open criticism of Islamism, religious censorship and violence is often automatically viewed as an expression of &quot;neocon&quot; or &quot;imperialist&quot; politics. Although there were exceptions at the time - among them Germaine Greer, John Berger and John Le Carr\u00e9 - many prominent cultural figures on the left extended Rushdie their support both here and abroad. Even a critic of The Satanic Verses, the Egyptian novelist and Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz, who felt the book was insulting to Islam, signed a petition stating that &quot;no blasphemy harms Islam and Muslims so much as the call for murdering a writer&quot;. Five years later Mahfouz was stabbed in the neck by Islamic extremists. In the years since the fatwa there have been many more flashpoints in which artists and writers have been threatened, attacked or killed for criticising Islam, and not all have been Muslims. Hitchens thinks this is a development that has been overlooked. &quot;Salman was raised as a Muslim,&quot; he says, &quot;so in theory he&apos;s within the jurisdiction. He can be sentenced as an apostate, and the same can be done to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Taslima Nasreen [the Bangladeshi novelist under threat of decapitation who has just been offered refuge in Paris]. But what people haven&apos;t noticed sufficiently is that now people who are not Muslims, like the Danish cartoonists, have been threatened with violence for criticising Islam. That&apos;s sort of new, and ought to be more controversial than it is.&quot; Yet few of those who have found themselves targeted by Islamic extremists in the wake of the Rushdie fatwa received wholehearted support from the liberal community. Quite the opposite. Theo Van Gogh, slaughtered on a busy street in Amsterdam; his co-filmmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, threatened with death and placed under police protection; the Danish cartoonists who responded to Jyllands-Posten&apos;s commission to draw the prophet Muhammad and were forced into hiding: in each of these high-profile cases, the victims of intimidation were castigated and shunned by a wide swathe of progressive opinion. &quot;Right wing&quot;, &quot;provocateurs&quot;, &quot;reactionaries&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; are some of the more restrained epithets aimed at the above names by their liberal critics. (Incidentally, surely the defining example of the absurdity of self-censorship is that the Danish cartoon that did not feature an image of the prophet but instead the legend &quot;Jyllands-Posten&apos;s journalists are a bunch of reactionary provocateurs&quot; was also deemed too dangerous to publish by every newspaper in Britain.)  The word, though, that is most frequently launched at the heirs of Rushdie is Islamophobic. Almost any criticism of Islam or any of its adherents is likely to trigger accusations of Islamophobia. For example, in 2007 the Channel 4 documentary Undercover Mosque exposed various preachers making hateful and violent statements regarding women, Jews, homosexuals and infidels. By any journalistic measure it was a compelling and revelatory documentary. But in the media storm that followed it was not the inflammatory preachers but the programme-makers who found themselves subject to an inquisition. The police tried to prosecute them for broadcasting &quot;material likely to stir up racial hatred&quot;. And when that failed they referred the film to Ofcom for censure. It took nine months before the film-makers were fully vindicated and their professional reputations restored. Of course, very few people sympathised with the preachers shown in the documentary but many did want to express their sympathy with Muslims in general, whom they saw, not without reason, as an embattled minority. And to the well-intentioned, the best way of doing this was to condemn anyone who criticised any Muslim, regardless of their extremism. As the playwright David Edgar put it: &quot;Whether they like it or not, the current defectors [his term for those liberals who criticise extremist Islamic leaders] are seeking to provide a vocabulary for the progressive intelligentsia to abandon the poor.&quot; Muslims in all their myriad variety and differences have morphed, or been corralled, into a unitary socio-economic-cultural block. To take vocal exception to one aspect of Islam or one particular leader or sect is, almost by definition, to be an opponent of all Muslims. The Satanic Verses affair was the first test case in Britain of Muslimhood - many were to follow - in which the mark of a true Muslim was to be in favour of banning the novel, and the distinction of an even truer Muslim was to be in favour of killing Rushdie. Inayat Bunglawala, spokesperson for the Jamaat-i-Islami-influenced Muslim Council of Britain, probably the most-often cited Islamic organisation in the country, passed both tests with flying colours. He was, in his own words, &quot;elated&quot; when Khomeini delivered the fatwa. &quot;It was a very welcome reminder that British Muslims did not have to regard themselves just as a small, vulnerable minority; they were part of a truly global and powerful movement.&quot; Nowadays he accepts that book-banning is wrong, though he looks back with gratitude on the protests. &quot;It was a seminal moment in British Muslim history,&quot; he told me. &quot;It brought Muslims together. Before that they had been identified as ethnic communities but The Satanic Verses brought them together and helped develop a British Muslim identity, which I&apos;m sure infuriates Salman Rushdie.&quot; One reason for Rushdie&apos;s fury could be that an identity forged on terrorising a fiction writer, with its direct associations of violence and censorship, is not a fair one to hang on two million Britons. Kenan Malik suggests that it is a myth that &quot;all Muslims were offended by The Satanic Verses. In fact, most Muslims were little concerned about it.&quot; But as with most political arguments, in this particular identity parade apathy never got a look in. Instead the most outspoken &quot;community leaders&quot; claimed, and were duly assigned, the mantle of authentic representatives of Muslim Britain. Yet again Khomeini was onto something. The expressed intention of his fatwa was to defend and strengthen the clergy, and one of its effects in Britain has been to create a kind of pseudo-clergy, a class of Islamist intellectuals and militants who presume to speak not just for their co-religionists in Britain but 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. At the same time, in the late 80s and early 90s, another clergy of fundamentalist preachers, often refugees from despotic Middle Eastern regimes, began to attract a disaffected constituency that had been radicalised by The Satanic Verses protests. As Hirsi Ali put it to me: &quot;The paradox in the UK with regard to freedom of expression is that most of the radical literature and most of the radical mosques moved from Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and established themselves in the liberal West, where there is freedom of religion and expression, with the bizarre purpose of destroying those freedoms.&quot;  In the 20 years since the fatwa, the parameters of cultural debate in Britain and elsewhere have undoubtedly narrowed. If the Islam of Khomeini and other fundamentalists has played a key role in redefining what is and is not acceptable, then it is not the only factor. Other religions have also got in on the censorship act. In 2004 the play Behzti (Dishonour) was cancelled at the Birmingham Rep after a riot by Sikh protesters on the opening night. Christian groups too have taken to organising more intimidating protests - though with less success - against shows and productions they deem offensive. Taken together they are all part of a multicultural accommodation that has come to determine the terms of public discourse. In hindsight, The Satanic Verses was published at a turning point in progressive politics. Throughout much of the 20th century a battle had been waged against discriminating on the basis of race (The Satanic Verses itself was avowedly anti-racist) and class. In other words, those aspects of humanity that are biologically inherited or socially imposed. For a variety of reasons, including the fall of the Berlin Wall later on in 1989 and the emergence of minority group activism, a new identity politics emerged. Class and race were replaced or trumped by culture. The emphasis moved to combating cultural discrimination. All cultures were deemed equal, and therefore all components of culture - religion, tradition, beliefs - had to be protected from critical appraisal. Obviously culture is socially inherited, but in a free society it is also a matter of freedom of choice. The liberty to change your beliefs, reject your traditions and question your religion is what distinguishes individuals from members of an enforced collective. Such liberty necessitates the discussion and expression of ideas that may be unpalatable to others. Increasingly, therefore, this has become a process that is actively discouraged. Respecting culture has come to mean restricting debate. Malik quotes the sociologist Tariq Modood on this issue: &quot;If people are to occupy the same political space without conflict, they mutually have to limit the extent to which they subject each other&apos;s fundamental beliefs to criticism.&quot; To some extent this sensitivity has been achieved by coercion - the fatwa model. But there has also been a more voluntary adoption of multicultural manners, chief among which is the duty not to offend. And where that has failed, the government has shown itself all too willing to step in with proscriptive legislation. Three years ago we came within a single parliamentary vote of being saddled with a law (the Religious Hatred Act) that meant you or I could be imprisoned for seven years for using insulting language, even if the insult was unintentional and referred to an established truth. Furthermore, under draconian anti-terror laws, it is now illegal to be in possession of a whole range of reading material. This is one of the terrible ironies of the conflict with reactionary Islam, previewed in the attempt to censor (and kill) Rushdie. In 1989 the British government defended freedom of expression against Islamic extremists. By 2009 Islamic extremists could accuse the British government of withdrawing freedom of expression. That the extremists dream of a far more extensive (and violent) censorship is no comfort or excuse.  Rushdie has now moved on, figuratively and geographically, from the fatwa years. Back from the front pages, he has once again relocated, having lived in Mumbai and London, to New York (he is not alone in noting that all three cities have suffered Islamic terror attacks). But The Satanic Verses remains a book about the struggles of migration and the frictions of cultural exchange. It pokes fun at all manner of targets, not least America and Britain. Above all, perhaps, it dramatises the conviction that there is nothing more sacred than the freedom to question what is sacred. Twenty years on, it&apos;s a principle that urgently needs to be remembered. What they said at the time Harold Pinter playwright&quot;A very distinguished writer has used his imagination to write a book and has criticised the religion into which he was born and he has been sentenced to death as well as his publishers. It is an intolerable and barbaric state of affairs.&quot;  John Berger author and critic&quot;I suspect that Salman Rushdie, if he is not caught in a chain of events of which he has completely lost control, might, by now, be ready to consider asking his world publishers to stop producing more or new editions of The Satanic Verses. Not because of the threat to his own life, but because of the threat to the lives of those who are innocent of either writing or reading the book.&quot; Germaine Greer writer and academic&quot;I refuse to sign petitions for that book of his, which was about his own troubles.&quot; Jimmy Carter US president, 1977-81&quot;Rushdie&apos;s book is a direct insult to those millions of Moslems whose sacred beliefs have been violated ... The death sentence proclaimed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, however, was an abhorrent response. It is our duty to condemn the threat of murder [but] we should be sensitive to the concern and anger that prevails even among the more moderate Muslims.&quot; John Le Carre author&quot;Again and again, it has been within his [Rushdie&apos;s] power to save the faces of his publishers and, with dignity, withdraw his book until a calmer time has come ... It seems to me he has nothing more to prove except his own insensitivity.&quot; Roald Dahl author&quot;[Rushdie] knew exactly what he was doing and cannot plead otherwise.This kind of sensationalism does indeed get an indifferent book on to the top of the bestseller list - but to my mind it is a cheap way of doing it. Sir Geoffrey Howe foreign secretary, 1983-89The British government, the British people, do not have any affection for the book ... It compares Britain with Hitler&apos;s Germany. We do not like that any more than the people of the Muslim faith like the attacks on their faith contained in the book. So we are not sponsoring the book.

This is a self-portrait of the artist as enigma: he casts a shadow but he&apos;s not there. Exhibitions of Van Golden&apos;s work are rare; the Dutch artist, now over 70, produces very little, and for long periods appears to work hardly at all.  Van Golden&apos;s paintings take their motifs from things around him: the pattern on a handkerchief, or faithful copies of the decorative designs on Japanese wrapping paper and tissues (the artist lived in Japan for a couple of years in the 1960s). In Van Golden&apos;s art, these patterned rectangles hark back to Mondrian and the geometric abstraction of the first half of the 20th century. In part this is effected by the off-key primary colours, but mostly it is Van Golden&apos;s concentration and application that communicates to us. The paintings sing.  Everything Van Golden paints seems to be an act of homage - a parakeet found in Matisse&apos;s 1952 cut-paper collage, The Parakeet and the Mermaid; a Giacometti standing figure; a blown-up detail from a Jackson Pollock drip painting. The parakeet becomes a plume or quill shape, its boundary edge scalloped in a way quite unlike the one Matisse sheared with scissors from coloured paper. Van Golden&apos;s painting of the Giacometti has none of that artist&apos;s worry and toil. I looked at this painting till my eyes saw pulsing blue-green after-images when I glanced away from it. I walked around to the other side of the wall where it hung, and there was an almost identical painting; for a moment, I felt like falling over. Why, you ask, would anyone do such things? It gets more complicated. From the birth of his daughter in 1978, and throughout her childhood and adolescence, Van Golden has photographed her. A series of images of the little girl performing cartwheels hangs beside one of Van Golden&apos;s Pollock pictures. The juxtaposition makes me think of different kinds of energy, and how photographs and paintings alike still the moment. In photograph after photograph we see the growing girl, in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and in Marrakech, Agadir and Kathmandu.  These photographs mark time and human presence, but time seems to disappear in Van Golden&apos;s paintings. What he painted in the 1960s is as present as the work he did last year. His art persists in a strange and oddly satisfying way. His paintings have almost no sign of touch. There are no erasures, no revisions, no mistakes, no tics or mannerisms. At one point he paints Fats Domino, copying the image from an enlarged half-tone photograph. He paints the dots with absolute precision. Then he appropriates and crops a mid-1960s poster of Mick Jagger, who appears to have a halo and looks as though he has stepped out of a Mantegna. Van Golden carefully paints a Buddha, leaving the image incomplete, with a few dry and wilted collaged flowers scattered like a garland.  Much of what is in this beautifully installed show I have seen before, either in museum collections in the Netherlands, or in the 1999 Venice Biennale, where he represented his country. Returning to him, I am perplexed each time. Repainting the parakeet or the Pollock detail - a skein of lines, a bulbous faltering drip, not once, but several times, I imagine the artist is also baffled. He paints the parakeet white - or rather paints the canvas blue, leaving the empty white space for the bird, or plume, or whatever it has become for him. Then he takes another canvas and does it again in red. Sometimes I think the paintings paint him. The photographs and posters are a peculiar though necessary accompaniment. One photograph is a closeup of some cultivated pansies. Each flower seems to be a face, staring back. This is disturbing. Like almost everything Van Golden has done, it could be precious and cloying. Instead, it is inexplicably odd. The more you look, the weirder it gets \u00b7 Red Or Blue is at Camden Arts Centre, London WC3 until 8 February.

The move will see remaining ad agencies Wieden &amp; Kennedy Amsterdam, Mother London, McCann Erickson Spain and Senior Rushmore Madrid further entrench their positions across Coca-Cola&apos;s flagship brand. These agencies are set to be briefed on how the new strategy, which will be known as the Coke Red European Agency Network, will be implemented this month.

As Tony Cross points out: &quot;Brentford FC were manager by Bill Dodgin Senior between 1953 and 1957 and his son Bill Dodgin Junior between 1976 and 1980&quot;. The Dodgins have form in this area. They also double-teamed nearby Fulham, Bill Senior between 1949 and 1953 and Bill Junior between 1969 and 1972. &apos;Never give a Dodgin more than four years in the job&apos;, as they say in west London. Fulham seem to go in for this kind of thing. Their first proper manager Harry Bradshaw (1904-1909) was succeeded by his son Joe in 1926, who also played under his dad at Arsenal. Keep up. Paul Napper writes from Southend with the news that Bob Jack, long-serving Plymouth manager during the first half of the 20th century, also managed Southend from 1906-1910: &quot;He later retired in Southend and helped scout for his son, David Jack, the first player to be transferred for more than \u00a310,000, when he managed Southend from 1934-1940&quot;. Also down south, both Kevin and John Bond have managed Bournemouth. John even came up with the name AFC Bournemouth, dropping the Boscombe bit. And changed the club kit to red and black to make it a bit more like AC Milan. If you know of any more father-son double acts, then let us know at knowledge@theguardian.com. NAME GAME &quot;Blyth Spartans were named after the Greek army,&quot; James Henry points out, before getting to the heart of the matter: &quot;What is the weirdest explanation for a football team&apos;s suffix?&quot; Blyth are named after the Spartan army, the legendary fighting force of the 6th to 4th centuries BC. This kind of classical allusion wasn&apos;t uncommon in the era of the late Victorian amateur. Corinthian, now Corinthian Casuals, were formed in 1882, their name referencing the mythic Greek code of amateur sportsmanship. This was a common practice across Europe at the time. Ajax of Amsterdam are named after Ajax the Ancient Greek warrior hero from the Iliad (and latterly also inspiration for a popular brand of domestic scouring powder). And the Spartans themselves left an imprint beyond Blyth \u2013 Sparta Rotterdam (Holland) and Sparta Prague (Czech Republic), both founded within a few years of Spartans, took their name from the same bunch of Greek hard-cases. All a little more elevated than the origins of Billingham Synthonia, whose suffix, explains Roger Hale, comes from an agricultural fertiliser, &quot;Synthonia being a contraction of &apos;synthetic ammonia&apos;. This was manufactured by ICI, which used to operate a large chemical works in the town and maintained a close association with the club.&quot; Brian Clough once played for them, you know. From Lithuania George M Campbell writes with news of his local team Vilnius Zalgiris, named after &quot;a battle fought in what is now Poland, in 1410, by the national hero Vytautas, where he finally defeated the Teutonic Order and their allies, thus securing the western border against the crusaders sent by numerous popes, and enabling his empire-building drive to the Black Sea&quot;. All of which, scholastically-minded Knowledge regulars will no doubt be familiar with already. Nick den Uijl is the man with the skinny on NAC Breda of Holland, although, as he points out, this is a prefix and not a suffix. &quot;NAC Breda comes from Noad Advendo Combinatie. Noad stands for &apos;Nooit Ophouden Altijd Doorzetten&apos; (Never Quit Always Persevere) and Advendo stands for &apos;Aangenaam Door Vermaak En Nuttig Door Ontspanning&apos; (Pleasant by Enjoyment and Useful by means of Relaxation). Noad and Advendo were two football clubs in Breda (the Netherlands) who merged in 1912.&quot; Never Quit Always Persevere Pleasant by Enjoyment and Useful by means of Relaxation Breda it is then. Catchy. From Russia Alexei Berezovoy writes with news of a team called Avtozapchasty, which means &quot;spare part&quot;. Avtozapchasty are from Baksan, and were named after a factory that made spare parts. To date their greatest achievement is a 4th place finish in the western zone of the Russian Second division. While we&apos;re at it let&apos;s not forget Swindon Supermarine, who play in the Southern Premier League, an amalgamation of Swindon Athletic and Supermarine, originally the works team of the Supermarine aircraft company, who made the Spitfire. And as of this year Leigh Genesis, who used to be Leigh RMI, but have now been renamed after a leading British prog rock band of the 1970s and 80s, apparently in order &quot;to give the club an association with the town and to symbolise its new beginning&quot;. Genesis also have a new &quot;logo&quot; on their kit \u2013 a series of green squiggles reminiscent of a bowl of pesto-coated spaghetti. As always, send further quirky examples to the usual address. OLD YOUNG&apos;UNS Fraser Wilson asks: &quot;When he played his final England Under-21 game, was James Milner the oldest player to have ever taken part in U-21 international football?&quot; For the record, Milner is still eligible to play for the Under-21s, despite the fact that he was 22 years, 9 months and ten days old when he won his record 40th cap last October. This is quite common, as Cordelia Csar explains: &quot;Jonathan Greening, born 2 January 1979, played for England at the 2002 European Under-21 Championships. England&apos;s last match was 22 May, so he was 23 years, 5 months and 23 days old. Milner is still eligible to play in the 2009 finals in June, as players have to be born on or after 1 January 1986 which would mean he could play for them while being older than Greening was.&quot; There&apos;s more to this, though. As Michael Haughey points out, Under-21 teams used to be allowed to have over-age players. &quot;The oldest U-21 player I can think of,&quot; he writes, &quot;was Hamish McAlpine of Dundee United and Scotland who played five games for the Scottish Under-21 team when he was 35.&quot; And all above board too. Unlike some others Pablo Miguez could mention: &quot;Brazilian Carlos Alberto played in the 2003 Youth World Cup at a mere 25 years old. He admitted it later, and that caused him to be suspended for a year&quot;. Carlos Alberto, ban served, is currently playing for Corinthians; who were named after the English club Corinthian; who have a classical moniker in common with ... Blyth Spartans. Email additional cases of Under-21s in their dotage to knowledge@theguardian.com. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Is there any truth in the story that Harry Redknapp once fielded a spectator during a West Ham game?&quot; asked Terry Williams back in 2006. &quot;Legend has it that the Hammers were having a shocker and a fan was heckling them. Harry is then supposed to have turned round and said: &apos;If you think you can do any better, then prove it!&apos;&quot; Incredibly, the legend is true, Terry. In 1994, Redknapp was assistant manager of West Ham and his side were playing Oxford City in a pre-season friendly when ... well, we&apos;ll let &apos;Arry take up the tale: &quot;Lee Chapman was playing for us at the time,&quot; recounts Redknapp. &quot;All through the first half some tattooed skinhead behind me was giving Lee terrible stick. At half-time I turned to this bloke who had West Ham etched on his neck and asked &apos;Can you play as good as you talk?&apos; He looked totally confused. So I told him he was going to get his dream to play for West Ham. We sent him down the tunnel and he reappeared 10 minutes later all done out in the strip. He ran on to the pitch and a journalist from the local Oxford paper sidled up and asked &apos;Who&apos;s that Harry?&apos; I said &apos;What? Haven&apos;t you been watching the World Cup? That&apos;s the great Bulgarian Tittyshev!&apos; The fella wasn&apos;t bad - actually, he scored!&quot; The fella in question was a 27-year-old called Steve Davies who had given up park football six years earlier. The West Ham board were obviously impressed with Harry&apos;s idiosyncratic decision-making: they made him manager a month later. CAN YOU HELP? &quot;Kaka has made it pretty clear that he &apos;belongs to Jesus&apos;, but have any other players publically displayed their religious views on the field?&quot; asks Jamie Jones. &quot;Following yet another loan move for Chelsea&apos;s Scott Sinclair, what is the most number of times a player has been loaned out whilst still under contract with his parent club,&quot; wonders Paul Kee. &quot;Could you possibly explain why Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s players did not wear matching strips during the 1987 FA Cup final against Coventry City?&quot; asks Stephen Graham. &quot;Some of the players \u2013 such as Richard Gough, Gary Mabbitt and Glenn Hoddle \u2013 did not have sponsorship on the front of their strip, while others did.&quot; Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.", "sentences": ["Ajax of Amsterdam are named after Ajax the Ancient Greek warrior hero from the Iliad (and latterly also inspiration for a popular brand of domestic scouring powder)."], "title": "The Knowledge: sons who have followed in their father's managerial footsteps", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/14/the-knowledge-father-son-managers", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Derby County", "Southend", "Bournemouth"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-15T08:00:00Z", "article": "The imminent decision on Heathrow&apos;s third runway is vitally important for the future of London and the UK. It is a decades-old issue that carries with it at lot of emotion. Facts should determine the outcome.  At its most basic, the key question is: will the UK be better off with more runway capacity at its hub airport? The answer must be yes. Business today depends on air connectivity to deliver products to markets and bring people to business. Foreign direct investment contributes \u00a352bn and 500,000 jobs to London&apos;s economy. The prosperity that this brings depends on effective air links. Look no further than the growth of technology companies in the area surrounding Heathrow for proof. Operating at 99% capacity, Heathrow is at its limits. If it cannot grow, London&apos;s hub benefits will slowly shift elsewhere. Paris has four runways, Amsterdam five, and Frankfurt will open its fourth in 2011. Operating at 75% capacity, all are eager to accommodate the business that Heathrow will turn away if it cannot expand. For those arguing that transit passengers provide little economic benefit to the home country, the facts tell a different story. Two-thirds of Heathrow&apos;s flights need transit passengers to fill a quarter or more of their seats to be economically viable. For London&apos;s business travellers, who make-up 40% of Heathrow&apos;s originating passengers, the hub makes direct and frequent connections to 187 destinations possible \u2013 including important markets like India and China. While 187 destinations is impressive, this is 44 destinations less than Heathrow served in 1990. By contrast, Europe&apos;s other hubs now offer more choice \u2013 50 more direct options from Amsterdam than Heathrow, 60 more from Paris, and 100 more from Frankfurt. To preserve its competitiveness, London needs more capacity to get the best value from its hub. Environmental arguments against Heathrow expansion also do not hold up against fact. Climate change is a global issue and aviation contributes 2% of global CO2 emissions. In 2012 aviation is scheduled to join the EU emissions trading scheme, capping its emissions at 2005 levels. Any growth in aviation&apos;s emissions will have to be balanced by reductions elsewhere. Net CO2 emissions will therefore not increase as a result of expanding Heathrow. Aviation takes its environmental responsibilities seriously. The International Air Transport Association pioneered a four-pillar strategy on climate change that includes improvements in technology, operations and infrastructure as well as positive economic measures. The strategy is delivering results. Since 2004 our work with airlines, airports and air navigation service providers has saved 59m of CO2. And progress in technology \u2013 everything from more efficient airframes and engines to aviation bio-fuels and advanced air navigation \u2013 is providing opportunities for further reductions.  Air transport was built by turning dreams into reality. In 50 years, we moved from the Wright brothers to the jet age. Today airlines safely transport over 2.3 billion people annually. Having proven our ability to overcome technical challenges, I am convinced that meeting the pre-conditions of limiting noise and preserving local air quality will be achieved. In fact, the association&apos;s vision is much bolder \u2013 to achieve carbon-neutral growth and eventually a plane that does not pollute at all. The facts clearly tell us that London will be better off with the economic benefits that a third runway will make possible. They also tell us that the environmental impact can be effectively managed. The responsible decision is clear. I look forward to Heathrow&apos;s third runway and a competitive and well-connected future for London.", "sentences": ["Paris has four runways, Amsterdam five, and Frankfurt will open its fourth in 2011.", "By contrast, Europe&apos;s other hubs now offer more choice \u2013 50 more direct options from Amsterdam than Heathrow, 60 more from Paris, and 100 more from Frankfurt."], "title": "Giovanni Bisignani: The third runway is crucial for Britain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/15/travelandtransport-heathrow", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Environment", "Heathrow", "Climate change", "UK news", "Heathrow third runway", "Travel", "Politics", "Green politics", "Transport policy", "Planning policy", "Transport", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-15T09:45:28Z", "article": " 9.50am: The transport minister Geoff Hoon is not due to announce until lunchtime whether the government will approve a third runway at Heathrow, but the media is taking it as a done deal. A new electrified high speed rail line linking Heathrow, London and Birmingham will be included in the package allowing Hoon to announce a &quot;green Heathrow&quot;, the Guardian reports. The Greenpeace director, John Sauven, told the BBC&apos;s The World Tonight late last night that Heathrow would become the country&apos;s biggest emitter of CO2 emmissions and that aircraft numbers over London would double.  &quot;The climate targets that this government says it wants to be a world leader in will be torn to shreds by this decision ... Gordon Brown knows the consequences of this decision. MPs from all sides, local governments, the London mayor have all said they will fight this every inch of the way.

But it is a more serious challenge than that. The solution is not to keep planes flying over London because there is no place to land and it is not to make those planes go to Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt, which is where they will go if they cannot go to Heathrow.&quot;  Friends of the Earth has a retort to what it believes is &quot;Soley&apos;s vision&quot;.  10.10amThe extra 600 flights a day and tens of thousands of extra cars&quot;could make it difficult for the government to meet its commitment ofreducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050,&quot; says the Independent. It is the &quot;wrong decision&quot;, says the paper in a leader. There&apos;s more newspaper reaction in today&apos;s Wrap.  10.25amHoon&apos;s announcement is now expected at around 11.30am.  Here&apos;s a profile of Soley. TheyWorkForYou has counted Soley using three-word alliterative phrases (e.g. &quot;she sells seashells&quot;) 70 times in debates \u2014 &quot;above average amongst Lords&quot;. More seriously, he&apos;s more active in debates than most lords in the upper house.  10.30amSo when will this runway actually be built? Pro-runway campaigners accept that Greenpeace&apos;s tactic of getting celebrities to buy a plot of land on the proposed site will delay the construction. We can expect a &quot;long and concerted campaign of civil disobedience and non-violent direct action&quot;, according to the Guardian. Guardian Heathrow third runway stories should be here, by the way.  10.50amMegan, from PR firm Rooster, has emailed to say she is watching this live blog &quot;with interest&quot; - at least there&apos;s one - though I fear her interest may be professional. She represents Cheapflights which believes a new runway &quot;brings with it the prospect of lower fares, more consumer choice, and the ability of Heathrow better to compete with European competitors&quot;.  11am&quot;Londoners will suffer&quot;, says the city mayor, Boris Johnson, making a plea to Gordon Brown for an 11.30th-hour change of heart.  11.05amI&apos;ve just been prompted to turn the comments on, so please do, if you like. Or email.  11.20amEarlier this week, I was talking to someone who has dedicated his professional life to transport infrastructure. He was unsure of the benefits of a high speed rail line between London and Birmingham with a Heathrow spur. His main points were:1. Over such a short distance, you save little time over the current 130mph London-Birmingham service and is it really worth the cost? 2. Ditto highspeed rail between Heathrow and central London. What you really want is a fast underground service, like Paris&apos;s RER or Crossrail.3. Many people in provincial England prefer to fly to Heathrow as they can check in their lugguage from their local airport to its final destination. The train option requires you lug it between London stations.4. A 200mph railway is less green than a 130mph one, as you use more energy the faster you go. None of is rocket science but, alas, then there&apos;s the politics.  11.40amNo confirmation yet. But a civil engineering body, a group you might expect to support a big building project, has come out against the new runway. Tom Foulkes, director general of the Institution of Civil Engineers, said:   &quot;Despite the obvious boom for the engineering professions, we simply cannot support the Heathrow expansion plans in their current form. The government seems to have got itself into a political mess over this project - largely because it lacks a coherent national transport policy that demonstrates how it intends to balance the UK&apos;s transport needs to meet growing demand with the need to reduce carbon emissions.&quot;   11.50amThe expansion is expected to lead to the construction of a dual carriageway road through Cherry Lane cemetery in Sipson, a village where 700 homes could be knocked down to make way for the runway. Edna La Mothe, spokeswoman for Cherry Lane Against Development said:   &quot;Today&apos;s decision comes as no surprise. This government has shown little regard for the living, so we didn&apos;t expect any consideration for our dead. As for us mourners, as if our distress was not great enough, we will now have to dodge vehicles when we visit the graves.&quot;    11.55amHillingdon council, which opposes a third runway, has lots of information and maps about how the extension may impact upon the area. In the interest of fairness, the airport operator, BAA, sets out its case for a third runway here.  12.05pmHere we go. Geoff Hoon is speaking in the Commons. He&apos;s just announcing a \u00a36bn motorway programme to open up the hard shoulder to traffic on the most congested parts of the M1, M25, M6, M62, the M3 and M4 approaching London, and the motorways around Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol.  12.10pmHoon announces the formation of new High Speed 2 company to consider the case for high speed line between London and Scotland. It will begin by developing a proposal for an entirely new line between London and the West Midlands. Hoon says there is &quot;strong case&quot; for Heathrow rail hub.  12.13pm&quot;Heathrow is our most important international hub... and operating at 99% of capacity,&quot; says Hoon. The government is convinced that expansion at Heathrow is crucial to long term growth strategy.  12.15pmHoon details some changes to the take-off and landing patterns in Heathrow which will benefit residents of Windsor. Did the Queen write in to the public consultation? He spells out the government&apos;s commitment to air quality obligations, to chuckles from fellow MPs.  12.16pmThe CAA will have a new environmental duty written into law to ensure air and noise pollution limited, Hoon says. The Environment Agency will act as an enforcement body.  12.18pmThere will be improved public transport connections meaning the government&apos;s three conditions for Heathrow expansion [on noise, air quality and access] have been met, says Hoon.  &quot;I can therefore confirm that an additional terminal and the slightly longer runway proposed in the consultation are the best way to maximise the efficiency of a larger airport.&quot;   12.21pmHoon announces a &quot;new target&quot; to get aviation emissions in 2050 below 2005 levels.  12.24pmAnswering an earlier question on this post, Hoon says he expects the new runway to be operational between 2015 and 2020.  12.25pm&quot;It&apos;s a bleak day for the environment,&quot; says Teresa Villiers, the shadow transport minister.  12.30pmA couple of initial sentences from the PA parliament wire on Hoon&apos;s statement:  &quot;Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon told the Commons that a new runway at Heathrow was &quot;the best way to maximise efficiency&quot; at an expanded airport. Mr Hoon said that initially the number of flights allowed to use the new runway would be limited to half the original proposal and incentives put in place for the use of cleaner and quieter aircraft.&quot;   12.40pmHoon told the Commons of three steps the government would take to limit increases in carbon dioxide emissions at Heathrow:  * First, we are limiting the initial extra capacity to around half of the original proposal; * Second, we intend that new slots at Heathrow will have to be green slots. Only the cleanest planes would be allowed to use the new slots that will be made available; and * Third, we will establish a new target to limit aviation emissions in the UK to below 2005 levels by 2050. Hoon&apos;s full ministerial statement is here.  1pm Mutiny in the Commons, reports the PA parliament wire:  &quot;Labour&apos;s John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) suspended from the Commons after picking up the mace and repeatedly challenging the Government&apos;s decision on Heathrow.&quot;   1.05pmSo, have environmental organisations been placated by Hoon&apos;s announcement that the UK will have the &quot;toughest climate change regime for aviation of any country in the world&quot;? Fat chance. The RSPB&apos;s conservation director, Mark Avery [shame it&apos;s not &quot;Aviary&quot;], says:  &quot;This decision shows that the UK&apos;s policies on tackling climate change are a sham. The government will never hit its carbon cuts targets if Heathrow has a third runway.&quot;  While David Nussbaum, the chief executive of WWF-UK, says: &quot;Heathrow&apos;s expansion was the first big test of the government&apos;s environmental credibility since the Climate Change Act became law last year. It has failed spectacularly and by choosing to support a third runway, the government has torpedoed it&apos;s own flagship policy.&quot;  1.10pmWhat about the rail lobby group, the Campaign for Better Transport? Surely it&apos;ll be happy about the new high-speed rail announcement? Not this time. Stephen Joseph, the group&apos;s executive director, says: &quot;Plans for better rail services should be instead of rather than as well as airport expansion. And those plans need to have budgets, timescales and a business case, not be vague promises.&quot;  1.25pmThe Guardian&apos;s transport correspondent, Dan Milmo, has filed on today&apos;s announcement.  1.30pmThe London mayor, Boris Johnson, described the decision as a &quot;devastating blow&quot;.  &quot;No amount of sweeteners in the shape of transport infrastructure will fundamentally alter the fact that the government is hell-bent on exacerbating a planning error of the 1940s and that Heathrow is not fit for purpose.&quot;  He&apos;s invited Gordon Brown along to his &quot;people&apos;s question time&quot; in Hillingdon next week to meet the people who&apos;ll be affected by the decision.  1.50pmHow much do you care about the Heathrow expansion? Enough to vote Tory? Enough to vote in our poll? Matthew, of Rainer PR, has been in touch drawing my attention to a poll for a firm called Camcon, which makes high-tech switches which could be used in the aviation industry to develop quieter planes. When asked to what extent do you agree that &quot;UK airports need more capacity to meet flight demands&quot;, just 38% of Londoners agreed. That would seem to imply most Londoners are firmly against airport expansion. You can read more about the survey and its methodology here [pdf].  2pmMace update. McDonnell says:  &quot;The decision today for my constituents was an absolute disgrace...It is a betrayal of future generations in terms of the environment, it&apos;s a betrayal of my constituents who will lose their homes, their schools, their cemeteries, their churches...&quot;   The heated exchanges took place as McDonnell called for a vote, something that Hoon said the Commons doesn&apos;t do on planning issues.  2.20pmThe bloggers in the Greenpeace press office note that Hoon said the use of the new runway would be limited to half capacity, &quot;so you&apos;ve got to ask yourself why build it?&quot;  2.25pmThe BAA boss, Colin Matthews, is a happy man. The share price of the Spanish firm Ferrovial, which owns BAA, is currently up 2.5%.

There&apos;ll be another chance to see the sequence of five half-hours at the end of the month, and it shouldn&apos;t be missed. The adaptation by Deborah Moggach was as restrained as it was powerful. My wife, who was born near Amsterdam in the war, said the lighting and sets caught the time and the place brilliantly. Anne&apos;s diary is one of the great powerful testaments of the Holocaust, a lasting monument like the lesser known, but truly great literary memoir, of Primo Levi&apos;s evocation of Auschwitz, If This is a Man.  &quot;With the violins of irony,&quot; wrote the critic AA Gill in the Sunday Times, &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank played all week against the background news of Israel&apos;s bombing and invasion of Gaza. The comparison between the Franks, forced into hiding, and the Palestinians, proscribed, trapped and hopeless in this sliver of land that is the Middle East&apos;s attic, was inescapable.&quot; The point is well made, for the Holocaust is central to the national narrative of Israel. Gill&apos;s one major criticism was that the BBC drama, for all its skill and pathos, lacked context. It didn&apos;t put the rounding-up of the Dutch Jews, of whom 100,000 died in the camps, in its historical context. Neither the drama nor the excellent documentary narrated by Kenneth Branagh that accompanied it, and which won an Oscar two years ago, went deeply into the question of who betrayed the Franks to the Nazi powers in Amsterdam. The sense of betrayal of the Jews is a powerful twist in the Dutch national narrative of the Holocaust, and its legacy endures to this day. Many Dutch feel the Jews were betrayed by Dutch bureaucracy itself. In the last national census before the war, which most knew was coming, individuals and families were categorised by race and religion, so the Nazi powers knew exactly where the majority of Jews lived and worked. And when the round-ups started, most people living in and around Amsterdam knew what was going on. My mother-in-law, Margreet Slingenberg, kept a diary throughout the war. Her chronicle of 1943, in a tiny pocket diary, is made up of one-line summaries of events. Thus for 3 February, &quot;Stalingrad fallen&quot;, on 6 February in a howling storm my wife Marianne is born; in July Mussolini&apos;s fall and the battles on Sicily are recorded. Then on 19 October, Thursday, she writes &quot;walked through Amsterdam, through the Jewish quarter where all the houses are empty, every window shattered, really spooky.&quot; The sense of betrayal in a different national context is brilliantly explored in Alexander Stille&apos;s book, Benevolence and Betrayal, about five prominent Jewish families in Turin under fascism. Four of the families had been generous donors to fascism, only the wily and tough communist Rocco Foa knew what was coming for the Jews once Mussolini hooked up with Hitler.  The Dutch betrayal of the Jews has a resonance today in the sensitivities and tensions currently running with the growing population of recent immigrants, and the rise of militant Islamists. Curiously it is overlooked by Ian Buruma, in his otherwise excellent book, Murder in Amsterdam, about the murder of Theo van Gogh by a Moroccan Islamist and of the populist anti-immigrant politician Pim Fortuyn, and the anti-Islamic protest of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. It came up again when the Serbs overran the Bosnian enclave of Srbrenica in July 1992, when it was under the protection of Dutch UN troops. Some 5,000-7,000 Bosniak males were taken away, tied and shot. This time the victims were Muslim. The sense of public betrayal was palpable among the Dutch, though it took several years and three attempts, led by two brave journalists Frank Westerman and Bart Reiss, to force the government to resign. The Holocaust is central to the history and psyche of modern Europe, yet is not regarded so centrally in other parts of the world, even among historians. It is central to the national narrative and very existence of the state of Israel, yet a point of discussion and dispute in the Arab world \u2013 though few there go the absurd lengths of denial of President Ahmadinejad of Iran and his mouthpieces, such as PressTV, the online broadcaster with a growing audience in Britain and Europe. This is where the fighting in Gaza comes in. The Israelis have the imperative of the narrative of the Holocaust for the right of their community and state to exist. The Palestinians have their narrative of expulsion and exile from lands for which they had title deeds under the Ottoman empire, and places as sacred to Islam as to Judaism and Christianity. Gaza is a battle between two peoples and two narratives, and the firepower of one side cannot hope to obliterate the deep memory and longing for return and redemption of the other.  In the weeks before the BBC screened The Diary of Anne Frank, Rotterdam followed her famous exhortation for human understanding, and elected its first immigrant mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, a well-known journalist who is son of a Moroccan prayer-leader. He has been elected in the city where Pym Fortuyn campaigned on a cocktail of rabid anti-immigrant slogans, trading on the fear that native Dutch are in the minority in the inner cities of several major municipalities including Rotterdam and Amsterdam.  Like Job Cohen, the Jewish mayor of Amsterdam, Aboutaleb works tirelessly on inter-community and inter-faith projects. In his first major post-election international interview in the Observer this weekend, he stated, &quot;My job is to build bridges and Rotterdam is a good place to do that. This is the city of big projects where the sky is the limit, but also a city with high levels of poverty. My job is to be mayor for everyone from the businessmen to the kid from Surinam just trying to earn a living.&quot;", "sentences": ["My wife, who was born near Amsterdam in the war, said the lighting and sets caught the time and the place brilliantly.", "Neither the drama nor the excellent documentary narrated by Kenneth Branagh that accompanied it, and which won an Oscar two years ago, went deeply into the question of who betrayed the Franks to the Nazi powers in Amsterdam.", "And when the round-ups started, most people living in and around Amsterdam knew what was going on.", "Then on 19 October, Thursday, she writes &quot;walked through Amsterdam, through the Jewish quarter where all the houses are empty, every window shattered, really spooky.&quot; The sense of betrayal in a different national context is brilliantly explored in Alexander Stille&apos;s book, Benevolence and Betrayal, about five prominent Jewish families in Turin under fascism.", "Curiously it is overlooked by Ian Buruma, in his otherwise excellent book, Murder in Amsterdam, about the murder of Theo van Gogh by a Moroccan Islamist and of the populist anti-immigrant politician Pim Fortuyn, and the anti-Islamic protest of Ayaan Hirsi Ali.", "He has been elected in the city where Pym Fortuyn campaigned on a cocktail of rabid anti-immigrant slogans, trading on the fear that native Dutch are in the minority in the inner cities of several major municipalities including Rotterdam and Amsterdam.", "Like Job Cohen, the Jewish mayor of Amsterdam, Aboutaleb works tirelessly on inter-community and inter-faith projects."], "title": "Robert Fox: Rotterdam has its first immigrant mayor.

One of them put it very starkly to me yesterday. &quot;Our problem on Heathrow,&quot; he said, &quot;is that the policy is going in one direction and the politics are going in the opposite one.&quot; As political problems go, this is one of the most timeless of all. Since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, rulers have striven and failed to reconcile the reality that what is good for the state is not necessarily synonymous with what the people want. So I don&apos;t think I am going out on a limb to say that Geoff Hoon, the transport secretary, has failed to find the answer to a problem that not even Plato managed to crack. Ed Miliband has probably read Plato in the original Greek. The energy and climate change secretary was right to say yesterday that the important principle at the heart of the Heathrow decision was that it rejects both the puritanism of the anti-flying absolutists and the decadence of the unconstrained aviation expansionists. I&apos;m sure that in his mind there is a platonic ideal airport, providing fast efficient travel to all points of the nation and the globe, with prosperity, aspiration and reduced emissions all balanced in perfect harmony. The problem is that this airport is not called Heathrow. Hoon and Miliband have to face three big difficulties. The first is that not every compromise between the two extremes of wholly constrained and wholly unconstrained aviation is as good as every other compromise - it is the content of the deal that matters. The second is that Heathrow is a particularly problematic airport and not just a representative of airport problems in general. And the third is that Heathrow has become a symbol for one of the great causes of the century - and Labour is on the wrong side of it. No government in its right mind is ever going to stop people from flying. But the Heathrow decision was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to say something very big, very brave and very difficult about the fact that the permissive proliferation of aviation is not merely a symptom of what Desmond Morris has called the human infestation of the planet but also, at least as seriously, about the damage our lifestyles and consumption are doing both to ourselves as individuals and to the biosphere. Yesterday&apos;s decision ducked that opportunity. I am all for compromise; however, the Heathrow announcement seems less an embodiment of Labour&apos;s pragmatic readiness to make tough compromises, which was how Hoon depicted it, than an embodiment of its almost congenital inability, when backed into a corner, to make decisive right choices on really difficult issues and then to build political alliances to ensure they are supported, implemented and understood. Faced with the question of whether, as Theresa Villiers put it, to graft an airport the size of a second Gatwick on to the chaotic Heathrow airport mini-city already wedged among the west London suburbs, Hoon and Miliband have come up with a bit of everything and a fair helping of nothing. A third runway, but not a more efficient &quot;mixed-mode&quot; throughput on the existing two. A sixth terminal, with new roads and rail links to connect it to the other five and to London. More use of motorway hard shoulders to (supposedly) speed drivers and buses in and out of the vast site. A new high-speed train network to connect Heathrow to Birmingham (one day) but not Manchester or Leeds. Timing may not quite be everything in politics, but it is certainly a lot more important than almost any other factor you can name. When a government is on the crest of a political wave of goodwill in an era of prosperity, as Labour was for so long, it can sometimes take a hard decision and get away with it. When a government is in the depths of a political trough and times are hard, however, there is only one consequence of doing something the public don&apos;t want. Government just gets even more unpopular than it was already. Political logic says this is what will happen to Labour as a result of the Heathrow decision. When the only genuinely spontaneous applause for the package comes from the business class who travel in the plane and from the working class employed to keep them flying, the reality is that what might once have been an opportunity for agenda-setting has now become an exercise in damage limitation. Most people simply don&apos;t care if more flights go from Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Paris rather than London. Most people in west London would be delighted. The opposition parties sense the local mood but otherwise they do not give much of a lead. If Heathrow expansion ever came to a vote in parliament, which it clearly ought to do by any democratic yardstick, then it would go down by a large majority. If Labour is ousted in the election, moreover, the whole thing will be scrapped anyway. But what would a Tory government do then? Heathrow could and should surely have been addressed years ago. It&apos;s not as if there wasn&apos;t the money, or the issues have burst upon us unexpectedly. Almost everyone in the country knows that Heathrow is a shambolic mess, and that it has to bear too much weight for an airport in the heart of the overcrowded southeast. Likewise, everyone has long been aware that our roads are as inferior to Germany&apos;s as our railways are to those of France. The environmental issues have been as clear to see for years as the bubble of credit was in the financial world. Yet in both cases the same charge applies - ministers knew that something needed to be done but were either too confused or too afraid to do it. This week we read of the death of the actor Patrick McGoohan. To anyone who saw him in The Prisoner, the debonair McGoohan is forever identified as Number Six, the former secret agent who spends his life trying to escape from an apparently ordered community that is in reality a prison - a sort of Heathrow departure lounge without the planes. Many members of the Labour government sometimes strike me as people who inhabit a similarly benign but repressive community at Westminster. Like Number Six, many of them really want to break free and do the right thing. Like The Prisoner, they never quite manage to do it. Maybe that is because, like him, they are too often their own jailers. martin.kettle@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["Most people simply don&apos;t care if more flights go from Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Paris rather than London."], "title": "Martin Kettle: Runway 3 will be a shrine to Labour's congenital frailty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/16/heathrow-runway-labour-hoon-miliband", "tags": ["Heathrow third runway", "Travel and transport", "Climate change", "Transport policy", "Labour", "Politics", "Environment", "Green politics", "Planning policy", "Transport", "UK news", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-16T11:47:14Z", "article": "&quot;I was down at the New Amsterdam, starin&apos; at this yellow-haired girl...&quot; My cocktail of feelings as I stood in the crowded Las Vegas nightclub on Friday of last week was hard to break down. Perhaps one part deja-vu, to one part heartbreakingly nostalgic, to one part trapped, to two parts what in the name of sweet Jesus am I doing here? &quot;Mr Jones strikes up a conversation with a black-haired flamenco dancer.&quot; Deja vu, certainly. It was, after all, the second time in a month that I&apos;d heard someone singing a live rendition of Mr Jones by the Counting Crows. The first time, regular readers of this column may recall, was in Reykjavik just before Christmas when, after a night out on the Brenniv\u00ccn, Brian Suda and I convinced an Icelandic reality show contestant to add the song to his scheduled set list of heavy metal covers. The results were predictably, but somehow delightfully, weird.  &quot;You know, she dances while his father plays guitar...&quot;  As for the heartbreaking nostalgia, I forgot to mention last time that the Counting Crows were \u2013 probably still are \u2013 the favourite band of a particular ex-girlfriend of mine. An ex-girlfriend who frequently made it clear during our relationship that if the band&apos;s lead singer was to so much as glance at her, she would dump me like a hot shit-covered potato and retire with all haste to his hotel room for the rest of her life. The relationship ended epically badly even by my standards of epic badness, to the point where \u2013 unless I&apos;m off my face drunk in Iceland \u2013 the merest note of one of their songs is enough to make me want to throw myself off a bridge.  &quot;...and so, she&apos;s suddenly beautiful....&quot; And I was certainly trapped. Whereas in Iceland I was standing at the back of a bar, this time I was right at the front, pressed hard against the low stage and unable to move in any direction. The room was full to bursting point and I was wedged in so tightly that escape was impossible. And as if all that wasn&apos;t weird enough, on this occasion, rather than being serenaded by a bald Icelander, the person doing the singing \u2013 standing right on the edge of the stage, not two feet in front of me \u2013 was Adam Duritz, the lead singer of the Counting Crows. My one-time cooler, richer, more talented nemesis himself.  Which just leaves the question of what in the name of sweet Jesus I was doing there? I&apos;d flown into Vegas from San Francisco the previous day, ostensibly to find out what the buzz was at this year&apos;s Consumer Electronics Show but really in the hope of topping my epic Vegas trip last year when Michael Smith and I managed to crash a party filled with 800 toga-wearing hairdressers. Given that the conference overlapped with the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, my hopes for decadence were high.  Not wanting to waste any party time, and mindful of the fact that I didn&apos;t actually have a conference pass, I had come up with a brilliant plan. Rather than actually spending hours trudging around the exhibitor booths, attending press conferences or watching the keynote presentations, I would instead simply hit up a few of the after-parties and ask other attendees what the big exciting news was. The wisdom of the crowds, right? Luckily, I&apos;d flown in from San Francisco on the same plane as Sarah Lacy who&apos;d invited me to a party she was co-hosting that night along with Frank Gruber, Brian Solis and Zappos. With about 700 people on the guestlist \u2013 mostly web industry folks \u2013 I figured I&apos;d easily find people who could pass on the main conference buzz, leaving me two whole days and nights to party without worrying about work. Unfortunately, what I had failed to take in to account is that CES is a gadget conference and not a web conference and so almost none of the web folks in the room had bothered to make it down to the convention centre. In fact, CES is so not a web conference that I overheard one of the guys from Twitter complaining that he&apos;d found it difficult to register because wasn&apos;t even a tick-box on the registration form that described his industry sector. With no CES insight in sight, there was nothing else to do but close my notebook for the night and focus on the partying. Partying which ended at the Palazzo at about 2am with three ice buckets full of champagne and the amazing sight of a couple of dozen geeks rocking out to M.I.A surrounded by a gaggle of bemused Vegas party girls. By night two, I was starting to get twitchy. I still had no idea what was going on at the conference and I was rapidly running out of decadence time. According to the buzz on Twitter, there was only one party worth going to that night, and once again it was sponsored by Intel. Held at the Luxor&apos;s LAX nightclub, the party would bring together thousands of CES attendees \u2013 almost none of them web folk. Finding stories from inside the convention centre would be a piece of cake. My only problem \u2013 aside from learning that the guest stars were my ex-girlfriend&apos;s favourite band \u2013 was how to get inside.  The party was due to start at 7.30 and by 7.15 I was almost out of ideas. Despite spending the day emailing every contact I knew who might be able to help, an entry wristband remained as elusive as a Wi-Fi connection at a French web conference. Dejected, I slumped down at one of the Luxor&apos;s many bars, ordered myself a rum and Coke, and started tapping out a few final desperate emails on my BlackBerry. 7.30 came, then 7.45 ... still no replies. It was hopeless. I was beaten. And then as if by magic... &quot;Hey!&quot;  It was Sarah. &quot;Oh, hi&quot; I mumbled, &quot;what you up to?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m just on my way to dinner, you?&quot;&quot;Trying to work out how to crash the Intel party.&quot;&quot;Are you kidding? The Counting Crows one? Why would anyone want to see the Counting Crows?&quot; &quot;Actually, they were my ex-girlfriend&apos;s ... never mind.&quot;&quot;Well, you can have my wristband if you like.&quot; She reached into her purse and pulled out a neatly folded strip of paper. I could have hugged her \u2013 but that would have wasted valuable seconds. It was almost eight o&apos;clock and the Counting Crows were due on stage at nine \u2013 I only had an hour of mingling time left. There was no time to lose.  Fast forward half an hour and my work was done. With a single lap of the crowded club, I&apos;d spoken to half a dozen of the attendees and had scribbled a list in my notebook under the heading &quot;everything you need to know about CES 09&quot;. Here, verbatim, is the list... \u2022 The conference feels pretty busy, but only because most stands were booked a year ago. In reality, most companies have only sent key staff to Vegas rather than entire teams. Everyone worried about their jobs. \u2022 Wireless electricity based on beaming heat across the room is super cool (no pun intended) but nowhere near ready to be unleashed on the public. \u2022 Microsoft really screwed up the Windows 7 beta launch. \u2022 If you like cool televisions, CES will make you shit yourself. \u2022 Palm Pre \u2022 PALM PRE \u2022 PALM PRE!!!  Ah yes, the Palm Pre Smartphone. The conference highlight that everyone \u2013 absolutely everyone \u2013 wanted to talk about. Apart from being a beautiful thing to behold, combining the multimedia possibilities of the iPhone with the not-having-a-fucking-annoying-virtual-keyboardiness of the BlackBerry, it also boasts the WebOS operating system. In short, WebOS makes developing applications for the device as easy as building a website. Between the aesthetics of the device and the openness of the platform, even iPhone owners I spoke to were considering trading up. If you can make Apple fans think about switching platforms, you know you&apos;ve created something amazing. And so that was that \u2013 in just half an hour my entire week&apos;s work was done, leaving the whole of the next day and night free for fun. I headed for the door. And I almost made it. Unfortunately, just as I was passing the stage, I ran into Frank Gruber, Sarah&apos;s party co-host. The room had really started to fill up in anticipation of the Counting Crows, so Frank was saving himself a spot right at the front of the stage. Given that he&apos;d been jointly responsible for ensuring I could drink for free all of the previous night, I figured the least I could do was to go to the bar and get him a drink. By the time I&apos;d made it back, forcing my way through the crowd with the drink held above my head, the club had filled to capacity. And no sooner had I arrived, than the stage lit up and the whole crowd surged forward, pinning me to my spot.  &quot;Sha la la la la la la la.&quot; But still, as the Counting Crows worked their way through a set-list consisting almost entirely of my ex&apos;s favourite songs, each of them sung straight into my face by the man she&apos;d have left me for in a heartbeat, I couldn&apos;t help but smile. I still had a whole 24 hours still left in Vegas \u2013 24 hours which, as it turned out, may or may not have involved a weird party full of porn stars and geeks, a dive bar where the specialty of the house was &quot;Ass Juice&quot;, a huge crowd of angry punks and a whole load of thrown bottles and chairs.  Those 24 hours would make one hell of a story, but you know what they say: what happens in Vegas ... ... I&apos;m saving for my next book. \u2022 Paul Carr is author of Bringing Nothing To The Party: True Confessions of a New Media Whore.

A visit to Petra, above, is on offer by the cruise company which would cost about \u00a3500 for each of us, including a night at a hotel in Petra. However, I know that other travel agencies offer full day visits to Petra for as little as \u00a365 per person. We are not interested in an overnight stay and wonder what our best option is?Owen Thomas, Chester A It&apos;s always worth comparing what&apos;s included in these kinds of tours, as cheaper isn&apos;t always better. You may find, for example, that one has a particularly impressive guide accompanying the visit that would make it worthwhile. However, in this case, I&apos;d advise making your own arrangements. The best option for a DIY trip, especially as there are two of you, is to hire a private taxi for the day. This is better value and less fuss than driving yourself. You can expect to pay around \u00a350 return for the two-hour journey. Taxis will be waiting outside the entrance to the cruise terminal, but they are unmetered so make sure you agree a price before you go anywhere. Finding your way around Petra isn&apos;t hard with a map, but an official guide from about \u00a320 will help you get more out of your visit. You can hire one from the visitors&apos; centre. The site is large and will take a full day to explore - bring walking shoes, water and protection from the sun. There&apos;s good information about Petra at www.go2petra.com.

Skiing in Andalucia can be great though - the Sierra Nevada resort (www.cetursa.es), 30 minutes&apos; drive from Granada, has 23 lifts and a top lift that rises to a very creditable 3,300m. Conditions are currently excellent, with 350cm of snow at the top, though you should check them before arranging a trip.  The Ski Club of Great Britain website, www.skiclub.co.uk, has details. Crystal Ski (0871 231 5659; www.crystalski.co.uk) has packages to the Sierra Nevada and Ryanair flies to Granada from Stansted, East Midlands and Liverpool. There&apos;s also great skiing in the Spanish Pyrenees, the best resort being Baqueira Beret (www.baqueira.es), to which Crystal and Ski Miquel (01457 821200; www.miquelhols.co.uk) run packages.  Q My husband and I are planning a trip to Cornwall or Devon in May. We can only be away for five days including travel to and from our home in Bedford. We would like to stay in reasonably nice B&amp;Bs , and we&apos;re keen to do a fair bit of walking and exploring. Could you suggest an itinerary? Wendy Gregory, Bedford A With five days including two long drives you&apos;re probably looking at no more than two destinations to avoid spending too much more time behind the wheel. My favourite part of the southwest is the South Hams coast around Dartmouth and Start Bay. There is fantastic walking and beaches, and the art deco house and sloping gardens at Coleton Fishacre to explore. Valley House (01803 834045; www.valleyhousedartmouth.com) is a centrally located B&amp;B in Dartmouth for \u00a330-40 per person. For another couple of days I&apos;d continue down the south coast into Cornwall and stay at Fowey, a seaside village with hiking trails radiating out to quiet beaches. Fowey Marine Guest House (01726 833920; www.foweymarine.com) occupies a good spot on the harbour for \u00a330-35 per person. South West Tourism (0870 442 0880; www.visitsouthwest.co.uk) has plenty more information. Q We get conflicting advice about car insurance when visiting the north of Cyprus from the south. What is your view?George Inman, Kimblesworth A If you take your hire car from the south of Cyprus to the north, you will not be covered by the car hire insurance agreement. It is possible to purchase third-party insurance at the border for \u20ac25, which covers you for up to \u20ac3,000 provided you are not responsible for the accident.  Cars hired in the north, however, cannot currently be taken into the south. If you hire a car in the north you can pay a collision damage waiver, but if you bring a car from the south you cannot do this. The North Cyprus Tourism Centre (020 7631 1930; www.northcyprus.cc) can help with further questions. Feedback Describing Schiphol as &quot;Europe&apos;s fifth largest airport&quot; (Letters, last week) surely gives a wrong impression. The emphasis upon size overlooks its advantages - easy pedestrian movement, plenty of seating and food outlets. To use the Cityhopper from Cardiff and make an easy, well informed/displayed change in Amsterdam must be better than travelling to London from Cardiff (by whatever means) and then having to cope with the confusions of Heathrow.Gerry Hones, Weston In addition to the response you gave on having credit cards arbitrarily blocked while in use abroad, I would like to add this warning. My husband spends the winter months in India, and despite telling HSBC his dates of travel, he was prevented from using his credit card in a department store, suffering embarassment and considerable inconvenience. When I phoned to get this rectified, I was assured it had been done. It had not. Moreover, be warned that the secondary card holder cannot access the account to get it unblocked unless they have previously taken out a third-party mandate. This too is fraught with problems, as many of the call centre operators seem unable to &quot;see&quot; that mandate on screen.  It took us months to get our card problems sorted, despite the best efforts of our branch. We received a lovely hamper from HSBC, and a direct number to ring in future, but I have lost all faith in the system.

The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, has condemned Israeli attacks on UN humanitarian centres in Gaza as &quot;outrageous&quot; and has called for an independent, international inquiry.  Meanwhile a senior minister in the Israeli government has been quoted in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as saying that when the full extent of the destruction brought on Gaza becomes known &quot;I will not be taking my holidays in Amsterdam&quot;. This possibly &quot;humorous&quot; observation referred to the possibility that leaders of the Israeli government may yet be arraigned before the International Criminal Court in The Hague \u2013 or a similar tribunal - to answer charges of war crimes. Indeed some 300 human rights organisations have already prepared an initial 37-page dossier to be presented to the court. At the same time, in a move which could be equally damaging to the international standing of the Israeli government, a number of United Nations humanitarian agencies have insisted that there must be an independent, internationally approved, legal inquiry into the prima facie evidence of crimes committed. It is clear now that Israeli shelling and missile attacks \u2013 including those on UN facilities used as shelters for civilians during the war \u2013 have taken many hundreds of innocent civilian lives.  There is one obvious problem with taking steps to ensure that those responsible for the horrific massacres of civilians in Gaza are held accountable for their actions: Israel is not a member state of the ICC. The initial reaction of the ICC has been that it is therefore not open to the court to examine these charges. According to some senior French jurists, however, it should still be possible for the ICC to pursue named individuals for alleged crimes committed in Gaza. There is also a precedent for the ICC to be asked by the United Nations to conduct such a trial \u2013 namely the current hearings into crimes against humanity allegedly committed by forces under the control of the government of Sudan in Darfur. It may be possible for the UN to establish a specific war crimes tribunal to hear the charges arising out of the actions of the Israeli forces in Gaza. After all, something very similar happened after the atrocities committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the Rwanda genocide.  The Israeli government has denied that it was responsible for any war crimes committed during the course of its three-week campaign in Gaza. Interestingly, however, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert has expressed &quot;remorse&quot; for what happened to the civilian population of Gaza. One obvious question is: what does he feel guilty about? Some Israelis may also argue that Hamas has also committed crimes worthy of international condemnation. But, of course, it open to them to present such a legal dossier to the ICC authorities in the Netherlands. Obviously, a UN mandate for a legal inquiry into alleged Israeli war crimes would only come about if the Obama administration decides not to use its veto in the UN Security Council. But by allowing a legal investigation to proceed, the US would send the clearest possible signal that it intends to exercise far greater even-handedness between Israel and the Palestinians than it has ever done in the past. Moreover, the incoming administration is under growing pressure to sanction an inquiry into possible criminal action by the Bush administration in its use of torture. No doubt, the British government, among others, will say that the priority of the international community must be to underpin the current ceasefire with a permanent peace agreement which provides for a two-state solution. But there is no reason why the push for a permanent agreement should exclude the rule of law from operating without inhibition. After all, this was the case in the former Yugoslavia. According to Israeli opinion polls, the present coalition government is heading for defeat in the general election in three weeks&apos; time. The responsibility for negotiating a permanent peace settlement is likely to fall to an even more right-wing government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu. That said, an inspiring feature of the feature of the worldwide demonstrations against Israel&apos;s Gaza offensive has been the prominent role played by Jews and Jewish organisations in the protests. Organisations like Jews for Justice for Palestinians, along with a small but heroic opposition to the massacres in Israel itself.

Traditionally a highly tolerant society, attitude towards its large Muslim immigrant population hardened after the 2004 murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a radical Dutch Muslim. Wilders, whose party has nine MPs, has largely built his popularity on the fear and resentment among many Dutch voters towards immigrants. Wilders provoked widespread outrage in March 2008 with his film Fitna and its portrayal of the Qur&apos;an as a manifesto for violence. The film interspersed images of the September 11 attacks with quotations from the Muslim holy book. In 2007, Wilders called for the Qur&apos;an to banned and likened it Adolf Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf. Today, the appeals court called Wilders&apos; film, newspaper articles and media interviews &quot;one-sided generalisations which can amount to inciting hatred&quot;. It reversed a decision last year by the public prosecutor&apos;s office , which said Wilders&apos; film and interviews were painful for Muslims but not criminal. Wilders told Dutch media it was a &quot;black day for myself and for freedom of speech&quot;. The court&apos;s three judges said they had weighed Wilders&apos; anti-Islamic rhetoric against his right to free speech, and ruled he had gone beyond the normal leeway given to politicians. While judges in the Netherlands are generally liberal, the court said it was making an exception in the case of Wilders&apos; comments about Islam. &quot;The court considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders,&quot; a summary of the court&apos;s decision said. It said the Wilders statements were &quot;so insulting for Muslims that it is in the public interest to prosecute&quot;. Gerard Spong, a prominent lawyer who joined Muslim groups in pushing for Wilders&apos; prosecution, welcomed the decision. &quot;This is a happy day for all followers of Islam who do not want to be tossed on the garbage dump of Nazism,&quot; Spong told reporters in Amsterdam. Wilder has not yet been charged, and it is not clear what maximum penalty he could face if convicted. &quot;I&apos;ve had enough of Islam in the Netherlands; let not one more Muslim immigrate,&quot; he wrote in national newspaper De Volkskrant. &quot;I&apos;ve had enough of the Qur&apos;an in the Netherlands: forbid that fascist book.&quot;", "sentences": ["A Dutch MP who made a provocative anti-Islam film and branded the Qur&apos;an a &quot;fascist book&quot; is to be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred, Amsterdam&apos;s appeals court ruled today The decision against Geert Wilders, the populist leader of the rightwing Freedom party, sets the stage for a high-profile trial likely to expose changing attitudes towards Islam in the Netherlands.", "&quot;This is a happy day for all followers of Islam who do not want to be tossed on the garbage dump of Nazism,&quot; Spong told reporters in Amsterdam."], "title": "Dutch court orders anti-Islam MP to face race hatred prosecution", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/21/dutch-islam-race-hatred-prosecution", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Islam", "World news", "Geert Wilders", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-23T00:05:02Z", "article": "There is a large colourful chessboard in the corner of Charles Clarke&apos;s office, given to him in the dog days of the 70s when he wound up his stint as president of the National Union of Students. On one side a pawn has the give-away eyebrows of Denis Healey, and on another a flame-haired character is depicted climbing out of a castle: Barbara Castle. Caricatures of Ted Heath, Enoch Powell and Reginald Maudling all line up to do battle on the other side. But the board is no longer used. According to the recent writings of Clarke, former home secretary and most recently Brown&apos;s most outspoken opponent in the Labour party, this chessboard is a museum piece and we now stand looking down at it as if it has been dug out of the ground. These days Clarke plays chess on his iPhone. The board is representative of another time. &quot;1979, 1980 \u2013 this is another era now. It lasted 30 years.&quot; One which Tony Blair and Bill Clinton merely &quot;adapted&quot;, he says. &quot;Thirty years,&quot; he repeats for emphasis. Clarke thinks, as many in his party do, that the economic collapse of 2009 has done for markets what the winter of discontent did for the state in 1979. The Labour prime minister of the day, James Callaghan, called that year&apos;s election wrong, delaying when many expected him to go to the country in the autumn of 1978. If Clarke had his way it would be out of Gordon Brown&apos;s hands all together. Fixed term parliaments are the answer. &quot;The constant speculation \u2013 not Gordon&apos;s fault in any way \u2013 about the election date, is very, very undermining and I think if one can be in a position of saying, &apos;right that&apos;s when it&apos;s going to be and that&apos;s the basis on which we&apos;re operating and we&apos;re confident of our economic policies&apos; \u2013 that&apos;s a much stronger basis for us to operate \u2026 rather than a sense of will he, won&apos;t he.&quot; In a letter to the Guardian last week, Clarke said Brown should settle on 6 May 2010, or similar, and make it public. Instead of a PM choosing an election date and then being accused of jiggery-pokery, Clarke suggests election timing should be as independently decided as the Bank of England sets interest rates. But what if \u2013 and stranger things have happened \u2013 Labour has drawn level with the Tories by this May. If Brown followed Clarke&apos;s advice, he would be unable to move quickly to take advantage of the bounce. &quot;I am a sceptic,&quot; Clarke says. &quot;I&apos;ve been through a lot of election campaigns \u2013 the three to four weeks of the election campaign \u2013 a lot changes \u2013 and I don&apos;t think anyone should assume that because the polls at the beginning of the campaign are X it will be the same at the end. Not just because of the campaign but because of the imminence of the campaign itself: people change their views. &quot;In fairly stable times, what you often find is that the position at the start of the campaign is the same as at the end of the campaign, and that would have been true of most of the elections of the last 20 years I would say. Where you&apos;ve got a very changing situation, that&apos;s not the case and I certainly wouldn&apos;t stake the political fortune of Labour on the particular opinion polls that come at the end of one particular month.&quot; If the moniker &quot;Blairite&quot; is lazy shorthand for a cast of characters on the margins, it&apos;s Clarke himself who defines the group of emeritus Labour politicians himself. But whereas Brown has made his peace with many of those Blairites \u2014 most spectacularly Peter Mandelson, and most recently Alan Milburn (appointed to head an inquiry on social mobility), relations between the prime minister and Clarke have been cool. In the run-up to the handover of power between Blair and Brown, Clarke was one of only a tenth of the Labour party not to back Brown for the post and he spent the next year criticising the prime minister with all his force. But today Clarke is conciliatory to the point of being counterfactual. &quot;I don&apos;t think Gordon is a man who harbours resentments, particularly ... That has never been the issue with him. The issue has been what he thinks about things gets very over-personalised. But our disagreements were always [over] policy \u2013 right through \u2013 when I was doing tuition fees. And that was also the source of the arguments he had with Alan Milburn. Stephen Byers, Peter Mandelson and so on.&quot; We know Clarke was offered something like governor-general of Basra and also an envoy role on foreign criminals. It was Downing Street&apos;s failure to get back to Clarke with a proper definition of this last job that was said by friends to have been the trigger for Clarke&apos;s more personal attacks on the PM. Today Clarke is rather a coiled spring. &quot;I&apos;m up for it&quot;; &quot;I&apos;ve never said that I would never return.&quot; The pair do have previous. When Brown was chancellor and needed to see another minister, that minister would normally visit the Treasury but at one point in the late 1990s, Team Brown tugged their forelock to Clarke&apos;s stature and turned up at what was then the Department for Education. Clarke kept Brown waiting for half an hour. Another former ministerial colleague of Clarke&apos;s questions whether Brown could have Mandelson and Clarke in the same cabinet, asking rhetorically why it took Blair two years before he gave Clarke a ministerial job. The answer they say is Mandelson. At some time in late 90s, Clarke is supposed to have careered past said friend&apos;s desk late at night with bottle of red wine in hand and asked: &quot;Do you think Mandelson will ever like me?&quot; Today Clarke hints at this when asked to evaluate the import of Mandelson&apos;s return. &quot;Personally [I think it&apos;s] much less significant than most people think. There are great pros and cons of Peter coming back. He&apos;s very experienced, he knows the situation, he was a very good minister. He has tremendous experience having been the European commissioner for world trade. So all of that is on the positive side. On the negative side: potential rivalries which can be engendered, potential tension that can be established. But he&apos;s working very hard to overcome that.&quot; As for Milburn, Clarke says: &quot;Alan has been very clear for a series of really very radical approaches \u2013 whether it is the Swedish model in education or whether it is some kind of voucher-based system in other areas. I will be surprised if what he thinks is not controversial.&quot; Green issues have become the number one priority for Clarke, possibly partially explained by the threat posed to his seat by the Green party in his constituency. He says neither Blair nor Brown are &quot;serious&quot; enough about green issues. Prime minister Clarke would not have backed a third runway for Heathrow. &quot;I haven&apos;t made the necessary study of the economic case for it in the way its supporters have, but I&apos;m a deep, deep sceptic. I certainly don&apos;t think Heathrow serves the country. It doesn&apos;t, for example, serve my part of the country in Norfolk, where everybody goes to [Amsterdam&apos;s airport] Schiphol from Norwich.&quot; Clarke still believes there is a case for fees to be introduced within the NHS, plus higher fees in road tolls and university fees. And as for the attempt by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to push ahead with a bill of rights? &quot;It&apos;s nonsense,&quot; Clarke says. &quot;We have a bill of rights \u2013 it is the European convention on human rights as incorporated in British law by the Human Rights Act. If you try and write another bill of rights I think that is confusing and misleading and makes law not cooperate effectively. There is a case for revising the European convention that was signed in 1950, there are some serious issues about the way the world has evolved since then \u2013 which need to be addressed \u2014 but I don&apos;t see how a bill of rights comes within that at all.&quot; Would the so-called TB-GBs have been ruinous if the economic downturn happened say, five years earlier with Blair still PM and Brown chancellor? &quot;On the issue of a stimulus, I would be very surprised if they were in different places. There were a lot of issues where that was true \u2014 but on this issue their fundamental position would have been the same.&quot; But he couples that with effusive praise. &quot;His is an historic role,&quot; Clarke says of the PM today. &quot;I don&apos;t think it was obvious to do what he did \u2013 many would have flinched \u2013 he was courageous to do what he did, from the outset.&quot;", "sentences": ["It doesn&apos;t, for example, serve my part of the country in Norfolk, where everybody goes to [Amsterdam&apos;s airport] Schiphol from Norwich.&quot; Clarke still believes there is a case for fees to be introduced within the NHS, plus higher fees in road tolls and university fees."], "title": "Clarke feeling conciliatory after end of an era", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/22/charles-clarke", "tags": ["Labour", "Economic policy", "Gordon Brown", "Politics", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-01-24T00:01:00Z", "article": "Locating a man you&apos;ve never met in an unknown apartment heaving with strangers sounds like a challenge, yet it takes me less than 10 seconds to spot Jim Haynes.

I arrive expecting an informal dinner party, with a small group seated around a table, but instead I find the place packed with more than 70 attendees. &quot;I&apos;m so glad you made it,&quot; says Jim, with genuine enthusiasm, after I make my way through the crowds to introduce myself. &quot;You needn&apos;t have brought anything,&quot; he adds, eyeing the bottle of wine in my hand.  I discover teetotal Jim, 75, always provides not just food at his weekly gatherings, but also all the drinks - boxed wine, bottled beer and soft drinks. Profits from donations go to various artistic and social projects. Tonight&apos;s Indian theme sees mountains of chicken curry, dhal, raita and rice being dished out of huge vats, and it&apos;s surprisingly good considering the numbers they&apos;re catering for. Each week, Jim invites a guest chef, and their success has even inspired a cookbook on group catering, Throw a Great Party: Inspired by Evenings in Paris with Jim Haynes (iUniverse, \u00a39). Guests step up to the hob to be served, then find a place to perch - either on one of the chairs laid out in the garden or on a sofa underneath walls crowded with souvenirs and photos. I&apos;m amazed by how approachable everyone is, whether they&apos;re a first-timer, like me, or one of the core of regulars. Here &quot;working the room&quot; involves no actual work, it seems to happen effortlessly.  Guests&apos; ages range from 20 to 80. I meet artists and scientists, locals and expats. Antonia, a British expat and tonight&apos;s guest chef, introduces me to a young filmmaker from Guadeloupe; an American pianist invites me to one of his recitals; and a local called Michael insists that next time I visit I attend his own open-house dinners, held every Saturday evening near Notre Dame (see meetup.com/TalkTime). Everyone here seems to have a story to tell. But could any surpass Jim&apos;s? Born in Louisiana, he spent his teens in Venezuela, followed by long stints in Edinburgh, London and Amsterdam before finally settling in Paris. I discovered he started an experimental theatre in Edinburgh, co-founded a magazine celebrating sexual freedom in 1960s Amsterdam, and has been called the &quot;godfather of social networking&quot; following his 1980s series of self-published People-to-People guides, which listed addresses of local people willing to help or host travellers. It seems Jim was setting the hospitality-tourism trend 20 years before the birth of CouchSurfing.  With all this in mind, I expected some bolshie extrovert, holding court in the centre of the room. But Jim is the opposite: softly spoken and unassuming, possessing an interesting mix of unshockable worldliness and an appreciation of the simple things in life. (&quot;I&apos;ve just had a lovely lemon tart,&quot; he writes in an email to me before we meet.)  &quot;These nights began by accident,&quot; he tells me later, as guests begin to disperse (a typical Sunday night dinner runs from 8pm sharp until 11pm). In the mid 70s, a young American dancer knocked on his door and nervously explained that she had just arrived in the city. A friend had suggested Jim as a good person for any newcomer to know. It was quite an understatement. Jim immediately offered his spare room, and she offered to return the favour by cooking for him and his friends every week. Before long, these nights became legendary. An estimated 120,000 have dined chez Jim over the years, sparking countless friendships and even weddings. He tells me how he once introduced female twins from Suriname to two brothers from Edinburgh, and both sets ended up marrying. &quot;Sunday dinners: an ongoing story&quot; reads his website.

It certainly isn&apos;t an obvious choice for a wild weekend away. And that is, of course, what makes it cool. Nobody you know has a story about sicking up in a coffee shop in Brussels. None of your friends has marked their territory in its quirky restaurants or neighbourhood bars. Going to Paris or Amsterdam can be like taking a 3D tour of a million stories you&apos;ve heard before. Brussels, on the other hand, is underexposed enough that you can make it your own. My best advice for exploring Brussels is to pick up a transport map and wander. An efficient metro circles the city, with buses and trams spidering out into the wider areas. You can easily do without a guidebook (I emailed friendly looking Bruxellois on MySpace for advice on where to go).  The streets that branch off the Bourse and the Grand Place are a great place to start. We began the day early at the excellent flea market in Place du Jeu de Balle, then headed north to explore. Highlights included Marjolaine, a gem of a junk shop (Rue de la Madeleine 7) and comic book shop Librairie Galerie Br\u00fcsel (Boulevard Anspach 100). Once we&apos;d tired ourselves out, we drank 12% beers in the art deco Walvis (Rue Antoine Dansaert 209) and stared at the wizened old locals playing cards at Au Labourer (Rue de Flandre 104). Then it was off for some jazz at L&apos;Archiduc (Rue Antoine Dansaert 6) and finally a hearty tagine at the cosy Kasbah restaurant (Rue Antoine Dansaert 20). Our B&amp;B, Chambres En Ville, was easy to find (Brussels is so compact, you&apos;d struggle to get lost), and turned out to be the perfect place to rest after pounding through the city: a big comfy bed and five types of jam in the morning.  The next day we headed for Flagey, in the heart of Ixelles just south of the centre. Flagey is pretty and quirky, with a mishmash of architecture typical of the city - the byproduct of a bonkers Belgian law that allows architects to sue for plagiarism. At its heart is the Flagey cultural centre, showing everything from old films to classical music, and lending the area a young, arty vibe. I recommend the excellent pizza at Mamma Roma (Chauss\u00e9e de Vleurgat 5), followed by a game of chess in the Pantin bar (Chauss\u00e9e d&apos;Ixelles 355). With all the drinking going on in Brussels, it&apos;s surprising to find that clubbing isn&apos;t a big thing. Superclubs such as the generic Fuse (Rue Blaesstraat 208) are rather scorned, and locals I spoke to said that they prefer to look out for parties (one-off events with DJs and live music) at quirky venues such as Mirano Dirty Dancing (Chauss\u00e9e de Louvain), a converted cinema, or Recylcart, a grubby, graffiti-covered former train station. Like all enlightened continentals, Belgians don&apos;t get going until after midnight and push on until dawn. Foodwise, make sure to try the cones of fr\u00eetes from Friteland near the Bourse. The Belgians pride themselves on their world-class double beef fat fried chips, which taste like perfectly crispy roast potatoes cut into tiny slices. But our best meal of the weekend was at the Caf\u00e9 des Spores in St Gilles. Here, the humble fungus is king and every dish contains a weird, delicious mushroom or three. We had gratin with black trompettes, moules with mushrooms and mushroom ice-cream (nicer than it sounds). It was eccentric but great - a bit like Brussels, really.

Particularly when the sports publication in question is French daily L&apos;Equipe, which is perhaps the most august organ of its kind anywhere in the world, and certainly one that couldn&apos;t be more po-faced if its emblem were the sombre visage of a red Teletubby. True, the paper did fall victim to a hoax a few years ago when it regurgitated an internet wind-up claiming that Ligue 1 outfit Lorient feared its poor home form could be down to the &quot;fact&quot; that their stadium was built on the burial ground of &quot;Micmac Indians brought from Canada by the [16th-century explorer] Jacques Cartier&quot;. But that was surely a one-off blunder and served to strengthen the journal&apos;s devotion to in-depth research and meticulous fact-checking. Right? Well, no. For the Fiver was today amused to chance upon a feature on L&apos;Equipe&apos;s website entitled &apos;Les Bad Boys du Foot Anglais&apos;. Taking $tevie Mbe&apos;s recent bother with the law as their cue, Les Diligent Boys du Hackery Francais informed their readers that &quot;in March 2008 Robbie Fowler was arrested for possession of \u00a3120,000 worth of cocaine&quot;. Unaware of any such event ever having occurred, the Fiver elected to look further into this sordid affair. And its research ended at exactly the same place, you suspect, as L&apos;Equipe&apos;s; that place being here.  So now permit the Fiver, in the gleeful tone of a schoolboy who&apos;s just caught his principal smoking behind the bike shed, to dispense some elementary lessons to our intrepid French colleagues. 1) When looking for impeccable sources for a story, think twice before turning to a website called www.thespoof.com.2) If you have not already heard raucous alarm bells, prick up your ears when said site carries quotes from a chap purporting to be Robbie Fowler&apos;s lawyer and glories in the name Mr Bob Tw@t.3) If your internal sirens are still strangely silent, ask yourself why the last line of the story was immediately followed, in bold type, by the following statement: &quot;the story above is a satire or parody. It is entirely fictitious.&quot;4) If you have ignored all of the above, feel free to shout &quot;oh merde&quot; very loudly indeed.5) Now sit back and await correspondence from Fowler&apos;s real-life lawyer. Clue: we don mean Mr Bob Tw@t. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;With our bookings we might get a few of them to miss the Cup tie&quot; - Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia hints that he might get a few of his players who are one yellow card away from a one-match ban to engineer bookings against Fulham tomorrow night so that they&apos;ll miss the FA Cup replay with Blackeye Rovers next week instead of a league match. And to think some say the romance of the Cup is dead, eh?  ********************* MULLINS KINTYRE Tony Adams has the very special quality that, when he speaks, everyone in the room stops what they are doing and listens intently in the justified expectation of receiving another pearl of wisdom from one of the great prophets of our time. At least that&apos;s the case when Adams talks to himself, or so the Fiver likes to imagine. When he addresses anyone else, there usually appears to be a mix of behind-the-sofa embarrassment and bewilderment that this man has been constructed as some sort of latter-day Romford Dickens. Yet at today&apos;s Audience With Anthony Adams, in among the sonnets, profundities and ... y&apos;knows, it was possible to discern one potentially crucial piece of information: Adams once did special exercise with Capri ... sorry, Adams has bought Hayden Mullins from West Ham. Mullins might not seem like the $exiest signing, but Adams is a man who openly admits to having wetted a few beds in his drinking years, so he knows the value of water-carrying and clean sheets. He announced the signing with grave expression of somebody who had just discovered a cure for baldness, misuse of the semi-colon and ITV&apos;s FA Cup coverage. Time will tell on those, but he may at least have found a cure for Portsmouth&apos;s run of one clean sheet in the league since he took over. They were never going to get anybody as exceptional as Lassana Diarra, but in Mullins they have a cheap, solid, cheap, Premier League-proven, cheap, screener who, lest we forget, comes cheap. And was good enough to keep the arguably peerless Javier Mascherano out of the West Ham side. &quot;It was a little bit of a shock,&quot; said Mullins of Adams&apos; stipulation that he recite every single Shakespeare play backwards while doing keepy-uppys before signing for the club. &quot;I trained on Sunday with West Ham and then it all happened very quickly, but I&apos;m very pleased to have joined.&quot; Adams cited two particular games that made Mullins stand out: West Ham&apos;s win at Portsmouth last year and their 1-0 win at the Emirates in 2006-07, when Mullins did his job so well that Robert Green only had to make 94 world-class saves. Adams also signed Portuguese Under-21 international Pele - insert your own Viagra/keep-them-up joke here - although, given that he said Pele might not play until next season, that&apos;s one with his successor in mind. He may appear to struggle badly in every other facet of management, but the Fiver reckons Adams has bought well this month, with Nadir Belhadj palpably gifted and Jermaine Pennant far too good for a relegation battle. But the concern is that, even if you gave him the silkiest of purses, Adams would still turn it into a sow&apos;s ear. And then try to bend yours about this great new author called Chaucer he&apos;s just discovered, y&apos;know? ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Newcastle United want to give Queen&apos;s Celtic skipper Stephen McManus the chance to become the latest high profile Eurodisney League player to prove he can&apos;t hack it in the Premier League. David Moyes will rescue what&apos;s left of Robbie Keane&apos;s confidence from the shredder in Raphael Benitez&apos;s office, then attempt to Sellotape all the tiny little strips back together at Goodison Park.  And having talked the talk about how sick he is of playing behind an inept defence at a club whose suits are a worldwide laughing stock, Newcastle United goalkeeper Shay Given will undermine all his good work by walking the walk to Manchester City.  ********************* NEWS IN BRIEF Arsenal and Manchester United have both been linked with Miguel Veloso, but a combination of Gary Megson&apos;s patter and the bright lights of Bolton look set to turn the \u00a313m-rated Sporting Lisbon midfielder&apos;s ponytailed head.  Having spent the best nine years of a once promising career doing little other than trousering big cheques at Chelsea, Carlo Cudicini has surged further clear of Shay Given in the race for the title of World&apos;s Least Ambitious Goalkeeper by moving to Tottenham Hotspur. Is the Pascal Chimbonda who was agitating for a move from Tottenham this time last year, saying &quot;it&apos;s all about the money. I don&apos;t care about the [Carling Cup] final, I don&apos;t care about the cup&quot; in any way related to the Pascal Chimbonda who&apos;s just re-signed for them from Sunderland? The Fiver thought Ben Watson was a 17, but it turns out he&apos;s actually 23. Whatever age he is, he&apos;s just completed his move from Crystal Palace to Wigan for \u00a32m, where he will be hazed alongside Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega, who has joined twice that amount. And Ugandan-born Germany U-19 international striker Savio Nsereko has taken the backward step of moving from Serie B promotion candiates Brescia to starting-next-season-at-the-bottom-of-League Two-with-minus-30-points West Ham. ********************* STILL WANT MORE?

McFadden hurt his left knee during Birmingham&apos;s 1-0 win over Derby County on Tuesday night. Scans have confirmed a medial ligament has been damaged. The club will seek a second opinion from a specialist but their manager, Alex McLeish, said the former Everton player could face a lengthy spell on the sidelines. &quot;The results show there is impact on the ligament,&quot; he said. &quot;He will miss four weeks anyway but probably more than that, maybe even double.&quot; If that proves the case, then Scotland&apos;s manager, George Burley, may have to do without McFadden for the vital World Cup qualifier against Holland in Amsterdam on 28 March. The Scots realistically must take at least a point from that match to keep alive hopes of reaching the 2010 finals in South Africa. McFadden has reserved much of his best form for the international scene in recent times, scoring a stunning winner against France in Paris during Scotland&apos;s last European Championship qualifying campaign. In all he has returned 13 goals from 42 appearances for his country. Meanwhile Willo Flood will be paraded as a Celtic player today after completing a medical in Glasgow.

Two days after she had won the Wimbledon junior title last year she flew to Amsterdam for a training session. &quot;A couple of people recognised me at the airport and then they made an announcement on the plane which was really embarrassing. I was sitting right at the back, and literally the whole plane turned and stared. That wasn&apos;t very fun.&quot; The young Briton reached her second junior slam final yesterday, when she defeated Noppawan Lertcheewakarn of Thailand, the top seed, 6-4, 6-3. Although there were signs of nerves at the beginning of the match Robson, struggling with both her normally dominant left-handed serve and forehand, quickly took control once she discovered her rhythm. She is getting a little more used to the attention now and happily signed autographs afterwards, though it is not so long ago that she collected them herself at Wimbledon. &quot;I think [Lleyton] Hewitt and [Kim] Clijsters signed my big ball, and [Elena] Dementieva,&quot; she added. &quot;I still have it at home.&quot; While Robson&apos;s achievement in becoming the country&apos;s first junior grand slam champion since Andy Murray won the boys&apos; US Open trophy in 2004 sprang her into the public focus, those who are nurturing her career are trying their best not to get carried away. They know the pitfalls only too well. Just one example is the Indonesian Angelique Widjaja, who defeated Dinara Safina in the 2001 Wimbledon junior final and won the girls&apos; title at the French Open the next year, but failed to make the transition to the professional world with any notable success. This week in the Australian heat, with temperatures the highest for 40 years, the experience has been something quite different for Robson, the No5 seed: &quot;At Wimbledon I was kind of like the underdog. No one expected me even to do well.&quot; Robson&apos;s talent was spotted early and she has been funded by the LTA for the past five years. She worked extensively when she was younger with Carl Maes, a former coach to Clijsters and now the LTA&apos;s head of women&apos;s tennis, and also the 1974 Wimbledon runner-up Olga Morozova, who coached Dementieva, a beaten semi-finalist in the senior event here this week. Octagon, which once had the teenaged Murray on its books, captured Robson when she was 10, and she already has a racket deal with Wilson and wears Adidas clothing. By the time the British public next sees her at Wimbledon, almost certainly in the main draw, those clothes are likely to be adorned with advertising. Fortunately for Robson&apos;s chances, neither she nor her parents have shown any sign of having their heads turned by either money or adulation. According to Steven Martens, the LTA&apos;s player director, she is an old head on young shoulders and those who are nurturing her career are acutely aware of the need to keep her grounded. &quot;The challenge is to keep her normal in her environment,&quot; he says. &quot;You need the chance to chill out. Tennis is a rough sport in the sense of the demands on young people physically and mentally and it&apos;s got much tougher in the last few years. Players of Laura&apos;s age now play a lot more, practise a lot more and do a lot more physical training than they used to and all of those things have to be balanced.&quot; And balanced Robson certainly is: she has found time to enjoy herself as well this week. Serena Williams came up to her and had a chat, Marat Safin penned a few words for her birthday card, while she also had her first glimpse of Roger Federer playing live. &quot;That was really good,&quot; she says. In between times she has been contacting friends on Facebook and eating jelly snakes, especially the dark red ones. She has also been consuming energy gels: &quot;But they don&apos;t taste so good.&quot; At 15 years, 9 days... Venus Williams 26 June 1995Professional for nine months.

Mostly because Worldcat is evil, according to the Guardian. Of course they don&apos;t come right out and say it. I can&apos;t help thinking, if you could type in the title and Google told you the nearest library, the Guardian would think that was evil.Meanwhile, you can still use interlibrary loan to borrow almost any book in the world for free. (Unless you live outside the city limits. Then, since you aren&apos;t already taxed for the library like the rest of us, you have to pay for a library card to borrow books. Oh, the injustice!) Or you can buy any book in the world on line and have it delivered to your house. Or go to the bookstore, sit in the comfy chair, and read a chapter a day. Or sit in the library and read. Granted, you have to leave at closing time.http://mondayevening.wordpress.com/2009/01/23/finding-and-reading-books/ &gt;&gt; Well of course you can \u2013 sometimes - it&apos;s just not that easy \u2013 as the article says the search results are dominated by commercial booksellers. Apart from the fact that restrictive contracts like OCLC&apos;s World Cat prevent opening up catalogues for libraries that subscribe to this cataloguing service, a key reason why you can&apos;t find books in online library catalogues is that retailers are better at getting their web sites ranked higher in search engines than libraries \u2013 it&apos;s their job to promote their wares.http://suehill.typepad.com/shrweblog/2009/01/why-you-cant-find-a-library-book-in-your-search-engine.html &gt;&gt; On a broadly related note, the Guardian reported this week on the spat over OCLC&apos;s revision of their data use provisions that all member OCLC libraries are expected to abide by. This report is slanted against OCLC but nevertheless the organization has handled the whole issue horribly, and management has now been forced to do what they should have done in the first place which is to hold a open forum (which will now be an open bitch session). http://personanondata.blogspot.com/2009/01/bibliographic-studies.html &gt;&gt; Now I believe OCLC has rights. But I&apos;m not sure what they are or should be. Should all records &quot;sold&quot; to libraries before 2009 become public domain records since OCLC policy was not clearly established? And then should libraries decide whether to continue their relationship with OCLC for their future cataloging needs?This is the problem I&apos;ve always had with electronic product: what are we really paying for, and what do we own? For example, now that Apple is making their content DRM-free, iPod customers need to repurchase music they already owned in order to own it again for real. I always ask this about our library databases that we purchase and then discard our print resources that are now available electronically. What do we own? Can we download the database and keep it on our server and then cancel our subscription? What if you change the content and remove something we value and put that content into another database that we now need to buy (again)? Why the hell did we dump all those perfectly good books?http://effinglibrarian.blogspot.com/2009/01/oclc-vs-everyone.html &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, OpenLibrary is under attack by a backwards-thinking company called WorldCat that hopes to shut down the &quot;little guys&quot;. I&apos;m sure WorldCat has something to offer the world, but if they hope to get onboard with the 21st century web, they&apos;d better start thinking inclusively.http://blog.inquirylabs.com/2009/01/23/need-a-library-book-have-it-scanned-free/ &gt;&gt; The writer observes that finding books in your library should be a simple matter of a web search. This is not the case. You can look up books in OCLC&apos;s WorldCat but most of these records are not shared with Google Books. Instead of trying to find new ways to share library records, OCLC recently introduced more restrictive licensing on them. Set to be implemented in February, the library community roared, and the date was deferred. It is a time for OCLC to pause and reflect.http://johnmiedema.ca/2009/01/23/youve-heard-of-worldcat-now-meet-fuzzycat/ &gt;&gt; The article implies that the reason &quot;OCLC shares only 3m of its 125m records with Google Books; none of them show up in an ordinary search&quot; is becuase OCLC is unwilling to share more records for more uses. My understanding was that OCLC was happy to share all it&apos;s records with Google (but not with you and I, for free), and would like them to show up in ordinary searches, but Google says it&apos;s too much data and they don&apos;t know what to do with it! (Contrary to popular belief, even Google is not omnipotent against the genuinely hard problem of dealing with our gigantic legacy corpus.)http://bibwild.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/oclc-in-the-guardian/ &gt;&gt; So all the eager modern-day librarians out there who so want to share their collection of great books with the wider public just aren&apos;t allowed. That&apos;s really, really sad. I hope - but am not counting on - that whoever in Obama&apos;s administration this thing sorts under will do something and break the monopoly of this kill-joy in Ohio. Read the whole article, it&apos;s not that long and it&apos;s interesting. There&apos;s more in it than just the above.http://labeet.dk/wordpress/?p=306 &gt;&gt; It is a good overview of the broader issues surrounding the OCLC Licensing problem, and is written for the general reader (i.e. this is the article you should recommend to all your non-library friends (and perhaps even some of your library friends).http://www.davemenninger.com/cincinnati/?p=971 &gt;&gt; The article asks the simple question, &quot;Why you can&apos;t find a library book in your search engine?&quot;It&apos;s an obvious question. The answer isn&apos;t quite as simple as they put it. Libraries would be in Google if their library catalogs could be spidered. But they&apos;d still be hampered by OCLC in various ways. Anyway the coverage of OCLC, Open Library, LCSH.info and LibraryThing are spot-on. And the subtle nationalist angle\u2014an American site!\u2014can&apos;t hurt.*Three cheers for the Guardian. Next up, the New York Times? We can hope.http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2009/01/guardian-asks-why-you-cant-find-library.php &gt;&gt; Flooding the Web with multiple copies of metadata about multiple copies of books is non-trivial to get right (just think of the issues around sensibly assigning &apos;http&apos; URIs to this kind of stuff for example) such that link counting, ranking of books vs. other Web resources, and providing access to appropriate copies can be done sensibly. There has to be some point of &apos;concentration&apos; (to use Lorcan Dempsey&apos;s term) around which such things can happen - whether that is provided by Google, Amazon, Open Library, OCLC, Talis, the Library of Congress or someone else. Too many points of concentration and you have a problem... or so it seems to me.http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2009/01/why-cant-i-find-a-library-book-in-my-search-engine.html &gt;&gt; It&apos;s good to see the ongoing OCLC debacle is starting to be picked up by the mainstream press in the UKhttp://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/632 &gt;&gt; It is rare for the Guardian to report on library catalogue intellectual property issues, but OCLC appears, though without glory, in a piece in the technology supplement this morning on the records ownership controversy.http://www.roper.org.uk/tr/2009/01/guardian-on-oclc-records.html IWORK, YOU WORKThank you for your piece on iWork. I fall into the &apos;do I need the new features&apos; existing user camp!

Recently I have mostly been listening to music via Spotify, and discovering new stuff, and occasionally indulging in nostalgia to old things like Ebenezer Goode and Frazier Chorus. I have been feeling very clever for making it work on my office computer. But now I&apos;m back where I was a year or so ago, when I listened to lots of stuff on my ipod, but everything I had for playing music out loud wanted CDs, so that I either sat around at home with headphones on or I could only listen to stuff I could physically find, which was a very last century way to live. I sorted it out by getting ipod dock speakers to take to Italy, and now I only use those and have never bothered to unpack my hifi. But now I am back to the same situation where I have to listen to stuff at home with headphones on, because my laptop&apos;s speakers aren&apos;t any good. I might need to set up some AirPort streaming system. Technology is complicated and confusing. Suddenly my ipod looks all out-dated. Could we all just stop and catch our breaths?http://bagford.blogspot.com/2009/01/hard-work.html INDIA&apos;S PHONE CHALLENGEPaul Munford (Connecting with Rural India) overlooked the biggest challenge facing operators in India and indeed in developing countries around the world: \u00a0how to \u00a0 find a way to provide telephone services to remote rural areas where ARPUs are very very low \u2013 and still make a profit from these \u00a0customers.Luckily for India&apos;s rural community they don&apos;t have to &apos;whistle at the moon&apos;. Zero opex [operating expense] solar-powered GSM base stations are being developed to reach people who have less than $3 a month to spend on their calls. \u00a0In addition, the microtelecom model is emerging. Like microfinance, microtelecom is based on the belief that &quot;bottom of the pyramid&quot; consumers can be profitably served \u2014 as long as the product or service is designed appropriately. \u00a0It centers around local stakeholder entrepreneurs who partner with operators to deliver mobile services within their communities.Anil Raj, CEO VNL \u00a0www.vnl.in MACS REDUXWhilst Roger Larkinson is correct in saying that the Mac mini is a great piece of kit - it is - it should not be forgotten that it is also a stand alone piece of kit. By the time you have also bought a monitor (and these days it has to be flat screen) keyboard, mouse and an external hard drive (and you wouldn&apos;t want anything but Apple kit of course) you are well on the way to the price of an iMac, which has a higher spec anyway.Perhaps the Mac mini will go down as one of Apple&apos;s design exercises which was stunning, but in the end, no-one quite worked out what to do with it.Alan Gent, Cheadle LINUX OR...The Guardian should be doing more to promote software that is safe by design.That means everyone should replace their Windows operating systems with well thought out ones.I mean Linux, and the easiest I think is still by far Ubuntu, which is easy to install on your computer - almost any commercially available one in the last five years.You will find installing Ubuntu far easier than even starting up a newly bought Windows computer for the first time.And, if you&apos;re scared of what it might do to your computer, you can run it from a CD, a USB drive or set up a dual boot system on your computer.The operating system and a vast amount of software is absolutely free, and almost any conceivable software package can be downloaded for free.And if there is that special Windows package you think you still need (there isn&apos;t) a utility called WINE will let you run your windows program, but will not allow your machine to be infected.Ubuntu, GNU, Linux, are all based on longstanding programing principles going back 30 years and more which have worked out methods of allowing programs to run on computers which don&apos;t allow them (or others out there in the wild) to take over control of your machine, techniques which we must believe Microsoft has purposely decided not to use.It&apos;s entirely free (you never own the software, but you don&apos;t Microsoft&apos;s malware either) but you use it under a &apos;copyleft&apos; as distinct from copyright licence.Occasionally Microsoft blows hot about its patents, but in fact nothing in the Linux core is owned by Microsoft, and the engineers who have built the Linux engine have long ago replaced any code that might be possibly held to infinge Redmond&apos;s property. The one company SCO that decided to go after Linux (a difficult thing as Linux is not a company, it&apos;s a community) imploded in an expensive bankruptcy.Why is it the best program environment in the world is free and not directly owned by anyone?In principle it&apos;s because there isn&apos;t a billionaire at the top feeding on it to fund his own agenda (however meritorious Bill Gate&apos;s charitable efforts are, he&apos;s only been able to do them because he has been able to charge you top dollar for his rubbish) ;that there&apos;s a community of people (who should be thought of as the computer equivalent of conservation volunteers) who think that a free software environment is a good thing, and willingly contribute to it, who know how to produce good software (rather as a good conservation volunteer learns good practice from bad in the environment); that there are a number of firms (a community rather than a monopoly) who put up the relatively small amount of money needed to keep the movement alive and people like us who want decent stable software.I don&apos;t have to pay a fee to anybody for the operating sytem in my TV. I have to pay for the content (licence fee or advertisements or Sky tax) and I have to buy my set, but I&apos;m not required to pay an entirely bogus charge to some American capitalist for the right to turn it on.If you continue to pay Microsoft that spurious charge, it is your free choice, but there isn&apos;t any need to! And by deserting Microsoft you will never have to worry about some mysterious security patch again. Charles Norrie, London VIRTUAL LONDONSSecond Life&apos;s &quot;London&quot; may be a great achievement, but it is also something of a hollow experience. There are two kinds of virtual urban re-creations : Amsterdam for example, where the frontages are photorealistic but completely static, pasted on to inaccessible non- buildings - rather like walking through a film set.Then there is London, where the textures are slabby and unrealistic (as they have to be to reduce lag), while the shops and clubs are like those you see everywhere in Second Life. Visiting either city just once is fascinating and eye-opening, but only die-hards would return regularly.Until computer power, broadband speeds, and server capacities make it feasible, then the fully interactive, realistic, virtual city is still only a dream. Better to visit the fully imagined locations instead, where Second Life really excels.Tid Kidd, Second Life Volunteer Island, Second Life  IPHONE GAME PRICINGYou mentioned today that Rolando on the iPhone is about as pricey as iPhone games get - they just reduced the price today to \u00a33.49:http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/rolando-price-cut-to-gbp-3-49Paul Haine, London SKY COPY PROTECTIONI have just read with interest your article regarding the above issue:http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/04/television-sky-programme-backupsI experienced the copy protection problem for the first time only 2 weeks ago, i.e. after the supposed fix. Following two lengthy conversations with Sky Technical Support in which they denied the existence of the problem I insisted that they send an engineer out.The engineer said he&apos;d never heard of the problem and declined to read, let alone take away, a copy of your article, which I had printed out for him. \u00a0He then tried to prove that the problem was with my DVD recorder by disconnecting it from Sky and showing that the copy protect message still appeared when trying to record.The engineer managed to get rid of the copy protect block by connecting the DVD recorder to the terrestrial input (which worked fine) and then back to Sky again. \u00a0He acknowledged reluctantly the possibility that if there had been a copy protect signal with the Sky output it could have upset my DVD recorder&apos;s settings, causing it to stick on copy protect. My problem is resolved for now, but I wonder for how long. \u00a0Will there be another randomly generated block signal by Sky in the future?I thought that you might like to know that copy protection is still a problem for Sky customers. Martin Langan, Clanfield DOWNLOADING SAUCERSAccording to McKinnon, &quot;These folders [NASA imagery folder] were full of images in a proprietary NASA format, or in a format I&apos;d never seen before: no jpegs or gifs. They were also 200 to 300 megabytes in size. And being on a 56K dial-up modem, there was no way I was going to download that at five minutes per megabyte.&quot;So what I did... The remote control program that gives you graphical control of the machine - I turned the resolution right down to, I think, 4-bit color and then on the desktop on the NASA machine, navigated to the folder, double-clicked on the first image. The application launches. The image comes up on the screen, but it&apos;s still very, very slow.&quot;And what I saw, or was hoping to see, was what she was describing as a saucer, very definite imagery. And what instead I saw I assume was the Earth. This was in shades of gray. You had the Earth&apos;s hemisphere taking up about 2/3 of the screen and then halfway between the top of the hemisphere and the bottom of the picture there was a classic sort of cigar-shaped object, but with golf-ball domes, geodesic domes, above, below, and this side [gesturing to the right], and I assume the other side as well. It had very slightly flattened cigar ends. No seams. No rivets. No telemetry antennae or anything like that. It looked... it just had a feeling of not being man-made. There was none of the signs of human manufacturing.&quot;Source: http://www.projectcamelot.org/gary_mckinnon_interview_transcript.htmlFirst obvious question - what was the craft McKinnon saw? Can you tell me if anyone from The Guardian has asked NASA about the image McKinnon claims to have seen?McKinnon also said that he could enter the NASA network easily, as, bizarrely, they had either no or the default network password. That is asking for trouble. Additionally, he states other hackers were also present at the times he entered this network - why have they not been arrested? Why has McKinnon been singled out for prosecution?In my opinion, McKinnon is being prosecuted for two reasons 1)punishment for what he saw and 2)to be used as leverage by NASA/DoD as &quot;evidence&quot; that hackers can be equated with &quot;terrorists&quot; and therefore we i.e. NASA, needs more money for &quot;security&quot;.

She had already chatted with Serena Williams in the week, had a penned birthday message from Marat Safin \u2013 she was 15 years old the previous week \u2013 and after losing the Australian Open junior final protected herself from the air conditioning with an oversized jumper she had borrowed from Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco who, just 12 hours before she played the final in the Rod Laver Arena, had lost there to Rafael Nadal in the semi-final. &quot;Because I just spent an obscene amount of time in the anti-doping room after my final, and I didn&apos;t have a jumper, I went in the cafe and asked Fernando and he gave me this one,&quot; said Robson, who met the Spaniard in Amsterdam last year when she was in the Netherlands training. Robson was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Russia&apos;s Ksenia Pervak, who is already ranked just outside the world&apos;s top 150 on the WTA Tour, and will be 18 in May. It was instantly clear her opponent was both physically more mature, with a greater capacity to chase down shots in a rally. There was an explosive quality to her running that the British junior still lacks, as you would expect of one so young, though she quickly demurred when it was suggested the Russian hit the ball harder. &quot;I think generally she won because she played more consistently than me. So it&apos;s definitely disappointing to lose, but I thought I played as well as I could have.&quot; As had happened in some of her early matches Robson began a little slowly and went 3-0 down, losing her serve twice. She then broke back, and held for 3-2, at which point many in the 400 or so crowd were expecting her to turn matters around completely as she had when winning the Wimbledon junior title. However, on this occasion the more experienced Russian maintained her grip and Robson&apos;s best weapon, the serve, let her down. Altogether she only managed to hold it twice, while her forehand also fragmented in the second set as fatigue set in. &quot;Not as much as the semi-final, I think I upped my dosage of jelly snakes,&quot; she said, grinning, though the brutally hot weather during the previous rounds had undoubtedly taken their toll. Robson will leave for home on Monday and sort out her schedule for the rest of the year when it seems certain she will receive a wild-card entry into the Wimbledon main draw. &quot;I&apos;ve no say in it, really. I&apos;ve got the wild-card for quallies, but it&apos;s their decision whether they want to give me a main draw one. I would like one.&quot; Off court, Robson remains very much the young teenager, immensely enjoying rubbing shoulders with the top players. On court her composure, and the timing of her shots, are mature beyond her years, and bode well for the future, even if the transition from junior to professional is a path strewn with sharp rocks and hidden obstacles. &quot;Obviously I wanted to win but getting to the final was a really big achievement for me, especially overcoming the all the hot weather.&quot; There were moments of frustration when she pinged her racket on the court, and uttered a few choice words to herself. &quot;I&apos;ll try to be a bit quieter next time,&quot; she smiled knowingly. All in all it was a good fortnight for Britain&apos;s women, though Robson baulked when asked by an American if she could be part of a revival. &quot;Well, it&apos;s not really a revival, because Anne [Keothavong] is already top 50. I don&apos;t like that question.&quot; But she was only being playful. By comparison, Russian women&apos;s tennis is immensely strong. There are five in the current WTA Tour top 10, and seven in the top 20, while in the junior rankings they have 10 in the top 100, excluding Pervak who did not play any junior tennis last year, competing at a higher level. She has a current WTA ranking of No 154, and before the junior event tried to qualify for the main draw. &quot;I knew that I was the best here, but it was a little bit hard to keep my nerve. You know you are the best, but also worry that you might get sick or have some injury problems,&quot; said Pervak, who often practices with Anna Chakvetadze, the former Russian world No5, who knocked out Keothavong here in the first round. Pervak was asked what she thought of Robson. She turned down her mouth and shrugged. &quot;I think she&apos;s ok, but I was better, so what can I say?&quot; It was hardly a ringing endorsement, but then you would not expect it. The Russian knows that Robson is being talked about in the locker rooms as a future star of the game, and she was not about to add to her growing reputation.", "sentences": ["&quot;Because I just spent an obscene amount of time in the anti-doping room after my final, and I didn&apos;t have a jumper, I went in the cafe and asked Fernando and he gave me this one,&quot; said Robson, who met the Spaniard in Amsterdam last year when she was in the Netherlands training."], "title": "Tennis: Laura Robson loses Australian Open junior semi-final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/01/australian-open-laura-robson", "tags": ["Australian Open 2009", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Laura Robson", "Australia sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-01T00:01:00Z", "article": "Beirut lies flattened beneath you, its streets and alleys incised out of old rubber; the city mapped in tyres and viewed from the dangerous skies. Nearby, a concrete tower block rises in three dimensions to head height, a perfect miniature of the artist&apos;s former home rendered in humble tile grout. Peer through the windows and you see that everyone has gone, evacuated after the 2006 bombings. Typical Iranian Wedding, as the painting is called, takes the form of a diptych: women on the left, with nothing more than a solitary chicken to dine upon beneath the bare bulbs, men stuffing their faces in a palace of varieties and blue cigar smoke on the right. In Baghdad, a car crashes into an American security wall, flames rage, a statue&apos;s head rolls in the dirt. In Ramallah, everybody&apos;s music clashes with everybody else&apos;s in a sound soup of chanting, hectoring, lamenting and bopping as night falls in the rickety encampments. Tiny lights glow in the tiny rooms of this sprawling model; the TV antennae twist into gesticulating figures. F-16s lie in wait behind a border of cardboard. Whatever one may have expected from the Saatchi Gallery&apos;s major show of contemporary art from the Middle East, it was never going to be intricate patterning or calligraphy. Only someone who has forsworn television news for decades could assume that a ban on representation still holds in Islamic cultures. Consider those statues, consider those wall-sized portraits of ayatollahs. But it is still amazing how far into politics this art bravely goes and it is no overstatement to speak of bravery in this case. One of the artists represented here, who lives in Tehran, is muffled in the gallery&apos;s publicity shot to conceal his identity. Another, the prodigiously gifted Tala Madani, has escaped Tehran for Amsterdam but still refused to have her face revealed in a photograph. The Iranian artists are particularly excoriating, especially those who have remained in the country while somehow managing to show their work in secret. At a distance, Ramin Haerizadeh&apos;s photo-based images look like blown-up Persian miniatures, with their jewel-rich colours and delicate arabesques, but their satire is gleefully savage. What appear to be women are in fact men, half-naked and shown prick to tongue and bum to bum, if not quite in the very act itself: a harem of bearded mullah voluptuaries. What a taunt this would be in an uncensored society, but over and again, these artists protest the daily constraints on freedom. Veiled women with graters, sieves and irons instead of faces; veiled women whose features are fading fast like exposed negatives; ranks of veiled women, kneeling in prayer, who turn out to be empty husks of tinfoil when you stoop to look into their eyes. Identical, faceless, made of kitchen materials: no getting away from the message. And much of the work in this show takes the form of direct one-liners, more or less blunt, more or less the kind of bull-point art Saatchi has tended to favour since the 90s. In fact, for anyone who saw the show of contemporary Chinese art that immediately preceded Unveiled, there is an eerie sense of following exactly the same trajectory - serious political works on the ground floor rising to apocalyptic sculptures on the next and enormous paintings in cruder and cruder series as you go up. The worst work here is a shambolic hybrid of eastern content and western style - Tehran prostitutes fashioned out of stuffed tights and melons; public funerals with overtones of Martin Kippenberger. The show&apos;s curator talks of &quot;robust independent art scenes from Marrakesh to Tehran&quot;, but how robust can any art scene in the world honestly claim to be when it plays hard to the international fair and biennale market?  But there are some truly independent minds here, from Marwan Rechmaoui, whose metaphors of Beirut are so acute in their use of materials, to the 28-year-old Tala Madani. Madani&apos;s paintings are brilliant parables of Tehran, from the hairdresser to the mosque, the street cafe and ice-cream parlour. But this is not immediately apparent, for she has invented a way of painting that turns upon classic Islamic idioms - pattern, repetition, complex abstraction - to achieve the visual equivalent of the double entendre. The faithful in Holy Light appear blinded by acid rain, but the picture looks like a beautiful design at first glance. The gorgeous hot pink and tan scriptures of Elastic Pink translate, when your eyes adjust, into shocking images of mass servility. Audacious, passionate and acutely drawn, Madani&apos;s paintings are modern Caprichos; moral in their fancy, coruscating in their invention and more original than anything by the new young artists generally favoured by the art world.", "sentences": ["Another, the prodigiously gifted Tala Madani, has escaped Tehran for Amsterdam but still refused to have her face revealed in a photograph."], "title": "Art review: Unveiled: New Art form the Middle East, Saatchi Gallery, London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/01/unveiled-saatchi-gallery-review-art", "tags": ["Saatchi gallery", "Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-01T00:01:00Z", "article": "Die tote StadtRoyal Opera House, London WC2 Nicholas AngelichWigmore Hall, London W1  Stephen KovacevichQueen Elizabeth Hall, London SE1 Obsession and fidelity, guilt, sex, grief and temptation rip their way through Korngold&apos;s impassioned Die tote Stadt, which had its British stage premiere at the Royal Opera House this week, a mere nine decades after it was written. Willy Decker&apos;s muted expressionist production, designed by Wolfgang Gussmann and conducted by Ingo Metzmacher, opened in Salzburg and Vienna in 2004, and has since been seen in San Francisco, Amsterdam and Barcelona. One off-putting factor for opera houses, never mind ingrained snobbery, parochialism or ignorance, is the difficulty of casting the piece. The heroic-tenor lead is scarcely offstage, riding the orchestra at high pitch and emotion throughout, while the soprano, playing a double role, must be secure in every part of an ambitious vocal range. Here a chunky Stephen Gould and the sinewy Nadja Michael deserve medals for effort and stamina, despite strain. Add to all this a slightly sneering attitude towards a composer whose popcorn name seemed more appropriate to his role as a pioneer of Hollywood film music (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk and similar epics) and you look no further for excuses. Born in Moravia, Erich Korngold (1897-1957) was the son of a bullying, rear-guard music critic - adjectives not generic to the trade but certainly applicable to Korngold senior, who at once pushed and persecuted the boy. Mahler and Strauss were early supporters. Doors opened for the prodigy, only to be slammed shut once the oppressive forces of nazism and modernism took a grip. After its triumphant run in the 1920s, Die tote Stadt vanished from the repertoire. The enterprising, non-professional Kensington Symphony Orchestra mounted the British concert premiere in 1996. A creditable Naxos recording introduces the piece usefully, but the relentless hurricane-force score, with its complex layerings and vast orchestral sweep and clatter, tends to be overwhelming in a confined domestic space, not least on grounds of noise pollution. Opera-goers were therefore keen to encounter this neglected hit in a professional staging. Korngold&apos;s source is Georges Rodenbach&apos;s poetic novel Bruges-la-morte - a fashionable influence on Rilke, Mallarm\u00e9 and Zweig. (Alan Hollinghurst minutely explores this ghostly fin-de-si\u00e8cle artistic world in his 1994 novel The Folding Star.) Psychology leads art into deep waters: Paul is obsessed by his dead wife, Marie. He encounters a lookalike dancer, Marietta, murders her with a relic of his wife&apos;s hair, then wakes from his lurid nightmare, returning to the comforting armchair of his id\u00e9e fixe. So just another rum operatic scenario, starring Bruges, otherwise thinly represented on the lyric map. Longueurs aside, the score has Straussian urgency, Puccinian heat and melody. Metzmacher&apos;s analytical grasp, and the brisk, no-nonsense playing of the ROH orchestra, glittering with additional organ, cowbells, wind machine and strident offstage trumpets, revealed true musical voluptuousness, rather than the flab that some expected. To hear it was rewarding rather than redemptive. Decker&apos;s staging takes a narrow, Freudian-casebook approach: windowless room with phantom tableaux vivants. The dead Marie is represented by splashy blow-ups of Sargent&apos;s portrait of doe-eyed Elsie Palmer. The dancer and her troupe of sinful, wimpled nuns - don&apos;t ask; the reference is to Meyerbeer&apos;s Robert le diable - rise from their tombs like a marmoreal herd of rare-breed horned cattle. Gerald Finley, animated in support as Frank/Fritz, lavished characteristic feeling in his party-piece aria &quot;Mein Sehnen, mein W\u00e4hnen&quot;. Kathleen Wilkinson, as the steadfast housekeeper, Brigitta, provided necessary stillness, no small relief. With 33 variations yet to come, you cannot judge a performance of the Diabelli Variations Op 120 on how the opening, almost bathetic waltz theme is played. In the unexpected circumstance of hearing Beethoven&apos;s late masterpiece twice on the same day, by pianists of dramatically contrasting style, it&apos;s nonetheless a place to start. Nicholas Angelich, on Monday lunchtime at Wigmore Hall (relayed live on Radio 3), began with weighty confidence. His intelligent, assured reading always brought out the hidden main theme even when transfigured in a welter of pounding octaves, fast repeated chords, brilliant, explosive trills and remote harmonies. &quot;Must music be entirely serious?&quot; asked Alfred Brendel, in his revolutionary 1989 essay, which changed our understanding of the Diabelli Variations for ever. Angelich could perhaps have offered a jot more wit. That evening at the QEH, Stephen Kovacevich, who ignited his career more than 40 years ago with this work and has recently re-recorded it, gave a more antic interpretation. The opening was swift and insolent, the martial first variation satirical and pompous. Bach, whose fourth Partita Kovacevich had played nervously in the first half, casts his generous shadow on the pensive fughetta of Variation XXIV. Here Kovacevich excelled. At the close, the transcendent finale, a tender minuet, thundered back to earth with one short fortissimo crash. Kovacevich whipped his hands from the keys as if scorched.", "sentences": ["Willy Decker&apos;s muted expressionist production, designed by Wolfgang Gussmann and conducted by Ingo Metzmacher, opened in Salzburg and Vienna in 2004, and has since been seen in San Francisco, Amsterdam and Barcelona."], "title": "Classical review: Die tote Stadt, Royal Opera House, Nicholas Angelich, Wigmore Hall, Stephen Kovacevich, Queen Elizabeth Hall, all in London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/01/classical-opera-review", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-02T00:01:00Z", "article": "Diageo plc has its headquarters in Henrietta Place, central London, and its \u00a33.6m-a-year chief executive, Paul Walsh, lives in Sussex. The drinks giant has 6,500 workers in Britain, mostly making and selling scotch. Their famous Johnnie Walker brand, blended in Kilmarnock, is exported all over the world. But this British firm has been paying very little UK corporation tax, relatively speaking. Despite average annual profits of almost \u00a32bn over the last decade, its accounts disclose a mere \u00a343m a year in average UK corporation tax charges. This is little more than 2% of its profits. The tax bill would be nearer \u00a3144m a year if it reflected Diageo&apos;s actual physical UK presence rather than the present system of taxing only those financial profits said to arise in this country. Some 30% of Diageo&apos;s production is located in Britain.  Leaving aside legitimate allowances against profits, such a difference could be said to represent a notional &quot;tax gap&quot; of more than \u00a3100m a year. It takes 20,000 ordinary British households paying income tax to fill such a gap. The vast bulk of Diageo&apos;s profits are declared to arise overseas, where what taxes they pay go to foreign authorities. The firm owns Guinness in Ireland and Smirnoff vodka in the US, for example. But those overseas taxes are also remarkably low. Diageo&apos;s global &quot;tax rate&quot; has been only 18% since 1999, according to average figures we have calculated from its own accounts. These record the tax actually paid each year over that period.  The bulk of Diageo&apos;s production outside the UK is in North America, where 26% of its production sites are located. There, the standard corporation tax was even higher than in Britain over the same period - between 35% and 45%. So this figure of 18% represents a major achievement by Diageo&apos;s tax department.  What is Diageo&apos;s secret? The company won&apos;t comment, and little hint is given in its published glossy annual reports. But it is possible to unearth some of the facts in the obscure filings of a network of Dutch subsidiaries created in the last few years. Diageo has managed to use these Dutch structures to transfer billions of pounds worth of its businesses out of the UK, on paper at any rate. The legal ownership of many famous trademarks has been transferred, including Johnnie Walker scotch, J &amp; B Rare, and Gilbey&apos;s gin - brands worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Along with the brands has gone the ownership of the entire whisky businesses, leaving Scotland&apos;s distilleries as hollowed-out sub-contractors. We have traced Johnnie Walker and J&amp; B operations vested in a Dutch central entity, Diageo Brands BV in Amsterdam. There is no sign in the accounts that Diageo paid UK capital gains tax on the profits when the Dutch entity purchased these hugely valuable operations.  Revenue sources say that the Netherlands will normally give tax relief to a subsidiary for the full value of all the business it has brought into the country. So, according to the records, the Johnnie Walker profits stacked up in the Netherlands following the move, virtually tax-free. But British tax authorities have lost a major source of revenue. Subsequent UK investigations into Diageo&apos;s tactics involved a trip to the Netherlands by an HM Revenue &amp; Customs team, led by Ian Valentine, deputy director of the department&apos;s large business service, and supervised by Britain&apos;s top taxman, Dave Hartnett, according to Whitehall sources. The drinks company hired David Cruikshank, a partner at accountants Deloitte, to negotiate on its behalf. Sources say that by the end of November a confidential deal was clinched, involving some extra payments. It was considered so generous to the company that sources close to Deloitte say the firm cracked open champagne to celebrate. As with all such deals, even the very existence of a tax dispute and settlement was kept secret. Issues involving hundreds of millions of pounds have been settled without any public oversight, behind the veil of secrecy laws. The methods Diageo used to spirit the legal title to its whisky business across the North Sea were far from straightforward. The technique is known in tax circles as &quot;outward domestication&quot;. In 2000, trademark registers show ownership of the Johnnie Walker brand was shifted from a Diageo subsidiary in Edinburgh to a second company called UDV [SJ] Ltd. The initials stand for a predecessor organisation, United Distillers Vintners, and for Saint James&apos;s Gate [SJ] where Guinness headquarters were located. The Johnnie Walker business, worth almost \u00a36bn, was now, it was recorded, to be &quot;carried on through a branch located in the Netherlands&quot;. Next, this &quot;Netherlands branch&quot; was incorporated and turned into a Dutch subsidiary company with an almost identical title: UDV [SJ] BV. [&quot;BV&quot; is the Dutch equivalent of &quot;Ltd&quot;.] A British tax concession allows such incorporation of existing foreign branches without the normal capital gains bill for selling the valuable asset overseas. Ownership of the business was then rapidly transferred into another Dutch company, Guinness UDV BV, soon to be re-named Diageo Brands BV. By this means, Johnnie Walker became &quot;Dutch&quot;. The Kilmarnock blending plant which made the actual whisky continued to operate just the same as always. But much of the profit went abroad.  Diageo continued its process of brand-shifting until Diageo Brands BV held many of its lucrative drinks trademarks. In 2006, J&amp;B followed Johnnie Walker abroad, via an even more intricate manoeuvre.  Justerini &amp; Brooks, a Diageo subsidiary, placed its J&amp;B whisky business in an entity called J&amp;B Scotland Ltd, on 1 November 2005. Then too, they said the whisky business, worth \u00a31bn, was being operated by a &quot;branch in the Netherlands&quot;. Shortly afterwards, on 18 January 2006, J&amp;B Scotland was sold on to UDV [SJ] Ltd. On the same day the status of the Dutch entity, UDV [SJ] BV, was altered. It ceased to be a direct subsidiary of UDV [SJ] Ltd, and instead became a subsidiary of J&amp;B Scotland Ltd. This enabled the entire whisky business to be transferred into the Dutch subsidiary a few days later, on 1 February 2006. J&amp;B finally ended up alongside the other whisky brands, as part of Diageo Brands BV. Once again, no capital gains tax appears to have been paid. Diageo has decided not to comment on the Guardian&apos;s disclosures. A spokesman said today: &quot;We don&apos;t want to comment on the article. I don&apos;t see what we would gain by doing so.&quot;", "sentences": ["We have traced Johnnie Walker and J&amp; B operations vested in a Dutch central entity, Diageo Brands BV in Amsterdam."], "title": "The tax gap: How Diageo plc put Johnnie Walker into a Dutch subsidiary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/02/tax-gap-diageo-johnnie-walker", "tags": ["Diageo", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-02T00:01:00Z", "article": "British taxpayers are being left to plug a multibillion-pound hole in the public finances as hundreds of the country&apos;s biggest companies increasingly employ complex and secretive tax arrangements to limit the amount they hand over to the exchequer.  An extensive Guardian investigation has examined the accounts of the UK&apos;s biggest companies - many of them household names - and discovered a series of sophisticated tax strategies which, critics say, amount to an almost unstoppable tide of perfectly legal corporate tax avoidance.  The veil of confidentiality that covers these tax avoidance schemes is so difficult to penetrate that nobody knows exactly how much tax goes missing each year. But HM Revenue &amp; Customs estimated that the size of the tax gap could be anything between \u00a33.7bn and \u00a313bn. The Commons public accounts committee put it at a possible \u00a38.5bn and the TUC said \u00a312bn. UK listed companies are not required to set out exactly how much UK corporation tax they actually hand over to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. When the Guardian asked each FTSE 100 company to provide this information only two offered a response. Similarly each company was asked what its official policy on so-called tax planning is and how this is implemented. No company was prepared to answer the question directly. However, the investigation, which we publish over coming days, has established that:  \u2022 The UK-based drinks giant Diageo plc has transferred ownership of brands worth billions of pounds, including Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Gilbey&apos;s gin, to a subsidiary in the Netherlands where profits accrued virtually tax-free. Despite average profits of \u00a32bn a year, it paid an average of \u00a343m a year in UK tax - little more than 2% of its overall profits. \u2022 Two major drug firms have shifted ownership of their brands to tax havens in the Caribbean. Their UK operations can then be made to pay royalties for the use of the trademarks, reducing their profits and the amount of tax due in this country. \u2022 An internationally renowned corporation has structured itself so that it is now simultaneously a British public company, tax-resident in Amsterdam, but whose brands are Swiss-owned. \u2022 The makers of an iconic British food product have shifted the rights in it to a tax haven in Switzerland. \u2022 A household name has been deliberately loaded with debt so that it no longer has any profits to pay tax on. \u2022 Top accountancy firms are charging \u00a3500,000 a time to invent tax-avoidance schemes. \u2022 Some UK-listed companies which have moved control to Dublin to benefit from Ireland&apos;s low-tax regime appear to have little real presence there.  According to the National Audit Office, in 2006 more than 60% of Britain&apos;s 700 biggest companies paid less than \u00a310m corporation tax, and 30% paid nothing.  Britain&apos;s top taxman, Dave Hartnett, told the Commons public accounts committee last year that 12 major corporations had &quot;extinguished all tax liabilities in 2005-6&quot; thanks to avoidance schemes.  Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats&apos; deputy leader, said last night: &quot;The scale of corporate tax-dodging exposed by the Guardian research is absolutely mind-boggling. It will deeply anger households and businesses who pay their fair share. &quot;The baroque complexities of corporate tax-avoidance schemes are similar to the elaborate structures which have now devastated a substantial part of the banking system. The tax authorities should stop trying to compete in the complexity stakes and apply the general principle that if companies deliberately seek to avoid taxation they should be penalised and charged.&quot;  According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, overall tax receipts - including personal income tax - will be \u00a37bn lower next year than forecast as a result of the downturn. The respected thinktank says key Labour programmes face being squeezed, in particular health and education spending. The result, say unions and campaigners, is that ordinary taxpayers have to make up the difference. If the TUC estimate of \u00a312bn is correct, it takes the average income tax contribution of 2.4m households just to fill the gap left by the perfectly legal tax manoeuvres of big business. That \u00a312bn is the equivalent of around 480 new schools, 300 hospitals or more than 1.3m new nursery places. Today, theguardian.com is also launching a unique interactive database of the corporation tax figures recorded in the accounts of each FTSE 100 compay in the last four years. It reveals the low amounts of tax paid by some, and a reluctance to supply meaningful numbers to the public. Despite their efforts to shift profits out of the country and minimise UK tax, the companies enjoy a range of important benefits by being based in Britain and listed on the London stock exchange. This has given them access to one of the widest pools of capital in the world; they have enjoyed light-touch but respected regulation and high corporate governance standards; and it has enhanced their international reputations to be listed in the UK, helping them to attract the best talent. Companies here also benefit from political stability and - perhaps most important of all - the directors want to live near London Many of the companies the Guardian looked at are already feeling the effects of the recession on their profits so their tax bills will go down. But campaigners insist that this makes the task of collecting maximum tax revenues more, rather than less, urgent. Failure to do so, they say, will put a massive strain on public finances already being stretched to breaking-point.  Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, said: &quot;Tax avoidance is hollowing out the tax system. With the rest of us having to fill the tax gap left by Britain&apos;s most wealthy, there is a real threat to the future of public services - especially as the recession takes its toll on normal tax flows. &quot;It will be hard to maintain public support for tax when it looks increasingly optional for big companies and the super-rich, who increasingly float free from the network of mutual obligations that underpin any civilised society.&quot; As they watch tax receipts dwindle through a combination of legal avoidance schemes and economic downturn, governments also face international pressure to crack down on the entirely separate problem of illegal tax evasion.  In the US, Barack Obama introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act in 2007 when he was still just an Illinois senator. Obama and his fellow sponsors of the act, Democrat Carl Levin and Republican Norm Coleman, claimed the US annual tax gap was approaching $100bn. &quot;We need to crack down on individuals and businesses that abuse our tax laws so that those who work hard and play by the rules aren&apos;t disadvantaged,&quot; Obama said. Political concern is growing across Europe. German chancellor Angela Merkel launched hostilities against individual tax evaders after her secret service bought computer discs from a whistleblower detailing the bank accounts of thousands of wealthy Germans in the tiny Alpine tax haven of Liechtenstein. In Britain, the Revenue paid \u00a3100,000 for the same information about individual UK tax dodgers and is now pursuing them.

TAX GAP The Guardian launches the fruits of a three-month investigation into the extent of tax avoidance by big business, which will continue over the next two weeks with an interactive database on the UK&apos;s 100 biggest firms. The page-one story kicks off: &quot;British taxpayers are being left to plug a multibillion-pound hole in the public finances as hundreds of the country&apos;s biggest companies increasingly employ complex and secretive tax arrangements to limit the amount they hand over to the exchequer.&quot; The investigation has &quot;discovered a series of sophisticated tax strategies which, critics say, amount to an almost unstoppable tide of perfectly legal corporate tax avoidance.&quot; The precise figures remain elusive: &quot;HM Revenue &amp; Customs estimated that the size of the tax gap could be anything between \u00a33.7bn and \u00a313bn. The Commons public accounts committee put it at a possible \u00a38.5bn and the TUC said \u00a312bn.&quot; Some of the highlights include: &quot;The UK-based drinks giant Diageo plc has transferred ownership of brands worth billions of pounds, including Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Gilbey&apos;s gin, to a subsidiary in the Netherlands where profits accrued virtually tax-free. Despite average profits of \u00a32bn a year, it paid an average of \u00a343m a year in UK tax \u2013 little more than 2% of its overall profits. &quot;Two major drug firms have shifted ownership of their brands to tax havens in the Caribbean. Their UK operations can then be made to pay royalties for the use of the trademarks, reducing their profits and the amount of tax due in this country. An internationally renowned corporation has structured itself so that it is now simultaneously a British public company, tax-resident in Amsterdam, but whose brands are Swiss-owned.&quot; Guardian: Firms&apos; secret tax avoidance schemes cost UK billions STRIKE THREAT ESCALATES It looks as though the braziers of the winter of discontent will soon be out as more workers are talking of wildcat strikes in protest at the number of foreign workers, particularly at big construction sites.

Gone, that is. At PSV this time. Following yet another player-revolt Huub Stevens, PSV&apos;s dream-manager after Ronald Koeman bailed out and the club stumbled towards their fourth consecutive title last season, is out. A training ground bust-up with the midfielder Edison Mendez; an on-field tirade from the striker Danko Lazovic; and a roasting in the NRC Handelsblad newspaper at the hands of the defender Carlos Salcido \u2013 who said Stevens made him &quot;dead mentally&quot; \u2013 were only the most public of affronts. The squad&apos;s closeness following last year&apos;s rags-to-riches season wasn&apos;t helpful. They&apos;d been sceptical about the appointment of Stevens, perhaps preferring that of the other, gentler candidate: Fred Rutten. It is indicative of the way we live now. In football, it is not the manager who controls the workers. In football, a minor mutiny is enough for the crew to set their captain adrift. Stevens&apos; downfall, many argue, was his eagerness to manage PSV. His wife was in ill health, you see, and so he wanted to work closer to home. So he negotiated little and wasn&apos;t allowed to appoint his own assistants. Dwight Lodeweges, now the caretaker, and Jan Wouters, whose brief caretakership last season was a catastrophe, remained in spite of Stevens&apos; wishes. They are said to have been unsupportive and unwilling to play good cop to counter Stevens&apos; bad-cop routine. The squad quickly grew fed up with Stevens&apos; sideline tantrums and defensive tactics. His refusal to field two central attackers further alienated the sides. He then started Ola Toivonen, a promising new forward, in his first game against NAC last week, ahead of the incumbents, further annoying his detractors. During half-time, a fist-fight between a player and coach was narrowly avoided in the dressing room. By Wednesday Stevens had seen enough and he quit. &quot;It&apos;s too easy to blame just Huub Stevens,&quot; the former PSV and now Russia manager Guus Hiddink told vi.nl. &quot;It really hurts me to see how the club is sliding away in such a short amount of time.&quot; So some blame the general director Jan Reker, who had earlier managed to convince Stevens not to leave. On his appointment 18 months ago, Reker had set about &quot;cleansing&quot; the club of their excess baggage. Out went the goalkeeping coach, the goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, the technical manager Stan Valckx, the scout Piet de Visser and the meddling in-house super-agent Vlado Lemic. But that cut off PSV&apos;s access to Lemic&apos;s immense network of talented players and Chelsea loanees looking to slum it in the Eredivisie. All in all, Stevens, the fifth Eredivisie manager to lose or quit this year, may be an outdated brand of leader. Tactically inconsistent, constantly fiddling with his line-up, truculent and sensitive to rebuttal, he is perhaps incompatible with today&apos;s generation of footballers. PSV&apos;s first half to the season was their worst since 1980\u201381. Statistically Stevens is the fourth-worst PSV manager ever, and the worst since 1968. Koeman, whom Reker had allowed to leave for Valencia without putting up much of a fight last season, is being mentioned as a successor. He has openly regretted leaving but his mea culpa may not suffice just yet. Rutten is also a candidate. He now manages Schalke 04 after a highly successful spell as Steve McClaren&apos;s predecessor at FC Twente. Frank Rijkaard, a master at mellowing dressing rooms bursting with egos, is not interested. And Hiddink has refused to advise because of his commitments to Russia. Zenit St-Petersburg&apos;s Dick Advocaat, another former PSV manager, is also being talked about. On Sunday, against a spirited De Graafschap, Lodeweges fielded only one central attacker, Toivonen, whose unruly blond mop didn&apos;t prevent him from hitting a post, having a ball cleared off the line, setting up two good goals for Ibrahim Afellay and scoring one of his own. The 3\u20130 win, which kept PSV in fifth place, was their best of the season. &quot;Those tasked with putting together the highlight DVD of PSV&apos;s season didn&apos;t have too much material at their disposal after half a year of football under Huub Stevens,&quot; Charles Bromet wrote in De Volkskrant. &quot;After their visit to De [Graafschap] on Sunday, they will probably have dedicated themselves to their annual task with new-found courage. Because in the interim-coach Dwight Lodeweges&apos; debut-match, the corset of preservation came off and the fallen champions actually showed some joy, relieved and happy that the new playing style allows for some adventure.&quot; Feyenoord, meanwhile, have just about sorted out their own problems. Off the field that is. Mario Been will become the widely endorsed new manager next season and his mentor, Leo Beenhakker, is rumoured to be his technical director. Against Been&apos;s NEC, however, Feyenoord looked like the feeble relegation candidates that they are on Sunday. In 12th place \u2013 two points above the drop zone \u2013 Feyenoord&apos;s clumsy last-gasp 1-0 loss  to NEC was thoroughly deserved. And how quickly a footballer acquires a sense of entitlement. Six months ago Georginio Wijnaldum was a 17-year old, overjoyed at making his Feyenoord debut. Yesterday he stormed off the field after being substituted for Jon Dahl Tomasson. In the capital a quick, spirited game was not robbed of its venom when the Ajax defender Thomas Vermaelen was sent off for taking out Heerenveen&apos;s breakaway attacker Roy Beerens on Saturday. But with their fifth red card this season \u2013 and third in three games \u2013 Ajax did destroy their chances of getting a result. Heerenveen&apos;s Daniel Pranjic scored from a free kick for the only goal of the game . &quot;After months of renewed hope and public support, cynicism once again took hold of the [Amsterdam] Arena on Saturday. Ten minutes before the end \u2026 the stadium had become half-empty,&quot; Maarten Wijffels wrote in Algemeen Dagblad. &quot;The manager was insulted on his way to the dressing room by a supporter. [The supporter] went ahead and thanked &apos;pancake&apos; Marco van Basten for yet another season without a national title. It hasn&apos;t quite come to that \u2026 But the scenario is very realistic.&quot; McClaren&apos;s Twente in fact had every chance of dropping Ajax into third place. In a drab 0-0 match  against FC Utrecht, dominated by Twente, a dozen or so chances weren&apos;t enough for Marko Arnautovic to lead his team to a Champions League-qualifier position in the standings. And following their relatively simple 2-0 win at Sparta through yet another goal by Mounir el Hamdaoui and one by Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, AZ are nine points clear. Dysfunctional one year, a beacon of stability and rest the next. In the land of the blind, one-eyed AZ are kings.

The Anglo-Dutch oil giant which made $50bn (\u00a335bn) in pre-tax profits in 2007, shifted its main tax-residence to the more benign climate of Holland after the merger of its twin UK and Netherlands arms in 2005. Shell simultaneously moved the ownership of its immensely valuable brands. Legal ownership of the trademarks now belongs to a subsidiary set up in the low-tax canton of Zug, which is entitled to charge royalties for their use to other Shell companies. The rights were shifted in February 2005 to Shell Brands International AG, a holding company registered in the former Alpine village of Baar, now part of a mini-conurbation joined to Zug itself. The canton hosts about 18,000 companies, mostly foreign entities set up to take advantage of corporate tax rates as low as 8%, with personal tax for expatriate executives at a similarly enticing level. This means that, legally speaking, Shell is now simultaneously a British public company, tax-resident in Amsterdam, whose brands are Swiss. Shell says: &quot;Shell Brands International paid Shell UK Ltd for certain trademarks. This payment was subject to corporation tax on capital gains in the UK. In the future, royalties are payable for the use of the trademark by UK companies&quot;. In fact, no tax was paid on the sale, because Shell was able to set it against other tax losses. The brand shift was for &quot;entirely commercial&quot; reasons, the company said. Control of the brands had been &quot;very fragmented&quot; but now there would be &quot;more effective and consistent management of the Shell trademarks&quot;. Shell&apos;s corporation tax bill to the UK was almost $1bn last year. That may seem a lot, but is actually only very small proportion of its $50bn profits. Most of its overall tax bill goes to foreign tax authorities. According to its accounts, only 5% of its total of $18bn tax payments went to Britain in 2007, 10% the previous year, and 6% in 2005. Shell says this is &quot;broadly in line with the proportion of group profits made in the UK&quot;. In 2002, Gordon Brown as chancellor announced plans to tighten up on UK companies which shifted their tax residence. But a few days before the rule came into effect, the accountants Ernst &amp; Young, who specialise in tax avoidance, registered a British off-the-shelf company called Forthdeal Ltd. Despite being British, it was controlled by Dutch directors and had Dutch tax residence. Forthdeal was subsequently passed on to Shell. Shell merged its UK and Dutch operations during 2004 and placed them all in this vehicle. It was renamed Royal Dutch Shell plc, and is now the parent of the whole of Shell&apos;s vast organisation. Holland was at the time attracting international businesses away from Britain, by allowing companies there to receive foreign dividends tax free. Shell, which was subsequently criticised by sources close to revenue officials for the manoeuvre, says: &quot;Changes came into effect in 2002 that altered the taxation of subsequently non-resident UK companies. Forthdeal was non-resident prior to the effective date of these rules. Forthdeal was therefore not subject to these changes.&quot; The company said the deal &quot;allowed us to maintain tax neutrality after the merger, ie maintain the tax position prevailing before unification&quot;.

Politicians, commentators and activists united to say to their fellow citizens that, no matter how outraged they felt at the loss of civilian life they had just witnessed, they should under no circumstances take out that anger on the Muslim community. Progressive voices insisted that Muslims were not to be branded as guilty by association, just because the killers of 9/11 and 7/7 had been Muslims and had claimed to act in the name of all Muslims. They urged Britons to be careful in their language, not to generalise from a few individuals to an entire community, to make clear to Britain&apos;s Muslims that they were a welcome part of the national life. One week after the 7/7 London attacks, a vast crowd gathered in Trafalgar Square to hear a call for unity led by then mayor Ken Livingstone, who said Londoners should not start looking for &quot;who to blame and who to hate&quot;. It was the right reaction and I am glad that, writing on these pages, I shared it, denouncing the surge in Islamophobia that greeted either a terrorist attack or the revelation of a terror plot. Yet there&apos;s been a curious silence in the last few weeks. Once again many are outraged by the loss of civilian life they have witnessed - this time in Gaza. Yet there has been no chorus of liberal voices insisting that, no matter how intense their fury, people must not take out that anger on Britain&apos;s Jewish community. It&apos;s worth stating the obvious - that Operation Cast Lead is not 9/11 or 7/7, that Israel is not al-Qaida - and noting that the silence has not been absolute. In a very welcome move, a group of leading Muslims wrote an open letter condemning apparent Gaza-related attacks on Jews. Meanwhile, Labour&apos;s Denis MacShane, in a passionate article for Progress magazine, urged those on the left not &quot;to turn criticism of Israel into a condemnation of Jews&quot;. Otherwise, it has been eerily quiet. Those who in 2001 or 2005 rapidly spoke out against guilt by association have been mute this time. Yet this is no abstract concern. For British Jews have indeed come under attack. According to the Community Security Trust, the body that monitors anti-Jewish racism, the four weeks after Cast Lead began saw an eightfold increase in antisemitic incidents in Britain compared with the same period a year earlier. It reports 250 incidents - nearly 10 a day - the highest number since it began its work 25 years ago. Among them are attacks on synagogues, including arson, and physical assaults on Jews. One man was set upon in Golders Green, north London, by two men who shouted, &quot;This is for Gaza&quot;, as they punched and kicked him to the ground. Blood-curding graffiti has appeared in Jewish areas across the country, slogans ranging from &quot;Slay the Jewish pigs&quot;, and &quot;Kill the Jews&quot;, to &quot;Jewish bastardz.&quot; Jewish schools have been advised to be on high alert against attack. Most now have security guards on the door; some have a police presence. The threat is real, and yet barely a word has been heard from those who pride themselves on their vigilance against racism. But there is more than a sin of omission here. Take last month&apos;s demonstrations against Israel. Riazat Butt, the Guardian&apos;s religious affairs correspondent, describes in a joint edition of the Guardian&apos;s Islamophonic and Sounds Jewish podcasts how at one demo she heard the cry not only of &quot;Down with Israel&quot; but &quot;Kill Jews&quot;. An anti-war protest in Amsterdam witnessed chants of: &quot;Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas.&quot; At the London events, there were multiple placards deploying what has now become a commonplace image: the Jewish Star of David equated with the swastika. From the podium George Galloway declared: &quot;Today, the Palestinian people in Gaza are the new Warsaw ghetto, and those who are murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the Jews in Warsaw in 1943.&quot; Now what, do you imagine, is the effect of repeating, again and again, that Israel is a Nazi state? Even those with the scantest historical knowledge know that the Nazis are the embodiment of evil to which the only appropriate response is hate. How surprising is it if a young man, already appalled by events in Gaza, walks home from a demo and glimpses the Star of David - which he now sees as a latter-day swastika - outside a synagogue and decides to torch the building, or at least desecrate it? Yet Galloway, along with Livingstone, who was so careful in July 2005, did not hesitate to make the comparison (joined by a clutch of Jewish anti-Israel activists who should know better). The counter-arguments here are predictable. Some will say they take pains to distinguish between Zionists and Jews. Intellectually, that&apos;s fine; in the seminar room, it holds water. The trouble is, it doesn&apos;t mean much on the street - at least not to the man who saw a group of Manchester Jews leaving synagogue on January 17 and shouted &quot;Free Palestine, you motherfuckers,&quot; before giving them the Nazi salute. The liberal left should know this already. After all, when Jack Straw wrote his notorious piece about the hijab, full of qualifications, progressives understood that none of that would matter: it would be read as an attack on all Muslims. And so it was. For all Straw&apos;s careful phrasing, Muslim women whose heads were covered were attacked. Liberals warned Straw that he was playing with fire. Today&apos;s anti-Israel activists need to realise they are doing the same. Besides, this business of distinguishing between good and bad Jews has a long history. Anthony Julius, author of a definitive study of English antisemitism, says that, with the exception of the Nazis, Jew-haters have always made distinctions. Christian antisemites accepted Jews who were ready to convert and rejected those who refused. A century ago, Winston Churchill drew a line between homegrown British Jews and those spreading Bolshevism. Now the dividing line is affinity for Israel. But the logical corollary of this is that, if Jews refuse to dissociate themselves from Israel, then they are fair game for abuse and attack until they publicly recant. Liberals rightly recoil from the constant pressure on Muslims to explain themselves and denounce jihadism or even islamism. Yet they make the same implicit demand when they suggest Jews are OK, unless they are Zionists. The effect is to make Jews&apos; place in British society contingent on their distance from their fellow Jews, in this case, Israelis. Nor is it good enough to say that most Jews support Israel. Yes, most have a strong affinity and family ties to the Jewish state. But that doesn&apos;t mean they support every policy, including the one that led to such mayhem in Gaza. And do we think that those who kicked the man in Golders Green first stopped to ask his opinion of the merits of Cast Lead? I know that some will say that even raising this is an attempt to divert attention from the real and larger issue, Israel&apos;s brutality in Gaza and the colossal number of civilian deaths that entailed. I won&apos;t accept that. Regular readers know that I denounced Cast Lead from the beginning. But I shouldn&apos;t have to say that. These two matters are separate. It is perfectly possible to condemn Israel&apos;s current conduct and to stand firmly against anti-Jewish prejudice. And it&apos;s about time liberals and the left said so. freedland@theguardian.com \u2022 Comments on this article will open at 9am GMT", "sentences": ["An anti-war protest in Amsterdam witnessed chants of: &quot;Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas.&quot; At the London events, there were multiple placards deploying what has now become a commonplace image: the Jewish Star of David equated with the swastika."], "title": "Jonathan Freedland: As British Jews come under attack, the liberal left must not remain silent", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/04/gaza-jewish-community", "tags": ["Gaza", "Judaism", "Religion", "UK news", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-06T00:01:00Z", "article": "First things first. Try to forget that Jacques Brel, the Belgian singer-songwriter, is indirectly responsible for Terry Jacks&apos;s Seasons in the Sun. Forget also for a moment Scott Walker, whose obsession with Brel in the late 1960s tends to dominate discussions about the chansonnier, with largely obfuscatory results. Brel&apos;s much-translated songs of sex, death, bruised romance and equivocal cynicism have influenced generations of artists, but to understand why, it&apos;s necessary to return to the source.  Gavin Friday, the Irish singer and ex-Virgin Prune who has recorded several of Brel&apos;s songs, recalls seeing him perform for the first time. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what the fuck was coming at me,&quot; he says. &quot;I just couldn&apos;t believe the man. The kicking-against-the-pricks theory, that&apos;s what I picked up on. It was like the next stage up from David Bowie doing Starman or Johnny Lydon doing Pretty Vacant on Top of the Pops. The physicality. The expression. I became obsessed.&quot;  For the Divine Comedy&apos;s Neil Hannon, he was &quot;beautifully ugly&quot; - an odd, unreliable man who wore good suits and whose music set &quot;a wonderful example of the absolute need to be yourself and say exactly what you think, regardless of what the public seem to want&quot;. Marc Almond, a longtime fan who once recorded an entire album of Brel songs, says: &quot;He&apos;s in everything I do. Songs like Say Hello Wave Goodbye have a Brelian sense of disillusioned romance. As a singer, I&apos;ve always looked at myself as an expressive storyteller rather than a technician, and that comes from him.&quot;  It&apos;s timely to return to Brel. The 30th anniversary of his death passed last year - he died from lung cancer, aged 49, in October 1978 - and a new compilation revisits his earliest recordings. Brel was born in Brussels on 8 April 1929, and his performance career was brief: he gave up singing live in 1966 and was in semi-retirement for the last 10 years of his life.  He first sang and acted in Franche Cord\u00e9e, a Catholic youth organisation, before attaining modest success as a performer in Belgium. Only then did he head for Paris to conquer the music halls. He made two albums for Philips Records between 1954 and 1957, and it is this fledgling period of his career that is covered by the new collection, In the 50s: The Birth of Genius. Remastered by Teenage Fanclub&apos;s Norman Blake, In the 50s is undeniably proto-Brel, the faltering footsteps of an artist still getting into his stride - though, as Blake says, &quot;there are flashes of what&apos;s to come&quot;.  Almond argues that a singer has to have lived a little before he or she can really get to grips with Brel&apos;s songs. Perhaps that applied to Brel as much as anyone. By the time the 60s began, he had piled up experience. His wife Miche and their three children had returned to Brussels, unable to cope with Brel&apos;s philandering and disappearing acts. His religious belief also failed to survive; instead, he placed his faith in flawed humanity and the certainty of death. Experience made his world-view darker, his themes more uncompromising, but there remained a sermonising streak in his work: an identifiable moral centre among the pimps, prostitutes and disillusionment. Hannon describes the song Amsterdam as the &quot;apotheosis of that mix of brutal honesty and absolute beauty: life is shit, everybody is horrible, but isn&apos;t it wonderful!&quot; By 1959 and the release of his fourth album, La Valse \u00e0 Mille Temps, Brel was a star in the francophone world, writing the songs that would ensure his legacy. Beyond their lyrical brilliance, La Mort (My Death, in its English version), Ne Me Quitte Pas (If You Go Away), Au Suivant (Next), Amsterdam and dozens of others are inventively arranged and rich in their use of instrumentation; they remain remarkably resonant today. La Diable (\u00c7a Va) is a song about western arrogance, colonial ghosts and bombs exploding on railway lines; Fils De ... is a deeply human anti-war song. There again, he was just as likely to sing about aeroplanes. Friday expresses awe at &quot;the width of what he sang about - not just the poignant love songs, but his political songs. And he wrote about things that people don&apos;t write about, like old people. There aren&apos;t many people who cover that vast spectrum.&quot;  Like many Brel fans, Friday was turned on by Bowie&apos;s and Scott Walker&apos;s performances of Brel songs. Walker first heard Brel in 1966 and plundered his songbook on his first three solo albums. The songs introduced the former heartthrob and Walker Brother to avant-garde euro-experimentalism, and he disappeared headlong into the possibilities. &quot;I believe Brel had a profound effect on that man,&quot; says Friday who, alongside Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn, worked with Walker during the recent Tilting and Drifting show at the Barbican. &quot;I think it was Brel that tipped him into where he&apos;s gone now. He &apos;Europeaned&apos; him.&quot;  Bowie, meanwhile, covered Amsterdam on the B-side of his 1973 single Sorrow and frequently played My Death in concert. The versions performed by Bowie and Walker, however, did not come from Brel, who wrote exclusively in French. Following Brel&apos;s first appearance in New York in 1963, his songs were translated first by the poet Rod McKuen, and later by Eric Blau and Mort Shuman, who in 1968 put together the off-Broadway stage show Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris. Subsequent renderings by everyone from Tom Jones and Dionne Warwick to Judy Collins and Alex Harvey brought his songs into the mainstream.  The translations range from the superior to the woeful. Blau and Shuman&apos;s rendering of La Mort, for example, is wonderful. Norman Blake picks out one particular line: &quot;&apos;My death waits like a Bible truth/ At the funeral of my youth&apos; - my God, it&apos;s astounding, absolute genius.&quot;  Less astounding are the disastrous transformations where, like some drunken game of Chinese Whispers, the original meaning is obliterated. In the hands of McKuen, the acerbic Le Moribond - a bitter, briskly cynical farewell from a dying man to his unfaithful wife and hypocritical friends - became the saccharine Seasons in the Sun, last heard being trilled by Westlife. Zach Condon of the band Beirut, who often performs Le Moribond in concert, dismisses Seasons in the Sun as a song where &quot;the dagger of his words has been taken out: &apos;I can see you all crying and wiping your noses above my grave, and I laugh at you.&apos; That&apos;s all gone.&quot; The fact is, Brel&apos;s humour, verve and honesty are tamed by the English language. One of the worst sufferers is Ne Me Quitte Pas, perhaps his most famous song. It was translated by McKuen as If You Go Away and covered by everyone from Nana Mouskouri to Frank Sinatra. Almond first became familiar with Dusty Springfield&apos;s &quot;toned-down&quot; version, but when he wanted to record the song himself, he went back to a &quot;truer&quot; translation of the original, which addressed Brel&apos;s affair with Paris impresario Suzanne Gabriello. &quot;It becomes a pleading, desperate song - voyeuristic, sexual and sinister,&quot; he says. &quot;The English translations have become the [accepted] versions of his songs, but you always lose something.&quot; Because Brel has been translated so often and his songs sung by such a wide variety of artists, it&apos;s common for English speakers to enjoy his work by proxy. Yet it&apos;s arguable that no translation really does him justice. &quot;I&apos;m close to fluent in French, but Brel was the first to really prove to me that you can&apos;t just directly translate songs,&quot; says Condon. As for Hannon, he recalls his French teacher struggling to explain what some of the lyrics in Amsterdam meant: &quot;There&apos;s a line in the first verse, a metaphor about the flags hanging from the buildings across the canal, and the way they drooped was like the atmosphere or something. It was hard even for her to understand it.&quot;  The best way to get around the problem is to watch Brel in action. Visit YouTube, or get your hands on Comme Quand On Etait Beau, a DVD of Brel&apos;s collected TV appearances. &quot;His magnetism breaks down the language barrier,&quot; says Almond. &quot;You don&apos;t necessarily have to understand every word he&apos;s singing - he makes you understand the story through the way he delivers it. He lives inside his songs.&quot; A word of warning, however. Anyone expecting echoes of Scott Walker&apos;s Adonis voice and lush orchestral pop will be in for a shock. Brel&apos;s sturdy baritone is technically ordinary but emotionally compelling, and the songs tend to zip along, propelled by flailing arms and guttural exclamations. Watching him sing is a physical, visceral experience. &quot;Brel is sweaty,&quot; says Friday. &quot;You can imagine him spitting on you if you&apos;re in the front row. It would be good to bring the blood and guts, the smelly Brel, back into play.&quot;  For musicians such as Friday and Hannon, the stark, grown-up realities of Brel are appealing when the posturing faux-rebellion of rock&apos;n&apos;roll starts to pall. &quot;Britain has a terribly snobby attitude to continental Europe and its musical traditions,&quot; says Hannon. &quot;But I vastly prefer most of it. We need it now more than ever; we have to admit that mostly everything this last decade has been complete rubbish. Rock&apos;n&apos;roll has had a good innings, but we don&apos;t have to be tied to that template. We can move on.&quot; Deviate from the orthodoxy of the traditional rock lineage, the one that starts at Rocket 88 and ends somewhere around Smells Like Teen Spirit, and it&apos;s not hard to see Brel as a father figure to some of our greatest, most emotionally expressive songwriters. He comes through loud and clear, both musically and lyrically, in the early songs of Leonard Cohen; he&apos;s there in the torch songs of Tom Waits, all grubby dockside glamour. He&apos;s there in Jarvis Cocker&apos;s words and in Joan as Police Woman and in Rufus Wainwright&apos;s defiantly non-rockist tilt at pop drama. Even in translation, he expanded the vocabulary available to pop songwriters, yet he remains woefully underappreciated as an artist in his own right.  True, language may be a barrier, but Friday has an answer: &quot;It&apos;s like a painting, isn&apos;t it? I might not understand everything literally, but I have the gist of it.&quot; In other words, with Brel you either trust your French or you trust your gut. Either way, the effort is richly rewarded.  \u2022 Jacques Brel in the 50s: The Birth of Genius is out now on Poppydisc", "sentences": ["Hannon describes the song Amsterdam as the &quot;apotheosis of that mix of brutal honesty and absolute beauty: life is shit, everybody is horrible, but isn&apos;t it wonderful!&quot; By 1959 and the release of his fourth album, La Valse \u00e0 Mille Temps, Brel was a star in the francophone world, writing the songs that would ensure his legacy.", "Beyond their lyrical brilliance, La Mort (My Death, in its English version), Ne Me Quitte Pas (If You Go Away), Au Suivant (Next), Amsterdam and dozens of others are inventively arranged and rich in their use of instrumentation; they remain remarkably resonant today.", "He &apos;Europeaned&apos; him.&quot;  Bowie, meanwhile, covered Amsterdam on the B-side of his 1973 single Sorrow and frequently played My Death in concert.", "As for Hannon, he recalls his French teacher struggling to explain what some of the lyrics in Amsterdam meant: &quot;There&apos;s a line in the first verse, a metaphor about the flags hanging from the buildings across the canal, and the way they drooped was like the atmosphere or something."], "title": "Graeme Thomson on the legendary Jacques Brel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/06/jacques-brel", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-06T14:16:57Z", "article": "If the runaway threat of nuclear proliferation ever explodes into Armageddon, the chances are that someone will blame the Pakistani scientist and international salesman Abdul Qadeer Khan for the devastation. Born into relatively modest circumstances in Bhopal, India, in 1936, Khan was the son of a schoolteacher. The family moved to Pakistan five years after the bloodshed of partition. Khan&apos;s political loyalties were always directed towards the Muslim state. Following university in Karachi, the enthusiastic young metallurgist was sent abroad to pursue postgraduate studies in West Germany and Belgium. He took a job at Urenco, a British-Dutch-German consortium developing uranium enrichment, in the city of Almelo, in the eastern Netherlands. In 1976, he returned home and was appointed head of the country&apos;s nuclear programme. India&apos;s first successful nuclear test, in 1974, had spurred its rival and neighbour to accelerate research efforts to build a bomb. After leaving Holland, Khan was sentenced to four years in prison by an Amsterdam court for industrial espionage \u2013 allegedly for stealing sensitive enrichment technology blueprints. The sentence was later dismissed on appeal. The Khan Research Laboratory at Kahuta in Pakistan soon became the centre of Pakistan&apos;s nuclear research. It developed the use of multiple centrifuges to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level. Pakistan&apos;s first nuclear test was conducted in May 1998, but it was the subsequent nuclear proliferation scandal that brought Khan to international attention. The development of almost identical nuclear centrifuge programmes by Iran, North Korea and Libya focused attention on Khan&apos;s alleged sale of the technology to countries the Bush administration deemed &quot;rogue states&quot;. The interception of a shipment bound for Libya in 2003 prompted an international outcry and led to intense political pressure on Pakistan to rein in the nuclear entrepreneur. Khan confessed in an interview on state-run television the following year, admitting that for 15 years he had supplied nuclear equipment and secrets to foreign countries. He offered his &quot;deepest regrets and unqualified apologies&quot;, adding: &quot;I take full responsibility for my actions and seek your pardon.&quot; Last year he said he disowned that confession.

It will. Roda JC and Fortuna Sittard look set to merge next season \u2013 in what could be the biggest Dutch transfer of the year. They are both looking at considerable shortfalls this season. Although the neighbouring clubs had been discussing becoming FC Limburg \u2013 after their province \u2013 since 2002, the financial crisis must have been a consideration. Perhaps, as in the business world, corporations are the inevitable future of football. Certainly the game is not immune to mergers, takeovers and downsizing. While the corporate world continues to devour itself, football too could find itself with fewer and fewer clubs. It could be that, not long from now, the proud Dutch province of Limburg, once home to four smallish, if solvent, football clubs, will be left with one. The two other remaining clubs, MVV and VVV, are not likely to thrive anytime soon. Combined as one, FC Limburg could grow strong by gobbling up all the fans in the region, the way Heerenveen and FC Groningen have done up north. They need to. Because with people forever moving to the bigger cities in the west, the gap in budgets is becoming prohibitive. In 2002, after the city of Maastricht had staved off MVV&apos;s impending bankruptcy, Roda, Fortuna and MVV took the initiative to discuss a possible FC Limburg after previously rejecting such calls from outsiders in 1996. After meeting in secret, the clubs abandoned the plan, despite 80% of Limburgers polling in favour of it. When the Dutch federation advised the clubs to reopen talks in October the clubs declined, saying they were not interested. But in November Roda and Fortuna presented a statement of intent to merge. They then announced that the club would definitely not be called FC Limburg. Last week, at long last, an exploratory group confirmed that it would be wise to join forces. Financial backers have been found and the new club&apos;s budget will be at least 25% higher than Roda&apos;s is this year. Since Fortuna played in the Eerste Divisie \u2013 one rung below the Eredivisie \u2013 the new side will take Roda&apos;s spot in the top flight, provided that Roda are not relegated, which is not altogether certain. The Dutch federation director, Henk Kesler, assumes MVV will naturally join them later. Whether it&apos;s for the best or not, the fans are seriously pissed off. When Limburg&apos;s regional leader brought up the FC Limburg idea again a year ago he needed police protection for a month. A series of demonstrations took place against the merger and several other high-ups were also threatened. The proverbial bigger picture was sprayed over with graffiti. To no avail. It is hard to ignore the hypocrisy of the protests. Roda JC themselves are a product of a fusion of two clubs, which in turn were born out of two more mergers. Fortuna, the first professional club in the Netherlands, are on the brink of bankruptcy. The inevitable demise of football in Limburg if clubs don&apos;t merge would be a real shame as Limburg was one of the cradles of professional football in the Netherlands. A double round of Eredivisie action this week was symbolic of Roda&apos;s troubles. They outplayed their opponents twice and lost on both occasions. On Wednesday AZ eked out a 1-0 win after Mounir El Hamdaoui converted his team&apos;s only real chance of the match. On Saturday, Sparta similarly won when a sublime Rydell Poepon free-kick felled a superior Roda in front of yet another half-empty stadium. The biggest on-field story of the week was Ajax, who finally unravelled after being poor but effective all year. Last Tuesday they were denied a last-minute winner against Heracles, who had been 2\u20130 ahead, after an effort was wrongly ruled offside. Marco van Basten went berserk. But when playing a team whose annual operating budget amounts to less than a third of what you spent on transfers during the summer alone, that&apos;s a weak excuse. Van Basten&apos;s tirade did, however, lead to the referee and errant linesman being &quot;rested&quot; for the weekend games. But at Vitesse on Sunday Ajax were as hapless as they have been in my lifetime. Van Basten&apos;s latest tactical blunder saw him field only three defenders. Clearly lacking a man, the back line was pulverised by a modestly talented Vitesse in a 4\u20131 defeat. It could well have been 6\u20131 or 7\u20131. Ajax were awful. Just awful. After taking a solitary point from the past four matches, Ajax are out. And Van Basten should follow. &quot;Will I be able to get things going?&quot; asked Van Basten, who has been exposed as way out of his depth. &quot;I would hope so. Have I thought of quitting? Those sorts of things go through my head sometimes.&quot; On Friday &quot;fans&quot; forced their way on to the practice field, disrupting badly needed training. On Sunday, they briefly blocked the bus trying to return to the stadium. But while Ajax are sinking without trace, PSV are resurfacing and are now only a point off Ajax&apos;s third place. On Thursday an unchained PSV pummelled ADO 6\u20130 through three Balazs Dzsudzsak goals. In a crackpot game at Volendam on Sunday, PSV bagged five more to win 5\u20133. Their wonderful new striker Ola Toivonen scored yet again before wrestling and elbowing his way to two yellow cards \u2013 becoming the fourth player to be sent off on Sunday. He was around long enough to prove that he and Ibrahim Afellay form the most gifted pairing in the Netherlands, though. Steve McClaren and his merry FC Twente gang had a fair week, beating NAC 4\u20131 in a sloppy game last Wednesday but drawing 2\u20132 with a sturdy De Graafschap on Sunday. They have every chance of retaining their deserved second place, giving them a shot at next year&apos;s Champions League. By the way, the Ajax supporter who rightly insulted Marco van Basten by calling him a &quot;pancake&quot; after yet another debacle against Heerenveen last week is in danger of being barred from the Amsterdam Arena for up to a year. No campaign for his reinstatement is in place as of yet.

It&apos;s been fascinating to observe the &quot;world&apos;s greatest orchestra&quot; (according to Gramophone&apos;s recent poll, something the orchestra&apos;s management are making the most of here) put together a performance of a piece they didn&apos;t know at the start of the week, but which, in concerts at the Concertgebouw Thursday and Friday, they were soon playing with complete authority.  Amazing, too, to observe Jansons&apos;s rehearsal psychology, which is a miraculous balance between going into fine, finicky detail, yet still allowing the players enough room to breathe and create the music&apos;s larger architecture. Clever stuff. It&apos;s been a revelation to talk to the players as well - including two British principals in the band, flautist Emily Beynon and double-bassist Dominic Seldis - who say that the hall may well be the finest acoustic to hear an orchestra if you&apos;re sitting in the audience, but the players themselves need to work hard to hear each other on the platform. It&apos;s all part of the alchemy of the Concertgebouw sound, the warmth and richness that is the result of a 120-year-long symbiosis between the players and the building. More of that in longer, book form soon!  The photo, by the way, is a view of my favourite stairway in classical music: the 26 red-carpeted steps that any Concertgebouw conductor has to negotiate to get on to the stage. They&apos;re steep, too, and since every step you take through the choir stalls to the podium is made in full view of 2,000 people, it must be one of the most precipitous adventures a conductor gets to take - and that&apos;s even before the concert starts. But the Concertgebouw isn&apos;t the loudest or even the most impressive sound I&apos;ve heard in Holland: at Paradiso, Amsterdam&apos;s venue for the adventurous extremes of musical life, I saw Fear Falls Burning. In a tiny venue, with about 50 people standing in front of a small stage, a lone guitarist, Dirk Serries (whose former nom de plume was vidnaObmana) produced an inexorable tsunami of guitar drones. From the simplest of musical material - a minor arpeggio, a simple loop - he conjured a physical musical experience that was huge in scale, and monumental in its sonic sophistication. Building up layers of distortion, pedal effects and overtones, this was guitar-playing as sound sculpture. There were three gigantic movements in his set, the final one built on a drum pattern as well as his guitar riffs (the slowest 4/4 rhythmic pattern I&apos;ve ever heard, only amplifying the sense of grand, ritualistic stasis of the music). He closed with a moment of musical theatre, leaving the stage and letting his loops and riffs build towards a moment of ear-shattering intensity - and then cutting off abruptly, leaving a shocked and shocking silence.

Should you think really hard about the extent to which butterfly effects have shaped the game, it hurts your head more than a night on the pop. In World Cups alone there have been fives of examples of ultimately successful sides who came within a whisker of not even qualifying: France in 1982, England in 1990, Bulgaria in 1994, Brazil in 2002 - and Holland in 1974. Football&apos;s summer of love so nearly didn&apos;t happen. If Belgium had not had a goal erroneously disallowed in the 89th minute of the final qualifier in Amsterdam, Holland would not have been at the World Cup in West Germany, and the game would have forked off in a different direction. Total Football was almost totalled before the world had seen it. A 16-team tournament meant that qualification was not the formality it is these days, even for the pre-eminent sides. History also weighed on Holland. They had not made the World Cup finals since 1938, nor had they reached the European Championships two years earlier. But their star was irrefutably in the ascendant, as shown by Ajax&apos;s three consecutive, swaggering European Cup victories between 1971-73. Alongside Holland in qualification Group 3 were Belgium, a very handy side who had finished third at Euro 72, and the makeweights of Norway and Iceland, two essentially useless teams in an era when Nordic sides were to be seen and not heard. Both Belgium and Holland played both qualification fixtures against Iceland on home soil. (Even Mum was loth to go Iceland in those days.) Belgium twice won 4-0 and then beat Norway 2-0 in Oslo. But as soon as Holland obliterated Norway 9-0 in their first game, it became apparent that the Dutch would have the edge in goal difference and that qualification would almost certainly be decided by the matches between Belgium and Holland. The first, in Antwerp on 19 November 1972, was dripping with enmity and ended 0-0 after Jean Thissen thumped a post for Belgium. After that match, Belgium would not play another qualifier for 11 months, in which time they played only one friendly, and their semi-legendary coach Raymond Goethals presumably sat watching his bank account get fatter. In the meantime Holland, managed by the Czechoslovakian Frantisek Fadrhonc (Rinus Michels would not take over until 1974), stuffed Iceland 13-1 over two games. That left both sides level on points with two games to play: Holland away to Norway, then Belgium at home to Norway, and finally the meeting between the two in Amsterdam, 364 days after the first match. Crucially Holland&apos;s goal difference was +21 to Belgium&apos;s +10. Holland made the heaviest weather of beating Norway in Oslo, but Johan Cruyff got them out of strife with a delicious backheel to create Barry Hulshoff&apos;s 87th-minute winner. Had they drawn, Belgium - who subsequently beat Norway 2-0 at home - would only have needed a draw in the final game in Amsterdam. Now they needed a win. Given the stakes, we might legitimately have expected cat and mouse, but nobody expected catenaccio from Belgium. Goethals, like George Graham at Anfield in 1989, went with the counterintuitive tactic of almost blanket defence - not unreasonably theorising that, in an open game and on their own patch, Holland could tear Belgium apart, and that the longer it stayed 0-0, the more nervous the home crowd and players would become. It also served to disorientate the Dutch, who had the slightly befuddled gait of men who had arrived at the wrong type of orgy. Holland did not know whether to stick or twist and, though their natural class led to the outstanding Belgian goalkeeper Christian Piot making some very decent saves, Belgium kept the score at 0-0. Still, however, they barely attacked. They were reticent to the point of absurdity, like a boxer who knew he was going to be beaten on points but didn&apos;t throw a punch in the final round. Then, in the 89th minute, came the Hitchcockian haymaker. With Holland pushing up for offside, the captain Paul van Himst&apos;s long free-kick beat the Holland keeper Piet Schrijvers&apos;s wretched flap and was touched into the empty net by Jan Verheyen. With history about to be written by the victors, Goethals&apos; tactical masterplan was complete. Or at least it would have been, had the goal not been disallowed for offside. Yet replays showed it wasn&apos;t even close: when the free-kick was taken, Verheyen was being played onside by at least three defenders. It was a Total Scandal. So Holland went through, and Belgium failed to qualify despite not conceding a single goal in their six qualifying matches. Goethals took great pride in those two clean sheets against Holland, particularly after they ran riot at the World Cup finals, and Belgium - unlike certain other countries on the wrong end of a shocking decision in a decisive World Cup qualifier in Holland - got on with their lives. For the Holland players, life would change for ever in West Germany the following summer. So would football. With their hippie chic, Holland freed the minds - and manes - of an insular sport, yet if they had not made it there would have been no Total Football, no pom-poms and pomposity, no instant friendship between football and the cerebrum, no empowerment for future generations of Dutch players. Cruyff would have joined Barry Ferguson on the list of great players never to appear at the World Cup, and a great West German side would have got the credit they deserved. And those are only the things we can logically conclude; never mind myriad unforeseen consequences. All that because of one tiny but crucial mistake. Total Football? Bloody hell.

The move is a blow for UK education. Almost 100,000 students take the IB diploma across the world every year, 3,315 of whom are from the UK. And 681,000 students worldwide take other IB courses. Around 300 employees are expected to lose their jobs in Cardiff when the headquarters is moved to Amsterdam. The company has experienced unprecedented growth over the last few years. The number of programmes IB offers has grown by 10% each year for more than 20 years. The 330 employees at the IB&apos;s main office, in Cardiff, take much of the credit for this and were furious to be told yesterday that the headquarters will move from the Welsh capital to Amsterdam by 2020. Bosses have told staff \u2013 many of whom are experts in assessment and curricula \u2013 that they are &quot;isolated&quot; in Cardiff and lack an international mindset. Monique Seefried, chair of the IB&apos;s board of governors, came from the US to speak to employees in Cardiff in September. She told them leaders of the company found that &quot;you in Cardiff remain very isolated from the needs of schools and of the cultures that the IB aspires to serve&quot;. The &quot;organisational structure&quot; in Cardiff did not fit with the &quot;ethos of international-mindedness that we insist upon&quot;, she said. Jeffrey Beard, the IB&apos;s director-general, told Cardiff staff in a presentation in May that the Welsh capital was remote, making it &quot;difficult to attract qualified staff&quot;, and was tricky for air travel. The company is offering staff the chance to relocate, but few are thought to be keen to do so. Cardiff has been the headquarters of the company for 20 years. In a letter to the company&apos;s board of governors, staff wrote: &quot;It may prove impossible to maintain the high standard and reputation of the IB when such a drastic and unnecessary step is taken. It is simply too risky to put the future of the IB at stake.&quot; Another said: &quot;The anger and desperation of staff in Cardiff are not simply a matter of self-interest. &quot;Many of us have given years of service to the IB, enabling it to grow to its present size. We do not want to see this work and commitment squandered. The proposed move from Cardiff to a more expensive location, where recruitment will be more difficult and more costly, is potentially disastrous for the organisation.&quot; A spokeswoman from the IB said parts of the assessment operation associated with the marking of thousands of exam scripts twice a year would be kept in Cardiff indefinitely. Beard said: &quot;We are implementing some hard choices that have resulted from our studies, but will do so with respect and gratitude to those who have got us this far, whom we very much value. It is with a sense of purpose and excitement that we are taking the organisation to the next stage of its development, expanding its possibilities and with it the possibilities of children all over the world.&quot; The IB diploma is now regarded as more academically challenging and broader than taking three or four A-levels. The university admissions service counts the top IB score as equivalent to six A grade A-levels. Overseas, the diploma can be taught in French, Spanish and English.

You&apos;ll recognise them &apos;cos they&apos;re both black.&quot; The officers sweated up to the top of the hill and told the people there who they wanted to talk to. Everyone stared at them. &quot;Aqua and Sulis? You sure about that?&quot; they asked. &quot;Definitely,&quot; the policemen replied. And so they were taken to meet the two black piglets that were kept as pets at the camp. No one returned from Solsbury Hill unchanged. The battle against Batheaston bypass was a turning point in the fight against the government&apos;s road building programme, and in the lives of many of the people who became involved in it. The protest - the first camp was set up on February 20, 1994 - began at a critical moment, when a raw, uncertain movement had begun to coalesce and find its voice. People emerged at the other end with a sense that life was richer - with experience and possibility - than they had imagined. Under Margaret Thatcher, the government had decided to build a network of new motorways and trunk roads in order to realise her dream of universal driving. Hers was a programme not just to facilitate car ownership, but also to close down the alternatives. We fought for Solsbury Hill because of what it was, what it represented. It was one of the few quiet places in a corner of England that was becoming ever noisier; a scene of slow beauty, of rough pasture, elder coverts and dense hedges, capped with an ancient hill fort. It epitomised the places we were losing to development in every county. Some protesters were local, the rest came from all over the country. Draconian laws When the first bedraggled refugees from Tory Britain arrived at Solsbury, they were still ahead in the arms race. The police, bailiffs and private security guards had not yet learnt how to extract people easily from the trees and their machinery. Nor had the draconian laws that would have made the whole protest illegal - the Criminal Justice Act, passed at the end of 1994, the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act or the 2005 Serious Organised Crime and Police Act - yet been passed. Britain, to an extent perhaps forgotten today, was still free. The first permanent arrivals at the camp built simple shelters of hazel sticks and canvas on the ground, as well as rudimentary treehouses as high as they dared to live. At times, the place looked more like a circus than a protest camp. Indeed, three of the tree dwellers went on to become professional acrobats. This was &quot;green politics&quot; at its most primeval and real. In an age when environmentalists are now likely to be wearing suits, it can be hard to imagine a time in which being &quot;green&quot; was not a fashionable metropolitan accessory but a political choice that set you apart from the reasonable majority. Solsbury leaves us with lessons. Some of today&apos;s office-bound environmentalists, talking of parts per million of carbon and the importance of &quot;sustainable development&quot;, would do well to remember that green politics, if it means anything, is born from a love of the natural world, and that a love of the natural world is fostered by being part of it. A sense of place, the smell of a night fire and the sensation of rain leaking through the roof of a bender are better guides to what is right and wrong than any number of policy papers. We lost the fight over Solsbury Hill, and Bath has been left with a high-spec dual carriageway to nowhere. But building our way out of congestion and pollution is now a discredited idea, and for this the campaigners of Solsbury Hill can claim some responsibility. In that respect, at least, victory was ours. \u2022 An exhibition based on the book will be held at Walcot Chapel gallery, Bath, from 17-28 February. Details at solsburyhill.org.uk Life-Changing experiences: The protesters&apos; tales Indra The locals asked us to come, and I was on the last bus to roll out. I had never heard the words capitalism or particulates, but Solsbury attracted brilliant people who taught each other. It looked as if we were trying to save a few trees, but it was much more than that. It was the first protest where people lived in the trees. Throwing ourselves against machines was all we knew. It was the most profound and powerful experience in my life. When it finished, there could be no turning back. When you know what&apos;s happening to the world, or who is doing the damage, it&apos;s painful not to do anything. I&apos;ve been working as a community development worker on a rundown estate in Brighton. Now I am the co-ordinator for a Travellers&apos; schools charity. My children go to the climate camp. My 18-year-old takes herself to marches and camps. I am so proud of them. Nick Pepper I spent six months at Solsbury and it empowered me massively. It was the seed for all the other protests that followed. I carried on protesting for 10 years, then went to Australia. I ended up 60 metres up a tree there and we stopped old-growth logging. Now I am back and have been part of a group trying to stop the Weymouth relief road. I have been working as a rigger and a climber, but I am now going to do a woodland management course. I am an ecologist, but I am classed as an enemy of the state. I just feel sorry for the police forward intelligence team who still follow me round. What a waste of their time! Jerry Solsbury defined my life for many years. I gave up a law degree to go there - went for a weekend, then another, and then I stayed. We were a mixture of the homeless and jobless. There was a massive pool of people waiting for something to happen. There are parallels with today. The lesson from it is that is you have to force the changes in Britain. I still see government pandering to the environment. The government still has to be dragged. After 10 years of protest, I had no possessions at all. In 2002, I went to Amsterdam and bought a wooden ship and restored it. I shall bring her back to Britain, get involved again, and set up a party for all the people who do not vote. We need to do an Obama! Cathy Jordan I was a local. I lived in Balebrook on the side of Solsbury Hill. It&apos;s a totally different place now. It was a haven, but now the countryside has been pushed back. I am completely different, too. Before the road came, I was politically naive. It changed me completely. I learned about how things work. I had not thought how decisions are made. I now see the government was taking the mickey. The public inquiry was there to shut people up. It&apos;s only when good, honest, normal people get together and say &quot;This is stupidity&quot; that things change. It&apos;s madness what is happening now. Ordinary people must stand up and say no. We stood up. We were ordinary. Now I lobby and write and get involved in other campaigns.Interviews by John Vidal", "sentences": ["In 2002, I went to Amsterdam and bought a wooden ship and restored it."], "title": "George Monbiot on the anti-road protest that still influences environmentalists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/11/solsbury-hill-adrian-arbib", "tags": ["Environmental activism", "Travel and transport", "Environment", "Books", "Exhibitions", "Transport", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-11T15:11:12Z", "article": "There is a whiff of political surrealism about the tale of Geert Wilders, the virulently anti-Islamic Dutch MP who has been banned from coming to London this week on public order grounds. He had received an invitation to show his documentary short &quot;Fitna&quot;, a chaotic rant calling for the banning of the Koran \u2013 being &quot;worse than Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf&quot; in the MP&apos;s view \u2013 and the rejection of Islam.  Lord Ahmed, the Labour peer, had vigorously protested about the Dutch politician and his film, and said they should not darken the doors of the Palace of Westminster. On Tuesday night, according to the Daily Telegraph, the banning order was issued by the government. Wilders has made hay, declaring this an attack on his freedom of speech and getting the Dutch foreign minister to complain to David Miliband. Enjoying his martyr role, Wilders plans to challenge the ban and says he now needs 24-hour police protection. There seems to be a huge amount of hyperbole about the reaction of the authorities to Wilders, leader of the hard-right and crudely populist Dutch party for Freedom (PVV). The film came out last year. Patently, it isn&apos;t much good. It can be widely seen on the Internet on the sister channel to Wikipedia, Wikileak.  The film is crass in its presentation, crude and vulgar in its message. It picks extracts from a handful of suras of the Quran about jihad and fighting the enemies of Allah. These are matched by a string of violent images, opening with sequences of the 9/11 attacks in New York, and at the Atocha railway station in Madrid in 2004. A sequence is shown of the bodies of two American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu in 1993. This is characteristic of the film&apos;s oversimplification \u2013 because, at that stage in 1993, the Americans and their allies were trying to wrest the Somali capital from the hands of the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Islam and al-Qaida were then merely incidental to the story \u2013 however much the propagandists have tried to rewrite history subsequently to show these as the opening rounds in George W Bush&apos;s global &quot;war on terror&quot;.  When the film appeared last April, it didn&apos;t cause the trouble and public disquiet its author obviously wanted. Possibly, this was because it so badly made, plus the fact that no mainstream Dutch TV channel wanted to show it. A small Dutch Muslim station did offer to air it, which Wilders refused, in keeping with his &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; logic throughout the entire episode. Wilders is now pitching to be seen as a martyr of political correctness and censorship. In Holland, and now in Britain, he claims to have been gagged and prevented the right of free speech. The fact that he claims the right of free speech to curtail the rights of free speech, and freedom of prayer and preaching, to Europe&apos;s Muslims seems to him neither here nor there. The libertarian conservative MEP and columnist Daniel Hannan has argued in his blog in the Telegraph that Jacqui Smith&apos;s ban on the MP gives him more publicity than he deserves, and that he should have been let in, allowed to strut his stuff and then consigned to oblivion. Even writing about him seems to give him more profile than he deserves, but the problem is that these cases are beginning to crop up increasingly often. Most of the public is pretty level-headed about these things. It&apos;s the authorities that seem to give them more than they are due.  Towards the end of last year, a court in Amsterdam appeared to play into Wilders&apos; hands \u2013 just as what little controversy there had been was dying down. It decided to prosecute the MP for incitement to hatred and causing insult. One wonders why the court wanted to offer Wilders such a golden opportunity to claim the status of judicial martyr. He does seem to care about his time in court in Amsterdam, however, and this appears imminent. Last week, he announced he was hiring one of the Netherlands&apos; most celebrated lawyers, Bram Moskowicz, to get the case thrown out in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. This ploy is unlikely to succeed.  The case recalls the controversy surrounding the anti-Islamic video presentation &quot;Shame&quot;, made by Theo van Gogh and Ayaan Hirsi Ali \u2013 which led to his assassination by a young Dutch Moroccan and her flight to the United States. The underpinnings of that drama were brilliantly portrayed by Ian Buruma in his book, Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance. The parallels and differences between the van Gogh story and the Wilders case have been drawn out last month in a characteristically lucid opinion article by Buruma in the International Herald Tribune. Though Wilders exploits the fame of van Gogh and Hirsi Ali, and radical anti-immigration stance of the populist Pym Fortuyn, he was not part of their movement or party. After van Gogh was killed, Wilders stayed away from parliament, saying he feared for his life \u2013 though his critics have cast doubt on this. As a populist performer, he is just not in the same class as the other three.  Before the film Fitna (meaning &quot;disagreement and division among peoples&quot;) could be seen on the web, it had to be edited because, among other reasons, Wilders failed to get copyright clearance for reproducing the Danish newspaper cartoons. This seems in keeping with the almost shambolic way in which it has been put together. More crass the film itself is the interview Wilders is currently running on YouTube. Here he persists referring to the Qur&apos;an as &quot;this fascist book&quot;, and to Islam as &quot;this wrong ideology&quot;, without ever defining his terms.  Ian Buruma surely has a point when he concludes there must be limits to the right to insult for the sake of it, while upholding the right to criticise. But the authorities, judicial, political and spiritual, must show more common sense. To pursue the authors of Fitna and their like with prosecutions and official guidelines about social cohesion, cultural relativities and mutual respect is to follow them into the descending spiral of their own absurdity.  The trouble is that the indications of officially and unofficially sanctioned intolerance and insult are on the up. This week, Ian Buruma again has highlighted here the bizarre growth of antisemitic polemic in a Chinese bestseller about the current crisis in capitalism \u2013 and in a country and culture that has almost no tradition of antisemitism.  The malaise of extreme language was depicted with stunning accuracy by Thucydides in his account of the civil war in Corcyra: &quot;Any idea of moderation was just an attempt to disguise one&apos;s unmanly character; ability to understand a question from all sides meant that one was totally unfitted for action ... Anyone who held violent opinions could be trusted, and anyone who objected to them became a suspect.&quot; That was in 427 BC.

The Dutchman, who will combine his role as Russia&apos;s coach with his new duties at Stamford Bridge, was due to be in Amsterdam last night ahead of arriving in London this morning, and is expected at Chelsea&apos;s training ground to meet the players either today or tomorrow. Although Ray Wilkins, Scolari&apos;s former assistant, will take charge of the team at Watford in their FA Cup fifth-round tie on Saturday, Hiddink will be watching from the stands. His first game in charge will be the potentially critical trip to third-placed Aston Villa on 21 February. The 62-year-old Dutchman will not have a contract at Stamford Bridge, his willingness to do so serving to emphasise his close friendship with the club&apos;s owner Roman Abramovich, who has secured his services for the next three months after instigating negotiations with the Russian Football Union (RFU). &quot;I don&apos;t have to sign one,&quot; said Hiddink. &quot;It&apos;s not a question of money. This is a favour to a friend. Abramovich called me personally. He does so much for Russian football that I wanted to do something back.&quot; Hiddink will continue to pick up his full salary from the RFU \u2013 a spokesman for Abramovich suggested the Dutchman&apos;s pay deals with Russia and Chelsea would be kept separate \u2013 and will oversee the World Cup qualifying games with Azerbaijan on 28 March and Liechtenstein on 1 April. He intends to assess the coaching staff at Cobham before deciding next week whether to bring in an assistant. He faces an awkward, though hardly impossible, task in west London with Chelsea seven points behind Manchester United in the title race \u2013 the leaders have an opportunity to extend that lead to 10 against Fulham next Wednesday \u2013 and gearing up to confront Juventus in the first knock-out round of the Champions League this month. His greatest challenge, however, is likely to be uniting a fractured dressing room, with some senior players having effectively lobbied for Scolari&apos;s dismissal as results continued to deteriorate over the last few months. The captain, John Terry, admitted on Tuesday that he and &quot;only two or three&quot; of his club-mates had been supportive of Scolari, who was dismayed to learn that a delegation of players \u2013 understood to be Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba and Petr Cech \u2013 had spoken with Abramovich last week to discuss the manager&apos;s position. Hiddink will contact his predecessor in the next few days in what is likely to prove an illuminating conversation about the cliques, divisions and frustrations that may exist at the club. &quot;I haven&apos;t done so yet, but I will call [Scolari] in the next day or two,&quot; said Hiddink. &quot;As for the coaching staff, I will not be bringing anyone in at this time. I always want to see the situation in the team myself before making any changes if they have to be made.&quot; Looking ahead to the game against Villa, he added: &quot;It&apos;s never enough time to prepare a team in one week, but this is an exceptional situation. Chelsea have good players and they should be in top form, and that should make my job easier.&quot; One of those players, the Ghana midfielder Michael Essien, whose absence has been felt so keenly, took part in his first group training session yesterday since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament early in the season. He remains some way off the first team, but Hiddink will feel the current squad should be capable of competing for honours over his 15-week tenure. There still seems little prospect of that being extended beyond the end of the current campaign with Chelsea, the RFU and Hiddink&apos;s representative, Cees van Nieuwenhuizen, all insistent that his appointment at Stamford Bridge is very much on a temporary, short-term basis. Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to leave Milan in May, is the most likely long-term appointment, though Hiddink himself hinted that the situation could still be open to change. &quot;There are two scenarios,&quot; he said. &quot;It goes bad and they say, &apos;go back east&apos;, or it goes well. But I&apos;m not thinking that far ahead. There will be no damage for the Russian national team.

The Catholic rightwinger sees himself as the heir to other recent Dutch iconoclasts such as Pim Fortuyn, the murdered politician who campaigned for an end to Dutch multiculturalism, and Theo Van Gogh, the film-maker stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street after making a documentary that denounced alleged Islamic repression. Wilders has been living under 24-hour police protection for most of the past four years for fear that his outspoken attacks on Islam could see him killed. He has thrived in recent years as decades of Dutch openness and tolerance of immigration and other cultures have triggered a backlash.  Initially an MP for the conservative-liberal VVD party, he broke away and sat alone in parliament as an independent. But in the past two years his new Freedom party has taken nine of the 150 seats in the second chamber (lower house) in The Hague and he has seen his support soar to up to 15%. A little more than a year ago, Wilders was voted the most effective politician in the Netherlands.  The source of the controversy surrounding him is his extreme view on Islam, which he explains with undisguised glee. Islam, he told the Guardian in an interview last year, &quot;is not a religion, it&apos;s the ideology of a retarded culture. &quot;Not all Muslims are terrorists, but almost all terrorists are Muslims,&quot; he said. &quot;Islam is something we can&apos;t afford any more. I want the fascist Qur&apos;an banned. We need to stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands.&quot; What about that hair? The Ukip peer Lord Pearson lauds Geert Wilders as a &quot;very brave man&quot; and, for the latter&apos;s hairstyle alone, one must agree. When a man objects to being described as a racist, it takes a certain sense of gall and irony to puff one&apos;s silvery locks into the finest supremacist quiff available on the hairdresser&apos;s menu. Maybe it&apos;s the way every strand is in such strictly controlled uniformity that makes one look at this hairdo and immediately think &quot;Ah! Racism!&quot; Maybe it&apos;s the Satanic-looking point from which it emerges on his untroubled brow. Maybe it&apos;s the way one instantly wonders how many copies of Mein Kampf he can store under there. It is a rare day that one is gifted with a chance to describe a man&apos;s hair as racist but, truly, there is no other word for this &quot;Toni &amp; Guy meets Himmler&quot; look. If Prince Harry is concerned he has exhausted the possibilities of costumes for fancy dress parties, he is highly recommended to start growing and powdering now.

As a planeful of hacks followed Geert Wilders on to a flight out of Amsterdam last week, the better to record the obscure Dutchman&apos;s pleasantries about Islam, the BBC recorded, stage by suspenseful stage, the news that Wilders was leaving Holland, was aloft, had landed and, hardly any time later, had arrived in the arms of Heathrow officials who banned him, as expected, from entering the country.  Then Mr Wilders, excluded but no longer obscure, flew back to do whatever he normally does in Amsterdam when he is not collecting footage of terrorist victims to make into short films. Between bulletins on Mr Wilders&apos;s progress, numberless Britons who would never, otherwise, have known of its existence, discovered that the pretext for all this fuss, his 14-minute film Fitna, was readily available on their laptops. One of the most worrying aspects of the whole business is that foreign secretary David Miliband, previously thought to have rather an impressive, for a politician, command of internet technology, should have been forced to comment on Fitna&apos;s offensiveness without actually seeing it. Particularly when he knew about it a year ago. &quot;I have not seen the film,&quot; he noted in his much-cherished, Diary of a Nobody-inspired blog in March 2008, &quot;but it is by advertisement and description deeply anti-Islamic, equating it with murder and violence.&quot; By last week, Miliband&apos;s dislike of Fitna had only increased, apparently because of the &quot;extreme anti-Muslim hate&quot; he now intuited. &quot;We have a profound commitment to freedom of speech,&quot; he reassured the BBC, before explaining that Fitna&apos;s was a case so extreme the public could not be allowed to judge for itself. &quot;There is no freedom to cry &apos;fire&apos; in a crowded theatre,&quot; he said, paraphrasing the American judge Wendell Holmes, adding: &quot;And there is no freedom to stir up hate, religious and racial hatred, according to the laws of the land.&quot;  Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs committee, who surfaced to attack the film on Newsnight, also confirmed that he&apos;d not bothered to watch it. Although I didn&apos;t watch Vaz myself, since one can know perfectly well, from advertisement and description, when something is so deeply unpleasant as to merit prohibition, he too insisted that Fitna could incite violence in its audience. Or was it Vaz who wanted it shown to all primary school children, in order to promote diversity?  Whatever. The response of a huge, online audience for this film following its incessant promotion by the Labour government cannot, at the time of writing, be compared to the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; identified by Miliband&apos;s repression icon, Wendell Holmes, as the sole justification for restricting free speech. Nor is there any sign that Wilders&apos;s putative hosts, the Europhobic Lord Pearson of Rannoch and his fellow peers are any more filled with hatred than usual following their viewing of Fitna on a screen at Westminster.  If the stolid, so far, viewer reaction to Fitna&apos;s shock tactics is a little disappointing for Mr Wilders, the controversy surrounding his non-visit leaves a debt to Jacqui Smith that can never be repaid. Much more likely, when he arranged to show his collage of jihadist atrocities in some forgotten corner of the Lords, must have been the prospect of complete public indifference. To judge by comments in newspapers, blogs and on air, most of them backing Wilders&apos;s right to visit, it&apos;s unlikely anyone would have noticed him last week, had he actually been in the country. In fact, even if the government has yet to catch up, current thinking on freedom of speech is a lot less equivocal than it was 20 years ago, when both Tory and Labour politicians agreed that Salman Rushdie had himself to blame if many Muslims wanted him dead.  Speaking for many Tories at the time of the fatwa, long before the arrival of Padma Lakshmi hardened opinion on the question, Lord Dacre announced: &quot;I would not shed a tear if some British Muslims, deploring his manners, should waylay him in a dark street and seek to improve them.&quot; A year later, Norman Tebbit agreed that the &quot;villain&quot; Rushdie had &quot;betrayed&quot; and &quot;degraded&quot; Islam. On the Labour side, a lot of us will never forget Lord Hattersley, then plain Roy and deputy leader of his party, explaining why the paperback of The Satanic Verses should not be published. &quot;The proposition that Muslims are welcome in Britain if, and only if, they stop behaving like Muslims is a doctrine which is incompatible with the principles which govern and guide a free society,&quot; he argued. Whatever &quot;behaving like Muslims&quot; actually meant. Today, Muslim Ed Husain tells us: &quot;Geert Wilders should be allowed in because this is a country that has pioneered freedom of speech, from Milton and Locke through to Mill.&quot;  A thought that did not, in 1989, cut much ice with Keith Vaz. When demonstrators destroyed an effigy of Rushdie in Parliament Square, accompanied by shouts of &quot;Rushdie die, Rushdie scum&quot;, even though he later condemned the fatwa, Mr Vaz described the event as a &quot;great celebration of freedom&quot;. None of the protesters whose placards and shouts called for Rushdie&apos;s death was prosecuted. If Rushdie benefited from state protection from his assailants, so, too, did their proposition that freedom of speech was no longer absolute and not, in particular, where it might offend orthodox Muslims. Like that other Tory hand-me-down, the Dome, New Labour was to embrace this flawed idea with idiot enthusiasm. Last week&apos;s pre-emptive attack on a film almost no one had heard of, still less objected to, was characteristic of a government which has presided, for 10 complacent years, over a progressive diminution of our freedom of expression.  But one of the good things to have happened since Mr Vaz led 3,000 demonstrators on an anti-Rushdie protest, is a parallel realisation, outside government at least, that Muslim sensibilities should not, contrary to what is implied by both Mr Wilders and those who want to gag him, be characterised as uniform and as so delicate as to merit privileged treatment. Wilders, at the end of his film, calls for Muslims to suppress certain verses in the Qur&apos;an lest they inspire their co-religionists to acts of terrorism. Vaz wants him banned from saying that, in case Muslims cannot deal with being offended. But isn&apos;t it terribly offensive to be called easily offended? Absolutely, which is why Chris Huhne, the Lib Dem, is typical of our governing censors in taking condescension a step further. Wilders had to be banned, says Huhne, because his film is so anti-Islamic that it might provoke anti-Muslim violence even in those of us who managed to get through The Satanic Verses without acquiring a criminal record. The dreadful images, he cautions, &quot;risk causing serious harm to others&quot;. Though not caused by him, of course.

Significantly, they were the hands of a writer who wrote by hand, words which touched people unknown to her.  For her previous book, Women, Leibovitz had included a portrait of her own mother, unusually unsmiling and staring straight into the camera. Her parents hadn&apos;t liked the photograph, but I find it a powerful and revealing &quot;interior&quot; portrait. Sontag had reminded the photographer that her mother was the first woman she knew - a statement obvious but profound; the skin-to-skin relationship between mother and child is the first connection with another being, a woman, the mother. I had mused on mother-daughter relationships often during the three long years I sat beside hospital beds and care-home armchairs, as my own mother grappled with the closing down of her life. She died a year ago: sweetly and softly, while sitting in a chair in the lounge of her residential care home just after the tea trolley has passed by. A quiet and mundane departure, as she wanted; a few minutes earlier, she&apos;d dispatched my sister, Alison, to her room to check if she needed more tights. It&apos;s perhaps too easy to interpret that as an unconscious attempt to protect her daughter from witnessing the moment. Mum needed to die; she was exhausted by the strokes and falls and leg ulcers - and what was barely acknowledged by the professionals, depression and a kind of existential angst which crushed her gregarious, optimistic personality from the day she arrived, unexpectedly, in the residential care home. Many fellow residents accepted their one-way ticket and some lived in demented denial, but others, like Mum, suffered terribly. &quot;Depression in an old person? I&apos;ve never heard of that before,&quot; laughed one of the usually helpful carers, when I suggested the reason for her newly withdrawn behaviour. One afternoon, as she dozed on her bed, the GP told Alison and me that Mum had very little time left and we needed to discuss end-of-life plans with her. I am convinced that she overheard the sentence. From then, she retreated, simply closed her eyes and shut down, lying in bed for days, reluctantly accepting sips of water and fortified drinks, but never speaking or opening her eyes. We kept watch and waited for her &quot;to go&quot;. And in the hours I spent alone with her, I studied her face, held her hand, made distracting notes, thought of photographing her, talked to her. Then, out of the blue, one morning, a carer phoned to say that she was eating Weetabix in the dining room and smiling. I decided that she&apos;d probably, unconsciously, been processing then accepting the news of her fate, on her terms, and the only way she could in such a public space was to cut out. Decisions made, she woke, bright and friendly and hungry and decided to go to the end exuding joyfulness. But the doctor then prescribed antidepressants to make sure the mood lasted, and she smiled so blissfully and was so sensually alert (even with one blind eye, two deaf ears and two semi-paralysed hands) to the pleasures of birds and colours, my latest jewellery and news from friends, that I wondered if they were trying her on ecstasy. Though still physically dependent, she&apos;d taken back control of herself. And sometimes it almost felt like she was now mothering us again. The last time I saw my mother, she was waving goodbye to me across the lounge as I left. She had asked when I would be back and I said, &quot;Two weeks&quot;- the longest gap I&apos;d left it in months, and instead of a look of disappointment, she grinned and said, &quot;Oh that&apos;s good.&quot; I bent and kissed her and she pinned me with her still dazzling blue eyes. Her stiff &quot;good&quot; arm stretched into an awkward wave as she mimed kisses to me, but, as I turned to go, she instructed me softly, &quot;Kiss me!&quot; and I turned back. &quot;I&apos;ve already kissed you, Mum, but I&apos;ll gladly kiss you again,&quot; and did, holding her hand. Ten days later, I arrived in that same lounge, four hours after her death. She was in her bedroom and I was faced by a scene I&apos;d envisioned so often, seen generically in films and read in books. I&apos;d imagined it peopled by the ones now standing around her bed - except my sister, who had found her &quot;asleep&quot; in her chair, had gone home by then for relief. Confusingly, this stage set of her room had somehow changed: my brother and sister-in-law stood mute, two of the kindest carers wept, and Mum lay partly under the covers, her hands exposed. She was wearing the sea-green dress and blue cardie embroidered with flowers that she died in, and which we decided without argument to bury her in. My mother&apos;s face resembled the one we&apos;d sat next to and stared at during the long days when we expected death: the same hollow and closed eyes, relaxed brow and folded hands. I was temporarily deceived into almost nudging her awake, but something unimaginably primal and complex in my brain had kicked in: this is the real thing, I thought, she&apos;s dead. Of course, it took only a split second in that room to know that truth, but not to really know it. Suddenly my voice took on an alien life of its own and filled the room with howls. I leant over her but felt a forcefield around her; she was in a different realm from us now, one I didn&apos;t understand. We were here, she was here, but where was she? I&apos;d missed that moment of transference I&apos;d so badly wanted to witness - her &quot;passing&quot;, but, for the first time, understood how that word is so apt. The others discreetly left the room to wait for me. In the car on the way from the station, I had checked my camera was charged. I&apos;d discussed with my friend Anne, several times in recent weeks, the fact that I wanted to photograph my mother in death. I couldn&apos;t articulate why, but our conversations gave me permission regardless. Now, sitting beside her, stroking her silky white hair, kissing her forehead, I pulled the camera out of my bag. She wouldn&apos;t have liked it; she&apos;d probably find it obscene, and certainly wouldn&apos;t have understood. But how could I have explained when I didn&apos;t know why I felt the need to do this? I kissed her forehead, moist and cool, and then, bizarrely, thought of the organic procedures of death; the internal factory that would now be working overtime to effect total shutdown. I sniffed her forehead, curious to know the smell of death but, thankfully, smelt only her hair, the smell she stored inside the hats and scarves she left behind, and which I now wear. I got off the bed, took out the camera and stood up, looking over my shoulders towards the closed door, as if about to commit an obscene act. I was nervous a carer might come in and find me in flagrante. I moved close to her, talking as I clicked, standing over her face. And then I stood up and stared at her hands: they were what I most wanted to preserve. I took one in my own, trying to warm it with my breath like I did when we&apos;d sat close together, talking. It always reminded me of calming a frightened bird. During her last years, Mum had started taking my arm to cross a road, grabbing my hand like a child, and eventually, when sitting close, letting me hold hers in my own. Her fingers were small and pointed and would have been elegant if they hadn&apos;t served years of domestic drudgery. She did housework until her last day in her own home, and in this final place, the hands grew smooth and beautiful, but increasingly useless. One day, I found her wearing nail polish and asked if she had a date; she giggled and splayed her fingers like a teenager, regarding them with detached amusement. Like Susan Sontag, and just as incongruously, she was buried with polished nails. I took the shot of her hand and threw the camera into my bag and sat down again, stroking her. But I was agitated now, I felt tainted: I&apos;d got what I wanted from her without understanding what I would do with the images, or why I wanted them. At that last sight of my mother, I remember fearing that my photographs were voyeuristic; had I behaved like a Weegee? But I shoved such thoughts from my mind and turned and kissed her goodbye for the last time.  Liebovitz had said she had to do it... &quot;It&apos;s what I do.&quot; Maybe wanting to photograph my mother was partly to defy the taboo in our culture against making death part of life. The notoriously sentimental Victorians were surprisingly unsqueamish about it. Early on, they harnessed photography to &quot;postmortem photographs&quot; of their dead children and babies, who were laid out wearing beautiful robes and surrounded by flowers, for the photographer to immortalise their short lives. Cards bearing the photograph of the child apparently sleeping were kept on mantelpieces and sent to relatives unable to make the funeral, aids to help deal with grief in a society not given to emotional expression. During the last year, I&apos;ve wondered about that need to hold on to something of my mother in death, and am now deeply comforted by having the images I shot without realising what I was doing. They are possibly more precious than the material things, and even more than the family snaps of her smiling at birthdays and weddings or chatting with her friend Kath in her beloved garden. What I possess are photographic memento mori, and as I look into her death face on my computer screen, I treasure the power of photographs to transmit a three-dimensional reality which genuinely conveys her. I can feel the textures and contours of her face and hands, their bones and scars, her history, and the silkiness of her whispy hair. Then one night, streaming through the internet while I wrote this story, I found a moving letter, written in 1870, by parishoner Flora A Windeyer to Revd John Blomfield on the death of her child: &quot;What a comfort it is to possess the image of those who are removed from our sight. We may raise an image of them in our minds but that has not the tangibility of one we can see with our bodily eyes.&quot;  Nine months after my mother&apos;s death, I walked into a gallery in Amsterdam called FOAM, and was greeted by a poster for an exhibition by the Japanese photographer Miyako Ishiuchi, intriguingly titled Mother&apos;s. A winter-sun-filled room contained large, mostly black-and-white prints of Miyako&apos;s late mother&apos;s intimate clothing and possessions, and close-ups of her skin and one breast. A detached, artful outpouring of memory, it overwhelmed me with its familiarity. Tears flowed and I was transfixed by the correspondence of her transfer of grief on to ordinary items - petticoats, bloomer knickers, lipsticks - with mine. The lacy, black underwear hung limply and transparent against the light, while the white cotton, thin-strapped vest of my mother&apos;s, held up, reveals the slight billowing of the fabric created by her breasts, like the mould for a cast of her small torso.  Back in England, I spoke to Miyako over the phone in Tokyo and through a translator. I needed to know why she made these movingly poetic images. In the background, I could hear her side of the dialogue in Japanese - a dark, sharp voice punctuated by occasional laughter. Miyako explained that she chose to photograph whatever was nearest to her mother&apos;s skin: &quot;Skin is the physical boundary between the inner world and the world itself, the first object to communicate with the outside world. I only photographed her alive skin,&quot; she said.&quot;When she died, I was in such grief because she died suddenly, that I didn&apos;t think of photographing her then.&quot; The naked breast, she revealed, was taken before her mother died so, unlike my mother, hers knew she was being photographed in this intimate way - and knew the images would be on public display. &quot;She quite understood what I was doing because I explained it to her. Before then, she was very reluctant to expose her skin, but when I asked to photograph it &apos;for a work of art&apos;, she said yes. Not because it would be a work of art but because it would be the work of her daughter.&quot; When her mother died, Miyako&apos;s instant need was to get rid of all her things, but instead she began photographing them. &quot;I was overwhelmed by the thought that a part of my mother - her undergarments - were equal to her skin. Her belongings were her. By photographing them, I wanted to objectify them, to get rid of the grief and the emotion.&quot; Several friends and I agree that we keep certain objects for the memories and stories they store, but Miyako&apos;s relationship with her mother hadn&apos;t been close, and her mother&apos;s possessions didn&apos;t evoke personal memories. But through photographing them she found she could communicate with her through them - and they now reside in a box at home. I noted how Miyako refers to the possessions she photographed as objets, elevating them to art objects, a way of detaching from them. I can&apos;t do that with the vest; I can&apos;t throw it away nor can I frame the photograph. Perhaps, with time, it will lose its potency - like the smell on the pillow where a lover had slept. My friend Krysia keeps her mother&apos;s hairband and says she cries when she wears it because she can still smell her hair on it. &quot;I don&apos;t wear it often,&quot; she says, &quot;because it could lose her smell.&quot; Miyako sees her saved items as indicative of &quot;an accumulation of time&quot;. She sees in them &quot;a decay and deterioration which matches the deceased. They spent time with my mother and I see them as representations of her lost past.&quot; In complete contrast are those friends of mine who reject inanimate mementos for objects with life and futures. My sister, for example, transplanted Mum&apos;s beloved fuschia into her own garden and was thrilled at last year&apos;s seemingly symbolic frenzy of flowers. In Italy, Krysia transplanted her mother&apos;s wild geraniums from Kent, and, in Brighton, I cosset my mother&apos;s like pets. But inanimate objects can also symbolise the future. My friend Melissa&apos;s mother left her silk neglig\u00e9e for her daughter&apos;s wedding and now it&apos;s waiting in a box for her girls&apos;. &quot;But,&quot; she confesses, &quot;when I see Sarah [her daughter] cooking us all breakfastwearing the dressing-gown my mother died in, I feel overwhelmed.&quot;  After Mum died, my sister, brother and I chose things of hers we wanted to keep. I&apos;d always loved her mossy-green Kangol beret with a small bow on the brim, and wore it to her funeral. I also keep her small brown suitcase, which I call &quot;The Room of her Own&quot;, because it contains clues to a life she rarely shared with us. Inside the lid she had written, in 1939, her maiden name and the address of her then fianc\u00e9 Sonny&apos;s family. In that year she joined the army, found freedom, and ended the engagement. Inside are her birth certificate, her army tie, Sonny&apos;s present of an autograph book containing loving epithets. The case reinvents my mother as a stranger - a single, free, adventurous woman moving around England during the war, having a fianc\u00e9 I know nothing of, and not yet aware of her future husband. Tantalisingly mysterious, it&apos;s truly her room. In my quest for stories from friends and family, I mostly heard about the potent objects which work like African fetishes for those of us left motherless. Most surprising were the two abstract mementos which carry as much - conceivably more - potency, maybe because they exist only in internal, private memories.  My school friend Sheila, whose mother was a kind presence during my school days, clings to a memory which she says is &quot;more consoling than anything I&apos;ve saved of hers in a box. Before she lost consciousness, she took my hand in both of hers and turned it round, and looked at it, and then stroked the palm. At that point, she couldn&apos;t really speak any more. When we left, I blew kisses and she raised her hand to me and blew them to me. She never opened her eyes to me again. Like your mother,&quot; she added, &quot;she wasn&apos;t able to be emotionally demonstrative; she&apos;d never done that to me before. I think it was a very generous way of saying goodbye.&quot; My sister-in-law, Jeanette, who doesn&apos;t easily talk at an emotional level, sent me an email which brought me to helpless tears. &quot;I couldn&apos;t really find any material things that really mean much about my life with my mother,&quot; she wrote, &quot;but what I do have is her last breath. At that moment, I felt how her life and mine were one, and why she was the person she was, how she felt, how she hurt and how she so loved life. I realised in that last moment what immortality really was and my mother gave me that.&quot; I set out to write this story partly because I was moved and inspired by Annie Leibovitz&apos;s photographs of her dead lover, and partly after the surprise discovery of Miyako Ishiuchi&apos;s work. Both these discoveries have helped me reconsider my own exploitation of photography and objects intimate with my mother as part of the process of grieving, and also made me curious about how women close to me have handled the loss of their mothers.

It, too, was an away fixture of sorts: after a run-of-the-mill first half, the players emerged after the break with new-found vigour and stepped up a gear. They were the little-known Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra and, under John Storg\u00e5rds, they went on to deliver one of the most breathtaking renditions of a symphonic work I&apos;ve witnessed. I wonder if the gaffer said something to them in the dressing room at half time.  You can never be certain you&apos;re going to get a cracking performance, either on the pitch or in the concert hall. Yes, there are guides to quality: football has league tables and music has polls, such as Gramophone magazine&apos;s recent list of the world&apos;s top 20 orchestras. But in both football and classical music, there&apos;s also a steely-eyed set of middle-of-the-road outfits, determined to punch way above their weight. With the right person on the podium or touchline, there&apos;s nothing to stop them.  Football managers and conductors are basically in the same line of business, and the good ones are cut from the same cloth. Most aim, ultimately, to conjure that old Bill Shankly miracle: getting their forces to play better than they ever thought they could. But it&apos;s not always the big-name managers and maestros who achieve this. Take straight-talking Scouse coach Paul Jewell. In the last decade he has put Bradford City into the top flight for the first time in 77 years, and has dragged Wigan Athletic up a staggering two divisions into the Premier League.  Jewell&apos;s alter ego in the orchestral world is the Finnish conductor Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4. When V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 brings his Minnesota Orchestra to London&apos;s Barbican next week, he&apos;ll do so in the knowledge that, on current form, it&apos;s one of the best orchestras in the US. Yet it didn&apos;t make Gramophone&apos;s poll, and it hasn&apos;t anything like the international clout of the Boston Symphony or the New York Phil. Since he took over in 2003, V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 has quietly cultivated exquisite detail, handsome balance and impressive tonal finesse in his Minnesota players; but, since he hasn&apos;t got a cabinet full of silverware to show for it, those outside Minneapolis can be forgiven for not noticing. The Minnesota boys have been playing well abroad of late (on an extended tour) and the Barbican is, of course, a world-class venue. So there should be a cup-tie atmosphere at next week&apos;s fixture. I wouldn&apos;t bet against the boys going out there and giving it 110% and really getting a result. Of course, for an edge-of-the-seat orchestral performance, a few other factors need to come into play. You need what football calls the 12th man: a good crowd, supportive if not exactly vocal. And the relationship between coach and players is crucial. Like most football managers, V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 has spent some time in the field himself (playing principal clarinet for the Helsinki Philharmonic); this is not so common among conductors, and as a result, he draws an affectionate respect from his team, rather than a fearful one. He works hard and doesn&apos;t overstretch himself. He is a warm, ordinary bloke who delivers his inspiring philosophies in plain English; it&apos;s not hard to see how he&apos;d instil confidence in a group of talented people who are not used to being told they&apos;re the best.  A handful of celebrity maestros and managers may continue to conjure astounding performances through a combination of genius, character and a gift for one-liners; but for the world&apos;s lesser-known ensembles and footie sides, a Jewell or a V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 is like gold dust. And in both football and the arts, relationships with executives, sponsors and local communities are becoming ever more important - in such a world, the jet-setting super-conductor who juggles a number of clamouring orchestras seems increasingly out of place.  So which improving teams and orchestras are the ones to watch? Hull City&apos;s tremendous run of form has wavered recently, and Jewell resigned from Derby County in December after uncharacteristic impotence in the face of poor results. But that&apos;s football - it&apos;s a funny old game. In the orchestral field, things tend to pan out more rationally. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra&apos;s Andris Nelsons is worth watching these days; St\u00e9phane Den\u00e8ve has quietly built a Royal Scottish National Orchestra with quality in all departments; and Andrew Litton&apos;s Bergen Philharmonic is sounding like Karajan has been working on it.  On the flipside, hearing one of the Man Uniteds of the orchestral world recently proved disappointing. The world&apos;s top-seeded orchestra, Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw, offered an uncharacteristically boastful and uncomfortable display. Then, in some gently undulating Debussy, the trumpet clattered into its solo with all the grace of a vending machine delivering a Lucozade. &quot;He won&apos;t be happy with that, John,&quot; I thought. &quot;He certainly won&apos;t, Gary.

The armistice comes just days before the opening of the National Gallery&apos;s latest blockbuster, devoted to Picasso - an artist whose natural territory is, arguably, Tate Modern rather the National Gallery.  A 1996 agreement, stating that the dividing line between the collections should be at 1900, lapsed in 2007 and has only just been reaffirmed, despite discussions within and between the galleries since at least late 2005. Broadly, Tate Modern covers international art from 1900, the National Gallery houses international art to 1900, and Tate Britain is the custodian of British art from 1500 to the present day. But the National Gallery has been challenging this strict boundary in recent years. Last March, its then new director, Nicholas Penny, noted publicly that &quot;the National Gallery was built to house contemporary art&quot;. In September, he was quoted as saying: &quot;The idea is not to have an agreement. We are not happy with 1900 as a final, absolute point of the end of the National Gallery.&quot; Even before Penny was appointed, the National Gallery is understood to have been unhappy with 1900 as the endpoint of its collections.  In practice it has been developing its involvement with modern and contemporary art, with a high-profile artist-in-residence scheme. In November, it will temporarily install Hoerengracht (1984-88), by Ed and Nancy Kienholz, a walk-in installation that recreates the &quot;whores&apos; canal&quot; of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district. It is intended to cast light on the gallery&apos;s 17th-century Dutch paintings, many of which show scenes from the demimonde. The cut-off has practical implications, with the galleries exchanging works that sit on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the line on long-term loan. Fifty works belonging to the Tate are in the National Gallery, while only three works belonging to the National Gallery are in the Tate (a Matisse, a Monet and a Picasso, the last now back in the National Gallery for the Picasso exhibition).  A minute from a 2005 Tate trustee meeting records Nicholas Serota, the director of Tate, as noting &quot;the agreement [is] not in Tate&apos;s favour in the short term because it [means] that 50 paintings were loaned to the National Gallery&quot;.  The original agreement was signed as the decision to create Tate Modern was made. A statement dating from 1996 stated: &quot;The decision to create [Tate Modern] has provided a fresh opportunity to reassess the distribution of works between the ... galleries. Major artists whose work straddles the turn of the century will continue to be shown to their best advantage across the whole range of their career where possible by the respective galleries.&quot; A Tate trustees&apos; report of November 2005 also explained that the agreement was made, &quot;because the national collection of European painting covering the period 1875 to 1910 was divided between the two institutions in a way that left neither with a very satisfactory representation&quot;. The latest agreement was not made available to the Guardian, and Penny and Serota declined to comment. However, it is understood that it affirms the same principles as those laid out in 1996. There are provisos to the &quot;1900 rule&quot;: the Tate recognises that the National Gallery may wish to acquire 20th-century works by artists usually associated with the 19th (eg C\u00e9zanne, Monet and Renoir) - and vice versa. The institutions need not confine exhibitions to the period of their collections. Both agree not to seek bequests outside their basic timeframes. The National Gallery and the Tate have had cause to work together in the recent past on one of the most important artistic bequests ever made to the nation - the \u00a3100m Sainsbury bequest of 18 works left to both institutions in 2007. The paintings were shown at Tate Britain last year before being distributed between the galleries. What&apos;s on where National Gallery From 25 February until 7 June: Picasso: Challenging the Past.

Lazing beneath with a cold beer, I squinted past the pages of my trashy novel to watch the progress of a volleyball match taking place a few metres away.  Yet despite the game-playing, the sunshine and the broad expanses of blue sky, this was no beach holiday - I was lying in the deep end of a former lido in the heart of Berlin&apos;s central Fritz Schloss park. A relic of old Berlin, the three empty pools were built after the second world war as a summer playground for families, but have been transformed in recent years into one of the most unusual places to stay in Europe&apos;s coolest capital. Less than a 10-minute walk from Hauptbahnhof, the main station, and a stone&apos;s throw from the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate, Berlin&apos;s only city-centre campsite is actually better situated than many of its hotels. Tentstation offers camping with a distinctly urban edge. With a landscape of bleached concrete and overgrown weeds, it is a world of strange and unusual contrasts that is typically Berlin; a sea of tents, makeshift gazebos, and swaying washing lines.  The largest lido is a cavernous and surprisingly versatile space which lends itself equally to arts events and impromptu kick-abouts. In high summer, a large screen is erected for film screenings, while gigs, recitals, performances and sport competitions have been performed in the stony depths.  Meanwhile, above in the old viewing gallery, a stylish bar serves an impressive array of beers - apparently blended with almost anything to hand - including a surprisingly refreshing grapefruit lager. The adjacent, slightly smaller lido is a perfect spot for sunbathing, its subterranean walls resounding with the electro beats from the bar, an unlikely but alluring spot to escape from the heightened pace of the city.  Berlin Mitte is so close you can almost smell the paint drying on the walls of its newest hip galleries, yet only the very peaks of the city can be seen above the surrounding canopy of trees. Noiseless apart from the babble of conversations that rise animatedly over the park&apos;s laidback soundtrack, it is singularly peaceful for a city centre location. There is a charming simplicity to the site that is neither too homely nor trying too hard to be cool. Croissants and coffee are on offer in the morning, and potent mojitos later on. For dinner I made use of the free barbecues, over which I cremated a couple of bratwurst while admiring the lights of Alexanderplatz&apos;s television tower overhead.

I am going to Amsterdam to meet my friend Frits, who has a 24-hour stopover there on his way from New York to Mumbai. I am not a good traveller, but this is such a straightforward journey, and it has gone so smoothly thus far, including the change of trains, that my pulse is nearly normal. As my train pulls out of the station I feel, for the first time in many weeks, as if I have nothing to worry about. When we arrive in Antwerp, a large number of people rise to leave the train. A man spills some loose change at my feet and bends over to pick it up. I stare as he reaches round my ankles. He is being peculiarly fastidious, I think, especially since the coins he dropped consist mostly of tiny five-cent pieces. I have a bad back, so I don&apos;t bend down in the morning for less than 50 pence.  I decide his behaviour is suspicious, or possibly just Belgian. I observe him closely as he exits the train and disappears down some stairs. Then I stretch my neck and glance upwards - my laptop is missing from the luggage rack above my head.  If there is one thing I dislike, it&apos;s an expensive lesson in how stupid I am. While being cheated out of 20 euros by a Roman taxi driver seems a fair price to pay for a timely reminder that I am, at bottom, an idiot, a whole laptop strikes me as excessive. I stand up, but there is nowhere to go. The accomplice who took the laptop obviously exited in the other direction, and is long gone.  When I sit back down, my most immediate fear is that criminals will order things using my Amazon account. I ring my wife to try to make the problem partly hers.  &quot;Are you sure it was stolen?&quot; she says. &quot;I need you to go online and change my Amazon password,&quot; I say. &quot;You can buy ovens on Amazon.&quot;  When I hang up, an even bigger worry springs to mind - the highly likely possibility that the last thing I did before I shut my laptop the night before was Google myself, and the near certainty that the next person who opens it will be greeted by a link to a blog describing my column as &quot;still unreadable&quot;. I have two more hours on the train in which to become philosophical about things. Let the thieves have my crappy laptop, I think. And the four years&apos; worth of work on it. And my bank details. I don&apos;t need any of it. I&apos;m free. Even so, I fear this new outlook will strike my friend Frits as a form of denial, so I resolve not to mention the incident to him. I haven&apos;t seen him in years. Why spoil the evening? &quot;My laptop got stolen off the train,&quot; I say as we shake hands. &quot;Oh no,&quot; he says. &quot;Did you lose anything important?&quot; &quot;Everything,&quot; I say. &quot;Everything.&quot; Two days later, I arrive at the BBC in order to appear on a Radio 5 Live phone-in about the perils of Googling yourself. In the lobby I remind myself not to mention the laptop in this context. Your misfortune is of no interest to the general listener, I tell myself. I take my place in the chair opposite presenter Victoria Derbyshire, and put on the headphones provided. After the traffic report, she introduces me and asks how often I Google myself.  &quot;Well, not for a couple of days,&quot; I say, &quot;because my laptop got stolen, but...&quot; &quot;A couple of days!&quot; she says. &quot;You mean, you Google yourself every day?&quot; Ten minutes later I am in the street, ringing my wife. &quot;I didn&apos;t listen,&quot; she says. &quot;I got bored waiting.&quot; &quot;I sounded insane,&quot; I say, trying to make it partly her problem, before remembering that it already is partly her problem.", "sentences": ["I am going to Amsterdam to meet my friend Frits, who has a 24-hour stopover there on his way from New York to Mumbai."], "title": "Tim Dowling has his laptop stolen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/21/laptop-tim-dowling", "tags": ["Family", "Relationships", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-23T00:01:00Z", "article": "A British couple who drifted in the Atlantic for 40 days after the rudder broke on their yacht are safe and well after being winched to safety in heavy seas by a passing oil tanker. Stuart Armstrong, 51, from of Stockport, Greater Manchester, and his partner Andrea Davison, 48, were running out of food and fuel on board their crippled yacht when they were picked up by an Italian tanker on 18 February, as it sailed from South America to Amsterdam. After making a five-hour diversion to rescue them, the 183-metre long Indian Point edged up to the 13-metre-long Sara in heavy seas to rescue the couple. &quot;The most frightening bit was seeing the tanker coming towards you,&quot; Armstrong told Sky News after the perilous, 90-minute rescue operation. The couple&apos;s problems began on 9 January, half way through a 2,500-mile transatlantic crossing from the Cape Verde Islands to Antigua. The yacht&apos;s rudder jammed to starboard, with all efforts to free it failing, leaving the couple drifting in a circle, 1,200 miles from their destination. &quot;At first we were not too bothered, as we had a good supply of dry provisions, the usual things you have on a boat - pasta, kidney beans, biscuits, rice and soya,&quot; said Armstrong, who had previously sailed across the Atlantic seven times. After alerting the US coast guard, he continued to try and free the rudder, but a power failure 10 days later knocked out his desalination unit, which provided drinking water. The coastguard told the couple they were too far out to be rescued, and storms began to batter the yacht. &quot;We kept getting hit by storms, but we managed to get out of them with no real problems,&quot; said Davison, of Wallsend, Newcastle. &quot;But I knew we were riding our luck and we wouldn&apos;t be able to go on for much longer.&quot; As the couple&apos;s food ran short, the US coastguard alerted the Indian Point, which approached Sara in heavy swells. Lines were dropped to secure the yacht to the side of the tanker, but the smaller boat slammed against its side, ruling out the use of a ladder to reach the couple. &quot;It would have been very dangerous to cling to a ladder,&quot; Michel Carlos Cancrini, the tanker&apos;s commander, said. Two safety harnesses were lowered, with Davison first to don the harness and leap into the sea and be pulled to safety, Armstrong following. The Sara was cast adrift and 12 minutes later the tanker had set a course for Amsterdam, where it is due to dock on 1 March.

His emergence at the beginning of the decade prompted comparisons to a young Johan Cruyff not just for his long locks but for his whimsical play. The lithe, speedy attacker, whose upper-middle- class background is betrayed only by his affinity for cricket, looked the most promising of another gifted generation delivered by the Ajax academy. He broke on to the scene at roughly the same time that Rafael van der Vaart did. The two offered a striking juxtaposition. Van der Gun, who had been raised in opulence, played with an urban grittiness whereas van der Vaart&apos;s gypsy background produced a majestic class on the field. But while Van der Vaart became Holland captain and a regular for Real Madrid, Van der Gun became an afterthought. He played all of the 2000-1 season and scored nine Eredivisie goals. Then he hurt his left knee and lost the next season. When he finally returned, he found himself competing for a spot in a crowded group of attackers that included Mido, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wesley Sneijder, Van der Vaart, Steven Pienaar, Andy van der Meyde and Jari Litmanen. Van der Gun, who never managed to convince the then manager Ronald Koeman, was the odd man out and was loaned to Willem II. Without him, Ajax made it to the quarter- finals of the Champions League. He had a solid season at Willem II but Ajax had no use for him and forwarded him to ADO Den Haag, in his hometown. After two years there \u2013 barely tickling at his vast potential \u2013 he was snapped up by Borussia Dortmund. And then came another bad injury, to his right knee this time. He played only three games there. To FC Utrecht. Another injury. And then another. His talent appeared to be trapped in a body too frail to support it. Injuries are inextricably linked with Van der Gun&apos;s career. When he was 18 or so, he went to a tournament in Dallas with Ajax reserves. After arriving, they kicked a ball around by the pool and Cedric accidentally kicked a wall. He missed the whole tournament. Now almost 30, Van der Gun has learned to look at other options. He&apos;s doing an online degree in entrepreneurship and business innovation, designed especially for footballers. But it is just as he&apos;s learned to look past football that it is returning what it took from him \u2013 with interest. Healthy at long last, his wrath is merciless. Against De Graafschap three weeks ago, he scored all three goals, easily transcending his peers. He leads Utrecht&apos;s scoring charts with nine from 16 and with five goals and three assists in the first five games of 2009 he was pivotal in their recent surge up the standings, returning them to Uefa Cup contention. The knee troubles relegated the new Johan Cruyff to a passable Eredivisie player who occasionally played up a storm. But the storms have become so regular that he is now a highly sought-after asset. In a furious attempt to make good on his long-lost promise, Van der Gun has hinted at a free transfer to Feyenoord at the end of the year. Mario Been, now in charge of NEC but Feyenoord manager come July, has flirted back, batting his eye-lashes and stealing glances from across the transfer meat-market. Much more interesting was thus the match-up between Van der Gun&apos;s FC Utrecht and Been&apos;s NEC on Sunday. But several good Van der Gun passes were lost on his team-mates as a Youssef El Akchaoui free-kick squirmed past Utrecht keeper Michel Vorm and an uncovered Jo\u00ebl Tshibamba headed in for a 2\u20130 NEC win. NEC needed that after being pummelled 3\u20130 by HSV in the Uefa Cup on Wednesday. Ajax did manage to win their Uefa Cup game, beating Fiorentina Italian-style on Thursday. Sitting back for most of the game as their opponents took the initiative, Ajax converted the only chance they got when Kennedy Bakircioglu&apos;s shot squeaked in despite the crossbar&apos;s best efforts. Even less impressive was their home win against FC Volendam on Sunday. Volendam took an early lead but Ajax struggled more with the ball than their opponents. Luis Suarez eventually equalised and Thomas Vermaelen willed in the winner to make it 2\u20131. A throbbing finale saw Volendam hit the post and score a rightly disallowed goal. &quot;Boo!&quot; was the Amsterdam crowd&apos;s verdict after the match. &quot;I&apos;m satisfied when we win and we play well,&quot; the Ajax manager, Marco van Basten, said. &quot;That just isn&apos;t the case here. We did win \u2026 but I&apos;m unhappy. We had a lot of chances but you don&apos;t finish them. Well Jesus, sooner or later it has to stop. If Luis [Suarez] starts missing from five metres \u2026 What more am I supposed to do?&quot; Ajax and the ball are still not on speaking terms. Steve McClaren&apos;s FC Twente managed an impressive 1\u20130 away win at Olympique Marseille on Thursday but weren&apos;t nearly as good at Sparta on Sunday. A Sparta own goal and penalty made it a sincere 1\u20131, which equated to the on-field status quo. But a last-minute and noteworthy long-distance shot from Theo Janssen won Twente the game. And in a glorified game of mud-wrestling in Groningen, the sides rewarded those who took the immense trouble of sitting through the first half with entertainment after the intermission. In the end, Stef Nijland&apos;s cross was headed in by Danko Lazovic for a last-gasp PSV victory. Nijland&apos;s father Hans, who is the general director of Groningen, spoke of disowning him. Stef claimed it was a joke. At De Graafschap, an inferior Feyenoord won the relegation battle 2\u20130 with the utmost effort. AZ&apos;s attacking trio of Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Ari and Mounir El Hamdaoui combined for the first goal, finished by the latter, against Heracles. Record signing and part-time striker Graziano Pell\u00e8 invented more new ways of not scoring but did manage to set up El Hamdaoui&apos;s second, his 20th of season. The unimpressive AZ were granted a pass by their ever more easygoing manager Louis van Gaal, who held injuries to six regulars and Heracles&apos; artificial pitch responsible, as several plastic sprigs whipped defiantly in the wind. The only thing that can keep this AZ away from the title is the injury virus infecting the team, which claimed international David Mendes da Silva on Saturday. Twenty-four rounds in the books. Ten remain.

As a medical researcher he studied kuru, an incurable disease that affects the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea, and showed that it had a long incubation period, but progresses rapidly when it starts, and is unlike any previously understood infection. It does not provoke an immune response and cannot be destroyed by heat, radiation or formaldehyde. He called the causative agent a &quot;slow virus&quot; and showed that kuru was related to Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans and scrapie in sheep; we now call the organism a prion and know that it is a non-living entity that can reproduce itself. Gajdusek was born in Yonkers, New York, to east European immigrants. He studied biophysics at Rochester University, graduating in 1943, and medicine at Harvard, qualifying in 1946. He then did research at Caltech (the California Institute of Technology) under Linus Pauling and Max Delbruch, and research at Harvard under John Enders. All three scientists later became Nobel laureates. In the 1950s, doing his army service, Gajdusek helped show that the haemorrhagic fever killing US soldiers in South Korea was spread by migrating birds. In 1954, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) sent him to a camp in Bolivia for native American Okinawans transported there by the US navy after the second world war. There were so many deaths it was rumoured to be an extermination camp; but he showed that the deaths were by natural causes and fighting. The CDC offered him a job. &quot;You&apos;re a screwball&quot;, said his boss, &quot;but you&apos;re my kind of screwball.&quot;  Gajdusek declined the offer and went to work with another Nobel-laureate-to-be, the immunologist Sir Macfarlane Burnet, in Melbourne. In 1957 Burnet sent him to Port Moresby, New Guinea, to set up part of a multinational study on child development, behaviour and disease, where he heard about a mystery illness called kuru affecting a tribe of the eastern highlands. The Fore, always willing to adopt new customs, had copied a neighbouring tribe, the Anga, some years earlier and taken up cannibalism. They abandoned it when missionaries told them that eating people is wrong. Their kuru was more recent and becoming more prevalent. Gajdusek began mapping its incidence, noting that nobody recovered. Dozens of blood samples revealed nothing untoward.  By April 1957 he had 28 cases and 13 deaths. By June he had 200 deaths; most were women and children. Kuru sufferers shrieked, stumbled, jerked and twitched, were belligerent and prone to mirth. Gajdusek wanted to know if the disease was genetic, infectious, environmental or psychosomatic. He sent brains to be analysed in Australia and at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). He investigated what the Fore ate, drank or touched. He tried ad hoc treatments: vitamins, steroids, antibiotics. Nothing worked.  Meanwhile, the Americans noted that the brains were similar to those of CJD patients. Burnet proposed sending out a multidisciplinary team. Gajdusek replied that he was that team. Around this time he visited the Anga. They did not have kuru but did have an interesting form of welcome: the youths persistently offered to fellate him and regarded it as great fun. After nine months, Gajdusek returned to NIH. There, an American scientist, William Hadlow, wrote saying how similar the brains looked to brains of sheep infected with scrapie. Gajdusek inoculated chimps with extracts of Fore brains, knowing it would be a long time incubating, and went back to the hospital he had founded for the Fore. He visited other tribes with paedophiliac traditions, and in 1963 brought to the US the first of his 56 adopted sons, a 12-year-old Anga boy, who landed barefoot in Washington with a bone through his nose. He put them all through high school, and many through university or medical school. In 1965, two years after they had been inoculated, the chimps started to become ill. Gajdusek consulted a British expert on sheep scrapie, who confirmed that the chimps had died of the same disease that killed the Fore. It was a triumphant moment for Gajdusek, says the science writer DT Max, author of The Family That Couldn&apos;t Sleep, a history of prion disease research: proof that the disease was caused by an infectious agent. By 1976, when he received his Nobel prize, Gajdusek had published 150 papers.  He published a further 450 papers on &quot;slow virus&quot; diseases and ethnography. In 1974 an American neurologist and neuroscientist, Stanley Prusiner, entered the field and coined the term prion (for proteinaceous infectious particle, and incorporating the first two letters of his surname). Prusiner received a Nobel prize in 1997. In the 1990s a member of Gajdusek&apos;s lab had told the FBI that something fishy was going on and that clues might lie in Gajdusek&apos;s diaries. They contained nothing incriminating, apart from a Prufrock-like reference to his inhibitions. The FBI questioned Gajdusek&apos;s adopted sons and found one who was willing to testify; in a taped phone call from the boy, Gajdusek admitted they had masturbated each other. None of the other boys said Gajdusek had touched them and several were willing to give evidence in his favour. Many distinguished scientists pleaded for clemency for him.  Gajdusek was 74 when he emerged after serving a year in prison, his health broken. He retired to Amsterdam, spending his winters in Tromso, Norway. He was unapologetic about his conviction, taking the view that &quot;boys will be boys&quot;. He is survived by his adopted children. \u2022 Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, medical researcher, born 9 September 1923; died 12 December 2008", "sentences": ["He retired to Amsterdam, spending his winters in Tromso, Norway."], "title": "Obituary: Carleton Gajdusek", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/25/carleton-gajdusek-obituary", "tags": ["Neuroscience", "Biochemistry and molecular biology", "Medical research", "People in science", "Science", "US news", "World news", "Biology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-25T15:41:13Z", "article": "      The Turkish Airlines plane that crashed in Amsterdam would have taken a &quot;pretty severe whack&quot; as it hit the ground but appeared likely to have been at least partly under control when it came down, an expert said today. Kieran Daly, editor of the online news service Air Transport Intelligence, said the range of possible causes of the accident was so wide that it was impossible to speculate at this stage. &quot;What you can say is that there&apos;s been a reasonably severe impact because it&apos;s done a lot of damage to the aircraft,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;A 737 doesn&apos;t break up all that easily. You&apos;ve got to get a pretty severe whack to do that and you would expect some people to be quite seriously hurt. &quot;The fact that there wasn&apos;t a fire is indicative that you didn&apos;t have a grotesquely out of control situation. If a plane falls from the sky then you immediately have catastrophic explosive damage. Here it looks like the aircraft was either partially or wholly under control when it touched down.&quot; Jane&apos;s aviation analyst Chris Yates said: &quot;A couple of eyewitnesses suggested that the plane lost power, lost propulsion. If those reports are true it potentially indicates that the engines were starved of fuel or that the plane itself simply ran out of fuel.&quot; This theory could be supported by the fact that medics could be seen treating survivors propped up next to the plane&apos;s fuselage, Yates said. &quot;They wouldn&apos;t be that close if there was a small glimmer that there was potential for a fire to break out.&quot; One person posting on the Professional Pilots Rumour Network (PPRuNe) highlighted the fact that fire crews did not appear to be mopping up or putting foam on spilt unignited fuel. But Gideon Evers, a spokesman for the International Federation of Airline Pilots&apos; Associations, said there was no indication the crash had anything to do with the fuel level. Regulations require all commercial flights to carry ample reserves, he said. According to mandatory limits, a passenger airliner must carry sufficient fuel to get to its destination, remain in holding patterns for 45 minutes, possibly divert to an alternate airport, hold for another 45 minutes, and then carry out a normal approach. Other experts said the fact the plane landed in a muddy, plowed field may have helped limit the number of casualties, by absorbing much of the force of the hard impact. It may also have helped avert a fire resulting from ruptured fuel tanks and lines on the underside of the fuselage. Daly said incidents such as this, and the recent survival of everyone on a US Airways plane that crashed into the Hudson River in New York, demonstrated the improvements in aircraft design and building in the last 15 or 20 years. The 737-800, which entered service in 1998, is part of Boeing&apos;s current family of narrow body planes. Some 2,578 737s are in service around the world, 1,490 of them 737-800s. The safety record of the aircraft is &quot;outstanding&quot;, Daly said. &quot;The 737-800 is a very modern aircraft. It&apos;s extremely well designed and well built and it will be around for a long time to come. If you have a situation where it crashes the prognosis for the passengers is very, very good.&quot; Yates said: &quot;It&apos;s a good solid aircraft.&quot; Turkish Airlines had a &quot;relatively good&quot; safety record, he added. &quot;They didn&apos;t have a particularly good record around a decade ago but they&apos;ve taken great strides to improve safety since then.&quot;", "sentences": ["      The Turkish Airlines plane that crashed in Amsterdam would have taken a &quot;pretty severe whack&quot; as it hit the ground but appeared likely to have been at least partly under control when it came down, an expert said today."], "title": "Turkish Airlines plane would have taken a 'severe whack'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/25/plane-crash-amsterdam-turkish-airlines", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "Turkey", "Netherlands", "World news", "Air transport", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-25T15:56:00Z", "article": "     At least nine people were killed today when a Turkish Airlines plane crashed into a field as it came in to land at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, breaking into three sections on impact. Among these who died were the three flight crew, whose bodies remained on the stricken plane, officials said. A total of 80 people had been taken to 11 hospitals around the region, a medical official told a press conference. Six of these were very critically hurt and it was not known whether they would survive. Five others were seriously hurt, she said. The mayor of the municipality, Michel Bezuijen, said the Boeing 737-800, believed to be carrying 135 passengers and crew, crash landed at 10.31am (9.31am GMT). &quot;We cannot say anything about the cause at the moment,&quot; Bezuijen told reporters . &quot;The priority of the authorities is providing assistance and care.&quot; The plane, arriving from Istanbul, was severely damaged as it ploughed into the field while approaching the Polderbaan runway, the newest and furthest from the terminals at Schiphol, 12 miles from Amsterdam&apos;s centre. The impact split the fuselage near the front of the wing, while the tail and a rear section of the body was sheared off. One of the engines was also ripped from a wing and lay around 200 metres from the main wreckage. There was, however, no sign of fire or smoke. Journalists at the scene, a muddy, rutted field edged with a few farm and warehouse buildings, about two miles from the runway perimeter, said they had seen four or five bodies covered with sheets waiting to be removed. A number of other injured people were taken away in stretchers. Turkey&apos;s transport minister, Binali Yildirim, said it was &quot;a miracle&quot; that more people did not die. &quot;The fact that the plane landed on a soft surface and that there was no fire helped keep the number of fatalities low,&quot; he said. One passenger told Turkey&apos;s NTV television that the plane lost height suddenly as it came in to land, striking the ground tail first. &quot;We were at an altitude of 600 metres when we heard the announcement that we were landing,&quot; Kerem Uzel said. &quot;We suddenly descended a great distance as if the plane fell into turbulence. The plane&apos;s tail hit the ground.&quot; Another passenger, Tuncer Mutluhan, told NTV: &quot;While we were making a normal landing, it felt like we fell into a void, the plane lost control, suddenly plunged and crashed.&quot; This happened &quot;in three or five seconds&quot;.      A local man said it appeared to him that the plane was gliding without any power. &quot;The plane was nose up and the tail section was at a 45-degree angle. The tail section broke down first, which broke off,&quot; Thomas Freidhoff told the BBC. &quot;And seconds after the crash people started exiting through the tail section ...

Some 550 yards before landing the plane landed on a field instead of the runway,&quot; he said. &quot;We have checked the plane&apos;s documents and there is no problem concerning maintenance.&quot; The airline was flying relatives of those on the flight to Amsterdam this afternoon, after Dutch authorities suspended the usual visa requirements. The airline described the plane&apos;s captain, a former air force pilot, as very experienced. Gideon Evers, spokesman of the International Federation of Airline Pilots&apos; Associations, said the cause of the crash remained unclear. &quot;Certainly it appears to be an unusual circumstance, but as always the sensible course of action is to wait for the results of the investigation into the causes leading up to the accident,&quot; he said. There was no indication that the crash had anything to do with the fuel level, Evers said, adding that regulations require all commercial flights to carry ample reserves. The airport, one of the main aviation hubs in Europe and the continent&apos;s fifth-biggest by passenger numbers, was briefly closed to air traffic after the crash, causing some delays and cancellations.

Dozens of safety officials and police worked overnight at the scene of the disaster in the hope of discovering evidence that could help explain why the pilot lost control of the Turkish Airlines plane seconds before it hurtled to the ground. An airport spokesman confirmed today that three Britons were on board the flight. They are believed to be Susan Lord and her daughters Sofia and Lisa Labeij, who were travelling to the Netherlands with Jakavus Labeij, the girls&apos; Turkish father. All are thought to have escaped without serious injury. Of the 125 passengers who survived the crash, six are critically wounded, officials said. Four of seven Americans on board were Boeing employees, Haarlemmermeer mayor Theo Weterings told a press conference at the airport. The flight&apos;s data recorders and voice tapes have been sent to Paris for examination and investigators said they expected the results within days. A separate team is working on location in the field near runway 18R, where the plane hit the ground and smashed into three pieces. Fred Sanders, a spokesman for the Dutch Safety Authority, which is leading the inquiry, said the damage to the aircraft supported witness statements that it had hit the ground tail-down. &quot;This may indicate that the plane had lost its forward momentum, that there was no motor function,&quot; he said, cautioning that it could be a long time before a full explanation was available. &quot;We will have an official finding probably in about a year, but we should be able to give an interim finding within weeks,&quot; said Sanders. This morning the Turkish news website Hurriyet.com raised questions about the technical record of the aircraft, quoting sources who said it had been sent for repairs twice last week, undergoing maintenance on 18 February for a failure detected in its flaps, and again on Monday, when its &quot;master caution&quot; lights burned out. Those reports could not be confirmed. Other theories behind the crash, including birds being sucked into the engine and the plane running out of fuel, appeared to be dismissed by investigators. &quot;The cause of the crash is not yet known, and we have no hypothesis at this stage,&quot; said Rob Stenacker, a spokesman for Schiphol police. The pilot of Flight 1951, Hasan Tahsin Arisan, who was one of three crew members to die in the crash, was an experienced former officer in the Turkish air force. There was nothing in the weather to indicate problems \u2013 aside from a slight mistiness, visibility was clear at 5,000 yards. The Boeing 737-800 model has an unblemished safety record. Today&apos;s Turkish newspapers are critical of Turkish Airlines and the government&apos;s handling of the crisis. Initial statements claimed all passengers and crew had survived the crash. It was only hours after that the full extent of the casualties became clear.

Doctor Atomic has already been seen in Amsterdam and Chicago, in Peter Sellars&apos;s staging created for the 2005 premiere in San Francisco. But for its British debut, English National Opera joined forces with the Metropolitan Opera in New York in a new version directed by Penny Woolcock, whose credits include an impressive film of Adams&apos;s The Death of Klinghoffer.  The decision is certainly vindicated. Adams&apos;s portrayal of the events leading up to the testing of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert in July 1945 is far more convincing musically and dramatically than it seemed at its premiere. Woolcock&apos;s naturalistic staging, with designs by Julian Crouch and carefully gauged video projections, is far less cluttered and tendentious than Sellars&apos;s original, doing away entirely with the mimsy, inappropriate choreography.  Yet, though it has been possible to take Sellars out of the production, his contribution to the opera itself, as author of the libretto, remains persistently problematic. The text is a mosaic of borrowings from documentary sources, with extracts from Baudelaire, the Bhagavad Gita and a Donne sonnet thrown in for good measure. It&apos;s all too wordy, lacking real dramatic sweep or momentum. The kernel of the story - the uneasy alliance between the military and the scientists led by Robert Oppenheimer making the bomb, and the moral doubts of those involved - is also blurred by the domestic scenes in the Oppenheimer household, with Kitty Oppenheimer and the Navajo maid Pasqualita, which have a touchy-feely PC irrelevance about them. With that stripped away, the focus narrowed and perhaps even an all-male cast (like Britten&apos;s Billy Budd), it might have been more cogent.  The conductor, Lawrence Renes, shows there are moments in Adams&apos;s music that promise a tighter dramatic grip. Too often, though, as in the shapeless scene in the Oppenheimers&apos; bedroom, a lack of harmonic movement becalms everything. The setting of the Donne sonnet, Batter My Heart, which ends the first act, remains the standout musical number, especially when sung with the gilded beauty that Gerald Finley brings to it; his neurotic, chain-smoking Oppenheimer is a remarkable portrayal. There are other well-formed characters, too - Brindley Sherratt as Edward Teller, Thomas Glenn as Robert Wilson, Jonathan Veira as General Groves. There is the stuff of a real opera in Doctor Atomic somewhere.

Perahia has a reputation for austerity, haughtiness even, and my spirits sank further when, as I rang the doorbell of his house in Ealing, west London, I could hear him practising the Schumann piano concerto, which he is about to play in Amsterdam and London. This man from Porlock was surely guaranteed a frosty reception. But, no, Perahia smiled weakly as he answered the door, ushered me into a room filled with records, CDs, paintings and all the stuff accumulated in this dark, warm, lived-in house over the past 30 years, and made me - or at least got his Spanish housekeeper to make me - a large cup of tea. Perhaps, now 61 but still looking curiously boyish, he is mellowing. He is deeply serious and a little unworldly - he hadn&apos;t heard about the opening of the two new concert halls at Kings Place, London N1 - but he has a willing laugh. How many concerts does he play in a year? &quot;I never count.&quot; Laughs. Why hasn&apos;t he recorded all the Beethoven sonatas? &quot;They&apos;re difficult.&quot; Laughs. He is perfectly at ease, balancing his tea precariously on an expensive-looking yellow cushion, happy to dismiss Lang Lang&apos;s suggestion that pianists over 60 can&apos;t hack it. &quot;I haven&apos;t slowed down yet. Maybe it will come.&quot; He doesn&apos;t sound as though he thinks it will. In any case, age brings compensations. &quot;I understand much more than I did when I was 40.&quot; As long as he holds together physically, he will never retire. &quot;I&apos;ll always play,&quot; he says. In the 1990s, he had to take three long breaks because of a recurrent thumb problem. Did he fear for his career? &quot;That wasn&apos;t the preoccupying thing, because I don&apos;t think in career terms,&quot; he says. &quot;The preoccupying thing was that I might never play again. Playing is more important than speaking to me.&quot; During those enforced breaks, he did some conducting, and he still occasionally conducts or directs from the piano - he is principal guest conductor of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields - but he has no desire to switch roles. &quot;I&apos;m not a conductor. I love to play the piano. I love the instrument. I think it has a series of secrets that we have to find out from it.&quot; A key figure in helping him unlock them was Vladimir Horowitz, with whom Perahia worked in his late 30s. &quot;His was a totally different kind of music-making from mine,&quot; he says, &quot;but I admired him very much. He was very concerned with the public and how an audience would respond to something. We all are to some extent, but he played his showpieces for the public. He was a gigantic pianist. He played for me the night before he died.&quot; Perahia had a charmed beginning to what he prefers not to think of as a career. He saw himself primarily as a chamber musician until he won the Leeds piano competition in 1972. That victory launched his solo career, but he also made a point of working alongside the very greatest artists - collaborating with Benjamin Britten at Aldeburgh, and accompanying Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Janet Baker in recitals. To hear the recording of Schubert&apos;s Fantasia he made with his friend and kindred spirit Radu Lupu at Aldeburgh in 1984 is to get close to the heart of his music-making: intense, lyrical, entirely without affectation, transcendent. A New Yorker by birth, he came to live in the UK in 1975, attracted by the vivacity of musical life here - &quot;Tippett was writing a new opera every year, Britten was writing, and the BBC covered everything, so it was very exciting&quot; - and has been here ever since (though a gentle New York twang persists), bringing up two sons in this unshowy suburban house. You sense he is no longer quite so captivated by the wider musical scene: he cultivates his own art and says he prefers to listen to musicians of previous generations. &quot;I listen to Casals, Furtw\u00e4ngler, Edwin Fischer, Cortot. The sound quality is so elevated, their playing is beyond the materialistic, there&apos;s no technique involved - it&apos;s just speaking, it&apos;s such natural music-making. We have difficulties with natural music-making.&quot; The separation of classical and popular music has, he believes, undermined that naturalness. &quot;In the early part of the last century, you had the popular music, like Gershwin and Cole Porter, but they were also really good classical composers, and the classical composers, even up until Schoenberg, were writing dance music, popular music. This has stopped: classical music is in its sphere and popular music is in its sphere, and therefore the popular rhythms don&apos;t infect classical music. We&apos;ve gotten elitist in a way, and that&apos;s dangerous.&quot; Schoenberg occurs several times in our conversation. He marks a dividing line for Perahia, who performs nothing later than Pierrot Lunaire, which was premiered in 1912. &quot;I play pretty much everything until Schoenberg, but I don&apos;t play atonal music because I don&apos;t understand it. Atonal music tries to get its organicism from intellectual concepts. This is serious music. It tries to be comprehensive, in fact. Every note is taken care of, all relationships are judged, and there&apos;s a unity in some way, but it&apos;s hard for a tonal person to understand it. It measures music completely differently, and you have to have another education for it, which I never properly got.&quot; Organicism is a key word in Perahia&apos;s musical lexicon. He is a devotee of the early 20th-century Austrian music theorist Heinrich Schenker, who believed the emotional meaning of a piece could be unlocked by close study of its form. Perahia makes several valiant attempts to explain Schenkerian thinking to me. &quot;I&apos;m drawn to [his ideas of] structure because this is what music is about to me - these subconscious elements, things that we&apos;re not really aware of when we&apos;re listening on the surface. But there is a pattern underneath, and you can see it more clearly if you study it. It&apos;s the same with life. We&apos;re taken by the surface events, but a really experienced psychoanalyst will see something deeper than just the surface events, and that&apos;s what Schenker tries to do in music.&quot; Perahia is at his most animated when he is talking about Schenker. My questions - about whether classical music is in decline, whether record companies are selling out, how careers are constructed - don&apos;t interest him. What does is understanding the pieces he is attempting to communicate. It is purism, yet not of the oppressive, self-conscious sort. He just wants to know what these great and difficult pieces - the only pieces he will play in public, leaving lesser works for his own private amusement - mean. &quot;How do Beethoven and Mozart create a world within a single piece? That&apos;s what fascinates me. &quot;I don&apos;t think the structure and logic is intellectual,&quot; he says, reverting to Schenker. &quot;I think it&apos;s an emotional thing. We&apos;ve gotten to something that I think is quite important. I like complicated emotions. The simple &apos;I love you&apos; doesn&apos;t appeal to me. &apos;What do you love?&apos; It&apos;s involved with your past, and love and hate are not so dissimilar. Things are very complicated, and when music is also complicated but has a real emotional message through all of this complication, that&apos;s when I&apos;m really happiest.&quot;  And he does look happy, radiantly so, until I revert to dull questions about his thumb and his concert schedule. Then he starts to dry up, and I have a sense that he would quite like to go back to the Schumann, to search for the sublime.  \u2022 Murray Perahia plays Schumann&apos;s Piano Concerto with Bernard Haitink and the Concertgebouw Orchestra at the Barbican, London, on 15 March.", "sentences": ["Perahia has a reputation for austerity, haughtiness even, and my spirits sank further when, as I rang the doorbell of his house in Ealing, west London, I could hear him practising the Schumann piano concerto, which he is about to play in Amsterdam and London."], "title": "Stephen Moss interviews Murray Perahia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/27/murray-perahia-interview", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-27T13:52:11Z", "article": "Survivors of the Turkish Airlines flight that crashed near Amsterdam have been giving further details of the moments before the plane went down. Investigators remain at the scene, mapping the exact location of each piece of debris in search of the cause of the crash, which killed nine people. One survivor, Henk Heijloo, said the last announcement he heard from the captain was for flight crew to take their seats. Heijloo said it took him a few moments to realise that the landing had gone wrong. &quot;We were coming in at an odd angle, and I felt the pilot give the plane more gas,&quot; he said. He thought the pilot might have been trying to abort the landing, because the nose came up. Kerem Uzel, a student, told Turkey&apos;s NTV television that he had not realised anything was wrong until the plane skidded through the muddy field. Flight TK1951 was coming in from Istanbul with 135 passengers and crew when it crashed about one mile short of the runway at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport on Wednesday. Witnesses on the ground said the plane dropped abruptly from about 90 metres (300ft). As 40 investigators work at the crash site, the plane&apos;s data recordings are being analysed in Paris. Sandra Groenendal, a spokeswoman for the Dutch safety authority, said a first assessment of what went wrong according to the black box would probably be released by next Wednesday. Pieter van Vollenhoven, the head of the safety authority, said yesterday that the Boeing 737-800 had fallen almost straight down, pointing towards engine failure. Groenendal confirmed this version of events but said engine failure was still only &quot;one of the possible scenarios&quot; for the crash. Five Turks\u201a including both pilots, and four Americans were killed when the plane crash-landed into a farmer&apos;s field on Wednesday morning, breaking into three pieces. Two of the dead Americans were Boeing employees \u2013 the plane maker said a third was injured and the condition of a fourth was unknown. Some of the bodies had not yet been formally identified, officials said. Theo Weterings, the mayor of the municipality of Haarlemmermeer, where Schiphol is located, said relatives of dead had been informed. &quot;After the identification process is complete and fulfilled, then there will be the possibility for [each family] to have the corpse and bring it home,&quot; he said. Several survivors of the crash returned to Istanbul on Thursday, including one young man in a wheelchair with his wrist bandaged. Investigators are exploring possible causes ranging from weather to insufficient fuel, loss of fuel, navigational errors, pilot fatigue or bird strike. &quot;[It] just fell straight down and then you heard the engines at full power as if it was trying to go forwards,&quot; a survivor, Fred Gimpel, told Dutch NOS news. &quot;It probably went up too steeply and stalled, and then the tail hit the ground.&quot; The Turkish Airlines chief, Temel Kotil, said the captain, Hasan Tahsin Arisan, was an experienced former air force pilot. The airline denied reports that the plane, built in 2002, had technical problems in the days before the accident. It had routine maintenance on February 19 and had to delay a flight on February 23, the day before the crash\u201a to replace a faulty warning light. The weather at the airport on Wednesday morning was cloudy with light drizzle. A recording of the conversations between air traffic controllers and the pilots revealed nothing unusual in the final moments before the crash. A controller read out the proper radio frequency for requesting clearance to land. &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; the pilot replied.", "sentences": ["Survivors of the Turkish Airlines flight that crashed near Amsterdam have been giving further details of the moments before the plane went down.", "Flight TK1951 was coming in from Istanbul with 135 passengers and crew when it crashed about one mile short of the runway at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport on Wednesday."], "title": "Turkish Airlines crash: plane 'fell straight down'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/27/turkish-airlines-crash-schipol", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "Netherlands", "Turkey", "World news", "Air transport", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-02-27T16:47:40Z", "article": "Thanks to the Drudge effect, the most read story on the Guardian&apos;s website this week was Monday&apos;s front page report that police in Britain are preparing for a &quot;summer of rage&quot; as victims of the economic downturn take to the streets to demonstrate against financial institutions. This time it won&apos;t be just the usual suspects \u2013 students and anti-globalisation activists \u2013 but middle-class folks who would never have considered joining demonstrations, Superintendent David Hartshorn tells the Guardian&apos;s reporter Paul Lewis. When it comes to public anger, Britain&apos;s most loathed man right now is probably Sir Fred Goodwin, the former head of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The press often latch on to a person to humanise a complex story. Goodwin, who has driven RBS over a cliff with an ill-timed deal, is very much that person in the banking saga. In Goodwin&apos;s case, though, it is not so much a case of humanise as demonise as this 50-year-old ex-master of the universe refuses to give back his \u00a3690,000-a-year pension despite colossal losses at RBS. In medieval times, Goodwin would have been placed in the stocks so that jeering mobs could throw rotten fruit and vegetables at him. The stocks, considered cruel and unusual punishment, are no longer used. These days vilification comes at the hands of the tabloid press. Goodwin was on most front pages on Friday with headlines such as Obscene at the Express and Off with his Fred at the Mirror. It&apos;s not just the tabloids, the quality press is barking mad at Goodwin for not doing the decent thing and handing back at least some of the dosh. But as Larry Elliott, the Guardian&apos;s economics editor, points out, public outrage over Goodwin&apos;s pension, although inevitable, is just diverting attention from the big issue: that policymakers are rapidly running out of options in their attempts to pull the global economy out of its nosedive.  One man trying hard to come up with solutions is Barack Obama, who had a big week not just with what was effectively his first state of the union message but his $1,700bn ($1,200bn) budget. The media on both sides of the Atlantic agree on Obama&apos;s audacity. &quot;Even more stark than the breadth and scale of Obama&apos;s proposals was his determination to break with the conservative principles that have dominated national politics and policymaking since Ronald Reagan&apos;s election as president in 1980,&quot; the Los Angeles Times reported. The Financial Times says by asking Congress to back his campaign promises on health and the environment when the global financial system is in meltdown Obama is gambling that Americans will see the crisis in the same way that he does - as an opportunity to remake the country. But it&apos;s not all gloom and doom \u2013 the fantasy world of Hollywood provided a momentary respite from tales of economic woe. If past history is any guide, cinemas should do well as people seek solace from economic misery in the movies. So appropriately enough, the second most read story on theguardian.com this week was our live coverage of the Oscars by the incomparable Xan Brooks, with a cup of industrial strength cup of coffee at his elbow to help him stay awake through the night. For the first time, the Guardian&apos;s Oscar coverage was accompanied by a theguardian.com/film Twitter feed.  An article about Gail Trimble, captain of Corpus Christi College Oxford on University Challenge, made it number three on the Guardian&apos;s hits list. The point-scoring phenomenon has been described as the cleverest contestant on University Challenge ever, a moniker that irritated Marcel Berlins in his weekly column for the Guardian.  It&apos;s the word clever that gets me. Trimble may be, almost certainly is, very clever. But the proof of it cannot be gauged by her excellence on University Challenge. What she has proved is that she has a huge fund of general knowledge, which she can summon up very quickly. But that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean she&apos;s clever.

Turning our attention to most read stories elsewhere, a column by George Will for the Washington Post turns up on that paper&apos;s list.

At night I would put my head on the pillow and think: &apos;My God, look at me, I grew up on a farm in Brazil and here I am now, an idol, in Europe.&apos; It actually makes me very emotional.&quot; The English way is not so kind. In fact, it can be brutal. &quot;Dodgy keeper&quot; is among the chants that have greeted Gomes at away grounds during his troubled first season at Tottenham Hotspur, when opposition players have talked of strategically targeting him \u2013 and he has been to blame for more goals than he would like to remember. On Match of the Day, Alan Hansen has even questioned whether there has ever been a worse goalkeeper in the Premier League. It probably says more about the knee-jerk world of modern-day punditry than Gomes&apos;s true ability, but by his own admission, his inaugural season as a Spurs player has been the most harrowing period of his professional life. &quot;It has been a very difficult time for me,&quot; he says,&quot;it has also been a shock. If you look back through my career, I&apos;ve never had a bad period before, whether it be for Cruzeiro, PSV or Brazil. This has been the first time I have suffered like this.&quot; Gomes, after all, used to go by the nickname of o goleiro grande, the great goalkeeper, back in Brazil. In his final season in the Netherlands, he was runner-up in the player of the year awards, breaking club records for clean sheets. &quot;This is what has kept me going. I know I have made mistakes, but I have always believed it is a bad period that will pass if I am strong. If I had ever thought I had become so bad I could not help the team, I would have been the first person to tell the club: &apos;That&apos;s it, I should go.&apos; But I have always thought I will come back and be the goalkeeper I was before.&quot; As always with goalkeepers, it is probably a question of confidence and it must be easy for Tottenham fans to worry about Gomes&apos;s state of mind going into tomorrow&apos;s Carling Cup final, bearing in mind he is playing only because Carlo Cudicini is cup-tied. Gomes has not played in the league since Cudicini signed from Chelsea last month and his performance in the away leg of the Uefa Cup tie against Shakhtar Donetsk nine days ago led to more derogatory headlines. The media in England have never been known for their compassion for expensive foreigners and few allowances have been made for the fact it cannot be easy at a new club, learning a new language and playing for a struggling team. Nor that Gomes has been troubled by a painful hip injury for most of the season. &quot;I don&apos;t want to use anything as an excuse,&quot; he says, &quot;but there have been times when I have been playing in agony. It would have been very easy to tell the media: &apos;Look, I&apos;m playing with an injury, the pain is incredible,&apos; but it&apos;s not my way. I was on the pitch for the good of the club. If it had been for myself, I would have been having treatment. &quot;I think the criticism was a bit over the top, it wouldn&apos;t have been anything like as fierce in Brazil. Inside the club, they know what I have been through.&quot; They are certainly protective of him behind the scenes at White Hart Lane. Gomes is a popular member of the dressing room and the manager, Harry Redknapp, has encouraged him to believe that he can re-establish himself in the team. &quot;He came to me when my confidence was low and said: &apos;I know what sort of goalkeeper you are and I know you are going to get through this.&apos; That was very important to me. I also found out he&apos;d spoken to people in Holland who assured him not to worry because, in their opinion, he had one of the best goalkeepers in Europe.&quot; The \u00a37.8m signing is talking in a quiet little office at the Alan Pullinger Centre in Southgate, north London, perched on a seat that seems far too small for that impressive 6ft 3in frame. As part of the Premier League&apos;s Creating Chances programme, Tottenham have donated \u00a33,000 to help Enfield Children and Young Persons Services run their youth club here and Gomes has spent an hour taking on the members at table football, air hockey and a Nintendo Wii contest. Not all footballers enjoy devoting their evenings to community events, but the 28-year-old is having fun. &quot;It&apos;s important for me to take the time to meet young fans,&quot; he explains. &quot;When you become a top footballer you have to remember where you came from.&quot; Later, he talks about the way some footballers spend money and he seems almost embarrassed that he belongs to a profession of such extravagance. &quot;I know footballers who have no notion of any sort of values in life. They think that because they earn a lot of money they can spend it like there&apos;s no tomorrow. They have no idea about what is really important.&quot; Gomes is different, refreshingly grounded, no diamond earrings, no attitude \u2013 a legacy, undoubtedly, of his upbringing in Minas Gerais, in south-east Brazil. &quot;I came from a town that was so small there was no electricity and no school,&quot; he says. &quot;We lived on a farm and we all mucked in, herding the cattle, looking after the horses, ploughing the land. This was my education.&quot; His eyes sparkle as he recalls his 6am starts to attend farm duties.

This is glamour at its most old-school - low-key, subtle and definitely upmarket.

One, El Armario (on Carrer de la Riereta), involves actually walking through the owner&apos;s wardrobe to get to the bar area. Far too cool for a telephone number or website, it rarely opens before 3am (and sometimes not at all) but if you do get in there&apos;s a fair chance you&apos;ll be the only tourists there. If it&apos;s closed, try El Mariachi (corner of Carrer dels C\u00f2dols and Carrer d&apos;En Rull in the Gothic quarter) or The Front Room (its unofficial name - it doesn&apos;t really have one), behind the metal door on Carrer d&apos;En Carabassa.

From the outside, a tourist would only see a row of dangling hams and an old-fashioned till. But &quot;tras tienda&quot; translates as &quot;behind the shop&quot;, so locals disappear behind the counter to find a cosy bar serving good house wines, local beer and, of course, Andalucian meats.

Ring the doorbell, however, and you are ushered into a scarlet-walled den, with gold drapes and warm lighting giving proceedings a sultry, &quot;boudoir&quot; feel - probably because it was a brothel in a former life. The thirtysomething crowd may look grown-up, but the tiny dance floor is always packed, regardless of the sometimes eclectic playlists (which can range from rockabilly to schlager - Austrian country music).

Don&apos;t expect languid sophisticates sipping Cosmoplitans; this is Czech grunge at its most, um, grungiest. House rules are nonexistent (apart from respecting other punters) and the house cocktail mixes vodka, gin, tequila and white rum.

The lounge is where the band plays and where the staff dispense drinks, and there are several smaller rooms - all dimly lit and cosy - although there is space to dance in the main room.

Duhamel failed to send off the Paris Saint-Germain pair of St\u00e9phane Sessegnon and Claude Makelele in a match against St Etienne and the players were later suspended for three and two games respectively on account of a headbutt and a reckless tackle. The referee was again widely criticised for his handling of a game between Rennes and Nice.

The actor Stephen Fry is one famous exponent, and MPs have jumped on the bandwagon too. Jim Knight, the schools minister, is a regular tweeter, whose recent posts range from the inane &quot;realised I never had that pancake yesterday - does that mean I can ignore Lent?&quot; to the more waspish &quot;wondering for how much longer we&apos;ll have to listen to Michael Gove&quot;.

Now even a few further education colleges have caught on. Sort of. When it comes to writing succinctly, we further education sorts do struggle. We&apos;re used to using eight words when one would do, and flabby paragraphs with 50-word sentences. And we do love our jargon.

Breaking news News of the Chinese earthquake last year broke on Twitter, as did the first images of the US Airways plane that had to crash-land in New York&apos;s Hudson river and last week&apos;s crash at Schipol airport near Amsterdam. The FE sector isn&apos;t tweeting on such a grand scale, but it&apos;s interesting to see the difference between how colleges and universities are using this forum. University tweets are &quot;talking&quot; to their current students: they warn of campus disruption, inclement weather and current research. Nottingham Trent University is looking for past and present cannabis users - it wants to establish whether users are more prone to developing schizotypal personality. Meanwhile, some colleges - struggling to see the wood for the trees - are tweeting about the &quot;special of the day&quot; in the canteen. It gets worse. Delve deeper and you will find some very odd posts on colleges&apos; Twitter pages. One college tells us &quot;network upgrade takeing [sic] place service interruptions possible during next 30 minutes&quot;. And that &quot;all studio (gym) classes this week canceled [sic] due to the adverse weather conditions&quot;. Another college &quot;tweets&quot;: &quot;Adapting my &apos;Ldap Active Directory users to SQL database&apos; webpage, Ldap queries are so intuitive (ha ha).&quot; Yet another says: &quot;Just opened a Twitter account.&quot; It&apos;s gripping stuff; you can see why students would want to enrol. But is there a right way to use Twitter, and what could colleges use it for? I know my college currently has around 100 &quot;followers&quot; but I don&apos;t know who is reading the posts, or where they come from - because you don&apos;t have to be a &quot;follower&quot;, or even be logged-in, to read a Twitter page. This means it can&apos;t be used as a robust marketing tool; I can&apos;t measure if it&apos;s helping to put &quot;bums on seats&quot;. Personality Colleges can build a &quot;personality&quot; using Twitter; a faceless institution can communicate a sense of humour, passion and even quality through this medium. Cornwall College&apos;s Twitter page isn&apos;t &quot;talking&quot; directly to students because younger students aren&apos;t yet the ones looking at Twitter. We have seven campuses, 40,000 learners and 3,000 staff, so we need to appeal to a wide community. Students, staff, parents, businesses, alumni - they&apos;re all out there, and we need to keep them engaged and interested in the college and what it&apos;s trying to achieve. &quot;I do think it&apos;s important for colleges to engage with social media,&quot; says Heather Yaxley, a lecturer at Bournemouth University and social media expert. She says it&apos;s too soon to see where the real potential lies. &quot;At the least they need to monitor and understand what&apos;s going on.&quot; Twitter might not be here for the long term, but colleges should take advantage of the hype. There&apos;s such a lot of noise around Twitter - it&apos;s free, and easy to get involved in.

Nine demonstrators from the Plane Stupid campaign group cut through Aberdeen airport&apos;s perimeter fence at around 2.15am in protest at BAA&apos;s plans to expand the airport. Seven protesters who had put up a &quot;wire fortress&quot; on a taxiway for North Sea helicopters handed themselves over to Grampian police at about 8.20am. Two others on the terminal roof surrendered to police at about 9.30am. Plane Stupid said the protesters were dressed as golfers in imitation of the New York property tycoon, who is building a major \u00a31bn golfing resort north of Aberdeen and supports the airport&apos;s growth. Wearing wigs and golfing visors, the demonstrators staged a mock game of golf with plastic clubs and balls. The protesters on the roof unveiled a banner stating: &quot;Nae Trump Games with Climate Change&quot;. The protest was timed to prevent commercial flights from beginning at 5am and led to delays of at least three hours to all early morning services, including flights to Heathrow, Paris and Amsterdam. Four incoming flights \u2013 from Paris Charles de Gaulle, Bristol, East Midlands and Humberside \u2013 were cancelled before scheduled flights resumed shortly after 9am. Incoming flights from Wick, Durham Tees Valley and Newcastle were also delayed, while a flight to Sumburgh, in Shetland, was cancelled. The protest also disrupted routine North Sea oil industry helicopter flights from what is one of Europe&apos;s busiest heliports. Some services were able to resume at 8am after BAA shifted takeoffs to another area of the airport, but the disruption has continued. &quot;It has been a bit stop-start,&quot; a spokeswoman for Bristows, one of the main North Sea operators, said. Plane Stupid said the protests, the first to disrupt commercial flights at a Scottish airport, were designed to highlight the escalating impact of aviation on the climate and protest against the UK-wide expansion of airports. Aberdeen has been given permission to increase passenger numbers by 1.5m by 2015, the group said. The airport is a major business hub, particularly for the oil and tourism industries, but it also provides lifeline services to Orkney and Shetland and some emergency air services. The group quoted one of its members on the roof, Jonny Agnew, a 22-year-old from Edinburgh, as saying: &quot;We have been failed by the generation of Donald Trump and Alex Salmond. &quot;Despite a catalogue of scientific reports warning them that they can&apos;t keep on with aviation growth, they continue with disregard for all of us who will end up dealing with the impacts of the climate crisis. &quot;The reality is that our generation&apos;s future is vanishing so that people like Donald Trump and his super-rich friends can jet into Aberdeen for a round of golf.&quot; A BAA spokesman condemned the protest as &quot;dangerous and highly irresponsible&quot;, adding: &quot;Aberdeen is one of Europe&apos;s busiest commercial heliports and a major transport centre for the north of Scotland, used by tens of thousands of people every day. &quot;There is no justification for this irresponsible action, which is deliberately calculated to delay and inconvenience the travelling public. &quot;Passengers are being advised that the airport is not closed, and are asked to contact their airlines directly for more information about flight schedules.&quot; A Grampian police spokesman said the protesters on the taxiway voluntarily gave themselves up after talks with police. Last December, Plane Stupid activists disrupted Stansted airport, in Essex, occupying part of the runway and forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights. Police made 38 arrests. In January last year, more than 20 protesters targeted the offices of private aviation firm Greer Aviation at Edinburgh airport, unveiling a banner that read: &quot;This planet has no emergency exits.&quot;", "sentences": ["The protest was timed to prevent commercial flights from beginning at 5am and led to delays of at least three hours to all early morning services, including flights to Heathrow, Paris and Amsterdam."], "title": "Climate change protest disrupts flights at Aberdeen airport", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/03/aberdeen-airport-climate-protest", "tags": ["Environmental activism", "Climate change", "Environment", "Heathrow Airports Authority", "Business", "Scotland", "UK news", "Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "Aberdeen"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-04T00:01:00Z", "article": "   Ex-billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky sits behind a soldier in court yesterday. Photograph: Sergei Ilnitsky/EPA    Former billionaire oligarch and government critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky went on trial for a second time in Moscow yesterday, in a case seen as a test of Russia&apos;s president Dmitry Medvedev and his promise to end the country&apos;s &quot;legal nihilism&quot;. Khodorkovsky, an oil tycoon who fell foul of Russia&apos;s former president Vladimir Putin and was jailed in Siberia for tax evasion, faces fresh charges of money laundering and embezzlement. He is accused this time of stealing $25bn. His supporters claim the case is a political attempt by the Kremlin to keep Khodorkovsky in prison. The tycoon, once Russia&apos;s richest man, was jailed for eight years in 2005. Khodorkovsky made his first public appearance in Moscow since 2005 after being flown in last week from his Siberian prison. Looking tired and considerably older, but in apparent good spirits, he smiled and joked with his business partner Platon Lebedev, who is also on trial. Yesterday&apos;s preliminary proceedings were held in secret. Reporters were allowed into the building to watch the trial on three TV screens downstairs, but court officials switched the monitors off seconds before the case began. The case is likely to be Russia&apos;s most high-profile legal event this year. Khodorkovsky&apos;s original prosecution was widely seen as retribution, ordered by Putin, after the tycoon funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 Duma elections.  Some analysts, however, believe the choice of Moscow rather than Siberia as a trial venue is a hopeful sign. President Medvedev insists he wants to replace Russia&apos;s corrupt and inefficient judiciary with a genuinely independent legal system. This trial is the big test.  &quot;This case is of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where Russia is going,&quot; Robert Amsterdam, one of Khodorkovsky&apos;s lawyers, said yesterday.

Amid the hustle and steam, Penny Newman, Fifteen&apos;s new chief executive, is extolling the virtues of the antipasti, mountains of which are being prepared with considerable aplomb by some of the trainee chefs enrolled on Fifteen&apos;s apprenticeship training programme. Fifteen was launched, with the help of a major TV series, as one of the UK&apos;s most high-profile social business experiments and established Oliver as one of Britain&apos;s first celebrity social entrepreneurs. The restaurant was set up as the trading arm for the Fifteen Foundation, a charity providing disadvantaged young people with the chance to gain vocational catering skills to help them get into the workplace. Seven years on, out of the 182 young people who enrolled on the 18-month apprenticeship, just over half have graduated, and of those, three-quarters are still working in the catering industry. And although Fifteen has expanded to Cornwall, Amsterdam and as far away as Melbourne, it has been somewhat overshadowed by Oliver&apos;s growing missionary zeal about everything from bad school dinners and obesity to unethically sourced meat, and to his growing portfolio of documentaries, books, public campaigns and new restaurant launches. Newman is here to change that. Coming from 10 years as chief executive of Fairtrade coffee company, Cafedirect, she says Fifteen&apos;s trustees hired her because she &quot;knows trading&quot; and could bring a balance of financial and values-driven business and marketing expertise. She says that although the job is &quot;bad for the waistline&quot;, it offers her the biggest challenge of her career. She says: &quot;There are a lot of misconceptions about Fifteen, such as that we&apos;re booked up all the time, and we&apos;re not, that Jamie is always around, and he&apos;s not. I think people understand what Fifteen was about seven years ago but don&apos;t know what has happened since then, and that the apprenticeship scheme is even still here. I want to make Fifteen a distinct brand, separate from peoples memories of the TV show or whatever.&quot; Newman came to Fifteen to &quot;feel the fear, the butterflies again, to give transforming something a real go one more time&quot;. As well as looking to reshape its business model, she wants Fifteen to expand its social objectives. Training hub &quot;Historically, the chef apprenticeship scheme has been the limit of the work of the foundation,&quot; she says. &quot;The nucleus of my vision for Fifteen is that we can become a training hub for the whole hotel industry, offering young people skills in every aspect of the restaurant business, such as sourcing and procurement or front of house. So you dont need to want to become a chef in order to come through our programme.&quot; Newman recognises that, to do this, she needs to make Fifteens commercial trading arm - the restaurant - more profitable and make sure more money is coming into the foundation by linking up with partner organisations. &quot;I want to link up with other food companies to think about other training schemes and opportunities we can offer, to &apos;pass on&apos; the young people, to nick one of Jamie&apos;s expressions, who come into contact with the foundation,&quot; she says. &quot;I think we can expand what we are doing, rejuvenate the brand, get marketing back on its feet, and start shouting more about what we&apos;re doing.&quot; Rejuvenating and building brands is one of Newman&apos;s fortes. After cutting her teeth in the retail and beauty sector, working on brands such as Avon and Faberge, her introduction to values-driven business came when she took a marketing job at The Body Shop in 1993. &quot;Before then, I&apos;d come from these American and German retail and beauty companies where it was all about the bottom line and I didn&apos;t even think about what was in the product or who was behind it. It was just about the marketing. This idea of injecting social and ethical principles into the business model just appealed to me intuitively. It felt like my eyes were just opened, it was that quick.&quot; She was shocked, therefore, by the late Anita Roddick&apos;s decision in 2006 to sell The Body Shop to the German beauty conglomerate, L&apos;Oreal. The need to hold true to the founding principles and objectives of the social business model, she says, defined her leadership of Cafedirect. During her decade as chief executive, it grew from a small niche company selling products in charity shops to the world&apos;s sixth largest coffee brand, whose sales benefit more than 1.4 million farmers and their communities in the developing world. &quot;I came to Cafedirect from The Body Shop, where the business was going in a direction I didn&apos;t agree with and shifting from a social towards a financial base,&quot; she says. &quot;I remember my first day in the job thinking about the potential of what Cafedirect could do, and my overwhelming feeling was, &apos;I can&apos;t let this die.&apos;&quot; Concept of fairness According to Newman, the thing that not only ensured the company&apos;s survival but also its growth, was changing the business from a trading model built on the concept of fairness to a governance and ownership model where the company was part-owned both by the producer farmers and the consumers. When she first started at Cafedirect, Newman struggled to find language to explain what the company did. While she is delighted that the &quot;funky term&quot; social enterprise is now common parlance, she fears that its protaganists&apos; inability to talk about profit is an obstacle to success. &quot;Now I&apos;m at Fifteen, its all about deficits and surplus and I can&apos;t help but wonder why we need an alternative language just because it&apos;s a charity,&quot; she says. She recalls her first meeting with the fair trade world, when she started talking about profit and was told gently but firmly that she didn&apos;t understand the world she was now moving in. &quot;I thought, &apos;Actually I do&apos;, because I was visiting farmers who were asking me, &apos;Do the people in England like my coffee? Are you selling more? Can we make more profit?&apos; It wasn&apos;t dirty to them, so why should it be dirty to us?&quot; &quot;We, and by that I mean all people running social businesses, need to embrace the need to grow. I would say that I have seen people not being willing to do this, and they can&apos;t be holding the sector back.&quot; But doesn&apos;t the recession present a serious risk to the continued health of the social enterprise world? Newman believes that, if handled correctly, social businesses could be some of the most well-placed to survive the financial downturn. &quot;What we have to do is build on the interest and respect that consumers now have for businesses providing a social benefit,&quot; she says. &quot;People have lost trust in the business world, in large institutions, and social businesses can survive this recession. We&apos;re more nimble and flexible and if we manage to maintain this trust that we&apos;re doing something different, that we are willing to be transparent and that we do have bigger aims than making a small amount of people a lot of money, then I think the sector will not only survive but could flourish.&quot; With the restaurant filling up with Fifteen&apos;s lunchtime clientele of businessmen and families, she points to the gaggle of trainees in their white hats and striped aprons. &quot;The thing is it&apos;s those people who really should be telling us what they need from us,&quot; she says. &quot;If we keep listening to them and keep an eye on the balance books, I think this place has the potential to change more lives than it already has.&quot; Curriculum Vitae Age 52.

When visitors ask me where to find good restaurants and cafes that won&apos;t break their budget, I tell them to avoid Fisherman&apos;s Wharf, then I give them my list of neighbourhood gems. Although San Francisco is a very small city, life is centered around its neighbourhoods, many of which you can reach via underground metro (BART and Muni) or by bus. You can also walk, which, given the hilly nature of the place, makes for good exercise and provides you with an excuse to indulge in many of the city&apos;s culinary delights. Here are my favourite places to eat, categorised by neighborhood. I have left out restaurants that have been listed in too many guide books and travel articles.  Mission District: Funky, young, and vibrant, the Mission District encompasses the area around Mission, Guerrero and Valencia Streets and is filled with Mexican and Central American restaurants, groceries and shops. In recent years however, it has become more famous for its cafes as well as some of the best French and Italian restaurants in the city. Along Valencia Street alone, you&apos;ll find: (1) Beretta: recently opened Italian restaurant and bar serving delicious small plates and the best thin-crust pizza in the city. They don&apos;t take reservations and the wait is long, but if you go after 8pm, you won&apos;t have trouble getting seated. (2) Gar\u00e7on: a popular French bistro that is always packed and serves some of the best French food in the city at reasonable prices. (3) Dosa: specialises in South Indian food. My favourites are the paper-thin, crepe-like dosas with spicy vegetables (or meat/fish). There&apos;s another Dosa on Fillmore Street in Pacific Heights.  (4) Ritual Coffee Roasters: a cafe that roasts its own beans (which are also sold in other coffee houses in town). They have free Wi-Fi, too.  If you walk towards 18th Street and Guerrero, you will find amazing bread and pastries at the Tartine Bakery &amp; Cafe. But if you are craving ice cream, the absolute best is just down the street at the Bi-Rite Creamery, whose salted caramel and orange cardamom flavours are divine. There&apos;s always a long queue outside Bi-Rite on those rare, hot San Francisco days. On the subject of ice-cream, if you are willing to go further down Guerrero Street as it turns into San Jose Avenue, you will find Mitchell&apos;s Ice Cream which serves Filipino ice cream flavours like sweet coconut, guava, purple yam and jackfruit, alongside other unusual ones such as Mexican chocolate and lucuma (a South American fruit). It&apos;s a neighbourhood hangout, with long queues of ice cream fans even during cold, foggy San Francisco evenings. Downtown (Union Square/Nob Hill/Financial District): The central shopping and financial district is a minefield for visitors because most restaurants cater either to the fast-food office crowd or to tourists. Fortunately, you can avoid all of that by going to the following places: (1) Gitane: recently opened Mediterranean (Basque/Spanish/Moroccan) restaurant with very glam, artsy interiors and delicious small plates. The bar serves some of the best cocktails in San Francisco. (2) Canteen: the ultimate secret because it&apos;s so tiny and hidden. You have only one choice - the $35 three-course prix fixe menu \u2013 but you don&apos;t care because the food at Canteen blows away the more well-known fancy restaurants in the city. Call well in advance to reserve. (3) Plouf: if you are craving mussels served the way the French like them, with wonderful frites, nothing beats Plouf. Located on a tiny alley called Belden Place, which has many restaurants that offer outdoor seating, it&apos;s lively and fun. (4) Katana-ya: this minuscule Japanese noodle restaurant is my favourite lunch place in downtown San Francisco. They serve the best ramen noodles in the city. Only one block from Union Square, it&apos;s inexpensive and crammed with happy Japanese customers slurping their noodles. (5) Olea: if you are stuck in a Nob Hill hotel and don&apos;t relish having to walk up and down the steep hills to Union Square or the Financial District to find a place to eat, Olea is the only good restaurant in this neighbourhood (at the corner of California Street and Larkin). Serves brunch on weekends and dinner; fresh California-Mediterranean food. (6) Blue Bottle Caf\u00e9: in my opinion, the best coffee house in the city. Located on Mint Plaza in light, airy space that used to be a bank (only one block from Bloomingdales and the San Francisco Westfield Shopping Centre), Blue Bottle roast their own coffee beans and serve even better espresso than Ritual Roasters Cafe.  (7) Pagolac and Miss Saigon: there are so many Vietnamese restaurants in downtown San Francisco, but Pagolac (in the Tenderloin) and Miss Saigon (two blocks from Bloomingdales) are my favourites. Embarcadero/SOMA: In the past four years, the Embarcadero and South of Market (SOMA) neighborhoods have seen an increase the number of new restaurant openings. New apartment buildings and refurbished lofts have attracted a younger crowd who like to go out at night. (1) Ozumo: vibrant bar scene, a hip young Asian clientele and some of the best sushi in city, close to the Ferry Building, right on the Embarcadero. (2) South Food and Wine Bar: best selection of Australian and New Zealand wines in San Francisco, delicious small plates. Close to the Caltrain station. (3) South Park Caf\u00e9: not a caf\u00e9, but a French bistro that has seen South Park transform itself from a dodgy park for the homeless in the early 1990s to an oasis for small high-tech businesses and live-work lofts. It&apos;s still one of the best neighbourhood gems in the city. Serves French classics at reasonable prices, small but good wine list. Richmond District: San Francisco&apos;s large Asian community is no longer centered around Chinatown. Many have moved to the Richmond and Sunset Districts. As a result, you&apos;ll find better Chinese food (and dim sum) in these areas than in Chinatown. There are also excellent restaurants that serve Thai, Vietnamese, Burmese, Korean and Japanese food. (1) Burma Superstar and B Star Bar: located on the Clement Street, just one block from each other, they&apos;re mobbed by locals during the lunch hour. Arrive either before noon or after 1.30pm. They&apos;re &quot;sister&quot; restaurants although B Star Bar serves a more eclectic selection of Asian dishes and Burma Superstar is, as the name says, Burmese. (2) Okina Sushi: tiny sushi restaurant run by an eccentric Japanese sushi chef one block from Golden Gate Park and open only for dinner. Castro: still lively after all these years, the Castro is the home of San Francisco&apos;s gay community and the best menswear boutiques in the city (my favourite is Rolo). (1) L&apos;Ardoise: little French bistro tucked away on Noe Street between the busy Market Street and Duboce Park. They serve wonderful French classics. (2) Eiji: another tiny Japanese restaurant that is difficult to find but well worth the trouble. Open for lunch and dinner, they have very good sushi, excellent udon noodle soups and tofu dishes. (3) Kasa Indian Eatery: inexpensive, popular Indian restaurant \u2013 a good stopover for lunch if you are walking from the Castro to the Mission District (after that you can keep walking and end up at Bi-Rite Creamery for ice cream).

The Dutch safety authority said the problem with the device, which measures altitude, had caused the Turkish Airlines plane to lose speed before it crashed as it landed on automatic pilot. The Boeing 737-800, carrying 135 passengers and crew, went down in a muddy field less than a mile short of the runway at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport shortly before it was due to land on 25 February. The chief investigator, Pieter van Vollenhoven, said the plane had twice before experienced problems with its altimeter. Boeing had been instructed to warn clients of the problem, he said. At around 700 meters (1,950ft), the plane&apos;s left radio altimeter had suddenly registered a negative change in altitude of about 2 meters, he said. &quot;It didn&apos;t only register it, but passed it on to the automatic steering system.&quot; Van Vollenhoven said it was not unusual to land a plane on autopilot. According to conversation recorded between the plane&apos;s captain, first officer and an extra first officer on the flight, the pilots had noticed the faulty altimeter but did not consider it a problem and failed to react, Van Vollenhoven said. Fuel to the engines was reduced and the plane lost speed, decelerating until at a height of 150 meters it was about to stall, and warning systems alerted the pilots. &quot;From the &quot;black box&quot; [data recorders] it appears that then the pilots immediately gave gas, full gas. However, it was too late to recover,&quot; Van Vollenhoven said. He said the pilots had been unable to see the runway at the time the plane began its descent owing to cloud and light rain. The plane fell into a freshly plooughed field, striking the ground tail first and breaking into three pieces. Those killed in the crash included five Turks and four US nationals.

At 1,950ft (600 metres) the device registered the plane, which was on autopilot, as being at about ground level, so fuel to the engines was reduced and the plane lost speed.

The customer handed the wallet and the teeth to employees at the Falmouth store but left without giving his name.

It was the first time I was allowed to dress up. In Holland children don&apos;t wear smart clothes until they&apos;re about 18, but I hated childish dressing. I loved fancy dress, and I loved to draw dresses. I made fashion drawings before I knew it was fashion. The designs were all about small bodies and big skirts. When I was a teenager, I would wear jackets and ties when my friends were all in sweatshirts. When we went to art school, Viktor and I were already looking more classical than the others, more disciplined-looking. I think my jacket and tie affected how people treated me at school; they kept people at a distance. I never wanted to fit in fashionwise. At college we knew we didn&apos;t want to look like anyone else, but at the same time we weren&apos;t interested in making a statement with our clothes. I think it&apos;s always fun to be not like the others, but also it&apos;s important not to alienate yourself through your dress.  We&apos;re always doodling together, and somehow it becomes a collection. Fashion is not just about making dresses. Everything that we do is about transformation, about innovating by reinventing the world. We always try to recreate and reshuffle the elements and make them obey our rules. The only thing I hate about fashion is the time pressure. In an ideal world there would be more hours in a day. Our days are planned very tightly, but we always include time to just sit and discuss and draw, and then when we&apos;re relaxed the ideas come.  We have a beautiful office in Amsterdam and we have strict working hours. We go to Italy a lot, and to Paris to do our fragrances, and to the US for business, but it&apos;s always a relief to come home. We are intensely private at home, hardly visible. We don&apos;t always agree, but we hardly ever argue. If we don&apos;t agree on a design then we know we&apos;re not there yet. It&apos;s the poldermodel - a form of Dutch politics where everybody talks until everyone has been heard.  It&apos;s not really a life of champagne and beautiful people, but we do like to maintain that illusion through our designs. When Viktor was 14, he read an interview with Karl Lagerfeld, who became his hero. He went to Paris at such a young age, which we thought was so inspiring. We met him a couple of times, and he&apos;s a very funny man. But it&apos;s not always so nice to meet your heroes, because it&apos;s not necessary to have that fantasy smashed. It&apos;s better to keep the mystery. Fantasy is very important - our work is an escape from reality. We are interested in the surreal, the mystery. Our work is usually a reaction to the work we&apos;ve made before, maybe because we are almost bipolar - we go from black to white, from aggressive to very soft. We are afraid of being one-dimensional; we always push to be complex. And that&apos;s where we are at the moment, opening a new chapter. \u2022 Samsonite Black Label luggage by Viktor &amp; Rolf starts at \u00a3155, 020 7734 0878, samsoniteblacklabel.com.", "sentences": ["We have a beautiful office in Amsterdam and we have strict working hours."], "title": "How we get dressed: Design duo Viktor & Rolf on the importance of fantasy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/viktor-rolf-how-i-get-dressed", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-08T10:00:00Z", "article": "Bishop Richard Williamson has some very peculiar, and frankly odious, views: that no Jews were murdered in gas chambers during the second world war; that the twin towers were brought down by American explosives, not by airplanes, on September 11, 2001; and that Jews are fighting to dominate the world &quot;to prepare the anti-Christ&apos;s throne in Jerusalem&quot;. And these are just some of his opinions on secular matters. On questions of Roman Catholic doctrine, his views were considered so out of line with the modern church that the Vatican excommunicated him in 1988, along with other members of the ultra-conservative Society of St Pius X, founded by fascist sympathiser Marcel Lefebvre. Supporters of Williamson include the British historian David Irving, who was jailed in Austria for glorifying the Nazis. The bishop, then, does not strike one as an attractive man. But does he deserve everything now hanging over his head? As a consequence of the views he expressed on Swedish television, he was denied re-entry into the church, as was promised earlier by Pope Benedict, which is probably just as well. But he was also kicked out of Argentina, where he lived, and is threatened with extradition to Germany, where preparations are made to prosecute him for Holocaust denial. Meanwhile, consider the case of another unappealing man, the Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who was banned last month from entering the United Kingdom, where he had planned to show his short film, Fitna, which describes Islam as a terrorist faith. Back in Holland, a case is being made against him in an Amsterdam court for &quot;spreading hatred&quot; against Muslims. He has compared the Quran to Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf , and wishes to stop immigration of Muslims to the Netherlands. The British ban, as well as the impending court case, has actually made Wilders more popular in the Netherlands, where one poll indicated that his populist anti-Muslim party, the PVV, would get 27 seats in parliament if elections were held today. The reason for Wilders&apos; surging popularity, apart from widespread distrust of Muslims, is that he has successfully cultivated an image as a fighter for free speech. The principle of free speech, one of the fundamental rights in liberal democracies, means that we must live with views that we find reprehensible, up to a point. The question is, up to what point? Laws on free speech differ somewhat from country to country. It is a criminal offence in various European democracies, including France, Germany, and Austria, to express the view that the Holocaust never happened. Many democratic countries also have laws against inciting violence or hatred. Some countries, including the Netherlands, even have laws against deliberately insulting people on the grounds of their race or religion. Bishop Williamson&apos;s ideas may be loathsome, but criminal prosecution against a man for his views about history is probably a bad idea. He should be criticised, even ridiculed, but not jailed. Similarly, it would have been much better to let Wilders show his wretched film in Britain than to ban him. Whatever one thinks of laws against spreading hatred or insulting people, the law remains a blunt instrument when it came to matters of speech. Nevertheless, free speech is not absolute. Even Wilders, with his absurd call to ban the Quran, clearly believes that there are limits \u2013 for his opponents, of course, not for himself. But it is not so easy to define precisely what those limits should be, for they depend on who says what to whom, and even where. Williamson&apos;s opinions suddenly mattered because this obscure, excommunicated priest was about to be reinstated by the Pope. This would have given institutional legitimacy to his private views. In the case of Wilders, it makes a difference that he is a politician, not just a private individual, pandering to dangerous prejudices against a vulnerable minority. In civilised life, people refrain from saying many things, regardless of questions of legality. Words used by young black men among themselves in American cities would have a very different resonance if young white men used them. Mocking the ways and beliefs of minorities is not quite the same thing as taking on the cherished habits and views of majorities. If this smacks of political correctness, then so be it. But civilised life, especially in countries with great ethnic and religious diversity, would soon break down if everyone felt free to say anything they liked to anyone. The problem is where to draw the line. Legally, this should probably be the point where words are designed to result in violence. Socially, there are too many variables to establish an absolute, universal principle. The proper limits must be constantly tested, contested, and renegotiated. People like Bishop Williamson and Geert Wilders are useful to the extent that they allow us to do just that. Let them speak, so that they can be judged, not in court, but by contrary opinions. Banning them only allows them to pose as martyrs to free speech. And that not only makes it harder to attack their views, but also gives free speech a bad name.

The UK, where the bank employs about 136 staff, accounted for about 16% of the company&apos;s loan book, behind the Nordic countries, which represented a combined 38%, according to the company. Iceland&apos;s financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority, suspended the bank&apos;s board, while chief executive, William Fall, who joined Straumur in 2007 from Bank of America, resigned. Reykjav\u00edk-based Straumur specialises in investment banking services to small and medium-sized companies, expanding into riskier areas such as leveraged lending or proprietary trading. Like its Icelandic rivals, Straumur opened offices in some of the European countries that have been hardest hit by the global credit crunch, including the UK, Denmark and the Czech Republic. Almost three-quarters of the bank&apos;s client income was generated outside Iceland, according to Straumur&apos;s website. In Britain, Straumur bought Teather &amp; Greenwood, a mid-cap stockbroker and financial adviser in October 2008, recruiting 60 corporate finance and research staff. Straumur also bought 50% of Stamford Partners, an investment banking firm based in London and Amsterdam, in 2006. The bank&apos;s operations grew rapidly over the past three years. It employed 109 people in 2006 and about 600 three years later, its website shows. The bank&apos;s loan portfolio surged by 161% in 2006 and almost doubled in 2007. Straumur&apos;s major shareholders, as of February 3, included Samson Global Holdings, an investment vehicle controlled by Icelandic multimillionaire Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, also a former main shareholder at Landsbanki. Samson had a 34% stake in Straumur, according to a recent press release. Struggling companies that have borrowed from Icelandic banks are under threat as the country&apos;s government has started to call in loans. Baugur, the investment company that held stakes in well-known retail chains such as House of Fraser and food chain Iceland, was put into administration after its government-controlled lender, Landsbanki, began a process to recover assets. Mosaic, another Baugur-controlled holding company that owns the Oasis and Karen Millen brands, also fell into administration following a call from Kaupthing.

Blackstone wrote down the net asset value of its investments by 31% in 2008. One Amsterdam-listed fund of KKR \u2013 KPE \u2013 was worse, writing down 47.5%. In the UK, Candover was down 50% and SVG Capital 66%. And with more writedowns expected given the state of the equity markets, some funds, such as Candover&apos;s 2008 fund, are considering winding down altogether. Not that many will sympathise with any losses these private equity players have to suffer. For years, they have taken over companies with huge debts, cut jobs ruthlessly and then sold them on at massive profits so to as to pay themselves remunerations that made bankers&apos; bonuses look rather ordinary. Now, it is their turn to suffer.  However, to leave them to their own fate, as tempting as it may be, would be a mistake. The government needs to take a careful look at the companies they own, not only because of the millions they employ but because the way they have been saddled up with debt could make them the next, and potentially most devastating, development in this financial crisis.  To take a step back, the private equity business model has been a larger, corporate version of the buy-to-let property investment model popularised over the last few years. They would simply buy a company worth say \u00a31m, of which as small a portion as possible, say \u00a3100,000, would be put down as equity. The remaining \u00a3900,000 would then be financed through a loan. The key was that, like a buy-to-let against the property, the loan was secured against the company so that effectively, the company itself was largely funding the purchase for the private equity buyer.  They would then make the company more profitable by slashing costs and jobs and squeezing suppliers. In turn, the value of the company would rise to say \u00a31.1m, where they could then sell the company, pay back the \u00a3900,000 loan and walk home with \u00a3200,000, a 100% return on their \u00a3100,000 investment.  On the plus side, private equity firms often revitalised firms with fresh management and aggressive targets. But this was at the cost of saddling the company up with debt \u2013 and a lot of it. When times were good, this wasn&apos;t seen as much of a cost because as and when this debt was due to be paid back, the assumption was that it could be renewed or more debt raised to pay it back. To support that belief was the multi-billion dollar Collateralised Loan Obligation (CLO) market, effectively Mortgage-Backed Securities but backed by the kind of loans banks wrote to private equity firms. Banks believed that this CLO market, much like the rest of the securitisation market, would always remain, encouraging them to write more loans knowing it could be sold on. However, the CLO market is dead today and banks don&apos;t have a particularly large appetite for risk. Which begs the question, where is the refinancing for the debt carried by private equity-owned companies going to come from? And even if it did come from somewhere, the terms are likely to be significantly worse, putting pressure on its profitability. Of course, private equity firms will always argue that the fundamentals of the companies they own should see them through, but if a company cannot get access to the right credit that it needs to stay operational, fundamentals count for nothing.  Ironically, it was one Sir Fred Goodwin who first suggested in June 2007 that this loan market was &quot;toppish&quot; and banks should only write loans when they were prepared to hold it on its own balance sheet. If loans had always been made so that a significant portion remained on bank balance sheets instead of being offloaded to CLOs, underwriting standards would have remained stringent and the private equity boom would have been moderate. These are lessons we should heed for the future.  In the meantime, the government needs to consider how to help these companies because while private equity firms should take a loss, the companies they collectively own employ millions (3 million in 2007) whose jobs may be at stake. And protecting these jobs is important if this recession is not to be exacerbated.  The government could ensure the provision of credit, but that would let the private equity firms get away without taking a hit. More appropriate would be to force the private equity firms to take a significant dilution of their holdings through debt-for-equity swaps or government stakes, neither of which would be popular but would certainly be fairer. Either way, getting involved sooner rather than later, and preferably in sync with the US, is going to be important if we&apos;re to prevent this situation from turning into yet another damaging episode of this financial crisis.", "sentences": ["One Amsterdam-listed fund of KKR \u2013 KPE \u2013 was worse, writing down 47.5%."], "title": "Tetsuya Ishikawa: Private equity firms must be helped to prevent future financial crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/09/private-equity-government-intervention-financial-crisis", "tags": ["Private equity", "Borrowing & debt", "Banking", "Recession", "US economy", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-10T00:01:00Z", "article": "TNT, the Dutch postal group that is frontrunner to take a stake in Royal Mail as part of the government&apos;s controversial part-privatisation plan, is threatening to sack 10,000 workers in the Netherlands if they do not accept a 5% pay cut.  The pay revelations follow a leaked email published by the Guardian yesterday which showed that Adam Crozier, Royal Mail&apos;s boss, is at loggerheads with TNT, accusing the Dutch group of poaching his customers. As part of the pay offer, TNT is promising not to make any compulsory redundancies for three years but only if workers accept the reduction in wages, which was outlined by the management yesterday afternoon. A spokeswoman for the CWU union, which represents Royal Mail&apos;s 160,000 workers, described the deal as &quot;bullying tactics from an aggressive employer&quot;.  &quot;It&apos;s time the UK government threw out TNT as their company of choice and scrap their unpopular attempt to privatise Royal Mail,&quot; she said. &quot;TNT are showing their true colours and are clearly driving down the terms and conditions of low-paid postal workers. We do not want the British postal industry to go the same way.&quot; Bernard de Vries, chairman of the TNT Works Council, which liaises between unions and the TNT management, said the pay cut was necessary to safeguard jobs as profits fell, but admitted that workers were angry. &quot;It&apos;s kind of blackmail,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;I can understand that.&quot; A spokeswoman for TNT declined to say whether the group would use similar tactics to cut British postal workers&apos; pay if it bought a 30% stake in Royal Mail. The three-year pay offer involves most workers taking a 5% pay cut in the first year, followed by a 1% rise for each of the next two years.  Today, the controversial bill to part-privatise Royal Mail will have its second reading. If a minority stake is sold, the government has promised to shoulder the group&apos;s \u00a39bn pension deficit. The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, argues that part-privatisation is the only way to modernise Royal Mail and secure its long-term future. A private partner is expected to wield strong influence on the group, providing management and technical expertise. The CWU and some 139 MPs are vehemently opposing the plans and hope to block the bill. The dispute will rumble on for many months: Royal Mail does not expect a parliamentary vote on the bill before summer. But the fierce rivalry between the two groups, revealed in Crozier&apos;s leaked email, has led to a breakdown of trust, making it harder for them to work together. Crozier accused the chief executive of the Dutch group, Peter Bakker, of trying to poach European customers from Royal Mail&apos;s profitable parcel delivery subsidiary, GLS.  Crozier claimed Bakker had informed some of GLS&apos;s biggest customers that TNT was about to buy the business, even though it is not part of the Royal Mail sell-off. &quot;GLS are reporting to me that some of their bigger customers are being approached by TNT and are being told that TNT will secure a full takeover of GLS,&quot; wrote Crozier to Stephen Lovegrove, at the Shareholder Executive, which oversees state-owned assets. TNT said that it &quot;did not recognise the allegations&quot;. GLS has a relatively low profile compared to Royal Mail&apos;s letters business and the post office branch network. But it is the one jewel in Royal Mail&apos;s crown as it faces an otherwise bleak future. Deliveries of letters are falling fast as people use email and other more modern forms of communication. But as the number of purchases through the internet increases, package deliveries are on the rise. By 2013, Royal Mail expects that half of group revenues and three quarters of its profits will come from its parcels division.  Jonathan DeCarteret, from consultancy Post Switch, said TNT and Royal Mail, which are being forced to open up their domestic market to competitors, had similar commercial strategies. &quot;Although this latest spat between Crozier and Bakker is a storm in a teacup, it underlines the fact that TNT remains one of Royal Mail&apos;s fiercest rivals and it may be a case that if you can&apos;t beat them, then join them.&quot; The government says that it has received a number of expressions of interest in Royal Mail from private postal operators, not just from TNT. A spokesman insisted that TNT was not the preferred bidder and would not receive special treatment. Nevertheless, when Mandelson and post office minister Pat McFadden revealed the results of the Hooper review which recommended the part-privatisation of Royal Mail in December, they said they both &quot;very much welcomed&quot; the expressions of interest from TNT. Analysts say that TNT would be a good fit with Royal Mail. But the company also has close commercial ties to the government. TNT is HM Revenue &amp; Customs&apos; primary supplier for specialist logistic services and for internal courier services, which earned the Dutch company about \u00a320m between 2005 and 2007, according to published figures. Geraldine Smith, the labour MP for Morecambe &amp; Lunesdale who is the rebel backbencher leading the parliamentary revolt against privatisation, will have a private meeting with Mandelson.  She is concerned that, with the government agreeing to take on Royal Mail&apos;s massive pension deficit, TNT - and not the taxpayer - will benefit most from its future profits. She is also concerned about Mandelson&apos;s reluctance to quantify how much a sale of a 30% stake might raise. Crozier has said it could raise hundreds of millions of pounds. Pass the parcels The Dutch group TNT, which is quoted on the Amsterdam stock exchange, faces many of the same problems as its British rival. Last month, TNT announced its profits for the year had slumped by almost a fifth. From next month, most of the Dutch postal market will be fully liberalised and TNT faces competition for the first time. The company says these twin threats amount to a &quot;perfect storm&quot; requiring drastic action. Much of these arguments will sound familiar to followers of Royal Mail. Management complains that competitors - such as TNT - can get away with paying staff much less than the state-owned operator. Royal Mail&apos;s profits are also set to nosedive. Unlike TNT, Royal Mail has had to service a pension deficit costing \u00a3280m a year.", "sentences": ["Pass the parcels The Dutch group TNT, which is quoted on the Amsterdam stock exchange, faces many of the same problems as its British rival."], "title": "Dutch frontrunner for Royal Mail accused of bullying workforce", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/10/royal-mail-privatisation-tnt", "tags": ["Postal service", "Business", "Economic policy", "Trade unions", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "Netherlands", "Royal Mail", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-11T00:01:00Z", "article": "One is a young, dynamic artist who has been like a jolt of electricity in the world of classical music. The other tore up the rule book long ago and continues to astonish theatre audiences after more than 60 years. Today the Barbican, Europe&apos;s largest performing arts centre, will reveal a new programme of work that includes a stellar list of names, from Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel to veteran director Peter Brook. As well as announcing a diverse programme in which the Barbican extends its reach eastwards, it will unveil a dramatic change in its relationships with some of the world&apos;s leading orchestras by creating five new residencies. Instead of being a venue for one-off flying visits by orchestras, the Barbican said it wants to change the dynamic and develop more lasting relationships with organisations that it today names as international associates. One of the most eye-catching is the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led as it will be by arguably the most exciting and dynamic conductor working today, the 28-year-old Dudamel. The others are the New York Philharmonic, Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the New York-based Jazz at Lincoln Centre, which will be the first resident next year. One reason they are a coup is that the orchestras will be exclusive to the Barbican and not then play at its London rival, the South Bank.  The Barbican will also announce new work from the always innovative and surprising choreographer Michael Clark and a dramatic extension into east London with a summer of music and dance music called Barbican Big Summer.  Sir Nicholas Kenyon, who took over the Barbican from Sir John Tusa in October, said they had had very successful one-off performances from orchestras over the years but now was the time to take relationships to the next level, allowing more concerts as well as smaller scale performances, master classes and work with schools.  &quot;We had a really successful concert the other night with the Minnesota Orchestra. They flew in, did a concert with Joshua Bell and they went again,&quot; said Kenyon. &quot;That&apos;s fine but it&apos;s unsustainable as a model going forward and we want to build the relationship between orchestras and audiences. &quot;We want to focus on these five relationships because they will develop into residencies where there is an interaction between the orchestras and our education and outreach and audience involvement programmes. Of course this is not all going to happen in a day, it will be rolled out over a series of seasons.&quot; Kenyon and the Barbican&apos;s artistic director Graham Sheffield believe the old system of orchestras whizzing around a tour circuit is increasingly not viable economically and, also, the orchestras coming to the Barbican want to put down roots in a way they have not done before.  Sheffield described the centre&apos;s forthcoming arts programme as &quot;a tapestry of inter-connecting themes and ideas but topped with the most stunning list of artists and orchestras and companies&quot;. Brook will return to the Barbican with the first English-language performance in the UK of his play Eleven and Twelve, based on the life of the Sufi sage Tierno Bokar. The dancer Michael Clark is another Barbican favourite and he will present a new work based on the music of Lou Reed, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. The London Symphony Orchestra continues as resident orchestra with conductors Valery Gergiev and Sir Colin Davis. Kenyon and Sheffield said the dynamics of London were changing and east London was now the place to be, which was why they were &quot;breaking down the walls&quot; of the Barbican and moving eastwards. &quot;We are the arts centre of the City but we want to face out to east London and go out to east London and become partners with different organisations and groups.&quot; The Arts Council-funded Barbican Big Summer is the launch of this eastward move and will take place in June and July. It will include dance bands such as Cafe de los Maestros and Estrelle Morente, along with a celebration of Cuban culture with musicians including Orquesta Aragon and Los Van Van. Venues will include the Hackney Empire, Victoria Park and Gillett Square. Elsewhere, Sheffield said the Barbican&apos;s art gallery will continue its efforts to carve out niches in architecture, fashion, contemporary art and photography in an attempt to differentiate itself in a crowded London gallery world.  In 2010, it is planning a first gallery exploration of the relationship between architecture and surrealism, an exhibition examining the development of colour photography and another devoted to Japanese fashion. By any standards the Barbican is in good shape, a sea change away from the &quot;basket case&quot; status it had in the early 1990s. It is now even possible to find your way easily around the building. More than half the Barbican&apos;s funding comes from the City of London Corporation. While Kenyon did not expect an increase, there were no indications of cuts. &quot;Given the circumstances that is a wonderful thing to be able to build on,&quot; he said.  Both he and Sheffield said the recession would not mean playing safe or staging only popular shows. &quot;In difficult times, people will gravitate towards quality.&quot;", "sentences": ["The others are the New York Philharmonic, Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the New York-based Jazz at Lincoln Centre, which will be the first resident next year."], "title": "Barbican transformed by dancing to Bowie and Venezuela's maestro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/11/barbican-residency-orchestras", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "UK news", "London", "Dance", "Gustavo Dudamel", "Conducting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-12T17:52:19Z", "article": "It&apos;s a simple idea, but a genuinely good one: the Barbican Centre&apos;s announcement yesterday of long-term relationships over the next few seasons with the New York Philharmonic, Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and, most tantalisingly, the Los Angeles Philharmonic with Gustavo &quot;the Dude&quot; Dudamel. It&apos;s a scheme that could usher in an era of more meaningful experiences for British audiences, rather than the one-night stands we&apos;re used to from international orchestras. As well as full-blown orchestral concerts, there will be chamber music events and outreach work in the East End of London - a chance to experience the denizens of the globe-trotting orchestral elite in new contexts. It must be good for the players, too, that when they come to London in the future, they won&apos;t be on the sort of eye-watering schedule that leaves them scarcely time for a rehearsal, let alone sightseeing, before they jet off to some other European capital. The Concertgebouw are in town this weekend for two concerts at the Barbican with Bernard Haitink: they&apos;ll fly in on Saturday morning, rehearse in the afternoon, play a concert of Mozart, Debussy, and Beethoven in the evening, polish up their Schumann and Bruckner the next morning for Sunday afternoon&apos;s concert, and then get straight on a plane back home. Not exactly conducive to an atmosphere of relaxed music-making, but we&apos;ll see at the weekend. There&apos;s another side to the Barbican&apos;s proposals: the Southbank won&apos;t be able to get near these orchestras in the same season (even if this London exclusivity doesn&apos;t extend to the Proms, who should still be able to nab them). That&apos;s got to be galling for the powers that be at the Royal Festival Hall: it means no Riccardo Chailly, who conducts the Gewandhaus, no Alan Gilbert, the new man at the helm of the New York Phil, and - unless he&apos;s appearing with his other band, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra - no Mariss Jansons either. At least they&apos;ll still have Dudamel, thanks to his relationship with the Philharmonia. Oh, and the Southbank can claim to have pre-empted the idea of longer-term residencies rather than single-night stopovers with this April&apos;s series from Dudamel and the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Youth Orchestra. Thinking back to last year&apos;s Proms, which showcased pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the idea of featured artists seems to be gathering momentum in British orchestral life.

Job Cohen, Amsterdam&apos;s mayor, said police received an anonymous phone call from Brussels on Wednesday night warning that an Ikea shop and other major retail outlets were being targeted by bombers. The caller named a suspect and identified locations to search. Police sealed off a shopping street in the city close to the stadium used by Ajax football club yesterday morning, forcing the cancellation of a concert by the US rock band the Killers scheduled last night at a nearby venue. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a regular bomb warning, but a warning of a planned action aimed at creating casualties in shops,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;Men were planning to put explosives in the shops and wanted to cause casualties in busy places.&quot; Those arrested were a woman and six men, aged between 19 and 64, none of whom were named. All are dual Dutch and Moroccan citizens and were held for allegedly plotting terrorist attacks. &quot;As far as we can tell, none involved has a history of terrorist involvement,&quot; the district attorney, Herman Bolhaar, told reporters. But one was a relative of someone connected to the Madrid atrocity who died when four suspects blew themselves up as police raided an apartment in a suburb of the Spanish capital three weeks after the attack. Police elsewhere in the Netherlands and Belgium also raided a series of homes. It was not known if any explosives were found. The office of the anti-terrorism co-ordinator for the Netherlands said the national terrorist threat level would not be increased as a result of the suspected plot. Bernard Welten, Amsterdam&apos;s chief of police, said he believed the arrests had &quot;reduced the immediate threat&quot; of an attack in Amsterdam. The shopping street was likely to remain sealed off today. On Wednesday, Madrid marked the fifth anniversary of the attacks, in which 10 bombs were detonated on packed commuter trains, injuring around 1,800 people. Spanish investigators said those behind the bombing were allied to al-Qaida but had no direct links to the group. The suspected ringleader of the plot, named by Spanish police as Serhane ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, was among the four suspects who died in a blast as police closed in. One policeman was also killed. The Netherlands has never suffered a major terrorism attack by a group associated with al-Qaida. But the country, in which just under 6% of the population are Muslim, has seen tensions connected to religion, most notably the murder in 2004 of Theo van Gogh, a film director who had made an anti-Islam film.

Since 2000, Fabchannel has filmed gigs at Amsterdam&apos;s Paradiso venue, webcasting them live before adding them to a vast, free video archive. Tragically, those 900-plus shows will disappear this evening, when the site closes. Fabchannel&apos;s CEO, Justin Kniest, explained in a blog that record labels of all sizes now view online content as something to charge websites like his for, rather than provide for free to help promote albums that fans increasingly don&apos;t buy anyway. Throw in the facts that global advertising revenues are tumbling and most web users remain unwilling to pay for subscription services, and it&apos;s clear why Fabchannel can&apos;t afford to continue. It will be sorely missed. But, with many other music sites funded by that rapidly shrinking advertising market, it may not be the last to disappear. One leading ad-funded internet radio site, Jango.com, has come up with a new service to help it ride out the economic downturn. The idea behind Artist Airplay is that unsigned and independent acts pay to have their songs played to Jango&apos;s 6 million monthly visitors who type in their favourite band and then listen to a stream of songs by similar artists. For $30, your song will be played 1,000 times to users who&apos;ve asked to listen to music by a particular artist; so whether you think you&apos;re the new Coldplay or Eminem, you can appeal directly to their fans. It&apos;s obvious why new acts would want that, and why Jango would be grateful for their cash. But you do have to wonder what&apos;s in it for the site&apos;s users: do listeners really want to hear music whose only definite merit is that it&apos;s earning Jango some money by being played to you? It seems unlikely. Of course, while existing music sites struggle to fund their activities, let alone profit from them, new ones are still constantly springing up. Most of the current wave are based around Twitter (a site that is itself trying to puzzle out how to profit financially from its stratospheric success). For instance, Tinysong.com lets you type in any track, then gives you a short url to a full stream of it, for you to share on your Twitter feed. Meanwhile, Twiturm.com allows unsigned musicians to upload their own songs and share them via Twitter. And Twisten.fm trawls Twitter for tweets about music then posts them on its page alongside a play button, so that you can keep abreast of what the entire world is listening to.

On the 25th anniversary of the coal strike, it is the fault of Thatcher and her battle with the miners. It is the fault of Thatcher, the deregulation fanatic. It is the fault of Thatcher and the idolatry of greed. Commentators of the left have pitted her against the noble miners&apos; leader, Arthur Scargill, in coalition with Karl Marx, socialism and king coal. Can we not see they were right all along? The politics of blame has found its narrative. This one is drivel. British history is getting like Soviet history under the commissars, a prisoner of the world view of its partisans. To see Scargill&apos;s miners, of all lost causes, being trundled from their stables to do duty as prophets of the credit crunch is ludicrous.  The 1984 miners&apos; strike was undoubtedly a climax in an economic revolution in Britain that began with Callaghan&apos;s 1976 admonition to the Labour party: &quot;You used to think you could spend your way out of recession ... this option no longer exists.&quot; The catchphrase was adapted by Thatcher as &quot;There is no alternative.&quot; It is forgotten today.  Following the deflation of the 1980 and 1981 budgets, Thatcher&apos;s battle with the miners did what was intended. It broke the economic power of the big unions at a time when they were weakened by recession. This made privatisation possible, aided by the financial institutions created by deregulation in 1986.  Nobody can seriously hold that Britain would today be better off with the industrial structure and restrictive labour practices of the 1970s still in place. Young people today can have no conception of the collective misery that was the British political economy at the time, of a nation dubbed the sick man of Europe, its commerce enfeebled by subsidies and class-bound management, its government in perpetual funk. My own industry may have its troubles but, until the Wapping revolution of 1985, it faced a wipeout similar to that which near obliterated the American and European press. As a result of Wapping, the British national press emerged from the Thatcher years with more daily titles than at the start. The Independent owes its existence to her, as its founder, Andreas Whittam Smith, has always accepted.  Where Thatcher - or rather her chancellor, Nigel Lawson - went wrong was in the reformed structure of City finance brought on by the Big Bang of 1986. I remember a director of the Halifax building society saying at the time, &quot;God help us if the bankers get their hands on our mortgages, or if our brokers get their hands on their deposits.&quot;  He was right, but that was not for more than two decades. By then the market in mortgage-backed products was a global business. The 1986 reforms were robust enough to survive the recession of the early 1990s and stockmarket collapses before and since. They brought London a commercial pre-eminence that was inconceivable in the 1970s, when Frankfurt, Brussels, Paris and even Amsterdam were bidding to be the financial capital of Europe. Besides, 1986 was necessitated by changes taking place in competition law and in the US and Japanese money markets. London had to change or die. The credit crunch is proving rich in historical irony. No one was more traumatised by the miners&apos; strike than two young Labour politicians, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. A year earlier, Blair had been elected for Sedgefield on a leftwing, anti-Europe, pro-union, pro-CND platform, to begin one of the most spectacular U-turns in political history.  By 1989 Blair was shadow employment secretary, and was demanding that his party quietly accept Thatcher&apos;s labour and privatisation laws. He and Brown visited Australia to study Labour leader Bob Hawke&apos;s ideal of Thatcherism with a human face. He declared, &quot;We play the Tory game when we speak up for the underclass rather than for the broad majority.&quot; Meanwhile Brown demanded that the party &quot;make an almost religious atonement for the sins of Labour&apos;s past&quot;, in the words of his biographer, Robert Peston. Brown was so frantic to mimic Thatcherism as shadow chancellor that Peter Hain wrote in 1993: &quot;There is little to distinguish Labour&apos;s macroeconomic policy from that of the Tories.&quot; John Prescott, Jack Straw and David Blunkett dismissed Brown in Tribune as a crypto-monetarist. He was against tax rises, for privatisation and an ardent defender of Kenneth Clarke&apos;s Treasury policies.  This is only relevant since whatever blame attaches to Thatcher for the financial chaos of the last six months attaches even more to Blair and Brown. In truth, Thatcherism was a consensus, built on the experience of the 1970s as the consensus of 1940s welfarism was built on that of war. The difference is that Brown, in his semi-independence for the Bank of England, was super-Thatcherite. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 established the tripartite regulation that has so conspicuously failed. It went far beyond what Thatcher would have tolerated. Her contribution to the political economy remains hopelessly misunderstood; her impact on labour and financial markets was emphatic, beyond anything attempted elsewhere in Europe. To accuse her of &quot;licensing greed&quot; is mere name-calling. She was an exceptionally cautious deregulator. She opposed Lord Howe&apos;s decision in 1979 to cut income tax from 83% to 60%. She was soft on welfare fraud, indulgent of housing benefit, lavish on health spending and custodian of a public sector that rose in her first parliament from 41% to 44% of gross domestic product.  Meanwhile history is silent on the downside of the Thatcher era. The command structure she created to crush her foes became unrestrained, over-centralised and inefficient. Her evisceration of local democracy bred a cynicism among Britons towards political participation that remains unique in Europe. It also led to her downfall through the poll tax.  Thatcher was one of the great &quot;nationalisers&quot; of all time, taking control of the public housing stock, the rating system, a previously devolved hospital service, the universities, the courts, crown prosecution and, during the miners&apos; strike, the police. It was Thatcher who turned Whitehall from an elite administrative corps into a demoralised, politicised officialdom which, under Blair and Brown, became besotted with targets, initiatives and useless IT systems. Thatcher removed former nationalised industries from the state. But ask any doctor, farmer, lecturer, engineer or victim of the health and safety executive if, as a result of Thatcher, they feel less or more liberated from state interference. You will get a sick laugh.  The portrayal of Thatcher as libertarian St Joan in the fight against big government is nonsense. When I once suggested to her that a policy she was proposing was hardly laissez-faire, she exploded: &quot;Never accuse me of that ghastly French word. I believe government should be strong in what it does.&quot;  All politicians are creatures of paradox. The electorate expects it of them as part of the democratic compromise. The paradox of Thatcher is that she is blamed for her strengths and excused her weaknesses. She was not the person of current mythology.  \u2022 Simon Jenkins is the author of Thatcher and Sons simon.jenkins@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["They brought London a commercial pre-eminence that was inconceivable in the 1970s, when Frankfurt, Brussels, Paris and even Amsterdam were bidding to be the financial capital of Europe."], "title": "Simon Jenkins: This Thatcher mythology condemns her strengths and excuses her failings", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/13/margaret-thatcher-recession-mythology", "tags": ["Margaret Thatcher", "The miners' strike 1984-85", "Politics past", "Conservatives", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-13T12:20:59Z", "article": "An alleged Italian gangster accused of leading one of the bloodiest massacres in the annals of organised crime has been seized by police in Amsterdam. Giovanni Strangio is wanted by investigators in Italy over a multiple killing at Duisburg in Germany two years ago that earned comparisons with the infamous St Valentine&apos;s Day Massacre in \u00adprohibition-era Chicago. Six people, including a 17-year-old boy, were shot dead outside a restaurant where they were suspected of celebrating an initiation into the &apos;Ndrangheta, the mafia of the poor, southern Italian region of Calabria. Police in Italy said 29-year-old Strangio was found living in the centre of Amsterdam with his wife and son. His brother-in-law, Francesco Romeo, was also arrested. Though Strangio was placed on Italy&apos;s most-wanted list over the murders in Germany, the story behind the killings led back to the small but notorious hillside town of San Luca, in Calabria, often described as the spiritual home of the &apos;Ndrangheta. Its clans have for years been bloodily divided by a feud in which Strangio&apos;s family was a prime actor. Investigators believe he assembled the four-man hit squad that struck in Duisburg to avenge the Christmas Day killing in 2006 of his cousin Maria Strangio. She is thought to have been killed unintentionally in an ambush primarily directed at her husband, the leader of one of the two factions in the gang war that has rent San Luca and upset the internal workings of the &apos;Ndrangheta. The Calabrian mafia, which many police and prosecutors believe has overtaken the Cosa Nostra to become Italy&apos;s top crime syndicate, controls much of the cocaine trafficking into Europe from Latin America. Police said wiretaps on telephones used by Strangio&apos;s relatives had provided vital clues to his whereabouts. He was an early suspect having been arrested and later released after being found in possession of a weapon at his cousin&apos;s funeral.

The iconic cola brand enjoyed a 3.6% boost in retail sales in 2008 and its best January sales this year, despite the increasingly gloomy economic news. Annual retail sales for Coca-Cola in the UK reached \u00a3514.5m by the end of 2008 - nearly a third of the overall cola sector, according to AC Nielsen data. The new ad, shown on MediaGuardian.co.uk, created by Wieden + Kennedy Amsterdam, is the latest instalment in the Happiness Factory series, which started in 2006. The ads show animated characters who make Coca-Cola in a magical land inside the vending machine and in the latest version, both the human purchaser and the Happiness Factory workers are tired and in need of the uplifting effect of a Coke. The campaign is global but will launch in the UK on Tuesday. The multimillion-pound UK campaign, bought and planned by Vizeum, includes TV, radio, online, outdoor, mobile and a cross-promotion with Xbox. The Xbox partnership includes a giveaway of 3m Xbox loyalty scheme points, online gaming gurus giving tips and advice and a Coca-Cola skin to let gamers customise their Xbox dashboard. Online elements include a &quot;Happiness Hub&quot; microsite on Bebo and an MSN games application and music track. Consumers can also download Happiness Factory ringtones for free from the Coke&apos;s Piccadilly Circus billboard using bluetooth. Cathryn Sleight, the marketing director at Coca-Cola Great Britain, said the different platforms helped the brand reach different consumers in innovative ways. &quot;For example using key teen passion points of music, social networking and gaming allow us to reach a new generation of Coke fans, whilst more traditional routes continue to reach the older demographic,&quot; she said. Including Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero, 2008 revenue reached \u00a3970.41m. Sleight would not comment on Coca-Cola&apos;s planned marketing spend for 2009 but said: &quot;We recognise that this year will be tougher than last, but our focus is on investing to grow and continuing to build our brands as we have done for many years.&quot; \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Armed with nothing more than a laptop, a camera and three changes of clean underwear, I left my home in Newcastle in an attempt to travel to New Zealand, unable to spend a penny on transport and accommodation, and instead relying entirely of the charity and goodwill of people who use Twitter. I&apos;m also trying to raise a tidy sum for Charity: water. All of which goes to explain why, 13 days later, I&apos;m in a 15 year-old boy&apos;s bed in Wichita. He&apos;s not here at the moment, obviously - he lives with his mother most of the week. I&apos;m stopping with his step-mother. That doesn&apos;t sound right either. How did I come to be the guest of a complete stranger in deepest Kansas? Because a Twitter user offered me a ferry ticket from Newcastle to Amsterdam, after which another person paid for a train ticket from Amsterdam to Paris. Another offered a train ticket to Saarbruck in Germany, then there was the flight from Frankfurt to New York via Amsterdam (again), a bus to Washington DC, a road trip to Wheeling in West Virginia, a flight to Chicago, a bus to Kansas City and finally a Greyhound to Wichita. I set out to prove that the connections we nurture online are capable of being equally as strong, if not stronger than those we foster in the flesh; that the world may be full of bastards and murderers and thieves and the devil, but is more likely to show charity and kindness.  And it&apos;s done that so far, just so long as you don&apos;t count Pittsburgh. Given the choice between helping me find accommodation for a night, and sticking fingers in both ears and humming loudly, the Steel City chose the latter option. Otherwise, thanks to some truly selfless individuals, I&apos;ve never had to spend a night sleeping rough. Kathy and Alston are the couple I stayed with in Wheeling - when Pittsburgh failed to hear my plea, they stepped forward and offered me their sofa. One of the benefits of squeezing so much travel into such a short period of time, is that I&apos;ve picked up plenty of useful travel hacks along the way. Such as: in the US, the bus can be a credible and low-cost alternative to air travel. On the east coast, the Bolt Bus serves Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, with direct routes that offer extra legroom, reliable wifi the whole route long, plus power sockets. It&apos;s like magic. Megabus also offers wifi on many of its services, too.  And: A diet of buffalo chilli and Cuban quesadillas with extra jalapenos is rarely a good bedfellow for an eight-hour road trip the following day. Later today I&apos;m joining a couple from Wichita on the eight hour road trip to SXSW in Austin, Texas. I&apos;ve no place to stay yet, or any idea how to move on.

The accolade, which brings W&amp;K&apos;s number of partners to just seven since it was founded in 1982, will give the London-based duo a stake in W&amp;K and a share of its profits. The appointment also marks the first time that founder and chief executive Dan Wieden has made partners of anyone from outside the global headquarters of W&amp;K in Portland in America. &quot;If you want to be a partner at W&amp;K you&apos;ve got to be some kind of saint and some kind of crazy,&quot; said Wieden. &quot;No one exemplifies that more profoundly than Tony and Kim. They have raised the bar, broken rules, lifted hearts and shocked the world.&quot; Papworth and Davidson have been the creative driving force behind establishing W&amp;K&apos;s London office as a major player in the UK market. The pair, who have worked together since 1985 after meeting at BMP, joined W&amp;K in 2000 as co-executive creative directors at a time when the fledgling London office was attempting to create a name, and client list, outside of the firmly established European office in Amsterdam. Honda is arguably the client that has become most readily identified with the London office&apos;s brand of creative risk-taking. Groundbreaking work has included TV ads such as Cog, a two-minute advert in which 85 dissassembled car parts form a chain reaction; Grrr, an animated advert about diesel car engines that won a grand prix at the Cannes Advertising Festival; Impossible Dream; and Choir. Other famous work includes the St Wayne poster, featuring Wayne Rooney body painted like the English flag, for Nike that ran during England&apos;s 2006 World Cup campaign. Prior to joining W&amp;K, the duo worked at Leagas Delaney from 1994 to 1997, for clients including the Guardian and the BBC. From 1997 to 2000 they worked at BBH developing, among other campaigns, the idea to use Flat Eric for Levi&apos;s. Wieden said that the appointment of Papworth and Davidson would not materially alter the running of the London office, although the pair would attend several global partner meetings a year and lend creative expertise to other offices. Davidson said the decision to make the step to partner-level status effectively tied their long-term future to the W&amp;K operation and that, in the autonomous way W&amp;K operates, the London office felt a lot like their own agency. &quot;I&apos;m never saying never, but yes,&quot; he said, with regard to whether the move now bound the pair to W&amp;K for the long term. &quot;We have had lots of offers from lots of places but you have to ask yourself where you are going if you do that. It&apos;s not about the money, it never has been. It is about management. Dan leaves you alone. It is almost like we have brought up our own agency [while] listening to Dan about what he&apos;d learned and combining it with what we had learned.&quot; Dave Luhr, worldwide chief operating officer at W&amp;K, said the first appointment of non-US partners was indicative of the globalisation of the network. &quot;We did this because of the tremendous job they have done in London,&quot; he said. &quot;Becasue we are increasingly becoming a global operation and it is a good time for new partners to tap into creative ideas.&quot; The last time W&amp;K made an employee a partner was in 1996. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Craig Gordon and Alan Hutton, each transferred to the English Premier League for \u00a39m, are currently not in the first team at Sunderland and Tottenham Hotspur respectively. Their Scotland places are consequently in jeopardy, with the manager unwilling to offer any guarantees of a place in the starting line-up. Gordon has played just a single game since November having failed to dislodge Martin Fulop in the Sunderland goal since his return from injury. Hutton, meanwhile, has not played at all since sustaining a fractured foot in the same month. The full-back has only been in full training for a week and must prove his fitness to Burley in a reserve game against West Bromwich Albion on Monday evening. &quot;Naturally, you have a better chance if you are playing regularly than if you are not,&quot; warned the Scotland manager, who today included the pair in his 26-man party for the matches in Amsterdam on Saturday week and four days later, when Iceland visit Hampden Park. &quot;Alan has had scans on his foot, it has totally healed and everything is fine. If he has some reaction after that reserve game or is not ready, he would be pulled out. It will be a good test for him. &quot;I spoke to [Tottenham manager] Harry Redknapp. He will be at the game on Monday as well and we will speak again then, he is happy to have a look at it and see how Alan goes in the game. Alan has shown at international level that he can perform at the highest level but he has got to be fit. &quot;The players have to be right for international football. If I had totally ruled Alan out, we wouldn&apos;t have the option. As it stands, we have the option and will have a look at him.&quot; The situation with Gordon is more intriguing. The former Hearts player has previously been his country&apos;s first-choice goalkeeper and has been capped 35 times. Yet his troubles at the Stadium of Light, combined with the emergence of Rangers&apos; Allan McGregor as a credible challenger, have placed his position in doubt. Gordon today stressed his preparedness to represent Scotland. &quot;I&apos;m fully fit, I&apos;m not feeling any effects from my ankle injury and I&apos;m ready to go if called upon,&quot; said the 26-year-old. &quot;Obviously, I&apos;d like a Premier League game before I went and joined up with Scotland. But if that doesn&apos;t happen then I&apos;m still ready to play.&quot; Burley, though, admitted he would have &quot;no qualms at all&quot; about fielding McGregor against the Dutch. &quot;I know what Craig can bring to us, that&apos;s for sure, but I know Allan is a top-class goalkeeper as well,&quot; he added. &quot;The team won&apos;t be picked until we have the players together and I have a chat with them. &quot;To be fair to Craig Gordon, he has been absolutely outstanding. In any other circumstance you wouldn&apos;t consider leaving him out because he has proved what he can do. But Allan came in and played for us in the friendly against Argentina and was outstanding. &quot;Craig has great experience but the problem is that he is not playing at the moment and that is a difficult one. We are not only talking about one or two weeks now, we are talking months and that&apos;s something I have to consider.&quot; Burley denied there was any friction between him and the Sunderland manager, Ricky Sbragia, who branded the Scotland coach &quot;unhelpful&quot; earlier this month. &quot;Ricky is a good friend of mine,&quot; Burley insisted. &quot;I think someone from the press had told him that I said Craig should be playing in his team, which wasn&apos;t the case.

And in one of said bars, they came up with the idea that would imminently lead to both of them quitting their day jobs.  Spotted by Locals is a network of European city blogs written by over 80 local bloggers who Sanne and Bart have met personally since coming up with the idea. Each city blog is manned by a number of enthusiastic local &quot;spotters&quot;, ranging from 18-year old Czech medicine students to 60-year old Belgian retirees. As the bloggers are all writing in second (or third) languages, the prose can occasionally be a little clunky, but therein lies its beauty: authentically local, on-the-ground advice. And, like all good blog content, the focus is on keeping up. &quot;All tips are always up-to-date. Our Spotters only write about places they visit regularly, and update the information in the article frequently.&quot;  Two years into the project, which hopes to build on its current collection of 20 destinations across the continent, Spotted by Locals is receiving recognition from a rather unlikely source - the blog network is nominated for two categories in the forthcoming Lonely Planet blog awards, hosted by surely the world&apos;s best-known &quot;paper guide&quot;.

Everything, from pins to tractors, from CDs to porcelain dolls, from used electromotors to old unopened letters, from furry muffs to VHS porn.

There are three bars, but we call this place &quot;Spica&quot;, which means spike, and if seen from above it actually looks like a land spike that points into the water. I&apos;ve known this place since forever and was always visiting it because this green oasis makes a perfect getaway from the urban hustle and bustle. The bars serve simple drinks you can drink either on the wooden benches on the shore or on the boat, or on deck chairs on the top of one of the barges. They also serve typical Balkan cevapcici; thumb-shaped grilled minced meat served on a plate with flatbread (lepinja), chopped fresh onions, kaymak and ajvar, which is a relish made mainly with red peppers, eggplant, garlic and chilli. \u2022 Tja\u0161a Janovljak, Ljubljana spotter.Privoz, in the Rudnik area.

Summer is equally tranquil; a conservatory to the rear opens out to a terrace overlooking the sparkling river, the opposite bank lined with lush, green trees.  \u2022 Ben Pendrey, London spotterThe Dove, 19 Upper Mall  Cinemanita - Amsterdam&apos;s squatters&apos; cinema     Photograph: Bart van Poll    Monday night is film night in De Nieuwe Anita, a cozy little bar that used to be run by squatters. The movies are presented by an American dude named Jeffrey Babcock, who&apos;s been a part of the sub-cultural scene of Amsterdam for quite some time. Not only does he select those hidden, twisted gems that you would not find yourself, he also drags you into the world of the filmmaker, by mixing factual information with juicy details about the often quite eccentric lives of the directors. The intimate interior has the look and feel of a living room; it has the right atmosphere to contemplate the movie you have seen, and to let your mind slowly wander back to reality. Cinemanita takes place every Monday night at 8.30pm. Be there at least half an hour in advance, as the seats are usually quickly filled. \u2022 Bart Verbunt, Amsterdam spotter111 Frederik Hendrikstraat, denieuweanita.nl  La Clota - Barcelona&apos;s forgotten district     Photograph: Sonia Martinez Arg\u00fcelo    Situated uptown between the Vall d&apos;hebron and Horta, you will find this small neighbourhood, very different from the rest of Barcelona. In fact, you don&apos;t feel you are in a big city but more probably in a small village somewhere in the Catalan countryside. No big buildings, not even a store, just a small bar hidden between two trees. Everywhere are stone houses with their gardens, orange and lemon trees and vegetable-gardens. Everything is slow-paced, quiet and peaceful. You can listen to the chirping of the birds, even the smell is different. It&apos;s an excellent place to stroll around if you want to escape from the crowded centre or just to get the feeling to be on vacation in the countryside. \u2022 Sonia Martinez Arg\u00fcelo, Barcelona spotterVall d&apos;Hebron subway  Sorolla Museum - Madrid&apos;s best-kept museum secret     Photograph: Nikko Hinderstein    Verging on being my favourite place on Earth, this museum is a true gem. You might not know the artist Joaqu&apos;n Sorolla, but you&apos;ve probably seen his paintings in a museum or two. He was one of the many Spanish artists who fell under the beautiful spell of the Alhambra in Granada, and while constructing his house (which is now the museum), he included various reminders of the Alhambra, even designing the garden with a mini version of one of the main fountains. The house itself is set up to display not only his artwork, but also the artwork of his friends and the decor which he either designed or painted. Of note is the dining room decor which features painted angelic versions of his wife and children floating on clouds. His studio is the central focus of the house with a high ceiling and light from almost all sides - it&apos;s easy to see how he was so inspired to paint. \u2022 Nikko Hinderstein, Madrid spotterGeneral Martinez Campos 37, museosorolla.mcu.es  Stockholm archipelago - empty winter wonderland     Photograph: Kristina B\u00e4ckstrand    The Swedish landscape has extremely beautiful lakes, forests and mountains that are used by most Swedes all year round. Even inside Stockholm it is possible to find a green park or a peaceful lake where one can relax. But one of the many things that make this city special is the archipelago, which is just a short boat trip east out of town. Even though it is very popular among locals during summertime (as the temperature of the Baltic Sea allows summer baths), the archipelago can also be rather spectacular during the winter season when the 24,000 islands are empty. Most of the boats leave from the centre of town and the islands are just around one hour away. Take a newspaper, a book and your camera, head out for a day to an empty island of your choice and enjoy a delicious meal at one of the great restaurants before coming back. But if you have the time for it, try staying an extra day at one of the beautiful inns opened during all the winter. \u2022 Vasco Castro, Stockholm spotterBoats depart from Str\u00f6mkajen  La Cotoletteria - traditional Milanese veal      Photograph: Alessandra Nigro    If you are looking for a restaurant with a long menu, this is not the place for you, since it serves just &quot;cotoletta&quot; and a few more dishes. It&apos;s a very informal place ... on a quiet street surrounded by pubs. The recipe of &quot;cotoletta alla milanese&quot; (literally &quot;chop from Milan&quot; - it is one of the typical dishes of the city) is really simple: a thin slice of veal dropped in whipped raw egg, rolled in bread crumbs and finally deep fried. There are 15 &quot;cotolette&quot; listed on the menu: from the plain one (the Classica) to the margherita, served with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese as if it was a pizza. Side dishes are included and you can choose between salad, grilled vegetables and fries. A tip: ask for lemon and squeeze it on the cotoletta, it makes the meat tastier. Try also the &quot;Fritto di fiori di zucca&quot;, deep fried zucchini flowers.

Having read the article about Apple&apos;s iLife suite (Technophile, 12 March), I wonder whether reviewers ever really use all those apps. There is a lot of trouble with some of them. For one, iWeb3 is very bugged. The blog part of it is practically useless. If you look at this page, you will immediately see the problem: misplaced images; the RSS feed of the blogs does not work properly (also a case of misplaced images); and the FTP transfer is not functioning properly for everyone. When you have more than one site or blog, adding an entry or making a change to one of those will result in damaging an other blog. That is practice, that is reality. The problem with iWeb pops up while working in iWeb on your desktop. If you add a new entry to a blog then several older entries will be misplaced by iWeb in the summary blog page and in the RSS feed. This even happens with a new blog I started in iWeb3 and when I there add a new entry, all my entries in another blog in a totally different site disappear or have misplaced images. I once even got an image from blog A misplaced in blog B! You can follow discussions about the iWeb problems here. It appears that there was a lot trouble with the previous version of iWeb as well, and Apple hasn&apos;t done much about users problems then. I have contacted several iWeb bloggers: some have simply removed all images, so they wouldn&apos;t be misplaced; others have reverted to the previous version of iWeb or have continued blogging with RapidWeaver, Wordpress or other. I had no trouble at all with my blog in iWeb2, and the part of my blogs that was made in iWeb2 is never touched by this bug. Only the stuff that was added in iWeb3 is unstable. It seems that Apple is again trying to shove the problems under the carpet, again leaving behind a lot of disgruntled customers. This could have to do with the changes they want for the future. It seems that with iLife09 several system frameworks were changed as well. In Apple&apos;s discussion forums the monitors take the trouble to censure words like &quot;hell&quot; \u2013 which appears as **** \u2013 when people express their annoyance, so they might as well pay some attention to the very annoying bugs in their own software.Hette Litjens Amsterdam  Make no mistake, iLife 09 is a big leap from iLife 08.

Two years ago a Fortune 500 company approached Alfresco (my employer), and ultimately concluded that they were too conservative and open source was too risky to move forward.

You rightly said that the creation of reusable address lists would have been best tackled &quot;when policy-makers first thought of it&quot;. What you failed to say was that this was 40 years ago, when the then ministry of housing and local government supported the development of computerised spatially based information systems for local authorities, including a pilot study with Coventry to develop a property data system. Much of this work resulted in the publication in 1971 of the General Information System for Planning, a major trigger for action. A lot of pioneering effort ensued, such as ICL&apos;s LAMIS system. It was only in recent years that issues such as copyright, commercial pressures, etc started to make gazetteer development so dysfunctional. It is even more recently that local authorities have started to adopt such attitudes. These have been encouraged by the realisation that they are being pushed into paying Royal Mail and OS for address information created and supplied by LAs with &quot;commercial&quot; elements added. Central government has really fumbled this one and only now seems to be trying to retrieve the situation. The costly, single-use census gazetteer is a major embarrassment.Peter Shilson Leeds Planes, trains and cars Good article by Charles Arthur until final paragraph (What if the internet was as safe as planes, 12 March).

Give me a break.Dr Daniel Winterstein, Winterwell Associates Ltd Edinburgh It&apos;s criminal Much as I applaud the efforts of organisations such as the Society for the Policing of Cyberspace and the National e-Crime Prevention Centre (The Judge Dredd of Birmingham, 5 March), I, like many others, am concerned about the lack of co-ordination and resourcing around the policing and reporting of e-crime nationally. The National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, disbanded in 2006, provided a model approach in many respects, particularly in its collaboration with business, but did not provide a central reporting point for less serious e-crime. Without such a facility, it is impossible to accurately determine the nature, scale or seriousness of such offences, which consequently inhibits the effective allocation of resources for crime prevention and detection. The recent removal of the duty on banks to report all fraud to the police can only makes this job more difficult, and perhaps indicates that law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed by the scale of cybercrime. The new PCeU (Police Central e-crime Unit), which is essentially the Metropolitan Police Computer Crime Unit given a national remit, provides some light on the horizon, and should go some way in helping to co-ordinate e-policing. However, it does not have a central reporting point (instead referring complainants to the yet-to-be-formed National Fraud Intelligence Bureau on its website) and the \u00a37m funding provided by the Home Office over three years will not go far. Let&apos;s hope that they manage to leverage sufficient funding from business and other interested bodies to really make a difference.Tony Troy via email Email us at tech@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["In Apple&apos;s discussion forums the monitors take the trouble to censure words like &quot;hell&quot; \u2013 which appears as **** \u2013 when people express their annoyance, so they might as well pay some attention to the very annoying bugs in their own software.Hette Litjens Amsterdam  Make no mistake, iLife 09 is a big leap from iLife 08."], "title": "Letters and blogs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/19/letters-and-blogs", "tags": ["Technology", "Apple", "Software", "Internet", "Open source", "Local government", "Government data"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-19T11:25:55Z", "article": "It&apos;s a reflex response: switch on the lights, check out the bathroom, put your luggage down, bounce on the bed, turn your head towards the hotel telly and &quot;Ooh, there&apos;s a minibar. And wow, it has - a cold tin of olives?&quot;  Reality dawns with the paper sledgehammer that is the price list. You feel mugged. You pledge never to spend \u00a35 on a small bottle of Carlsberg when you can grab a crate of beer in the corner shop for five pfennigs. Ever! But minibars are cruel. No matter how hard you try, you will always raid the evil little two-shelf fridge, usually late at night. And hotels know it. According to research by Hotels.com across eight European countries - UK, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, France, Norway, Sweden and Germany - 46% of us succumb to the monster minibar. Brits spend \u00a3526m a year on minibars alone, the equivalent bailout of a small bank - or four miniatures of Scotch and a chocolate peanut bar.  The average Briton&apos;s minibar spend per break is \u00a315.44, \u00a32 down on 2007 (must be the recession, glad to see thrift has returned). The worst offenders are the Irish, spending \u00a322 per break, according to the poll, with the Norwegians the most frugal at \u00a310. (That seems odd - if you hail from a country where a beer is \u00a38, you&apos;d view a minibar booze a bargain.) Minibars are like having your own personal Ryanair trolley in your room, without the surly service, rattling wheels and time-consuming currency conversions. And, like a Ryanair trolley, a minibar stocks all manner of unhealthy, unsatisfying snacks and drinks at unwelcome prices. And because few of us feel comfortable paying minibar prices, we invent ways to snooker it. It&apos;s called &quot;minibar-meddling&quot;, apparently. One in 10 Brits admitted to a &quot;minibar meddle&quot; in the survey: buying similar drinks in the corner shop to cheekily restock what we&apos;ve necked the night before. That is easier said than done, however. Minibar products are sometimes outsized - more usually undersized (they have to be small to fit in) and unavailable in the local shop. The brands are often international, too expensive for many local shops. In Kiev, and on a tight budget, I went one better, and popped out to load up on snacks and drink, emptying the overpriced minibar of branded western products and replacing it with my own, local, cheaper comfort fodder. Sixty per cent of us do that, says Hotels.com. The next day the maid helpfully made my bed, cleaned the bathroom, and then very kindly emptied the fridge of all my drink and replaced it with all the hotel&apos;s drink. My beer was warm, their&apos;s was cold. One-nil! So I put them back again. One-one! This tiring game of fill, empty, refill went on each day for four days until I checked out.  We can blame minibars on the German firm Siegas, which introduced the first refrigerated bar in the early 1960s. The true pioneer (read culprit), however, was the Hong Kong Hilton, which installed small fridges in each room, with two drinks of every type on a small shelf to be given away free to guests (ah, the golden days of travel).  The cost proved prohibitive until some canny marketing jobsworth - someone who should be hunted down and bludgeoned to death with a small fridge and a can of olives - worked out a billing system for each room&apos;s usage. The result? A spectacular 500% rise over normal room service sales. Apparently, it raised the bottom line profit by 5%. All the Hiltons copied it, and so did other international chains. Which is where we are today, except hotels are dreaming up more ways to fleece the guest. Some stock condoms, vibrators and even lubrication - &quot;They&apos;ve got vibrators and lube in K West in Shepherd&apos;s Bush,&quot; says my friend Paul. The three-star Catalina Hotel and Beach Club in Miami has a &quot;pimp my fridge&quot; option, &quot;enabling guests to order various personalised minibars&quot;, including the &apos;Get It On Minibar&apos; which includes a Barry White CD, edible body paint, Champagne and whipped cream.&quot; There are even &quot;minibar happy hours&quot;. The five-star Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel in Knightsbridge offers 30% off between 10pm and midnight.  Perhaps the best way to flog overpriced minibar goodies is to put stuff in it we actually want. (No tinned nuts, more fresh sarnies!) Hotels.com says for men that means more beer (yawn - 60%) and, oddly, massage oils (25%); while women are more concerned with chocolate bars (yawn again - 43%) and a good book or magazine (38%). Erm, book? Magazine? In a fridge? Perhaps there is nothing next. Some hotels simply don&apos;t restock the minibars. Rare, I know. But common in stag do cities and aircrew hotels, apparently.  One friend turned up late to a hotel in Amsterdam only to find the minibar totally empty - not even water or OJ, she says. &quot;It was an airline crew hotel, and experience had shown that air crews couldn&apos;t be trusted not to get totally larrupped the night before a flight... so the airline instructed the hotel to clear out ALL the minibars.&quot; Cheap, very cheap.", "sentences": ["One friend turned up late to a hotel in Amsterdam only to find the minibar totally empty - not even water or OJ, she says."], "title": "Mini bars, major prices!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2009/mar/19/hotels-minibars-travel-food-drink", "tags": ["Hotels", "Food and drink", "Travel", "Europe holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-19T13:53:02Z", "article": "&quot;The recession is turning into a depression in an unprecedented manner and at an unprecedented pace \u2026 The degree of fiscal expansion may not be enough but the possibilities for [it] will diminish \u2026 The situation in Europe is grim and \u00adgetting grimmer \u2026&quot; &quot;This is the paradox of the paradigm.

They did so with sober passion and, not least, humour and mutual respect, commodities sadly lacking in most of the contributions so far. And for older commentators such as this one, alarmed that a reprise of the depression 80 years later could trigger worldwide violent political extremism of the kind that wrecked European civilisation in the 1930s, they went at least close to the heart of the problem. What kind of capitalism or post-capitalism will or should emerge from the crisis? What social and economic order are we willing to embrace or able to agree on? If the economic crisis is over-arched by the planetary one of global warming can we really envisage and implement a &quot;green new deal&quot; or a sustainable society that breaks with the past and deals resolutely with poverty, exclusion and injustice? Of course, the panel of two delivered no definitive answers. But in a city where policy wonks debate issues from breakfast to post-dinner and the audience emerges little or none the wiser, it was refreshingly provocative and radical. And there was even, surprisingly, a degree of consensus between a proponent of (amended/reformed/regulated) globalisation and one of its fiercest critics. Koopman, thrown into a lions&apos; den of largely anti-capitalist NGO campaigners, stoutly defended the EU&apos;s responses to the crisis against Bello&apos;s repeated criticism that it depended heavily on &quot;failed multilateral institutions&quot; or FMIs (a play on the French version of IMF: Fonds Mon\u00e9taire International) that required radical reform. Bello \u2013 drawing on the experience of 1944 when, in the middle of war, more than twice as many countries as in the G20 turned up at Bretton Woods for the (now discredited) new world order \u2013 wants the UN to play the key role in deciding BW2; Koopman thinks that body too unwieldy given the urgency of the crisis. The pair argued extensively over issues such as the likelihood or not of an implosion of euroland under the weight of credit default spreads, budget deficits, mega-unemployment et al. It&apos;s a prospect viewed as increasingly imminent by Delors. In a melancholy and angry interview with the German magazine Capital he assails Germany for failing to offer prior consultation on its own responses or adequate solidarity. &quot;I could well imagine that the pressure of the strong on the weak to carry out better policy or leave the monetary union is growing \u2026 I&apos;m pessimistic about the future of the euro.&quot; Delors, co-architect of the EU&apos;s crowning glory, the single market, says Europe is in full protectionist retreat and reacting &quot;slowly and ploddingly in areas such as new rules in financial supervision or on cleaning up banks&quot;. It was a view endorsed by Bello, who wants a ban on derivatives, hedge funds and short-selling and &quot;the extension of criminalisation to certain economic and financial activities&quot;. Koopman, of course, countered that the EU is already leading the way in proposing tougher, more extensive regulation such as outlined in the recent Lamfalussy and De Larosi\u00e8re reports (reprised by Adair Turner in his 122-page FSA paper this week). But this was, above all, not a meeting of closed minds between the north and the south. We emerged into a sunlit European Quarter with agreed notions that a 80% cut in CO2 emissions on 1990 levels by 2050 will be inadequate; on the need for an inter-generational pact to tackle the demographic challenge in mature economies; on the urgency of genuine solidarity with the fathomless pool of the discarded unemployed in the north and of the excluded, innocent poor of the south; and of a permanent brake on consumption and greed.

If, and at this point it remains no more than that, the Sunderland manager, Ricky Sbragia, opts to restore Craig Gordon as his goalkeeper for the away game, the debate over whether the \u00a39m man should represent his country in the Amsterdam ArenA next week will enter a new phase. Burley, battling to keep alive Scotland&apos;s aspirations of World Cup qualification, appears in a serious quandary over his choice of keeper for the daunting visit to Holland. Allan McGregor has emerged as a creditable challenger to Gordon, a matter more to do with impressive showings for Rangers in Europe last season than for what he has done in this one. Gordon, who has recently been Martin Fulop&apos;s deputy at the Stadium of Light after recovering from an ankle injury, may be the same age as McGregor, 26, but his 35 international caps compare strikingly with the Rangers man&apos;s three. It would be harsh if Gordon does not pull on the yellow jersey for Scotland&apos;s clash with the Dutch, even if Sbragia does not select him. Not only has Gordon never let his country down, he has in the past excelled on the big occasion and against high-profile opposition. If course and distance matters at all, Gordon should get the nod. The typical west of Scotland clamour for McGregor&apos;s promotion has been evident for more than a year. Ironically, though, while a heavy section of Rangers fans believe their goalkeeper is superior to the one Hearts sold to Sunderland for such a lavish sum, others remain unconvinced. Radio phone-ins north of the border regularly echo to the tones of Gers fans who &quot;don&apos;t fancy&quot; McGregor. The case for his inclusion is simple. McGregor is playing every week and for a team who do not concede many goals. Gordon, meanwhile, has featured in only one first-team game in more than four months. Those European showings earned McGregor widespread acclaim, most notably away to Werder Bremen. This season, though, McGregor has earned less praise. Partly, of course, because Rangers&apos; involvement in Europe was so brief but also on account of more than a few wobbly moments \u2013 the latest against Hamilton Academical in a Scottish Cup tie this month. McGregor retains a capacity to look more than a little suspect under cross balls, his excellent shot-stopping notwithstanding. Despite all of those who claim McGregor is the equal of Gordon, and despite Rangers&apos; much-publicised financial troubles in January, it appeared significant that no clubs from south of the border made meaningful attempts to coax him from Ibrox. Neither has McGregor been touted as a player of the year in this most mediocre of Scottish domestic campaigns. Gordon featured for Sunderland&apos;s reserves on Monday night and, even taking into account the low-key nature of a fixture in Morecombe, it is a harsh truth that the first-team strike forces of Falkirk and Kilmarnock do not include the likes of Benni McCarthy, against whom Gordon kept a clean sheet. Meanwhile, Norwich fans may have cause to be miffed. Their team&apos;s goalkeeper, David Marshall, has been almost flawless in the last year and again is part of the Scotland squad but, bizarrely, he has not been afforded any action by Burley. If current form alone is the key component of an international player, Marshall arguably has more of a claim to replace Gordon than McGregor. Gordon has done little or nothing wrong to merit the loss of his much-treasured Scotland jersey. Many would argue, in fact, that Sbragia has been unduly harsh in not handing the Sunderland No1 spot back to him upon return from injury. Gordon had been in fine form, probably his best while on Wearside, before his fitness troubles and came back for a match against Bolton Wanderers in the vain hope that it would keep Roy Keane at the club. It didn&apos;t, and further damage incurred on that ankle prompted another spell on the sidelines. Now fully fit, he has never been an individual to rest on his laurels or let standards slip. There should be no comparison with Kris Boyd, who was denied regular club action, and therefore had no Scotland action, and subsequently took the huff. Nor Alan Hutton, who would represent a genuine risk to Burley if returning at full-back in Amsterdam, having not kicked a ball in any competition since November. Hutton&apos;s fitness would be sorely tested against flying Dutch wingers. An interesting footnote relates to the Scotland goalkeeping coach, Jim Stewart. His full-time job is with Rangers, despite previously having worked with Gordon at Hearts. It is far from inconceivable he will push Burley towards McGregor, the man with whom he works daily. Burley and Gordon also have familiarity from the pair&apos;s time at Tynecastle, when Gordon&apos;s coach was the impressive Mal Webster. Burley cannot afford gambles at this stage in the campaign after defeat in Macedonia and a home draw with Norway. He should be reassured that fielding Gordon, a man rated by his peers as one of the finest goalkeepers in the world, represents nothing of the sort even against Holland.", "sentences": ["If, and at this point it remains no more than that, the Sunderland manager, Ricky Sbragia, opts to restore Craig Gordon as his goalkeeper for the away game, the debate over whether the \u00a39m man should represent his country in the Amsterdam ArenA next week will enter a new phase.", "Nor Alan Hutton, who would represent a genuine risk to Burley if returning at full-back in Amsterdam, having not kicked a ball in any competition since November."], "title": "Ewan Murray: George Burley must bring back Craig Gordon as Scotland's goalkeeper", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/mar/20/craig-gordon-george-burley-allan-mcgregor-scotland-holland", "tags": ["Scotland", "Holland", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-20T17:40:32Z", "article": "One to bookmark A sign of the times.

Road to successYou need good aerodynamics, handling balance and engine power on this circuit where you really work the car very hard. In addition to full throttle running and the need to tackle fast, slow and medium-speed corners, it also calls for tremendously hard braking into the chicane before the pits. When the lights go outWe are back at Suzuka this year after two seasons at Fuji and this is a really great circuit, a stunning track. Going into the first turn is really quick, running downhill all the way from the chicane before the pits. Grandstand or total pitsOne of the very best venues on the championship calendar. It has everything from fast, flowing corners to a really tight chicane. It really has got everything to tax all aspects of a formula one car and the driver&apos;s performance.

It offered shares in Caduceus Medical Technologies which, it said, would be a hot share when it came to the US Nasdaq stockmarket. But I can&apos;t find any independent information on either the broker, or the company, being sold. Is this worth a trip to Rome to find out?MK, London  Don&apos;t waste your money on a ticket to Italy, where it claims to have an office in Rome&apos;s via Barberini. If it does so, it will be no more than a maildrop. You have to go much further afield to find the real Legacy Global Wealth offices - as far as Manila, Philippines where you&apos;ll have to take the lift to the 20th floor of the Pacific Star Building in the Makati area. Legacy Global Wealth is an unregulated boiler room. Belgium&apos;s Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission has warned consumers against the firm - and &quot;against transferring money to any account number it might mention&quot;. One that it uses is a Barclays Bank Seychelles account in the name of ZRG Holdings. Little is known about ZRG, other than it has been connected to a number of unauthorised share approaches including &quot;offers&quot; from a number of other boiler rooms. One was Bangkok-based Jackson Cole, which enriched around 20 people in the few months it carried on business in 2003. According to one ex-employee, UK investors were paying in $1m a month for worthless shares - although a fair slice of that went towards police bribes and bar girls. Jackson Cole was run by Birmingham-born Paul Hilton (not his real name - the first rule of boiler rooms is that no name is genuine). He now runs Legacy Global Wealth.  As for Caduceus, it may or may not have a brilliant method of disposing of used needles. But it has no published balance sheet - and, so far, has not revealed if it has any sales. Avoid. I lost my keys - then my insurer lost my car  My house was burgled in mid-November. Among other items, my car keys were stolen. I contacted Direct Line, my car&apos;s insurers, who took the car away the next morning for new locks to be fitted. I haven&apos;t seen it since. Can you find my car?RS, Leeds  Direct Line acted correctly in wanting to replace your locks - after all the thief could have come back for your car at some stage. But then you lost your car for over three months. Two days before the break-in, you had booked your 2002 car into a Seat dealership for clutch work. You asked Direct Line to take the car there for its engineer to approve the locks, but no engineer ever went (there was nothing to look at, as there was no damage). So Direct Line failed to authorise the Seat garage to do the work.  Just after Christmas - and after Direct Line had paid \u00a370 in compensation for delays - the car was moved to Direct Line&apos;s own garage. You were given free hire of a Ford Ka, but that was too small for your mountain bike and 5.5-metre seagoing kayak - so you were deprived of your hobbies as well. December went into January and February and still no car. Then Capital Letters intervened. Direct Line found your car, blaming problems in sourcing Seat lock parts - the main dealer you wanted might have been better. The insurer has acknowledged your pain. As well as the cost of 80 days&apos; use of a hire car and the \u00a370 it paid in December, it will now pay \u00a3300 for the clutch repair you had previously arranged with the Seat dealer, refund the \u00a3225 excess you should have paid, and treat the incident as &quot;no fault&quot;, which will cut \u00a3105 from your renewal premium. And it will pay for the new locks. The total bill is more than your car&apos;s value. How low-cost flights become high-cost I booked two flights with BMI Baby from East Midlands airport.  The first was to Amsterdam, but was cancelled due to snow. I had paid \u00a3263.43. I was advised to rebook but then decided I did not want to go. I called BMI Baby&apos;s 35p-a-minute helpline, which told me to write in. The airline then deducted \u00a310 from my ticket price and said I had to use the remaining credit they offered me by 27 August 2009. I also wanted to go to Geneva later this month but my flight, which I had booked last October, has been cancelled. The new flight goes on a Friday (rather than a Wednesday), which is not suitable. I paid \u00a3102.35 for this but the airline will only refund me \u00a395.35. Please help.SE, Nottingham  This is another example of how low-cost airlines become high-cost.  The flights were cancelled through no fault of your own but, instead of immediately offering a credit card refund, the airline made you spend 35p a minute to call it - and then only refunded a proportion of your expense.This is nonsense. You paid for a service and the airline failed to deliver. It should make a no-questions refund. After a Capital Letters call, BMI decided to return your money in full. But there is no explanation for the deductions - nor any compensation for the wasted premium phone calls or time. Tipster service turned out to be a bad bet As a disabled pensioner, I get pleasure from placing small bets on televised race meetings. I recently received a mailshot from Brando Racing in Hove, a firm of tipsters which promised a 60-day free trial and &quot;an expert team of full-time professional gamblers, offering the ultimate inside information service to a select number of genuine, reliable and honest backers&quot;. I had to sign up with a \u00a397 a month standing order but after one month the success rate was rubbish, although it had claimed between 44% and 62%. Can I get my money back?JC, Worcestershire  Standing orders involve telling your bank what to do with your money - direct debits allow the other side to claim the money. But the real problem here is that Brando will not refund the first monthly payment you made, even though most of its tips were also-rans - almost anyone can pick the occasional odds-on winner. You are not the only one with Brando problems. But those behind it seem to have disappeared. Its literature does not have a phone number, so Capital Letters called another firm in the same Hove building, which said Brando had moved on. It had apparently only ever used the place as a mailbox. Don&apos;t keep sending good money after bad I took out an 11-year endowment with Britannic Assurance 10 years ago, paying \u00a325 a month (\u00a3300 a year). It was supposed to have given me a small nest egg on retirement. However, over the past year, I have paid in \u00a3300 only to see the policy gain just \u00a310. What is happening?MC, London  You - and others - are victims of the great &quot;with-profits&quot; savings con. You were told that &quot;smoothing&quot; would free you from the ups and downs of the stock market. But that did not work. So far, you&apos;ve paid in \u00a33,000 to get \u00a32,978 - it will be less if you cash in. And it seems unlikely that the last \u00a3300 for this year will fare much better. Your plan has coincided with the worst decade for shares. But even if performance had been better, the only winner would still have been the insurer, now Phoenix. Deductions on 7.5% annual growth would have been \u00a31,400 over the first 10 years, leaving you with just \u00a33,000 (the sum you paid in).

Rare are the days when Tottenham do serious damage to fellow Londoners. Precious was the pleasure of inflicting the first setback upon a storied foreign coach&apos;s entry into the English game. Guus Hiddink had been making a habit out of the sturdy single-goal victory as Chelsea manager, gradually ratcheting up the pressure on Manchester United at the summit of the Premier League. A run of six domestic victories ended at White Hart Lane as the Dutchman fell to a 1-0 defeat \u2013 his frustration increased by the knowledge of United&apos;s aberration at Fulham a few miles south-west. &quot;We missed a huge opportunity,&quot; \u00adHiddink said. &quot;These are the days in such a tough league when you have to be right at the key moments. If Man United is losing those are the moments to strike, but we didn&apos;t do it.&quot; For Spurs it was an afternoon of reassurance as they near the end of an oft-fretful season. Relegation now avoided in all but the arithmetic, their fans will use \u00adperformances such as this as fuel for dreams of what might be next term \u2013 imagining the scorer Luka Modric and the creator Aaron Lennon undoing more than just Chelsea. &quot;Well deserved,&quot; argued Redknapp with justification. &quot;I think that&apos;s 18 points from nine games. The way we&apos;re playing I think we are as good as anybody in the country at the moment. We&apos;ve just got to keep that going.&quot; Criticised both inside and outside the club for deciding to scrap Tottenham&apos;s Uefa Cup campaign, Redknapp&apos;s reward has been a one-game-a-week schedule and a consistent line-up. Fielding Ledley King at centre-back every match has been an obvious advantage; using the same midfield four has brought a creative understanding. With three trophies to play for and a fragile squad to handle, Hiddink has shuffled both personnel and formation. Here, Alex covered for Ricardo Carvalho&apos;s newly strained ankle, while Juliano Belletti replaced Deco on the right of a midfield unusually anchored by Michael Ballack. Kick-off delayed half an hour as police removed a suspect van from outside the South Stand, Chelsea began scrappily, misplacing passes as the home side rushed bodies behind the ball in their own half and pressed lustily in the other. If Michael Essien pulled an early save from Heurelho Gomes, Belletti caused more pain by \u00adfalling on his compatriot&apos;s head. Hiddink redirected Nicolas Anelka to the left wing as he tried to take a grip on possession, but it was Tottenham coming closer to goal. Jermaine Jenas curled a shot just over; a long ball put Robbie Keane in for a spectacular volley, spectacularly saved by Petr Cech. Corners were a threat and the captain strained Cech again after Vedran Corluka sprinted away from two markers to manufacture another opening. Chelsea were struggling, their only other first-half chance coming when Didier Drogba optimistically attempted a tight-angled volley that flew across the area for Anelka to shoot on target. The Ivorian was forced to take his half-time break early, unintentionally clattered by King as they contested a high ball. Drogba returned after the interval, but so did Chelsea&apos;s troubles. Applying the game sense Redknapp has been teaching him, Lennon shifted Ashley Cole left and right, then clipped a pass low and square into the area. Devoid of a marker, Modric swivelled directly into a shot that angled wide enough of Cech to find the net. Soon the pair almost repeated the dose, Lennon crossing and Modric shooting higher as Cech scrambled away. \u00adHiddink added a genuine winger in Ricardo Quaresma, but his team&apos;s chances came from distance and Gomes&apos;s hesitation on a cross. When Florent Malouda joined him and Chelsea went to 4-2-4, John Terry had a close-range header gloriously saved by Gomes. From the subsequent corner Lennon demonstrated there is still some polishing to be done as he broke away and chose the sky over three team-mates. As Chelsea pushed even their centre-backs up, Tottenham grew agonisingly looser. King saved them from Anelka with a lunging block, Alex headed on to the underside of the bar, and Ballack&apos;s shot in the dying seconds was cleared from the line. It was a defeat, said Hiddink, that came from &quot;sloppy defending&quot; and a poor start to both halves.

Deliberating on the forthcoming World Cup qualifying double-header \u2013 Iceland are due at Hampden Park four days later \u2013 the Scotland manager did not hesitate to declare his belief that the second leg is the likelier source of the points that will advance his squad&apos;s chances of finishing runner-up in Group Nine and a chance of reaching the play-offs for a place in South Africa next year. Burley&apos;s sense of priorities owes less to squeamishness than it does to a realistic view of Scotland&apos;s chances away to a Dutch side ranked third in the world behind Spain and Germany. Although remaining unstated, this assessment will doubtless privately include the acknowledgement that none of his players could be considered worthy of a place in Bert van Marwijk&apos;s side. Hints of the manager&apos;s seemingly diffident attitude to the trip across the North Sea were both powerful and plentiful. He did not, for example, reach for the managerial cliche of &quot;taking one game at a time&quot;, but emphasised that the second of the assignments would have significant relevance to his planning and selection for the first. In discussing the likelihood of Alan Hutton&apos;s appearance after a lengthy, injury-enforced absence at Tottenham, Burley gave the strong impression that the right-back would not be risked against the Oranje in order to be ready for Iceland. As Hutton is one of the most highly-rated members of the squad, this amounted to an admission of low expectations at the Amsterdam ArenA. &quot;In our preparations over the week, we have to cater for two matches,&quot; Burley says, &quot;and we have to regard the Iceland match as the bigger for our purposes. Anything we could take from Holland would be a bonus. I have my thoughts about the team I&apos;ll pick and how we&apos;ll play, but that could all change by Monday, when we find out how they&apos;ve all come through the weekend. &quot;In Hutton&apos;s case, we&apos;ll have to wait until Tuesday, as he&apos;s coming back from injury to play in a reserve match for Spurs at West Brom on Monday night. He&apos;s been out a long time, so he&apos;ll have to be assessed. Players coming back from that kind of absence often get through their first appearance purely on adrenaline. That could happen with Alan, who is a top-class player we would always want in the team, but we do have to remember that we have two matches to consider this time.&quot; The Dutch players&apos; historic tendency towards in-fighting and disharmony has, in the past, encouraged opponents to believe that the most effective way of securing a result has been the hope that they would beat themselves. But, having watched them win all three of their qualifiers and establish a five-point lead over the Scots in second place, Burley detects no signs of internecine war. &quot;No, they look very together, very much a solid team,&quot; he says. &quot;The one that stood out in their win over Norway in Oslo was Mark van Bommel, of Bayern Munich. He was a real leader, very strong and very competitive. And when you look at those around him, like Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie and the clubs they play for, you know why they are ranked third in the world. &quot;There&apos;s no point in saying we&apos;ll go there and have a go at them. Our priority will be to work as hard as we can to stop them from playing. Because of their quality and their pace, they&apos;re likely to take full advantage of any space we allow them.

The Dutchman is experienced enough not to let defeat anchor his mood, though his first as Chelsea&apos;s manager has had infuriating consequences. He wanted to leave on an upbeat note reflective of his reign to date. Instead, his last duty before swapping part-time roles was to all but surrender the title. Reality caught up with Chelsea across the capital. Hiddink always knew he was operating to outrageously fine margins in pursuit of Manchester United, but the opportunity his team wasted here inflicted as much psychological as mathematical damage to their prospects. This had already been a damaging week after confirmation that Arsenal and Liverpool await as daunting opponents in the FA Cup and Champions League, but the inability to capitalise on United&apos;s latest implosion provided a horribly low key note on which to depart on the two-week international break. The gap remains four points, but it might as well be a chasm. Players and management staff will stew over this set-back. &quot;We may not get more chances,&quot; admitted Hiddink, who had stopped off in Amsterdam to visit his 93-year-old fatherbefore flying on to Moscow. &quot;United can lose one game and they are still in the driver&apos;s seat, but Liverpool and Chelsea are chasing and cannot afford to drop a single point. United are under pressure, of course, but they lost \u2013 and those are the moments when players know they must strike. If you are chasing, you cannot afford to do what we did. It&apos;s not as if we were outplayed. We were just sloppy in the first 10 minutes after the break.&quot; It was uncharacteristic slackness from a side that had been supremely drilled for most of their games under the Dutchman over his first month in charge. Jose Bosingwa and, to a certain extent, Michael Ballack were most culpable in the concession, an unmarked Luka Modric capping his own wonderful display with a glorious finish from Aaron Lennon&apos;s right-wing centre five minutes after the interval. Yet Chelsea laboured virtually throughout. Wilson Palacios and Jermaine Jensas hassled and harried their midfield, Robbie Keane tracking back to stifle the deep-lying Ballack whenever the visitors gained possession. Tottenham&apos;s work ethic bordered on the feverish. Chelsea were off-colour and becalmed. It was only in the frantic final minutes, when Harry Redknapp described them as &quot;desperate&quot; and Heurelho Gomes blunted their best efforts, that they offered any drive or purpose, though to no avail. This team has not won a London derby all season and have now failed to defeat Spurs in their last four meetings. &quot;I thought they&apos;d be more of a threat than they were,&quot; said the Tottenham manager. &quot;We came in at half-time feeling quite comfortable, really. They hadn&apos;t really caused us too many problems.&quot; Not many opponents can say that of a brush with Chelsea, but it was Spurs&apos; commitment and endeavour that disrupted their opponents&apos; rhythm. Whether knowledge of United&apos;s toils at Craven Cottage had also played a part in choking Chelsea, this game having been delayed while a suspicious vehicle was investigated outside the ground, is open to question. It was the visitors&apos; temperament that proved truly suspect. The loss was untimely given that this is the first occasion when Hiddink&apos;s dual duties will truly come under scrutiny, though it is hard to see how Chelsea will be affected by his concentrating on qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Liechtenstein in the next fortnight. Virtually his entire playing squad dispersed around the globe last night on international duty. There will not be enough first-team numbers at Cobham even for a practice game until Hiddink returns. Redknapp will face similar problems at Chigwell, though his side take momentum with them into the break. Unbeaten in six league games, four of which have been won, they are a side eyeing qualification for the Europa League. They were outstanding here, with Ledley King magnificent in front of the watching England manager Fabio Capello, though it was their goalkeeper who preserved the victory. Gomes denied John Terry, Alex, Florent Malouda, Nicolas Anelka and Ballack in the dying minutes, four of those chances coming in stoppage time.&quot;I&apos;d be a liar if I told you, &apos;Yeah, I always knew he&apos;d do that&apos;,&quot; admitted Redknapp. &quot;I was getting worried when he had that horrible spell a few months back, but every time we went to Europe people would tell us how good he was. The goalkeeping coach at PSV Eindhoven, the Dutch guy who works for Shakhtar Donetsk and finds all their South American players \u2013 they all said he was world-class. Tony Adams, who&apos;d done some coaching in Holland, told me in the summer that Spurs had signed one of the best goalies in the world. He&apos;s showing that now.&quot; The Brazilian departed with a hug from his coach at Spurs, Tony Parks.

The prospect of a makeshift Scotland defence \u00adcoming face to face with Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben in the \u00adAmsterdam ArenA on Saturday evening is \u00adgalling enough, after all. Yet Burley is acutely aware he is fighting a battle beyond merely trying to take Scotland to the World Cup for a first major championship since 1998. An underwhelming feeling at the time of his appointment in January 2008 has manifested itself in unedifying fashion ever since. If the tabloid press can distort public opinion \u2013 and in this instance there is a strong argument that they have \u2013 they can also force undue pressures on managers. A drawn friendly against Northern Ireland seven months ago, as an example, led to Burley being compared in print to Berti Vogts; the manager who, by common consent, oversaw Scotland at their lowest international ebb. &quot;There has been a lot of negativity,&quot; Burley conceded. &quot;If you are winning games all the time, it helps. We have played hard games, hard friendly games. It hasn&apos;t been all plain sailing but international football is like that. We don&apos;t have the personnel to say we should be winning every game. In this day and age, it is something you learn to live with. If you got down about it and worried about it, you couldn&apos;t do your job.&quot; But does the nation&apos;s press have a duty to talk up the national side? &quot;That is what you would hope for but it hasn&apos;t happened, has it? The most important thing for me is not to let it influence me. I am totally focused. The media in general has changed and in a small nation like Scotland, it is intense. Negativity at times sells papers. &quot;It is 11 years since we qualified for major championships. Walter Smith did an excellent job and so did Alex McLeish; we haven&apos;t had 10 years&apos; worth of bad \u00admanagers. We have had excellent \u00admanagers and still haven&apos;t qualified so that is the size of the challenge.&quot; Burley&apos;s task has hardly been made \u00adeasier by a series of high-profile spats. He has had more than a few cross words with the Scottish Premier League regarding what he perceives as unhelpful fixture scheduling; the SPL, under duress, agreed to delay the start of next season to aid preparations for Scotland&apos;s visit to Norway in August. &quot;I put my points across but I can&apos;t \u00addictate things,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m trying to do my best for the country and hopefully people understand that. Everybody has their own agenda, I&apos;m trying my best for the national team. Other \u00adpeople think otherwise, and that&apos;s where you have conflict.&quot; Most notably with the Rangers striker Kris Boyd, who publicly declared he would not represent his country again while \u00adBurley remains in charge. The former Ipswich, Derby, Hearts and Southampton manager&apos;s riposte these days is veiled rather than direct. &quot;In football you never look back. It is important that everybody wants to give their all for the country. If you are not committed, in any squad, you are as well not being there.&quot; Burley remains an intriguing character. Bland in public, privately he retains the respect of senior players who appreciate his hands-on approach. He has been known to get the names of those players wrong when speaking to an audience, although such a flaw hardly rendered Jack Charlton or Bobby Robson hopeless international managers when they were in charge of the Republic of Ireland and England respectively. The media aside, Burley clearly \u00adstruggles with certain aspects of international management after being in club football from the age of 15. &quot;This is a great challenge and a great honour for me,&quot; he explained. &quot;It has been very enjoyable but it is frustrating at times. I can&apos;t influence the team the way I would do as a club manager. You don&apos;t have enough time to work on things on the training ground, to fix things if they are going wrong.&quot; Not that Scotland&apos;s opening to their World Cup qualifying campaign has been disastrous. An unjust defeat in \u00adMacedonia was swiftly followed by victory in Iceland, and a subsequent home draw with \u00adNorway leaves Burley&apos;s team second in Group Nine as they head to Holland. \u00adVictory over Iceland at Hampden Park next Wednesday, by the manager&apos;s \u00adadmission, is essential regardless of what happens in Amsterdam. &quot;Not beating Norway hasn&apos;t changed anything,&quot; Burley insisted. &quot;We are still in second position; it is still in our own hands. Even if we lose to Holland we can still qualify. &quot;I feel we need to pick up 10 points at least from our next five games. We are looking for nine from the three home games and at least a point away from home somewhere.

Occasionally you see a flame, even an explosion, but usually it looks over the world with quiet calm.&quot; Van Commenee, the Dutch coach known best in this country for the blazing intensity he brought to his work with Denise Lewis and Kelly Sotherton, has the task of galvanising Britain&apos;s underperforming athletes and coaches in the 40 months left before the 2012 Olympics. And, after seven weeks in the job, the volcano will not remain dormant much longer. Seismic changes will soon rock UK Athletics \u2013 not just in scalding reaction to another poor performance at the European indoor championships in Turin this month but in a determined restructuring of its unwieldy system. &quot;The volcano effect,&quot; Van Commenee suggests coolly, &quot;is a powerful card. But it&apos;s important not to overuse it. The essence of coaching is to find different ways to communicate your message to different people \u2013 so they understand how we need to improve radically.&quot; Dwain Chambers has done more than anyone to deserve an eruption of Vesuvius proportions. Though he won one of Britain&apos;s two gold medals in Turin, the disgraced sprinter has continued to stoke his doping controversy. He followed the publication of his autobiography with an admission that he was still in contact with Victor Conte \u2013 who supplied the banned performance-enhancing drugs Chambers consumed in 2002 and 2003. After he marked his arrival at UK Athletics by insisting Chambers had been punished enough, Van Commenee has been let down by subsequent revelations. These include an unsubstantiated claim from Chambers&apos; former coach, the shamed Remi Korchemny, that he was advising him again. &quot;When I heard about Conte and then Korchemny,&quot; Van Commenee says, &quot;I thought, &apos;Is truth really stranger than fiction? This can&apos;t be true!&apos;&quot; His desire to be transparent in regard to Chambers is illustrated by the fact that we conduct two separate interviews in order for him to articulate his thoughts. During our first conversation at UK Athletics in Solihull last Tuesday evening he had conceded that &quot;of course we are concerned. It would be strange if we were not concerned that one of our athletes was associated with Conte and Korchemny. But I need to sit down with Dwain and find out the extent of their involvement.&quot; The very next morning he met Chambers privately. At that meeting, as Van Commenee stresses now, &quot;Dwain said he is not using any supplements or any sort or medication provided by Conte and there is no active involvement of, nor any meetings with, Korchemny. I reminded him Korchemny is banned from the sport. But you can&apos;t force people to keep their lips sealed.&quot; Conte and Korchemny might have their own surreal hunger for publicity; but any plea of victimisation from Chambers is undermined by him having instigated the current glut of stories. And so Van Commenee refuses to claim he has made a breakthrough which will resolve the whole miserable saga. He cannot issue Chambers with an ultimatum to avoid speaking to his former dope-dealer \u2013 for Conte is not banned and it would be impossible to police the situation constantly. &quot;I just stick to the facts \u2013 which are that Dwain has served his sentence, is eligible to compete in certain meets, is available to drugs-testers at all times and has not tested positive since coming back. However, beyond the facts there is the powerful force of perception.&quot; Van Commenee&apos;s difficulties with Chambers are plain. The sprinter has run blisteringly fast this year and yet he has been just as quick with his mouth. Chambers can be reflective, if given the space to address his doomed fall, but he has a tendency to babble when a microphone is pushed under his nose. It is not the disciplined way of Van Commenee \u2013 who would be able to defend Chambers more robustly if the former doper followed his victories with a stoical silence. &quot;If Dwain had the same\u00a0awareness about the consequences of perception as he has the talent to run fast, he would be in a different situation now - and so would the sport. I am concerned about Dwain and I am concerned about the sport - especially the perception people have of it. We all have a responsibility towards the sport, including Dwain.&quot; Van Commenee&apos;s thoughts would have been expressed more forcibly to Chambers than in the summary he offers me for public consumption: &quot;Dwain might do better if he not only runs fast but is also clear that he has broken with the past completely, especially with the people involved and advocates a strong anti-doping message. And he needs to be more modest. In fact he has a unique opportunity to send a very positive message.&quot; Yet it is difficult not to despair of Chambers&apos; capacity for generating trouble. Van Commenee seems surprised when hearing that Chambers claimed that other British sprinters lack his ambition. &quot;Is that what he said? I don&apos;t know. I need to spend time with them to make my own judgment. But if someone is locked up and limited in his number of competitions, like Dwain, then you&apos;re hungry. Maybe he is more eager to use his few opportunities.&quot; He shrugs more dubiously at Chambers&apos; boast that he will rival Usain Bolt this summer. &quot;60m indoors is very different from 100m. I don&apos;t believe making predictions is very professional. I stay away from it. If I was any good at it, I would spend time in a casino rather than here on a couch in Solihull.&quot; Van Commenee set a low target of five British medals in Turin \u2013 and the ensuing failure underlines the need for a shake-up. &quot;I was disappointed and, if there is another poor result [at the world championships] in Berlin, there will be real reason for me to worry. But let&apos;s talk again in May after I&apos;ve had six weeks away with the different elite athletes.&quot; His current target for 2012 is to match the previous best British Olympic performance. &quot;If you ignore those Olympics where there was a boycott, the finest results were in 1988 when British athletes won eight medals \u2013 even if none were gold. So eight medals in 2012, knowing how competition has increased globally, would be ambitious.&quot; The colour of the medals also matters, as Van Commenee showed in 2004 when he berated Sotherton as &quot;a wimp&quot; minutes after she had won bronze in the heptathlon at the Athens Olympics. If she had run one second quicker in the final 800 metres event she would have held on to a silver medal. &quot;It was the right thing to say but the wrong time,&quot; he admits. &quot;That was an occasion when my emotion took over because Kelly had been silly. You work hard for many years and you should not present a medal to your opponent like that.&quot; It is instructive that Sotherton and Lewis, with whom he shared an even more volatile coaching relationship, have been ardent supporters of his appointment. &quot;I feel honoured by that but they knew that 95 out of a hundred times my anger was controlled. It was meant to help them.&quot; Lewis has suggested that the sensitivity in Van Commenee&apos;s work is obscured by his infamous rows. And, intriguingly, he has been most successful when coaching women. After tracing his journey from a modest working-class background in Amsterdam, where his father was a manual worker and his mother an Indonesian immigrant, he is absorbing when recounting his coaching of the Chinese shot-putter Huang Zhihong and the Dutch long-jumper Sharon Jaklofsky. He began coaching Zhihong in 1993 when, as world champion, she broke free from the Chinese sports institute. &quot;It was one of my best performances actually,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I ended up teaching a 30-year-old Chinese woman how to cook rice! From the age of 13 she&apos;d been in this sports-school where, basically, they train, eat and sleep. She had never cooked a meal, fallen in love or done anything the rest of us would&apos;ve done when much younger. But she caught up, big time, and now she is a mum who lives in Australia and is a celebrity in China.&quot; In 1996, just before the Atlanta Olympics, he proved his close bond with Jaklofsky. &quot;She was treated unfairly by the Dutch federation and so I withdrew from the team \u2013 even though I was national coach. I had to be loyal to my own athlete and stick to my principles. This caused lots of controversy but I was happy to pay the price.&quot; Van Commenee paid his way to Atlanta \u2013 and steered Jaklofsky to the Olympic final. &quot;Interestingly,&quot; he says, &quot;four years before that I was removed from the Olympic village [in Barcelona] by the police after I had a row with the chef de mission. Now here I am, 17 years later, the chef de mission of an Olympic team. So I know these young coaches with fire in their belly. That fire is passion.&quot; At the age of 50 that fiery passion still burns inside him \u2013 and it means he will make the unpopular decisions required to alter the moribund state of British athletics. The smouldering volcano smiles quietly. &quot;I have no illusions that, when I step on the plane to fly home to Amsterdam one day, a red carpet will be laid out for me. I won&apos;t have too many friends left after my work here. But I will take the decisions I need to make British athletics much better than it is right now. I would not be true to myself if I did anything else.&quot;", "sentences": ["After tracing his journey from a modest working-class background in Amsterdam, where his father was a manual worker and his mother an Indonesian immigrant, he is absorbing when recounting his coaching of the Chinese shot-putter Huang Zhihong and the Dutch long-jumper Sharon Jaklofsky.", "&quot;I have no illusions that, when I step on the plane to fly home to Amsterdam one day, a red carpet will be laid out for me."], "title": "Big interview: Charles van Commenee", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/24/charles-van-commenee-dwain-chambers-interview", "tags": ["Dwain Chambers", "Athletics", "Sport", "Charles van Commenee"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-24T17:00:00Z", "article": "IT&apos;S NOT REALLY NEWS THAT HIS ENGLAND CAREER IS EFFECTIVELY OVER, IS IT?

Yes, this has really happened! He really couldn&apos;t do any training! Anyway, in Scotland, there&apos;s a Spurs defender who won&apos;t be predictably draping himself across a chaise longue all day like a poor man&apos;s Paul McGrath. Alan Hutton has had a broken paw since last November, yet he&apos;s quite happy to make his comeback in Scotland&apos;s 7-0 loss at the Amsterdam ArenA on sAturdAy. So well done him. That&apos;s just as well for Scotland manager George Burley, who has a list of withdrawals as long as his arm. (His arm is not particularly long, truth be told, but the length in question is still, while insubstantial in the context of limb measurement, worthy of note when referring to a series of names grouped together meaningfully to constitute a record.) That list already featured Kirk Broadfoot, David Weir, James McFadden, Shaun Maloney, Barry Robson, Kevin Thomson, Lee Miller, Garry O&apos;Connor, Ledley King, Dan&apos;l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, old Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all - and now also features Kris Commons, who has a jiggered calf. It&apos;s almost as bad as the usual Manchester United injury list, only everyone really is properly injured and there isn&apos;t \u00a3784bn worth of talent to step in. If that isn&apos;t bad enough for Burley, he&apos;s also hopeless, having not achieved a thing of note since guiding Ipswich to fifth place in 2000 - apart from setting Southampton on their inexorable downward spiral, that is. And if that isn&apos;t bad enough for Burley, Stephen McManus is likely to also withdraw, as he&apos;s got a swollen ankle. &quot;It&apos;s improving day by day but we don&apos;t think he&apos;ll play on Saturday, he is doubtful,&quot; confirmed Burley&apos;s aptly titled No2, Terry Butcher. &quot;But we are optimistic about his chances for the Iceland game at Hampden on Wednesday.&quot; Rangers&apos; uncapped full-back Steven Whittaker is likely to take the place of McManus.

Two of the remaining three central defenders in Burley&apos;s party, Christophe Berra and Darren Barr, have a combined four caps to their name.

If you want to beat the Dutch at any time you have to have the bottle to go out and play against them. &quot;We have to test them out, utilise the pace we have and the likes of Ferguson, Brown and Fletcher.

Maybe we could stay there for a little, since today is the 40th anniversary of John Lennon and Yoko Ono&apos;s infamous bed-in, a performance &quot;peace&quot; staged for the world&apos;s media. Now, I&apos;m maybe not the best person to talk about this, having remained thoroughly immune to the charms of Imagine all these years. Nonetheless, there is something here I think well worth a revisit. After their wedding ceremony in Gibraltar, Lennon and Ono travelled to Amsterdam, where, between 25 March and 31 March 1969, they staged what they called Bed-In for Peace. Each day, for a week, the couple invited the press into their hotel room. Ensconced in bed, they would politely answer questions about their decision to stage this event as a protest against the Vietnam war. If we see it as a one-off caprice, then the event can look remarkably like irrelevant self-indulgence. With memories still reasonably fresh of how ineffective the 2003 anti-war protest was, the idea that sitting in bed for a week might have caused Richard Nixon to revise his foreign policy looks a tad hopeful, to say the least. It might be more helpful, though, to view Bed-In as a point of convergence between the very different careers of Lennon and Ono. Lennon received a hefty dose of derision and bile from the media for his actions and pronouncements at this time. Ono, too, was despicably treated as a convenient screen on to which all and sundry could project their misery at the break-up of the Beatles. But this attention was seized upon as a necessary element in Bed-In, and the piece turned the media&apos;s insatiable craving for cultural fodder into a positive. It allowed the &quot;hairy hedonists&quot; to propose an alternative attitude to the &quot;active&quot; resistance that had, for example, resulted in the violent clashes in the previous year&apos;s Grosvenor Square anti-war demonstration. Looked at now, Lennon&apos;s words seem a perfectly rational commentary from someone who, while understandably distressed at certain aspects of reality, knew full well he couldn&apos;t do anything practical to alter them. This ineffectuality does not invalidate the sentiment, although Ono subsequently admitted that their presumption that the media would come to them because of Lennon&apos;s fame was perhaps somewhat narcissistic. In the work&apos;s title, &quot;peace&quot; is both what it means and a wordplay on &quot;piece&quot;, the word Ono uses to designate all her works. The bed-in followed 1964&apos;s Bag Piece, in which two people stay hidden within a large cloth bag performing whatever activities they choose. It has an obvious formal similarity to Bed-In, and Lennon apparently thought of it as a &quot;bag of laughs&quot; against the Vietnam war. In the pictures of the event, you can also see the word &quot;Bagism&quot; on the bedroom wall. Just as significant is Ono&apos;s 1966 performance Shadow Piece, in which she traced the outlines of 20 people lying on a strip of cloth laid out in London&apos;s Free School playground, a piece of land left derelict since its bombing in the war. Shadow Piece was performed as part of an event called Destruction in Art, and carried strong resonances of Ono&apos;s childhood memories of Hiroshima and the aftermath of the atomic bombing. At the end of an interview I once conducted with Ono at Tate Britain, she handed out \u2013 as she often does \u2013 fragments of a broken pot to members of the audience. These distributed shards offer the idealistic possibility that one day all those present could reassemble and put the vessel back together again.

If we could get a point in Holland, it would be a terrific result.&quot; The Dutch were already overwhelming favourites to defeat Scotland in the Group Nine game before the raft of injuries which have hindered Burley&apos;s plans.

The Tottenham Hotspur full-back could, though, play his first competitive match since November against Iceland. &quot;I am not looking to get Alan involved in Amsterdam but have an open view to Wednesday,&quot; said Burley. &quot;A fit, motivated Alan Hutton would get in most international sides. We will analyse his fitness levels to see if he is able to step in on Wednesday.&quot; If Hartley, Kris Commons, David Weir or Kirk Broadfoot improves, then they, too, will re-join the Scotland group at the start of the week. For the present the manager has adopted a sanguine attitude to squad disruption. &quot;I think you become immune to it,&quot; Burley said. &quot;There is no good worrying about it or being negative about it. We will take 23 players to Amsterdam and take it from there. You can&apos;t change luck, you just hope it goes with you. I&apos;m looking at how things will go with the players I have got; that is the only way I can look at it.&quot; Burley surprised many onlookers by volunteering yesterday that Allan McGregor, and not Craig Gordon, will keep goal against the Dutch. Gordon has recently been unable to dislodge Martin Fulop at Sunderland but, with 35 caps, has long been established as his country&apos;s No1. That situation has changed, for the time being at least, on the basis that the three-times-capped McGregor is playing weekly for Rangers. &quot;It was simply a decision made on the basis that Craig has not played, nothing else,&quot; Burley explained. &quot;I think there has been so much speculation, it was fairer to the two of them [to announce it early]. Now Allan can focus without people speculating over the rights and wrongs. &quot;It could have been an unnecessary distraction but there is nothing else to talk about now. The decision is made and we move on. Last season Allan was magnificent, I can&apos;t remember him making a mistake in all the games I watched. And he has again been in outstanding form of late.&quot; A rare display of anger emanated from Burley when it was implied to him that, unlike McGregor, the Scotland captain Barry Ferguson&apos;s form for Rangers has been somewhat below an acceptable standard. &quot;Barry Ferguson is an excellent player,&quot; said the former Ipswich, Hearts and Southampton manager tersely. &quot;There are a lot of comments made in the press that I don&apos;t agree with.

Cruyff, a three-time winner of Europe&apos;s premier trophy as a player with Ajax and again as the manager of Barcelona, feels a widening gap across the continent between the big clubs and the rest is \u00adharming football. Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea remain in this season&apos;s Champions League at the quarter-final stage. &quot;In England, there are four teams in the Champions League and just one in the Uefa Cup,&quot; he said. &quot;The gap is getting bigger all the time and that is bad for football. It has become all about resources, clubs can now buy so many players that 10 or 20 guys who could be top players elsewhere cannot play. This is a problem for a lot of countries; the top guys are only going to England, Italy or Spain.&quot; Cruyff is therefore a firm advocate of the &quot;six plus five&quot; proposals regarding homegrown talent in club football. &quot;That&apos;s what is needed,&quot; he stressed, adding that &quot;politic\u00adians have done a stupid job&quot; by allowing free movement across Europe. Holland&apos;s progress to the World Cup finals in South Africa is almost assured, they sit five points clear of Scotland and Iceland, having won their opening three Group Nine matches. Scotland&apos;s participation or otherwise in what would be their first major tournament in 12 years is somewhat less clear; a low-key start which has included defeat in Macedonia and a home draw with Norway has seen to that. Tomorrow night&apos;s match between Holl\u00adand and Scotland is therefore regarded as a foregone conclusion to many, but Cruyff offered some hope to George Burley and his players. Amusingly, for a man who played with such grace, his advice to the Scots is basic. &quot;Scotland in the air are very good,&quot; said the 61-year-old. &quot;Holland have got to play their game in short passes. Arjen Robben, for example, will not tackle. Holland cannot be dragged into a physical game, they will want to push the ball around because they are not a team who will go in for tackles. If Scotland can stop those passes, they have a chance. And the Dutch cannot give away any corners, or stupid free-kicks.&quot; Understandably, Cruyff lacks detailed knowledge of any of the players who will don dark blue in the Amsterdam Arena. He is perfectly aware, though, that the Dutch charges under Bert van Marwijk&apos;s guidance have an abundance of attacking riches. &quot;They have so many good forward players that they cannot get them all in the team,&quot; he explained. &quot;And, because of that, it means they always have a lot of strength on the substitutes&apos; bench. &quot;Klaas-Jan Huntelaar could not get in the team for a while because of Ruud Van Nistelrooy and because he was in an Ajax team who were not doing so well. Now he has gone to Real Madrid and scored eight times, which is fantastic.&quot; Cruyff remains well placed to assess Dutch international outfits having scored 33 goals in 48 appearances for his country. He was in Glasgow last night as the guest of honour at a Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice dinner and to publicise Setanta Sports&apos; live screening of tomorrow&apos;s sell-out match. Thankfully perhaps for Burley, Cruyff regards this Dutch team as &quot;different&quot; rather than superior to the one which trounced Scotland 6-0 in Amsterdam six years ago. &quot;I won&apos;t say it will be the same, no two games are the same. But Holland have a lot in their favour, they are at home and know what is at stake if they win.&quot; Despite the dark skies and howling winds which greeted him in Scotland, he will remain on these shores to watch the qualifier on television with his close friend Steve Archibald, with whom he formed an association at Barcelona. &quot;I think only two of the Holland players on Saturday will be based in their home league,&quot; he added. &quot;The other nine will be doing well abroad, which is such a major thing. They are a young team and a team who have done well in recent tournaments; confidence is very high. &quot;Holland have nine points now, they have the opportunity with the next two home games to get to 15 which will seal their qualification for South Africa. Beating Scotland would knock Holl\u00adand&apos;s main opponent out of the way, I think, and leave Scotland to fight with Iceland and Norway for second place.&quot;", "sentences": ["And the Dutch cannot give away any corners, or stupid free-kicks.&quot; Understandably, Cruyff lacks detailed knowledge of any of the players who will don dark blue in the Amsterdam Arena.", "Thankfully perhaps for Burley, Cruyff regards this Dutch team as &quot;different&quot; rather than superior to the one which trounced Scotland 6-0 in Amsterdam six years ago."], "title": "Football: Cruyff warns that widening gap between rich and poor clubs is hurting football", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/27/scotlandfootballteam-holland", "tags": ["Johan Cruyff", "Champions League 2008-09", "Scotland", "Holland", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Europa League", "Champions League", "Premier League", "Sport", "Uefa Cup 2008-09", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-27T10:19:28Z", "article": "A highly unlikely away victory, a win for the home side of more than four goals or a serious injury incurred by one of George Burley&apos;s key players. About the only three factors which would render Scotland&apos;s visit to the Amsterdam ArenA tomorrow night a meaningful one. The Tartan Army will of course descend on the Dutch capital in their thousands \u2013 more for the tourist spots than the football, one could assume \u2013 and interest has been intense on what is a high-profile World Cup qualifying fixture. Yet Burley&apos;s Scots realistically have far more at stake when Iceland visit Hampden on Wednesday. With those two nations currently tied second in the Group Nine table \u2013 albeit Iceland have played a game more \u2013 that is an encounter Scotland without question have to win. Anything else and progression to the finals in South Africa next summer would be an unattainable dream; Scotland could still finish second behind Holland, but would be odds-on to be the lowest scoring runners-up from the nine groups and therefore miss out on a playoff berth. In the context of this group, it is clear Holland will emerge as clear victors. Scotland&apos;s best hope, as was the case when the section draw was made, is to collect points from their nearest challengers to secure second. Hoping thereafter, of course, that Holland have little motivation for victory when they arrive at Hampden for the last game of the group on 9 September. If little is certain in football, Burley can at least rest assured that he will be castigated by certain sections of the Scottish media in the event of Holland beating his team convincingly. That will be the same Holland who took to pieces significantly better teams than Scotland during last summer&apos;s European Championships. That the current Scotland manager receives the kind of harsh press treatment which Berti Vogts was subjected to during his closing months in the job, but never afforded to Alex McLeish or Walter Smith, remains a source of intrigue. Scotland have not been sparkling under the former Ipswich, Derby, Hearts and Southampton manager&apos;s guidance but the days of Vogts are thankfully a distant memory. Gareth Williams and Robbie Stockdale are at Watford and Grimsby Town respectively, Berti. Only defeat in the morale-sapping category tomorrow would prove costly to the Scots. The last time they faced Holland on their own patch, in 2003, a wave of orange attacks saw them lose six. This will be different; Scotland had clearly angered their hosts on that occasion by beating them 1\u20130 in Glasgow in the first leg of the Euro 2004 playoffs and Holland were a team under serious pressure to perform, such was the antipathy towards them from the country&apos;s football-going public. In the current qualifying campaign Holland have won their three matches, but scraped past Norway and Macedonia. There is little evidence of an appetite for crushing the Scots. Hopes of an upset have been tempered by Burley&apos;s latest injury ills, a problem which has overshadowed each of his games in charge. Delighted his first-choice midfield is available, the manager has seen defenders drop like flies before the very game he needs a backline most. Stephen McManus&apos;s loss will be the most keenly felt, but the pace of Christophe Berra may compensate in part for the Celtic captain&apos;s absence. A point, by the manager&apos;s own admission, would represent a &quot;terrific&quot; return. But even he has also conceded thoughts have moved significantly towards Wednesday already. Having dropped two home points to Norway and having lost in Macedonia, defeat against the relative also-rans of Iceland would be disastrous. With that in mind, Burley should and will take no risks on the fitness of any other players and refrain from indulging in downbeat talk if the Dutch make it four wins from four. Two Scottish victories over France in the Euro 2008 campaign, while the stuff of legend at the time, proved ultimately worthless given points dropped elsewhere. The matter of injury is straightforward. Any victory would be tempered or defeat compounded by a wounded limb for Scott Brown, for example. For all concerned, if there is lasting damage to be incurred in Amsterdam, Burley and Scottish supporters must pray it goes no deeper than the loss of three points at one of the most daunting venues in the European game.

While it is a depleted unit that George Burley takes to the Amsterdam Arena, home to humiliation for Scotland on their last visit, the manager believes he can still call on the qualities that claimed the scalp of France when he seeks to repeat that stunning upset tonight. A siege mentality often suits Scotland against superior opponents; it has been enhanced prior to the meeting with Bert van Marwijk&apos;s gifted team by an injury list that few countries could withstand. &quot;Why shouldn&apos;t we repeat that performance against France?&quot; asked the Scotland captain, Barry Ferguson. &quot;There is enough quality in the squad to do it again.&quot; Ferguson will make his first competitive start under Burley, but his availability \u2013 and arguably his optimism \u2013 are exceptions for the Scotland manager. Not that he is approaching this formidable task with dread. &quot;Games are not won on paper and shocks do happen in football,&quot; Burley said. &quot;The Dutch have fantastic players but football is a team game and our strength as a nation is working together, scrapping for each other and fighting for the result. That is the only way we will get a result here. Nobody outside Scotland expects us to get anything here, so it would be tremendous to repeat the France result. It doesn&apos;t getting any bigger than managing your country in a World Cup in Amsterdam. It is the biggest game of my managerial career.&quot; Ferguson was also keen to revisit the spirit of Paris, insisting occasions like tonight&apos;s are precisely what has brought the best out of his national side in recent years. &quot;It is a fabulous stadium against a top team and these are the games you rise to,&quot; the captain said. &quot;Some of our best results in the past have come against the top sides: Italy, Holland at Hampden and obviously France.&quot; Three players will make their competitive debuts against the Netherlands should Burley add the Rangers defender Steven Whittaker to his starting line-up. The Scotland coach has confirmed that Allan McGregor, with three caps from friendlies to his name, will replace Craig Gordon in goal due to the regular No1&apos;s inactivity at Sunderland. Christophe Berra, with three substitute appearances totalling 34 minutes so far, has to be given his first start in a defence weakened by injury. Whittaker is a possible inclusion in midfield. Burley is expected to adopt the same 4-1-4-1 system that brought such reward for Scotland in Paris, when they beat France 1-0 in September 2007, but that is where the similarities end. Alex McLeish, the then Scotland manager, had an embarrassment of riches compared to those his successor finds himself with in Amsterdam. Of the 11 players who started at Parc des Princes, only four are likely to play against the Netherlands: Graham Alexander, Scott Brown, Ferguson and Darren Fletcher. The rest are either injured, recovering from injury, out of favour at their clubs or, in the case of Lee McCulloch, retired from international football. If Burley has overseen a revolution since that heady September night, it is not one he would have chosen. Optimism has evaporated, and it is the 6-0 mauling that Scotland suffered on their last visit to Amsterdam, for the European Championship play-offs in 2003, that dominates talk among the Tartan Army, not Paris. A point would not represent a bonus for Scotland tonight but a revelation, a result to rival the victory over France. It is why Burley has openly admitted that next Wednesday&apos;s home game with Iceland will have more bearing on qualification for South Africa than the visit to Group 9&apos;s front-runners, and why his comments have been accepted as realistic rather than defeatist. There is, however, urgent need to put more points on the board as Scotland strive to become one of the eight runners-up who will contest the play-offs for 2010. Of the nine second-placed teams in the European qualifying division, Burley&apos;s team are currently ninth on points. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve been negative at all. I am an optimist, but I&apos;m also realistic,&quot; said Burley. &quot;We are not going to out-pass the Dutch but we can give them other problems. Football is not all about skill. It is also about heart and strength of character, and we have plenty of that.&quot;", "sentences": ["While it is a depleted unit that George Burley takes to the Amsterdam Arena, home to humiliation for Scotland on their last visit, the manager believes he can still call on the qualities that claimed the scalp of France when he seeks to repeat that stunning upset tonight.", "It doesn&apos;t getting any bigger than managing your country in a World Cup in Amsterdam.", "Alex McLeish, the then Scotland manager, had an embarrassment of riches compared to those his successor finds himself with in Amsterdam.", "Optimism has evaporated, and it is the 6-0 mauling that Scotland suffered on their last visit to Amsterdam, for the European Championship play-offs in 2003, that dominates talk among the Tartan Army, not Paris."], "title": "Scotland hope for passion of Paris against Holland", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/28/scotland-holland-world-cup-qualifier", "tags": ["Scotland", "Holland", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-28T12:48:00Z", "article": " Preamble Hello. Accepting a freebie in Amsterdam probably isn&apos;t to be encouraged, but that&apos;s how Scotland should perceive tonight&apos;s game. In the Premier League, the Little 16 generally perceived games against the Big Four in such a way: you&apos;ll almost certainly lose, so anything&apos;s a bonus. It&apos;s the same here. For Scotland the biggest game of this double-header is, by far, Iceland at home (disconcertingly scheduled for April 1). Holland have basically won how Group 9, so it&apos;s a race for the second place that will almost certainly guarantee a play-off. This said, Wales could have adopted a similar attitude in 1997 but they would surely have been scarred by a 7-1 pasting in which, absurdly, Neville Southall was the Man of the Match. Scotland, of course, were cleaned up 6-0 by the Dutch in a Euro 2004 play-off (why not kick back and savour Scott Murray&apos;s considerable pain during that game by clicking here), with a stronger side than this injury-ravaged collective. I don&apos;t know what the point of all this is; I&apos;m just rambling now. Lalalala. Holland to win 3-0.  So, it&apos;s Holland v Scotland, which means I&apos;m contractually obliged to link to this. The funny thing is that Gemmill wasn&apos;t even a first choice at the start of the tournament; nor was Graeme Souness. Scotland&apos;s midfield two were Bruce Rioch and Don Masson.  Team news nicked from the wires Ross McCormack and Gary Teale were the surprise inclusions for Scotland in tonight&apos;s World Cup qualifier against Holland in the Amsterdam ArenA. Cardiff striker McCormack, making his first start to earn his second cap, was asked by manager George Burley to support lone striker Kenny Miller from a wide position. Derby player Teale was the other wide man, leaving skipper Barry Ferguson, Darren Fletcher and Scott Brown to try and win the centre midfield battle as Burley combined Gary Caldwell and Christophe Berra together for the first time at the heart of the defence. Holland were unsurprisingly strong favourites. The Group Nine leaders were looking to make it four consecutive wins in the campaign and manager Bert van Marwijk had Real Madrid striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar leading the line, supported by a powerful trio of Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Dirk Kuyt.  Susanne van Kampen drinks beer, sends email &quot;Well, i like to follow the Guardian sports section, but ehm I forgot what I was going to..Oh right! But I never send emails to, well to anyone really. I twitter instead. That&apos;s a joke. Anyway, I had fun with the Scots today, in Amsterdam. They gave me good beer. And lots. For free. Because I&apos;m a girl. They don&apos;t wear underwear. And we made a bet, which I am sure to win, obviously. ME LIKES SCOTLAND! And quite drunk already, I look forward to the Beautiful Game produced by Holland. Am I being nationalistic now? I hope not. I&apos;m a girl and I just love that weird orange and washed up blue socks. Should finish drunk message now.  (btw, aren&apos;t you impressed wiht how good my English is, after a full day of Scots surrounding me and trying to get me drunk?)&quot;  Another email &quot;Just read, against my will, this month&apos;s copy of my particular industry&apos;s monthly magazine,&quot; says Mac Millings, idly flicking through his copy of Fluffer&apos;s Weekly. &quot;Apparently, one way to &apos;beat negativity&apos; is to replace &apos;have to&apos; with &apos;get to&apos;. So I tried it. Oddly, saying out loud, &apos;I get to read this month&apos;s copy of my particular industry&apos;s monthly magazine&apos; only made it worse.&quot;  Those teams Holland (4-2-3-1) Stekelenburg; Van Der Wiel, Mathijsen, Ooijer, Van Bronckhorst; Van Bommel, De Jong; Kuyt, Van Persie, Robben; Huntelaar.Subs: Timmer, Boulahrouz, Braafheid, Van der Vaart, Sneijder, Afellay, Schaars.  Scotland (4-1-4-1) McGregor; Alexander, Berra, Caldwell, Naysmith; Brown; McCormack, Darren Fletcher, Ferguson, Teale; Miller. Subs: Gordon, Barr, Hutton, Steven Fletcher, Iwelumo, Morrison, Rae.  The atmosphere is absolutely brilliant, possibly for the reasons outlined by Susanne van Kampen earlier.  1 min Holland kick off from right to left, with Scotland in white.  2 min &quot;Other uses of &apos;get to&apos; that your readers might want to use to add positivity to their lives,&quot; begins Mac Millings.&quot;I get to go to work on Sunday with a stampeding hangover.I get to tell my girlfriend I&apos;m cheating on her.I get to inform my sister that our dad just died.&quot;  3 min Scotland start with hustle and bristle, apparently determined to press the ball fairly high up the pitch - at least as high as the halfway line. That&apos;s an admirable but risky and taxing strategy.  4 min I got the Holland formation wrong. It&apos;s actually 4-2-3-1, with Kuyt and Robben wide and Van Persie in the hole behind Huntelaar.  5 min &quot;Although most of the signs do point to a hiding for the Scots tonight, there are more than a few straws to clutch,&quot; says Lou Roper, dropping them everywhere. &quot;1. the Dutch defence is poor; 2. do they have no one better than Giovanni van Bronckhorst? 3. can Robben and van Persie play in the same team?; 4. Huntelaar, notwithstanding his recent form, is rubbish; 5. Berti Vogts is not the Scotland manager.&quot; Agree on all of those. So 3-0 Holland it is.  6 min No Dutch pressure of note yet; apart from not touching the round thing, Scotland will be pleased with their start.  7 min Scott Brown, a very underrated player I think, is haring round with all sorts of intent. I bet he has a really, really hairy backside. In other news, Huntelaar has a pop from 20 yards; a deflection takes the sting out of it and it bobbles through to McGregor.  8 min &quot;I &apos;get&apos; to say: why the heck doesn&apos;t Sneijder play?&quot; says &apos;S&apos;. &quot;Ok, I know he plays for the wrong team (Real Madrid) but surely, he&apos;s more...let&apos;s say...mature than Robben?&quot; Tell that to their hairlines.  10 min Scotland have started really well from a defensive point of view, asphyxiating the Dutch in the central areas just past the halfway line.  11 min &quot;I get to work the bar at a function (alone, because noone else has turned up) while unable to watch football,&quot; begins Niall Harden. &quot;The only three CDs soundtracking this function are James Blunt, Simply Red and (seriously) Riverdance. Later I get to make my way home through an apparently quite rowdy south Belfast. Life&apos;s amazing! Thanks Mac!&quot;  12 min The first hint of trouble for Scotland. Robben zig-zags down the left, troubling Alexander, and then drills over an early cross to Van Persie 15 yards out, but he mistimes his volley and it spins behind him.  13 min Big chance for Scotland. Miller broke the offside trap as he ran onto a cute chip over the top from Fletcher; his first touch was really good but then, with only Stekelekekekekekekelekenburg to beat he showed all the urgency of a man trying to decide whether to have white or brown bread before work, taking a further three touches and allowing Mathijsen to slide round and smother. That had to be just one touch to control, another to set it up and then a strike at goal. What a chance that was!  16 min Scotland are playing really well, and have won a couple of corners in the last few minutes. The little victories.  17 min Robben runs onto a long pass from Kuyt down the right. As he comes infield Berra slips over, and that allows Robben to take a further touch and then shoot at goal from the edge of the box. He skies it, but on a couple of occasions now he has offered a thrilling penetration.  18 min &quot;On a night when much has been made of England&apos;s new bowls kit, I&apos;d like to compliment the Scotland strip, which is rocking the &apos;heavy metal&apos; font on the back,&quot; notes Ben Beresford.  19 min De Jong is booked for an unpleasant sliding challenge on Ferguson. Scotland are playing excellently here.  20 min At the moment, Ferguson, Fletcher and Brown are controlling De Jong, Van Bommel and Van Persie, although Brown got away with one there after missing a sliding tackle and taking down tthe marauding Robben 35 yards out.  21 min &quot;Me again,&quot; hics Susanne van Kampen. &quot;Ok, now I am enjoying the kilts more than the game. Btw; England&apos;s new kits are worse than the Dutch ones. That&apos;s impressive. -Robben is crying again...Poor fella..-&quot;  22 min That&apos;s another late challenge, this time by van Bommel on Naysmith. He isn&apos;t booked but it&apos;s a reflection of how well Scotland are playing that Holland are having to put the boot in.  23 min &quot;Germany is likely to be world champions 2010,&quot; says our friend &apos;S&apos;. &quot;Can I begin to cry, right now?&quot; Don&apos;t let me stop you. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be weeping warm droplets over something before the night&apos;s out.  25 min Ever get that feeling that things are all going a bit too well?  26 min Robben is the main threat here and no mistake. What a brilliant, direct player he can be. It&apos;s such a shame that he&apos;s, y&apos;know, him.  28 min What wonderful play from Robben. Van Bommel arrowed a marvellous 60-yard pass to the left, and Robben - having dummied to control the ball while standing still - killed the ball and zipped past Scott Brown with just one touch. Then he surged past a desperate sliding challenge from Caldwell to get to the byline inside the six-yard box, but McGregor came out to block Robben&apos;s attempted cut-back. The disguise on that first touch, and then the acceleration, were glorious: he went from 0-100 in about half a second.  GOAL! Holland 1-0 Scotland (Huntelaar 30) Such a simple goal. Van Bommel, maybe 35 yards out and right of centre, had far, far too much time to look up and curl a cross - a pass, really - to the far post, where Holland had two-on-one. Van Persie occupied Caldwell, and that allowed the unmarked Huntelaar to simply plant his header across McGregor and in from six yards. From Scotland&apos;s point of view that&apos;s not a very good goal to give away. In fact it&apos;s an effing miserable one.  32 min It&apos;s over, you don&apos;t need to tell me.  33 min &quot;I&apos;m not drunk but I am Dutch and very erm.. annoyed at Van Marwijk,&quot; says Ellen. &quot;He plays Gio (who&apos;s been very rubbish for a generally very rubbish Feyenoord all season) rather than the very quick and very excellent Braafheid who plays for the generally excellent this season Twente, and as a result Scotland continue to create danger on the right. Then he plays Dirk Kuyt on the right and decides to leave Sneijder out and as a result Holand have no-one in midfield to dictate play. Yeh we&apos;ve just scored and will probably win and all that will do is gloss over the annoying good-for-nothing conservatism of our manager. I guess I should be more upbeat about us winning shouldn&apos;t I.&quot; Well, positivity never goes amiss - unless you&apos;re, y&apos;know, English - but it sounds like a fair complaint. Also, why aren&apos;t there any AZ players in the team? They play the shexy football, non?  36 min Now it&apos;s all Holland: not in a the-second-one&apos;s-in-the-post way, but just that rhythmic, cocky retention of possession. See that nice round white, thing? See it? See it? You want it? Nah, you can&apos;t have it.  37 min &quot;The farmer scored!&quot; shrieks Susanne van Kampen. &quot;Yes! He&apos;s a new van Nis.........You knnow what? I&apos;m just gonna turn down my computer now, it&apos;s just,,. I a too drunk.. i have to prematurely celebrate my bet vicotry! YAY! 10 euros for me! ... I hope. anyway,I enjoyed the kilts.&quot; Given that they were wearing no underwear, I&apos;m not surprised.  38 min &quot;What are the odds on Kenny Miller scoring?&quot; says Lou Roper. &quot;Is there a more feeble striker playing for any European nation (aside from Huntelaar, notwithstanding his goal tonight)?&quot; Not today, but with all the injuries Michael Owen might get a game on Wednesday.  39 min Scotland put two passes together since the goal, and then they make three, and then Gary Teale - who has looked out of his depth, in truth - fails to get past Van der Wiel.  42 min Van Bommel - who should have been booked by now - takes down Brown from behind and then offers an apology. The look of bewilderment on Van Bommel&apos;s face as Brown responds, presumably with barely comprehensible vitriol, is a picture.  44 min &quot;Well Rob,&quot; says Ellen of my question in the 33rd minute, &quot;for as long as I can remember, being rubbish for a traditional top three side gets you into the Dutch national team if you&apos;ve shown an ability to fart in the right direction, while playing like Pele in his good years for a club outside the traditional top three often isn&apos;t enough to get you capped. You can tell by now that I&apos;m a frustrated Twente fan can&apos;t you. By the way, I&apos;ll gladly agree that Robben is an annoying so-and-so, but so far he&apos;s the only player that makes this game worth watching.&quot;  GOAL! Holland 2-0 Scotland (Van Persie 45) That&apos;s a killer. In the second and final minute of added time, Van Persie runs between Fletcher and Alexander before soaring to head Robben&apos;s inswinging corner past McGregor from five yards. That, again, was far too easy. McGregor couldn&apos;t come because Kuyt was blocking him. I think Scotland might have been zonal marking: certainly Van Persie had 10 yards&apos; worth of momentum, whereas Fletcher and Alexander were stationary. Not that it mattered, as they were nowhere near him anyway.  Half time: Holland 2-0 Scotland That&apos;s a pretty frustrating half for Scotland. For so much of it they played sensible, streetwise football - Allan McGregor hasn&apos;t really made a save - but they gave away two desperately poor goals and have no chance now. See you in 15 minutes.  Half-time chit-chat, with your host Mac Millings &quot;Rob, re: &apos;I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be weeping warm droplets over something before the night&apos;s out&apos; (23 min). &apos;Something&apos; is not a gentlemanly way to describe the unfortunate girl you&apos;ll be luring into tonight&apos;s Smyth Web Of ABV-sharpened misery.&quot; Homophobe.  46 min Scotland kick off. They are not going to enjoy the next 45 minutes, are they?  48 min &quot;Good grief Rob, two MBM back to back, this can&apos;t be the weekend you were so looking forward to yesterday during the ODI?&quot; says Hans Deenen. &quot;Or are you indeed the masochist I always suspected you to be?&quot; If I was a masochist, surely I would prefer to be out doing socialising and doing attempting to talk to girls, such is the inevitable pain and misery that results from said activity.  49 min The camera cuts to Bert van Marwijk, the Dutch coach, who is sitting with his legs absurdly far apart. I hope those are expensive, well-made trousers, because if not he&apos;ll be hearing a rip from below any second now.  50 min It&apos;s as it was for the last 15 minutes of the first half: Holland keeping the ball, Scotland struggling to keep pace with the shadows, never mind the players.  51 min Robben bursts past Naysmith with absurd ease on the right. His pull-back finds Kuyt, whose 12-yard shot deflects off the boot Alexander and goes just wide of the far post.  52 min &quot;What are the odds on Kenny Miller getting a brace tonight?&quot; says Lou Roper. &quot;Has anyone bothered to set odds on this rarity?&quot; No, of course not, because such an idea would even make this little fella laugh.  54 min A good one-two between Brown and Miller so very nearly ends with Brown having a chance to shoot from the edge of the box. Instead Scotland win a corner, but it&apos;s a poor one from McCormack.  56 min The obvious temptation is for Scotland to go to 4-4-2, but if they do that they could get completely battered.  57 min He&apos;s back! &quot;Evening Rob - due to work and family obligations, I have missed most of the sport over the last couple of days,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Apart from missing my chance to get to read Mac Millings&apos; e-mails, I feel somewhat undeprived, especially as the only sport I did see was Albie Morkel smearing some very green Australian bowlers all over the High Veldt. This afternoon must have been dull and surely this is a foregone conclusion being played out?&quot; What he said. I enjoyed the England game, though, mainly because Rooney brought back memories of a time when we genuinely thought he was going to rule the world.  59 min Marvellous play from Robben again. He came infield from the right, played a one-two with Huntelaar and then shaped one towards the far corner from 22 yards. McGregor leapt to save reasonably comfortably in the end, but it was wonderful play from Robben.  61 min Holland are toying with Scotland, who look shattered. This could easily end 4-0 or 5-0.  64 min Sneijder replaces van Persie, who clashed heads with Berra. No need for any tactical readjustments.  66 min  69 min Robben should have scored there. Van der Wiel&apos;s cross from the right was flicked on by Huntelaar to Robben, beyond the far post and maybe eight yards out. But he struck his volley into the ground and I&apos;m not sure it was going in even before Caldwell headed it over his own crossbar.  70 min &quot;I predict the Dutch media will slaughter Van Marwijk tomorrow: the football is awful,&quot; says Ellen. &quot;How on earth we keep on winning no-one knows. By the way Pi-Air van Hooijdonk is co-commentating on Dutch telly and contributing nothing.&quot; You Dutch really do have high standards don&apos;t you? You should try having our football team and Jamie Redknapp. But yes, Holland have, with the exception of Robben, been pedestrian tonight. But that&apos;s all they&apos;ve needed to be.  71 min Steven Fletcher replaces Kenny Miller.  73 min &quot;Finally Sneijder,&quot; says &apos;S&quot;. &quot;He&apos;s (...sexy penetrating word...) good! Sorry Robin v Persie had to go though. Yes: the v is NOT CAPITALIZED, contrary to...err. anyway, I agree with Ellen. She&apos;s right about Braafheid. I agree with the drunk chick too...Wish I&apos;d made a 10 euro bet.&quot; I wish I was on what you lot are on.  74 min Alan Hutton, out for four months, replaces Alexander, another like-for-like substitution.  75 min: Scotland have a goal disallowed And it&apos;s nonsense, too. Caldwell rose beautifully at the far post to thump McCormack&apos;s left-wing corner into the net, but by then the referee had blown his whistle, I think for a foul on the goalkeeper. Having seen the replay, that&apos;s very harsh. That&apos;s a desperately poor decision, in fact.  GOAL! Holland 3-0 Scotland (Kuyt 77 pen) Insult, injury, etc. De Jong&apos;s reverse pass finds Huntelaar, who is taken down from the side by Berra. No arguments with that decision, and Kuyt tucks the penalty low to the left as McGregor dives the wrong way.  79 min &quot;But Dutch Ellen...She&apos;s right!&quot; says the increasingly ramshackle &apos;S&apos;. &quot;About Pi-air and evertyhing. I&apos;ve fallen in love just now. With Ellen. Not with you Rob.&quot; Ah, that familar sound of restraining orders being typed.  80 min A double Dutch substitution: Afellay and Schaars replace Huntelaar, booked moments earlier for a dry-hump on Hutton, and De Jong.  81 min &quot;Incidentally, do you know that the sport homepage says I can follow this game with Roby Smyth,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;Is this your new moniker then?&quot; Yes, but only because they won&apos;t allow me to use &apos;Bronze Cheese&apos;.  84 min Scotland keep the ball for a bit. Nothing happens.  85 min James Morrison replaces Gary Teale. He tried very hard, as all the Scots have, but he was out of his element.  88 min It&apos;s all over bar the peep-peeping.  Full time: Holland 3-0 Scotland The scoreline is entirely predictable, but Scotland deserved a little better: they coped well for long, long periods of this game, and had a goal scandalously disallowed at 2-0, but of course Holland&apos;s superior class told in the key moments.

They said the killing of a former arms and drugs trafficker, whose body was found in an Amsterdam canal, had been ordered by an Irish gangland boss. Dutch police confirmed this weekend that they had discovered the remains of a 30-year-old Dubliner, who they believe was dumped in a canal three weeks ago. Garda sources have named the victim as Keith Ennis. The gruesome discovery has brought the Dublin gangland death toll to 11 in 2009. Garda sources said they believed Ennis was abducted and killed on the orders of a gangster with an extremely violent reputation. The gang boss had suspected him of working for the Garda, they added. Ennis is understood to have fled to the Netherlands at the end of last year fearing he would be unmasked as an informant. He was known as a suspected gun and drug dealer and had been charged a year and a half ago after \u20ac100,000 worth of drugs and five firearms were recovered in Dublin. The Garda and the Dutch police are now trying to establish where he was killed. Ennis was only identified through his DNA and fingerprints after Dutch police contacted the Garda. The gangster whom Garda sources believe ordered Ennis&apos;s death has been behind the killings of at least six men in Dublin&apos;s ongoing gang wars. Ennis, of Oakway, Clondalkin, absconded while on bail after being charged with possession of cocaine and a Glock semi-automatic pistol in November 2007. He was thought to be a one-time associate of one of the biggest drug gangs in Dublin, which included former members of the Irish National Liberation Army and the now defunct Irish People&apos;s Liberation Organisation. The gang has close links with former Irish drug dealers now based in the Netherlands who are believed to have tracked Ennis down. So far, all of the 11 Dublin gangland murders since the start of 2009 remain unsolved. However, garda\u00ed in the Kevin Street District have sent files to the director of public prosecutions in relation to the murder of &quot;Champagne&quot; Johnny Carroll, shot dead in at a pub in The Coombe on 18 February. More than 20 people have been arrested in relation to that murder, and last week garda\u00ed arrested and questioned a 61-year-old man related to the prime suspect. Garda sources said that Ennis&apos;s body had been dismembered. This is the first time this is known to have happened in an Irish gangland killing. The gang responsible for the Ennis murder is one of the most violent in Dublin, according to Garda sources. Meanwhile, the other main centre of Irish gang warfare, Limerick City, remains relatively quiet since the accidental death of Philip Collopy last weekend. The gangster aligned to the Keane-Collopy gang in the city shot himself during what he thought was a mock-game of Russian roulette. Collopy had remembered to pull out the magazine of his Glock semi-automatic pistol and put the weapon to his head but he had forgotten that a single round was still inside the gun when he pulled the trigger. It is understood that a teenager was filming the stunt on a mobile phone at the time when the gun was discharged. Collopy was buried last week in the flak jacket he wore for protection against his gang&apos;s main rivals, the Dundon-McCarthy gang. Last week in a move to calm tensions in the city, the Dundon-McCarthy families sent a message of condolence to the Keane-Collopy gang over Collopy&apos;s death.", "sentences": ["They said the killing of a former arms and drugs trafficker, whose body was found in an Amsterdam canal, had been ordered by an Irish gangland boss."], "title": "Irish gang killings spread overseas", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/29/irish-gang-killing", "tags": ["Ireland", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z", "article": "Letter of the week Q I&apos;m doing a three-week tour of Peru and Bolivia in May and have a day free at each end in Lima. I would really like to explore the city, but I&apos;ve scared myself to death with dire warnings of &quot;express kidnappings&quot;, dodgy taxis and the like after reading the Foreign Office advice. I would really appreciate your advice on how best to get around safely as a solo traveller.Ian Wollaston, Wolverhampton A You&apos;re certainly not alone in being concerned for your safety in Lima, but most visits are trouble-free. There is a risk of opportunistic theft or mugging, as there is in every large city in South America. However, tourists are very seldom caught up in anything more serious than that. Statistically, you are at more risk of being involved in a car accident.  That&apos;s not to say you don&apos;t need to be careful and sensible. Valuables of any kind - apart from your passport, which you should keep with you in a security wallet - should be left behind, locked in your luggage or in a safe. Avoid carrying a camera or wearing an expensive watch, and don&apos;t gawp conspicuously at maps. It is a good idea to make sure you have booked accommodation in advance and arranged an airport pick-up if this is not included in your tour. You can read reports from other travellers who have been as concerned as you and enjoyed a trouble-free trip to Lima at Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree discussion board (thorntree.lonelyplanet.com). Q We&apos;re going to a birthday party in Groningen in the Netherlands in September and thought we could spend a few days in the area. We live in Stoke-on-Trent and would rather not travel to Gatwick or Heathrow. Can we fly from the north of England and, if so, do we have to fly to Amsterdam or are there flights to other Dutch cities? We hope to see Het Loo Palace and the Gardens of Appeltern. What else would you recommend? Sarah Akhtar, by email A Groningen is in the north-east of the Netherlands - not to be confused with the province of Noord-Holland, the peninsula to the north of Amsterdam. Groningen itself is a buzzing city of 185,000 people and will keep you busy for a few days. The Groninger Museum opposite the station, the Wall House gallery and tongue-twisting Noordelijk Scheepvaartmuseum are cultural highlights. You can find more suggestions at toerisme.groningen.nl/english.  For something completely different, take a train and bus to Pieterburen, which is the world capital of wadlopen (mudflat-walking). From May to September you can take short or long treks through the tidal goo in the company of a trained guide (see wadlopen.org).  Het Loo Palace is a 90-minute drive from Groningen, and Appeltern is an hour further, offering two obvious highlights if you wished to hire a car. The best website for further planning is holland.com. The only flight from the UK to Groningen is from Aberdeen with bmi, but you can connect through north-east Scotland from Manchester. Fares on this route start at \u00a3169 one way, \u00a3338 return, including taxes. You can fly to Amsterdam from a choice of northern airports, including Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds (from \u00a373 return with bmibaby or KLM), and from there take the train to Groningen. Q We are planning a trip to Cape Town for September and would really like to spend some time in the townships, to get a flavour of how the majority of South Africans live. We&apos;ve heard about township B&amp;Bs. How do these work and are there any you would recommend?Hannah Smith, Hackney A Township B&amp;Bs can give a fantastic insight into everyday life, and show you a different side of Cape Town from the City Bowl or well-to-do seaside suburbs. You&apos;ll see similar things to what&apos;s included in a township tour, but at your own pace, and you&apos;ll be able to tap into the host&apos;s network of contacts. Many township B&amp;Bs or homestays offer cooking courses, walking tours and volunteering opportunities. Often you&apos;ll be staying in comfy modern homes like Malebo&apos;s (00 27 21 361 2391; malebos.com; \u00a318 per person per night) and seeing poorer areas of townships on guided excursions.  Q My girlfriend is 21 in October and has her heart set on a trip to New York. We are unsure exactly what to do while we are there - or where to stay, for that matter. We are planning to go for between four and seven days, with a budget of \u00a32,500.Craig Scott, by email A You can find dozens of October flights on this competitive route. Try British Airways, Heathrow to JFK for \u00a3305.70 return at Opodo (opodo.co.uk). The next decision is where to stay - hotels in Manhattan were expensive even before the rise of the dollar against the pound. A Midtown location works for many people on their first visit. Gershwin Hotel (00 1 212 545 8000; gershwinhotel.com) has colourful art-filled rooms to suit all budgets: a standard room costs from $179. If you&apos;re staying a while give them a ring and see if there&apos;s a better rate going. Midtown is prime shopping territory and well-placed for the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station and Central Park. Or you could take an alternative bird&apos;s-eye view from Top of the Rock (topoftherocknyc.com) on the roof of the Rockefeller Centre.  The subway can take you to Brooklyn Bridge, downtown for the Staten Island Ferry and the various neighbourhoods of lower Manhattan, as well as uptown to the Metropolitan Museum, the Frick Collection and other cultural highlights. Brooklyn is a fast-changing borough, and exploring Brooklyn Heights and Prospect Park is a great way to see another side of the city. For your girlfriend&apos;s actual birthday, dress up and go for cocktails at the Rainbow Room (rainbowroom.com). Readers&apos; suggestions for a first trip to New York are welcome. Feedback This time last year I saw the northern lights from Sweden&apos;s Abisko Mountain Station, a hostel in a national park 250km north of the Arctic Circle. Flights from Manchester to Stockholm cost around \u00a3125 and it was roughly the same again for the overnight sleeper to Abisko. A large room in the clean, quiet, well-equipped self-catering block costs \u00a350-\u00a360; rooms in the hotel-style main building cost more.

Itchy eyes, sneezing attacks that practically floor me and mysterious aches in my joints. And yet there&apos;s barely a leaf on a tree. The joint ache is worse in the early morning when I lie in bed wondering if this is body-wide arthritis and contemplate hip-replacement surgery. However, as soon as I get up, the aches disappear - almost. My theory is that this is not some latent heralding of spring but a case of poisoning - I am being poisoned by London where I&apos;ve now lived for more than a quarter of a century. I look at the window sill outside my study, dark with a fine-grained, dusty powder - pollution falling from London&apos;s sky. I wipe it clean and two days later it&apos;s back again. I&apos;ve been breathing this stuff into my lungs for more than 25 years and I believe it&apos;s created in me a form of hypersensitivity - a subdued, near-permanent, minor-allergy problem - summer or winter, it doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;ve come to consider it as a tax my body has to pay if I want to live in London; I wonder if I&apos;ll feel better in Vienna. I go to Vienna, a city I have a strange obsession for, to research my next novel. I have a novel coming out in September but I find that, as I wait for one to appear, it&apos;s a good idea to begin preparing your next. Good for literary morale; a helpful pre-emptive measure against slowly mounting pre-publication anxiety. Vienna is an extraordinary city, astonishingly beautiful and unchanged. Lift your eyes from street level and it&apos;s time travel. Archways, street corners and cobbled alleys offer glimpses and tableaux of buildings and rooftops that, you feel, would still be familiar to Mozart or Musil or Wittgenstein - or Adolf Hitler, come to that. Vienna is full of ghosts. I pay my usual visit of homage to the Leopold Museum in the Museum Quarter to look at its huge collection of Egon Schiele. Poor, tormented Egon Schiele, dead at 28 from the influenza pandemic that swept Europe in 1918 - another of Vienna&apos;s ghosts - and, thinking about great artists who died young (Keats, Shelley, Mozart, Wilfred Owen, Schubert, Jimi Hendrix), I can&apos;t help wondering what marvels Schiele might have achieved had he been allowed even another couple of decades to live and work. There are tremendous Schiele drawings in the Leopold, exhibiting a graphic line of complete confidence - bold and unhesitant. As Robert Hughes, the great art critic, sagely pointed out, it is the ability to draw well that licenses all subsequent formal experiment in art. Starting with experiment is an evasion of responsibility, not to say a cop-out. I am staying at the incomparable Hotel Sacher behind the opera house. Perhaps it&apos;s the Sacher&apos;s discreet pleasures that are making me feel so en forme - all London&apos;s contaminations exhaled. I decide to walk to the Freud Museum in Berggasse. Going down in the lift, I am joined by a young, smartly dressed woman. We exchange a polite &quot;Guten Morgen&quot; before I am overwhelmed - by her perfume. She must have emptied half a bottle over herself and my London hypersensitivity goes into overdrive. By the time we reach the ground floor, my sneezing spasm is out of control and I am trying not to breathe. My lift companion flees the second the door opens. I wipe my streaming eyes and compose myself. It can&apos;t be long before perfume is banned like smoking, I reason, as a health hazard. In fact, I think that even now some prescient corporations in Los Angeles are forbidding their employees to come to work perfumed. After-shave is just as noxious - my hypersensitivity is not sexist.  Recovering, I saunter to the Freud Museum along streets that he would have recognised instantly. The museum is, in fact, the apartment where Freud lived and worked for decades before he left Vienna in 1938 as the Nazis arrived.  I am able to wander through Freud&apos;s waiting room, consulting room and study, alone. The walls are a vivid terracotta and the floor is parquet. There are a few bits of furniture, memorabilia and artefacts and many photographs, but the interest lies in the scale of the rooms themselves, their layout and juxtaposition. You can imagine arriving for your appointment with Herr Dr Freud, climbing the stairs with their etched glass windows, going through the right hand door on the landing, hanging your coat on that hook, sitting - apprehensively? eagerly? - on that couch in the waiting room, watching for the consulting room door to open and your session to begin. Judging from photographs, Berggasse still looks very much as it might have at the turn of the 20th century (minus motor cars) and the apartment is spookily Freudian.  Just why your neuroses might have evolved in your pre-conscious infant state is another matter, but in Freud&apos;s apartment you do sense the origins of the revolution that was psychoanalysis. To the Cafe Sperl for lunch and a drink. Vienna has the best large cafes in the world, perhaps, rivalling Paris and Amsterdam. Places where you can stay for hours, eating simply and well, drinking, reading newspapers, watching the world come and go. Posters are displayed here that say KULTUR-SCHOCK! - I&apos;ve noticed them all over town. A very Viennese phenomenon. There is so much culture, so easily available and proximate - history, art, music, architecture, religion - even horses, if you like the Lipizzaners, at the Spanischer Reitschule - that the effect can be daunting and a kind of culture panic ensues. What next? Where next? Who next? I try to resist such clamour. You should go to these famous cities also to gain some sense of the place and its citizens and how they live. You should go into a supermarket or a chemist as well as the Franziskanerkirche or the Belvedere Palace. In this spirit, I ask the concierge at the Sacher if there is any cabaret on. Before I left London, a friend had given me some CDs by Hildegard Knef, a 1970/80s German chanteuse in the Lotte Lenya/Marlene Dietrich style. She has a husky, cigarette-ravaged voice that is very alluring, particularly if, like me, you&apos;re in full Germanophile mode. Alas, cabaret is the one cultural factor in short supply in Vienna. However, the concierge does direct me to a place called the Eden Bar in Liliengasse, a famous Viennese club where live music is played every night. I may be lucky enough to find some cabaret there. It&apos;s time travel again, but on this occasion I don&apos;t think Freud or Wittgenstein would have recognised it. But the Eden Bar is wonderfully 1970s, if you like that sort of thing. I sit in a booth in the corner of the empty club with my drink watching a couple dance le swing to the accompaniment of a Filipino band (Imelda&apos;s sister on vocals) doing a fair cover version of the Bee Gee&apos;s classic How Deep Is Your Love? It&apos;s Vienna. It&apos;s KULTUR-SCHOCK! Back to London and its toxins tomorrow. The Boyd CV The life:  Born Ghana, 1952, and grew up there and in Nigeria.

Then reality arrived in Amsterdam, and the thought that this depleted and inexperienced team could punish Holland as they did France 18 months ago was exposed as fantasy. The absence of the massacre that many in tartan had feared offered little consolation. This was still an ordeal. Holland were too rich in resources and quality for Scotland. Goals from Real Madrid, Arsenal and Liverpool \u2013 courtesy of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Robin van Persie and Dirk Kuyt \u2013 illustrated the gulf in class vividly. Bert van Marwijk&apos;s team are coasting towards South Africa with a 100% record. Scotland are scrambling for second place, and after this chastening experience they can only hope confidence has not been damaged too badly ahead of Wednesday&apos;s vital date with Iceland at Hampden Park. &quot;It won&apos;t be difficult to lift the players after this,&quot; said the coach, George Burley. &quot;We were playing against some of the best players in the world tonight and, while we made some mistakes, there were some good performances out there and a lot of endeavour.&quot; Burley cited a block on goalkeeper Allan McGregor in the build-up to the second goal, as well as a disallowed header from Gary Caldwell, as instrumental factors in the defeat. The argument was spin-doctoring at its finest. It was the timing of Van Persie&apos;s goal, with the last touch of the first half, that proved pivotal, sapping the spirit and rendering Scotland&apos;s positive opening irrelevant. The hosts were comfortably in the ascendancy when Caldwell was adjudged to have pushed his marker before heading home with 16 minutes remaining. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to six people who have watched the goal on television and no one can see why it was disallowed,&quot; said Burley. &quot;It is a mystery why it wasn&apos;t given and who knows what might have happened had we got it back to 2-1.&quot; Scotland&apos;s errors were the major factor in this defeat, not those of the French referee, Laurent Duhamel, and completely undermined their disciplined opening. It was Van Marwijk who got closer to the truth when he stated: &quot;If we had played more intelligently we would have scored more.&quot; For 30 minutes the visitors, with McGregor, Christophe Berra and Ross McCormack all making their competitive debuts, were excellent. The Rangers No1 had only one save to make in the opening third of the game, when he thwarted Arjen Robben at his near post as the Real Madrid winger latched on to Mark van Bommel&apos;s raking pass. A minute later, Van Bommel swept an inviting delivery over the Scotland defence again, and this time there was no protection as Van Persie and Huntelaar drifted in behind Caldwell with the latter directing a simple header into the corner of the net. Given the display until that point, the goal was far too simplistic from Scotland&apos;s viewpoint, and worse was to come when Van Persie lost Darren Fletcher at Robben&apos;s corner and headed past McGregor with the final touch of the first half. The problem for Burley was not simply containing a skilled Dutch team with a defence decimated by injury but to pressurise the opponents&apos; most obvious weakness, their defence, and a goalkeeper, in Maarten Stekelenburg, whose form prompted an appeal to Edwin van der Sar to reconsider his international retirement. Moreover, it had to be achieved with a starting XI with just 21 goals to their name, as opposed to the 60 that Holland boasted before kick-off. Miller did have a glorious chance to open the scoring when released behind the offside trap in the 12th minute, but dwelt too long and enabled Joris Mathijsen to produce a vital challenge. It was a chance Scotland could not afford to miss. Kuyt marked his 50th appearance for his country with the third goal, three minutes after Caldwell&apos;s effort had been ruled out. Berra felled Huntelaar inside the area as they pursued a pass from Wesley Sneijder, and the Liverpool striker embellished his half-century with an emphatic penalty.

With the game goalless early in the first half, the Rangers forward was sent clear on goal by a Darren Fletcher pass which cut open the Dutch defence. Miller raced into the box but never looked comfortable and before he could get his shot away Holland defender Joris Mathijsen recovered with a saving tackle. &quot;It was a very sticky surface and it was hard to get moving with the ball at your feet,&quot; Miller said. &quot;I was trying to get the ball in front of me and get a shot in. Unfortunately, the defender got back and blocked the shot so I didn&apos;t get the chance to test the keeper.&quot; It was arguably the turning point of the game. Real Madrid striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar put the home side ahead and when Robin van Persie made it 2-0 almost right on the half-time whistle, the game was all but over for George Burley&apos;s men. Gary Caldwell had a late &apos;goal&apos; mysteriously chalked off by French referee Laurent Duhamel, before Christophe Berra - making his first start for Scotland - felled Huntelaar inside the penalty area which allowed Dirk Kuyt the chance to grab number three from the spot. Miller reflected on what might have been, then looked to make amends against Iceland at Hampden on Wednesday. &quot;We were beaten by a cross, a corner and penalty which is disappointing. We should be defending them a lot better as a team. &quot;Allan McGregor had to make a few saves which we expected him to do but the goal on half-time was a sucker punch for us. &quot;But we have to get ready to go again and take care of Iceland on Wednesday.

Next up is his biggest test, and there may not be an opportunity for the Scotland manager to better a Saturday night out in the Netherlands should Iceland derail his uncertain journey to South Africa on Wednesday night. There is no margin for error now. Coffee shop optimists could not conjure hope for the most difficult test in Group Nine and it unfolded exactly as it appeared it would on paper, with a depleted Scotland exposed by a side ranked third in the world. There was no shame for Burley&apos;s men and no recriminations but there will be if they fail to record a second win in the group at Hampden Park this week. Scotland will again be plagued by injury and painfully short of quality in attack against Iceland. Excuses, however, will not be welcome. Burley must find a way. &quot;We need to beat Iceland now. We have to win,&quot; the Scotland manager said. &quot;We&apos;ve got to look to win all our home games if we are going to finish second. I think three wins and a draw would be enough for us to get into the play-offs now, with the draw being in Norway. But we&apos;ve got to earn the right to do it. It is possible. We are not too deflated by what happened in Holland. Things went against us in that game but we worked our socks off and there were some encouraging things to take from that performance.&quot; In many respects Burley could not lose in Amsterdam. Little was expected of Scotland and there was no argument with the containment plan he sought to execute against a vibrant Dutch team. Now he is under pressure to attack, and the hesitancy that allowed Joris Mathijsen to smother Kenny Miller&apos;s one glorious chance for Scotland showed how problematic that can be when he has so few options in reserve. &quot;It will be a different game altogether,&quot; said the manager, who must be tempted to start Hibernian&apos;s Steven Fletcher against the Icelanders. &quot;I thought we were fairly positive against Holland in going 4-3-3 and we competed well against them. Holland are a tremendous team. Iceland is a completely different game and we have got to press them higher up, put them under pressure and win the match. We need to win the game. We are all aware of that.&quot; The Scotland manager ruminated on the defensive lapses that ruined an excellent start and enabled Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Robin van Persie to head home exquisite crosses from the hugely influential Mark van Bommel and Arjen Robben. Nor did he miss the opportunity to place more importance on Gary \u00adCaldwell&apos;s disallowed header than it merited, coming as it did with Scotland two goals down and moments from conceding a third, when Dirk Kuyt scored from the penalty spot after a trip on Huntelaar by the debutant Christophe Berra. The lesson in possession football was galling for Scotland&apos;s seasoned internationals and it may be wise not to revisit the final hour of this match on DVD before Wednesday night. &quot;When you come up against a top-class side like Holland you do realise just how far we have to go before we are ready to compete against the very best,&quot; said Darren Fletcher. &quot;They have some world-class players and you just have to look at the way they keep the ball without panicking to see the way the game should be played. They weren&apos;t cutting us open in the first half but they stayed patient. It suits them to keep the ball and to try to suck you into making mistakes. It can get disheartening at times when you are just chasing after the ball and they are knocking it around for fun.

Butcher, the assistant manager, promised Scotland would address the shortcomings against Iceland, when they aim to keep their World Cup finals hopes alive and the Tartan Army onside. Four matches on home soil have yielded three draws and one defeat for Burley, the manager who declined the easy option when he agreed to friendlies with Croatia and Argentina.

It is a barren spell that does not bode well, given that Scotland have three &quot;must-win&quot; home games in their final four qualifiers. &quot;We know we have to tighten up at the back but we need to score more too,&quot; said Butcher. &quot;We are all frustrated that we haven&apos;t won or scored a competitive goal at Hampden for a long while. &quot;We haven&apos;t made enough chances, it&apos;s as simple as that.

His death, occurring within days of that of his distinguished colleague Christopher Raeburn, closes a chapter in the history of recording in the second half of the 20th century and the end of a great tradition. Lock (known universally as &quot;Jimmy&quot;) was responsible for many of the signature recordings of artists including Sir Georg Solti, Herbert von Karajan, Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland, for whom - along with other top names on the Decca roster - he was the engineer of choice. Born in Bromley, Kent, Lock attended Canterbury Technical College. His career began in 1955 as a trainee for the International Broadcasting Corporation, after which he worked for a time as chief engineer of Saga Records. On 1 January 1963 he joined Decca, for whom he was to work for more than three and a half decades, cultivating the &quot;Decca sound&quot; and engineering some of the most prestigious discs in the catalogue. Initially he acted as tape operator for the engineer Kenneth Wilkinson, from whom he acquired valuable knowledge in the arts of recording technique and artist handling.  He eventually became chief engineer and acoustic adviser to the artists and repertoire department, with responsibility for the selection of halls and other locations used by the company. In due course he became one of Decca&apos;s most prolific and prized engineers, with a huge list of recordings to his credit. Many prestigious musicians - among them the conductors Leonard Bernstein and Charles Dutoit, the singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Angela Gheorghiu, Cecilia Bartoli, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras, and the pianists Vladimir Ashkenazy and Andr\u00e1s Schiff - came to value his unique contribution, in particular his ability to capture the essential quality of a recording venue, while also establishing the ideal balance between soloistic and orchestral forces. They responded to his human qualities as well, for Lock was a warm-hearted, modest man with a mischievous sense of humour. Crucial to his expertise was an unerring sense of acoustics. His favourite venue was the Kingsway Hall in London (demolished in 1998), although he also enjoyed working in Vienna (especially the Konzerthaus), the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Davies Auditorium in San Francisco and the Jesus-Christus Kirche in Berlin. The St Eustache Church in Montreal was discovered by him as a suitable recording venue, after a year-long search involving some 40 locations, and many fine recordings were made there, by Dutoit and others, under the supervision of Lock and his colleagues.  Of the numerous recordings made during the course of his long career, the ones of which he was particularly proud included a 1963 recital disc of R\u00e9gine Crespin singing Ravel&apos;s Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade and Berlioz&apos;s Les Nuits d&apos;\u00e9t\u00e9 with Ernest Ansermet and the Suisse Romande Orchestra; the 1964 version of Bellini&apos;s Norma with Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne; Herbert von Karajan&apos;s La Boh\u00e8me (1973) and Madama Butterfly (1974), both with Mirella Freni and Pavarotti, and Solti&apos;s 1983 recording of Mahler&apos;s Ninth Symphony (which won a Grammy award). Live recordings were initially treated with circumspection by the profession, because of the problems of audience noise, variation of internal balances between rehearsal and performance, and the altering positions of soloists. Lock was among those who helped to perfect a technique of live recording based on multi-tracking, whereby the failure or imbalance of individual microphones could be compensated for. His mastery of the acoustics of the Baths of Caracalla in Rome immeasurably enhanced the original Three Tenors concert and recording (1990), the latter holding the Guinness World Record for the best-selling classical album of all time. Following this success Lock was invited by Gian Carlo and Francis Menotti to supervise the sound amplification of the open-air concerts at the Spoleto Festival, including the 90th birthday celebration of Gian Carlo, an event that featured Domingo, Ren\u00e9e Fleming and Jean-Yves Thibaudet. His primary concern on such occasions was to convey the particular sound characteristic of the artist or artists in such a way that the listener was unaware of any amplification. On leaving Decca in 1999, he was employed as a sound consultant for many live amplified classical-music events. His services were also secured for a state-of-the-art recording studio in Lisbon, called O Ganho do Som, owned by Jo\u00e3o Ganho. There he planned to remaster some late-1970s recordings in 5.1 surround sound, to renew his search for halls with outstanding acoustics, and to present annual lectures discussing recording and mixing techniques. He also intended to write his autobiography - initiated with the writer and producer Jon Tolansky under the title The Other Side of the Microphone - for which his decades at Decca and close acquaintance with renowned artists would have provided a rich source of material. \u2022 James Lock, recording engineer, born 23 June 1939; died 11 February 2009", "sentences": ["His favourite venue was the Kingsway Hall in London (demolished in 1998), although he also enjoyed working in Vienna (especially the Konzerthaus), the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Davies Auditorium in San Francisco and the Jesus-Christus Kirche in Berlin."], "title": "Obituary: James Lock", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/01/obituary-james-lock", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-03-31T23:06:38Z", "article": "George Burley is prepared to take the boldest decision of his Scotland reign by dropping his captain, Barry Ferguson, or Darren Fletcher from a meeting with Iceland that could determine his nation&apos;s World Cup fate and his own longevity as manager. Burley has assured no player of his place for the must-win game and conceded that one of Ferguson, Fletcher or Scott Brown, the midfielders he lauded as his &quot;three outstanding talents&quot; before the 3\u20130 defeat by Holland on Saturday, could be sacrificed to accommodate ambitious tactics against Iceland. Burley also left open the possibility of recalling Craig Gordon in place of Allan McGregor in goal, despite omitting the former in Amsterdam due to his lack of first-team football at Sunderland. Brave selections have been a feature of Burley&apos;s troubled tenure but dispensing with his captain for such an important fixture could define his reign. Ferguson, who did not perform the captain&apos;s customary press conference duties yesterday, is the most vulnerable of the three established midfielders should Burley revert to a 4-4-2 formation and increase his authority over the dressing room at Hampden. Brown was comfortably Scotland&apos;s best player at the Amsterdam Arena and could be switched from his anchor role to right midfield should Ferguson and Fletcher start in the centre, although Burley has indicated that Ross McCormack&apos;s crossing ability could be essential in stretching the Icelandic defence. Whatever the team, and the Scotland manager will not inform his players until later today, Burley admits he is giving consideration to the biggest risk of his international career by placing Ferguson, Fletcher and Brown&apos;s involvement up for review. &quot;That is something I have got to look at. I&apos;ve got key decisions to make,&quot; he said of their involvement. &quot;Every position is under consideration. It is a massive game for me, it&apos;s like a cup final, and I&apos;ve got to make bold decisions, I&apos;ve got to be positive. I can&apos;t be negative at all.&quot; Last week the Scotland manager pre-empted speculation over his goalkeeper by announcing McGregor would replace the underemployed Gordon in Amsterdam. The circumstances behind that decision have not altered but Burley now admits his previous first-choice keeper has trained his way back into contention. &quot;You have to assess every game, every game is different,&quot; he said. &quot;You choose what you feel is best. You assess it, you look at the training, and you go with what you feel will be best for that particular game.&quot; Omitting Ferguson and McGregor would raise the prospect of both following their Rangers&apos; colleagues, Lee McCulloch and Kris Boyd, into premature international retirement under Burley. But the Scotland manager says that whoever misses out must accept the greater good of qualifying for a World Cup for the first time since 1998. &quot;They are professional people and they will take it in the right manner,&quot; Burley said. &quot;We need the right shape and the ability to impose ourselves and put Iceland under as much pressure as possible. As a manager you can&apos;t please everybody and that&apos;s not my job. I will pick the team for my country with no inhibitions. This is a one-off game and we need to go for it. It doesn&apos;t matter who is on the bench or in the stand; we are all as one. That is what I said to the players today; we are all as one.&quot; Defeat tonight would have major ramifications not only for Scotland&apos;s hopes of reaching South Africa \u2013 Iceland are second on goal difference and Burley has admitted his team need three wins and a draw from their remaining four games to qualify \u2013 but for the manager&apos;s future. However, Burley believes he should be given time to develop a Scotland team of limited resources and experience. &quot;I don&apos;t feel it is win-or-bust for meagainst Iceland,&quot; he said. &quot;I am a manager who has to make decisions, it is what I have done for the last 17 years. If we don&apos;t win, it is going to be very difficult to qualify, there is no hiding from that, but I feel I am a young manager at international level with a young team that is developing. It is an honour to be manager and I will be manager for as long as my country wants me.&quot;", "sentences": ["Burley also left open the possibility of recalling Craig Gordon in place of Allan McGregor in goal, despite omitting the former in Amsterdam due to his lack of first-team football at Sunderland.", "Brown was comfortably Scotland&apos;s best player at the Amsterdam Arena and could be switched from his anchor role to right midfield should Ferguson and Fletcher start in the centre, although Burley has indicated that Ross McCormack&apos;s crossing ability could be essential in stretching the Icelandic defence.", "I can&apos;t be negative at all.&quot; Last week the Scotland manager pre-empted speculation over his goalkeeper by announcing McGregor would replace the underemployed Gordon in Amsterdam."], "title": "World Cup Qualifiers: George Burley warns Barry Ferguson and Duncan Fletcher that three into two won't go for Scotland's midfield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/01/george-burley-scotland-barry-ferguson-iceland", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Scotland", "Iceland", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-01T09:11:00Z", "article": "Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor have been dropped from the team for Scotland&apos;s World Cup qualifier tonight after a breach of discipline, the Scottish Football Association confirmed today, though after apologising both will take a place on the bench.

The focus of today is victory this evening and we will be going all out for three points.&quot; It is alleged that Ferguson, 31, and McGregor, 27, carried on drinking in front of guests at the Cameron House Hotel hours after their team-mates had drifted off to their rooms, much to George Burley&apos;s anger. Ferguson failed to appear at yesterday&apos;s press conference at Dumbarton as Burley hinted at &quot;big decisions&quot; to be made regarding team selection. The incident throws into disarray Burley&apos;s plans for the crunch game for the Scots who need all three points if they are to have a chance of qualifying for South Africa through the play-offs as a second-placed country. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of big decisions to be made,&quot; Burley said. &quot;I will speak to my staff but it&apos;s one where I need to back my own judgment. I won&apos;t worry about other factors, simply what I feel will be the best team to win.&quot; Burley&apos;s dramatic action casts doubt over the future of Ferguson who, despite winning 45 caps, has played just once for Scotland in the last 14 months. McGregor, who will be replaced by the regular No1, Craig Gordon, has won only four caps. Burley&apos;s own future almost certainly depends on tonight&apos;s result against Iceland. A draw or defeat would all but end Scotland&apos;s hopes of reaching their first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup in France.

Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor remained onlookers from among the substitutes as Ross McCormack and Steven Fletcher kept Scotland&apos;s hitherto fading dreams of progression to next summer&apos;s World Cup alive. Failure to return three home points would not only have all-but ended those aspirations, it could have made the manager&apos;s position hovering above the category of untenable. It now remains to be seen whether the fall-out from the late-night drinking session which reportedly stemmed into the following lunchtime ends at Burley dropping the Rangers duo to among the replacements. Arguably it was more of an insult, particularly to Ferguson, for Burley to name the captain as a substitute rather than jettison him from the squad altogether. Nonetheless, that the pair remained among Scotland&apos;s chosen 18 hints strongly they will not be punished further by the international manager. There is a strong argument, in fact, that Burley should have stuck by what is understood to have been his original decision; to banish Ferguson and McGregor from the Scotland party altogether after showdown talks on Sunday. Only sincere apologies from the pair seem to have dismissed that option. Given that a close friend of the pair, Kris Boyd, has already said he will not represent the Scots while Burley remains in charge, this still appear an obvious case of a manager flexing his muscles. And, in doing so, making it at least partly plain his authority will not be questioned. Other players, including Scott Brown and Alan Hutton, had for a time joined in what started as a bonding session at the Cameron House Hotel upon return from Amsterdam in the formative hours of Sunday. Given that pair played against Iceland, their behaviour was either a great deal more reasonable than that of their team-mates, or Burley wanted to make a special example of two particular squad members. Privately, the Scotland coaching staff have been keen to avoid any clique mentality within their camp. Burley, who has been unfairly castigated by sections of the Scottish media since the day of his appointment, has won the battle. If a place in the finals - which would be Scotland&apos;s first in 12 years - is guaranteed, there will be little argument about the war either. One must be careful not to turn what amounts to an unauthorised morning booze session into an issue of life and death, or a matter to become all morally indignant about. Ferguson and McGregor have not betrayed Scotland, they have not committed an act of treachery and they have fallen well short of disgracing the nation. However, their actions were hardly helpful at a time when Burley was preparing for the most crucial match of his 15-month tenure. And these two players owe a particular debt of gratitude to the former Ipswich, Derby, Hearts and Southampton manager. Ferguson&apos;s club form has been less than impressive for so long now, the odd glimpse of magic apart, that there has been a legitimate call from some quarters for his place in the international team to come under review. Amid such rancour, Burley has been defiant, backing his &quot;outstanding&quot; captain and even displaying a rare glimpse of public anger last week when it was put to him Ferguson&apos;s touch is currently below par. The manager had been positively bristling at the prospect of utilising his captain for the first time in a competitive encounter, an option he had not been afforded before Saturday&apos;s defeat in the Netherlands. Yet for this match, given Burley&apos;s clear willingness to revert to a 4-4-2 formation, there was a sensible case for deploying Darren Fletcher and Brown in central midfield for purely football reasons, regardless of what happened over the weekend. McGregor had a reasonable claim to be included when Scotland visited Amsterdam but, given Craig Gordon&apos;s vastly superior experience in navy blue and that Burley is on record as saying the Sunderland man is the finest goalkeeper he has ever worked with, selecting McGregor still represented a bold move. Neither Ferguson nor McGregor excelled in the 3-0 reverse to Holland four days ago - far from it - with the latter enduring a particularly troubled evening. Those within Hampden Park&apos;s corridors of power have hardly steadfastly supported Burley in the immediate aftermath of this debacle either. Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the Scottish Football Association, would only admit he is &quot;going along&quot; with Burley&apos;s decision &quot;just now.&quot; Smith added that, although Burley had already supplied his reasons for dropping the wayward duo, a review of the situation will take place later this week. Not exactly unequivocal backing. The Tartan Army have a clear idea who they favour, though. Ferguson&apos;s name was roundly booed when read over the Hampden tannoy before kick-off. That of McGregor was less so, although chants of &quot;There&apos;s only one Craig Gordon&quot; within 15 minutes represented more than a tacit dig at the Rangers No1. So what happens next? Ferguson, ironically, used a tabloid interview last week to claim &quot;I have been pulling knives out of my back for years&quot;. Surely double standards would apply if the 31-year-old follows the lead of Boyd and another Rangers midfielder, Lee McCulloch, by withdrawing his Scotland services and, in turn, increasing pressure on Burley. The case of Ferguson and Paul Le Guen, who believed undermining from his captain played a significant part in his troubled time as the Ibrox club&apos;s manager, also cannot be ignored. McGregor is a separate case, although it would appear ridiculous if a 27-year-old announced he will not represent his country again while playing second fiddle to a man who cost \u00a39m and has no such history of off-field shenanigans. That prospect, though, cannot be discounted. Burley knew a Scotland victory here would maintain that public support and render his decision the right one; he owes a serious debt of gratitude to Steven Fletcher.", "sentences": ["Other players, including Scott Brown and Alan Hutton, had for a time joined in what started as a bonding session at the Cameron House Hotel upon return from Amsterdam in the formative hours of Sunday.", "McGregor had a reasonable claim to be included when Scotland visited Amsterdam but, given Craig Gordon&apos;s vastly superior experience in navy blue and that Burley is on record as saying the Sunderland man is the finest goalkeeper he has ever worked with, selecting McGregor still represented a bold move."], "title": "George Burley stands defiant and vindicated after making example of dropped duo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/apr/01/world-cup-2010-scotland-iceland-george-burley", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Scotland", "Iceland", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-02T15:56:00Z", "article": "Since the first Google Maps mashup - maps overlaid with information - was created in 2005, a growing band of users have been making maps of hotels, pubs, restaurants, hotels, galleries, museums and anything else that can be plotted.  My website, Google Maps Mania, tracks the amazing mapping websites that are constantly being dreamed up. Here are 10 travel-related Google Maps mashups that I find invaluable whenever I go on holiday.  1. For real-time information: Wikitude Wikitude is an application for Android mobile phones that includes a Google Map of 350,000 world-wide points of interest that can be displayed in a list view, map view or cam view. But the really astounding feature of Wikitude is the &apos;augmented reality&apos; view that can be seen through your phone&apos;s screen. If you hold your phone in front of a mountain you can see the name and height of the mountain overlayed on top of it on your phone&apos;s screen. Walking around an unfamiliar city, users can view a building through their phone, and Wikitude then tags the building on the screen with relevant information about the building.            2. To see the sights before you visit: Google Maps Street View The recent introduction of Street View to a number of countries around the world makes it possible to virtually explore holiday destinations before you leave. You can use Google Maps Street View on Google Maps in conjunction with the Wikipedia and Panoramio photo layers to find interesting sights to visit. In addition, some official tourist offices (and others) are beginning to introduce Street View options to their websites. For example ... Intoscana.it has produced a Street View map of Florence&apos;s major sights. I Amsterdam has just added some Street Views to its Explore the City map (so far the sights are a little uninspiring but the site plans to add more Street Views to the map). Street View Tourist is my own Street View map of a number of famous tourist destinations in the UK, Paris and Rome. 3. To plan ahead for a Gap Year: GoGapYear     GoGapYear Photograph: PR    The British Government&apos;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office have teamed up with Lonely Planet to produce this gap year planning tool built on top of Google Maps. The map includes photographs, podcasts and Lonely Planet reviews of tens of thousands of destinations around the world. You don&apos;t even need to be planning a gap year to benefit from this amazing map - it can tell you the best weeks to hike the Inca Trail, go diving in the Bahamas, or when you should visit Stromboli in Italy. 4. To map your own travels: Holiday Maps Holiday Maps is a very cool website that lets you create your very own Google Map displaying all the places that you wish to visit on holiday. You can use the photo and Wikipedia layers to virtually explore your location in advance of your trip, and add markers to the map to show the location of galleries, museums and restaurants you plan to visit when you arrive. Once you have finished planning your trip you can print out your personal holiday map or, alternatively, you can just access it from your mobile phone when you arrive.   5. To find a hotel, and look inside: Tripr.tv     Trip.tv Photograph: PR    Tripr.tv lets you view video reviews of hotels so that you can actually see the hotel rooms and facilities on offer before you book. The videos are submitted by the site&apos;s users so the opinions voiced in them are independent. If you see a video of a hotel you like you can even book the hotel from the Tripr.tv site. Use the Google Map to zoom in on the area you would like to stay and then click on the map markers to view the video reviews. 6. To get tips from around the world: ZoomandGo This impressive social network for tourists and travellers has a large collection of user-generated reviews, travel pictures and videos. ZoomAndGo provides Google Maps for individual locations around the world. Each map shows the top-rated hotels, galleries, museums and restaurants. The site aggregates each location&apos;s user rating for attractions, eating, shopping and scenery, so it is possible to quickly scan through towns and cities to see which have been rated the most highly by the site&apos;s users. 7.

The site has an online directory of hostels, budget accommodation centres and package tours. Hostels in the centre of cities are often the most expensive, but as Hostelworld.com allows you to search the directory via a Google Map, can easily visualise the balance between location and price.", "sentences": ["I Amsterdam has just added some Street Views to its Explore the City map (so far the sights are a little uninspiring but the site plans to add more Street Views to the map)."], "title": "The best Google Maps mashup travel sites", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/02/travel-websites-google-maps-mashups", "tags": ["Travel websites", "Travel", "Technology", "Maps", "Google Maps"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-03T06:06:06Z", "article": "     Honda has taken all the advertising space in the first 11 pages in Saturday&apos;s Guardian and an entire ad break on Channel 4 this weekend as part of its campaign to get more members of the public to be &quot;do gooders&quot; regarding the environment. The car manufacturer is to launch a 2 min 10 sec animated ad, called &quot;Do&apos;er&quot;, which will take the entire first ad break during Channel 4&apos;s UK terrestrial TV premiere of Al Gore&apos;s polemical environment documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which is being broadcast on Saturday, 4 April, from 9.20pm. Honda&apos;s &quot;Do&apos;er&quot; commercial, which will be preceded by a special announcement on Channel 4 ahead of the ad break, is only planned to run once in the UK. The &quot;Do&apos;er&quot; ad is narrated by the distinctively voiced American author and broadcaster and Honda commercial regular, Garrison Keillor. Honda will also be the only brand name seen in ad space in the first 11 pages of Saturday&apos;s Guardian with a print version of the &quot;Do&apos;er&quot; campaign. A range of different press ad formats will be used, including a number that have never appeared in the Guardian before. The &quot;Do&apos;er&quot; animation and press campaign, made by ad agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy London, attempts to raise awareness of the efforts Honda is making to try to be more eco-friendly. The campaign also offers tips to get consumers to make a difference, such as not revving engines and not stop-starting in jams, and will promote the launch of Honda&apos;s new hybrid car, the Insight, in the UK. &quot;None of this has been done before with a newspaper, as far as we know. We are incredibly pleased,&quot; said Ian Armstrong, the manager of customer communications at Honda UK. &quot;We are at our best telling stories about what we have achieved or what we are looking to do in the future.&quot; Honda will launch its main European TV and press campaign for the Insight, developed by Wieden &amp; Kennedy Amsterdam, on 14 April. &quot;The Inconvenient Truth is one of the most talked about films about the environment and we wanted a good story idea, Do&apos;er, that could bring innovation into the [media] marketplace&quot; said Armstrong. He pointed to Honda&apos;s media tie-up with Channel 4 last year to launch the Accord, where a team of skydivers made a live TV ad spelling out the word Honda, as an example of how the car manufacturer has a track record of looking beyond &quot;mainstream media ideas&quot;. Honda is also launching an online challenge, called Grow It, where the public can log on to be assigned to look after five plants from a selection of 24. The idea, said Armstrong, is that people monitor the progress of their plants through a web cam and, by answering a series of eco-themed questions, can see their crop get fed or watered and grow. &quot;Honda has always behaved against category,&quot; said Alex Conaway, the group account director at W&amp;K. &quot;This is even more important during the extreme conditions in which the car industry is currently operating in. The &apos;Do&apos;er&apos; film and the Guardian takeover is about telling stories about the brand and making people again feel an emotional attachment to Honda.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Washington has never, to my knowledge, graced a list of the world&apos;s most romantic cities and few could imagine the line &quot;I love DC in the springtime&quot; falling soulfully from Cole Porter&apos;s pen. As a seat of government the city naturally attracts venom and the innate line of thinking is that the place is bloodless, bureaucratic and transient. But friends of mine who know the city say Thompson and his ilk have got it wrong. One lobbyist points out, &quot;Even a policy wonk&apos;s thoughts can turn to romance.&quot; He cites the city&apos;s low-rise architecture and wide, gracious avenues, designed by Pierre-Charles L&apos;Enfant in the 1790s and inspired by Versailles, as evidence of a secret, pulsing, Francophile soul, while Georgetown, on the banks of the Potomac, has a whiff of old England.  In April Washingtonians celebrate yet another turbulent on-off international relationship. The capital&apos;s striking Tidal Basin is lined by 3,700 Japanese cherry trees, donated by the Mayor of Tokyo in 1912 to mark the two cities&apos; then burgeoning friendship. This weekend sees the trees in full, heart-swelling bloom, and a million visitors are expected to stroll - or embrace - beneath the petals and celebrate the National Cherry Blossom Festival.  But Washington doesn&apos;t need blossom to feel sexier than salsa this year. The Obama circus is in town and the District of Columbia is officially hot. Even at Dulles Airport you note the capital&apos;s starry-eyed affair with its 44th president. Mugs, fridge magnets and T-shirts all proclaim the lurve. And I subscribe to the vibe: I walked through the arrival lounge carrying my copy of Dreams From My Father. As my cab entered DC, cardboard cut-outs of Barack Obama peered from windows, fond echoes of the inauguration. My cab driver said proudly, &quot;Obama house!&quot; as we whisked past the building formerly known as the White House. In a bookshop later, I overheard two women discussing the virtues of Portuguese water dogs as presidential pets.  While the honeymoon lasts, much of DC seems to think of the Obamas as extended family; unsurprising, perhaps, in a city where African-Americans comprise nearly 60% of the population. The kinship is strengthened by the notion that, as a long-time Chicago resident, Barack Obama is the first truly urban president. A point proved when, on his first weekend in town as president, he popped into a popular neighbourhood diner, Ben&apos;s Chili Bowl (benschilibowl.com) in the U-street district. The signal was clear: you no longer have to eat at some over-priced grill to be an insider.  Avoiding pomposity, it seems to me, is the key to enjoying DC and finding its more soulful sub-culture. While the Capitol and the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials remind you of your antlike insignificance, and Maya Ling Yin&apos;s Memorial Wall commemorating the Vietnam dead reduces everyone to tears, you can get a little monumented out in DC. As one Washingtonian friend remarked, gesticulating at a plinth, &quot;Another fucker on a horse.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Obama House&quot; is so familiar from the West Wing that it&apos;s both surreal and underwhelming to find yourself suddenly outside it. It must have been jollier back in the early 1800s when there was a brothel in the grounds, and President John Quincy Adams&apos;s wife Louisa said drily that instead of voting itself a pay rise, Congress ought to found an orphanage for their bastard progeny. It seems every DC age has had its scandal, with the last half-century bringing us JFK&apos;s serial rutting, Watergate, Monica Lewinsky&apos;s refrigerated dress and the recent revelation that Eliot Spitzer, the crusading New York attorney general, favoured Washington for his trysts with a $5,000-a-night hooker. My hotel, the Tabard Inn, close by the Dupont Circle, is a celebrated place of assignation in DC, and has featured in several novels, including John Grisham&apos;s Pelican Brief. It&apos;s worth going to Washington for the Tabard alone, which is ludicrously good value. Unfortunately, there are no lifts, but that didn&apos;t deter one elderly loved-up couple (he sporting a Homburg, she a cloche) from hauling themselves upstairs.  The Tabard consists of three interconnected turn-of-the-century townhouses, stuffed full of crazy antiques, paintings and curios, and has a deservedly praised restaurant (one of the earliest to source organic ingredients).  Another enjoyable way to experience this unexpected side of the capital would be a grand tour of its galleries and museums. The Mall is lined with the Smithsonian&apos;s great institutions, and while New York equivalents can easily charge $20, DC&apos;s finest are free. It would take a month to even begin to do justice to the collections, but seeking the city&apos;s more sensual side I stood entranced before the Whistlers in the Freer Gallery (asia.si.edu), before wandering through their oriental art collection. Later, in the Hirshhorn (hirshhorn.si.edu), I was transfixed by Louise Bourgeois&apos;s erotically nuanced sculptures. And in the National Gallery of Art (nga.gov) I passed through Multiverse, a vast and utterly enchanting light sculpture by the American artist Leo Villareal.  Outside the Tabard, the best way to locate the city&apos;s beating heart is to roam up-and-coming neighbourhoods. On the north side of Dupont Circle, I found the packed but charming Bistro du Coin (bistrotducoin.com) with its unpretentious trad Gallic dishes.  I also perused the area around 14th and U Street, where young Democrat dads in groovy specs push buggies past hip bars. Enter any coffee shop and you&apos;ll see a clutch of latte-sipping Obamites tapping away at their MacBooks. A lone Popeye&apos;s Fried Chicken joint sits forlornly amid the galleries and home furnishing stores, reminding you that this was, until recently, a predominantly poor, black area. One d\u00e9cor shop was called Home Rule (homerule.com), highlighting the DC dwellers&apos; perennial gripe that they have no voting representation in the US Congress. The district&apos;s vehicle licence plates bear the mantra &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot;. Then a Brit journalist friend and his Washington-raised girlfriend walked me over to the Adams-Morgan district where 18th meets U Street. We had cocktails and sushi in Perry&apos;s (perrysadamsmorgan.com), a fancy-pants sort of a joint celebrated for its rooftop terrace. But I preferred the daisy-fresh late-night feast we enjoyed around the corner at the Amsterdam Falafel Shop (falafelshop.com) on 18th, where college kids and lobbyists queue to line their stomachs after a hard night&apos;s partying, and the delightful owner, Scotty, became misty-eyed as he recalled standing on the Mall in ice-cold weather for Obama&apos;s inauguration. Far from the political bovver-boys on Capitol Hill there&apos;s a lot of heart in DC. It&apos;s true that muggings are disappointingly commonplace, and as one African-American Washingtonian told me wryly, &quot;You&apos;ll not meet a single person who&apos;s crossed the Anacostia River to the city&apos;s Southeast ghettos.&quot; But homicide rates have halved from the crisis years, and the process of gentrification seems relentless I spent my final day in Washington in the near-deserted and hauntingly lovely gardens of Dumbarton Oaks (doaks.org), a Gilded Age mansion in Georgetown landscaped by Edith Wharton&apos;s niece, Beatrix Farrand. The sun shone and the only sound was birdsong, and I found it easy to imagine that I had somehow fetched up in a rural paradise. Then I rounded a corner and disturbed a couple in a rustic shelter.

We&apos;re sitting around her dining room table and she&apos;s recounting Inca legends. She is speaking in Spanish, and there are lots of long Quechua names, yet somehow I manage to follow. With tales of ancient battles, thwarted love and lost gold, I feel like I&apos;ve stepped into Inca Jackanory. Sonia is my homestay host in Ollantaytambo, a historic town in southern Peru&apos;s Sacred Valley, known for its cobbled streets and mountainside ruins of 15th-century storehouses and agricultural terraces. Sonia&apos;s house is a traditional, stone-built Inca structure, with an open courtyard that looks straight up at some of the most dramatic ruins. It&apos;s been in her family for generations and is decorated with all manner of Peruvian artefacts, from mythological ceramic bulls to Quechua festival masks. I&apos;ve found Sonia through Leap Local (leaplocal.org), a website that allows travellers to recommend local guides and services. It&apos;s not dissimilar to TripAdvisor, but the aim is to draw attention to smaller outfits and ensure money goes to communities. It&apos;s part of an emerging crop of online communities whose focus is specifically local. These sites range from blogs written by a network of local &quot;spotters&quot; around the world (see spottedbylocals.com) to virtual marketplaces where the tiniest of enterprises - even individual chefs or guides - are given an online presence.  I&apos;m giving hotels, tour operators and even Machu Picchu a backseat and basing my entire trip around Leap Local. Staying with Sonia, her husband Ferdinand, daughter Coralee, 10, and baby Rio Ferdinand (yes, really) is a wonderful start. They are listed as offering bed and full board for \u00a37.50 a night, and for no extra charge, they&apos;ll adopt you as one of their own. I join them on an outing to a local festival and get an education in Inca legends. Sonia used to be a cook on the Inca Trail, and a small restaurant she ran in her front room was a favourite hangout of Leap Local&apos;s co-founder, Louise Norton. Louise, a 29-year-old Cambridge graduate, came to Peru six years ago and decided to stay after falling in love with a local named Arturo. She recognised a gap in the market for a networking site that helps distribute tourism money more fairly among people who need it most. Louise is still based in Ollantaytambo, where she runs the Cactus Bar with Arturo. When I pop in, she draws me maps and recommends guides from the site. It&apos;s a pity every location can&apos;t have an in-situ co-ordinator. It&apos;s through her recommendations that I find my second contact, Jose Sotelo, a freelance guide who speaks English. I check out his site listing where one traveller describes him as &quot;a very flexible, easy-going, experienced guide&quot;. I email him, and in no time we&apos;ve created a bespoke three-day tour, based on the Lares trek, which is an Inca Trail alternative with hot springs en route. Via Jose, I also arrange a night&apos;s camping, a Leap-sourced homestay in Patakancha and a day&apos;s mountain biking. Jose&apos;s language skills make things straightforward, but at some point wires still get crossed. &quot;I thought you were bringing the tent,&quot; says Jose when we meet outside Calca market at 7am. My face falls. &quot;OK,&quot; he assures me. &quot;I have a friend we can stay with.&quot; Our first day of trekking is fairly leisurely. We pass jagged peaks and sweet-smelling eucalyptus. The absence of tourists makes it a far cry from the Inca Trail, a route that is trekked by up to 2,000 people a day. Just as the temperature begins to drop, we arrive at the small, mountain-top village of Wacawasi. Here Jose finds a last-minute alternative to the tent: a one-roomed stone hut that is home to Antonio, the oldest man in the village. Inside it is pitch black and filled with smoke, and the host seems slightly drunk. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d find this one on TripAdvisor. Yet I sleep surprisingly well in the cubby-hole bed in the corner.  Antonio mumbles away in Quechua, and although he isn&apos;t much of a conversationalist, I&apos;m still touched that he&apos;s welcomed us into his home. I&apos;d be happy to pay over the odds, but Jose insists I stick to local rates. I hand over the suggested 20 soles (\u00a34) and Antonio&apos;s eyes light up. &quot;See. It&apos;s important not to get carried away,&quot; says Jose. &quot;Otherwise it raises expectations.&quot; Day two brings a much tougher five-hour trek, past lakes and green hills that rise to a punishing 4,000m. Our end point - Patakancha, a weaving community - doesn&apos;t come a minute too soon. Compared with the previous day, my homestay here, in a clay-brick house, seems like luxury. Rooms are homely, and they&apos;ve even installed a shower and toilet. Food and board costs 40 soles (\u00a38) a night for the two of us. The only down side is that owner Juan Yupanki is away on the Inca Trail, where he works as a cook. As former president of the local campesinos court (where country workers settle disputes among themselves), he could have been an interesting character. In his absence, his younger brother, Americano, steps in to show us around, and whips up a hearty vegetable soup.  Next morning, mountain bikes are hired and delivered from Ollantaytambo (price \u00a314) and we end the tour whizzing downhill, passing stone villages where women sit outside weaving while men churn the fields. Jose charges me US$40 a day. Later, I see a four-day Lares trek being advertised through a tour company for US$250. Presumably they wouldn&apos;t have forgotten the tent, but neither would the tour have been so special.      Florencio with his wife and daughter    Aside from allowing you to save money and gain a more personal experience, Leap Local lets normally voiceless players in the industry take a more active role. My third contact, Florencio, usually works as a porter on the Inca Trail, carrying bags for a few dollars a day. But via Leap Local, he also offers tourists the chance to stay with his family and experience life in their lakeside village of Umasbamba. Unable to get through to him in advance, I just turn up. It&apos;s a tiny village so I soon find him in a nearby potato field. A small, jovial fellow, he says he&apos;d be more than happy for me to stay and can guide me to the nearby Inca ruins of Huchuy Qosqo, said to be a &quot;mini Machu Picchu&quot; without the crowds. I&apos;ll just have to wait for him to finish sowing his crop. Before long, I&apos;ve got my own potato-laden sling strapped to my front. As the sun dips behind the perfectly still Lake Piuray, we head back to the family home. It&apos;s quite big for these parts - two storeys with a mud courtyard, an outdoor, hole-in-the-ground toilet and a kitchen, where a wood stove chugs out black smoke, and guinea pigs run underfoot. Florencio brings me coca tea, while his wife makes dinner of potato soup, followed by rice, fried potatoes, egg and cheese. The next day we set off early for the ruins. We walk for five hours past creeks, cactus and yellow gorse. Finally, Huchuy Qosqo comes into view. Spread before me are its ancient terraces and roofless buildings. Looking closer I see all the hallmarks of Inca workmanship - walls that fit together like perfect puzzles, the seemingly impossible sharp angles of the square windows. It&apos;s smaller than Machu Picchu, but still impressive. The setting is beautiful, with a snow-capped mountain behind it in the distance, and best of all, we have it to ourselves. Florencio has offered an insight into Peruvian country life that I don&apos;t think I would have found alone. It&apos;s just a pity that, not recognising the potential for peer-to-peer recommendation, he ends up overcharging me. Granted it&apos;s not much - just \u00a340 for the tour and accommodation - but it is quite a jump from the \u00a37-a-day site suggestion. I try to query it, but Florencio sticks to his guns and I can&apos;t haggle over a few quid. It&apos;s an awkward situation, but it could have been easily avoided. I committed a schoolgirl error by not agreeing a price before setting off. &quot;I have briefed him on prices and suggested rates,&quot; Louise tells me later, but she admits that it is impossible to keep track of everyone and the prices on the site can only ever be a guideline. All in all, Leap Local has been a hugely rewarding experience, but at some points, it has demanded extra effort and patience. How many people will be motivated enough to forgo the ease of an organised tour? I put the question to another Leap Local guide, Mario Tapia Meza, over a post-trek beer. Having already racked up 10 glowing references, he insists the site has changed his life, allowing him to build his own freelance business. He also believes that the scope is wider than people imagine. &quot;I get a real mix of people,&quot; he says. &quot;I was contacted by a couple in a five-star hotel.&quot;  Regular tourists looking for not-so-regular experiences?

We are meeting up with friends from Brisbane and going with them for the last two weeks to New Zealand. We have a limited budget and will need to hire a car. Can we get tickets from Heathrow to Melbourne, hire a car there and drive via Sydney to Brisbane? Then could we take a plane to New Zealand and fly out of there to London? Kate Denny, by email A This route is no problem - Qantas and Air New Zealand are used to selling tickets with open-jaw overland portions covering both countries, and the plentiful flights between the east coast of Australia and NZ mean you have lots of options. The best-value fares involve transiting through one country at both ends of your journey - so Air New Zealand itineraries involve changing planes in Auckland on the way out and Qantas flights will mean a change in Melbourne or Sydney on the way back. Austravel (0800 986 4676; austravel.com) quoted \u00a3872 flying with Qantas and can also help arrange car hire for around \u00a320 a day. You can save on one-way drop off surcharges by hiring a car and returning it to the same city, then taking a bus or train to your next stop. Q My fianc\u00e9 and I plan to visit Mongolia, China and Tibet in September. We have a budget of \u00a31,500 each, but only 18 days for the trip. Ideally, we want to ride on the Trans-Siberian railway through Mongolia, stopping off for a few days en route. We&apos;d like a few days in Beijing, then take the train to Tibet and spend a few days in Lhasa before coming home. We are happy to take internal flights, but definitely want to do these two train journeys. How far in advance should we book trains and internal flights? I understand that we need visas for Mongolia and China, but I am not sure about Tibet. Is there an air pass (or better still rail-air pass) that we could use to keep the costs down?Sharon Martiny, by email  A This route will need to be pieced together bit by bit and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s feasible unless you extend your budget. International flights are straightforward: flying from Heathrow with Aeroflot (020 7355 2233; aeroflot.co.uk) via Moscow to Irkutsk in Siberia on the way out and coming back from Beijing, will cost \u00a3572.40. From Irkutsk, the jumping-off point for Lake Baikal, you can take the train to Ulan Bator in Mongolia, spend as long as you please exploring and then continue on to Beijing. Tickets go on sale 60 days before travel but agencies can block-book available berths 45 days before travel. So try a Russian rail travel agent such as waytorussia.net or The Russia Experience (020 8566 8846; trans-siberian.co.uk) or a Mongolia-based agency such as Discover Mongolia (discovermongolia.mn) - \u00a3100-\u00a3150 is a reasonable cost for both legs.  Tibet is volatile and access depends on the Chinese authorities and the situation inside Tibet. It has not been possible to enter Tibet legally during March, for example, but it is expected to open up again this month. Visitors need a permit and an official guide for the duration of their stay. The China Travel Service in the UK (020 7388 8838; chinatravel.co.uk) can arrange permits, guides and one-way rail travel on the 48-hour journey from Beijing, with a flight back to the Chinese capital, for about \u00a3550 per person not including accommodation and activities in Tibet.  The train journey from Qinghai to Lhasa across the Tibetan plateau is the highest in the world, and though carriages are not pressurised, oxygen is available. The excellent Life on the Tibetan Plateau blog (kekexili.typepad.com) is a good place to keep up with developments on travel to Tibet. Q We have a stopover in Nairobi this August and are free for the day and evening. What suggestions do you have to get a taste of the city?Ben Dessau A While most of Nairobi&apos;s most popular things to do are in the suburbs, if you&apos;re staying in the centre the newly renovated National Museum, with its collection of East African history, culture and art as well as tribal portraits by Born Free author Joy Adamson, is worth a look, as are the old steam engines at the Railway Museum near Nairobi station.  You may be stopping over before heading off on safari but, if not, Nairobi National Park, located just a few miles from the city centre, offers good wildlife-spotting opportunities - you should be able to arrange a half-day trip easily enough. Also in the suburbs are two popular animal sanctuaries: the Giraffe Centre and the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, where you can meet baby elephants and black rhinos. Both are easy to get to by taxi for about \u00a310, and the driver will often wait for you. In the evening you should take taxis to get around safely, but in the wealthy suburbs of Karen and Langata you will find some of the best restaurants in town, including the Karen Blixen Coffee Garden.  Feedback Re Sarah Akhtar&apos;s trip to Groningen (29 March). I had to go to this excellent little Dutch city a couple of times for work, and I found by far the best way to get there was to fly to Amsterdam and then take the train. I did not even book in advance. There is one stop on the way, but the Dutch railway network really is excellent. One equally important piece of advice: make sure you try the local mustard soup.

Smith, speaking immediately after the Scotland manager George Burley reported to the SFA board over circumstances which led to the duo being banned from Scotland duty on Friday, was pressed on three separate occasions on whether or not those sanctions could be lifted if, for example, a new manager was in place. Ferguson and McGregor were dropped to the substitutes bench for the match with Iceland on 1 April after a drinking session following the fixture with Holland in Amsterdam four days earlier lasted from 4am until midday. Gestures made while sitting on that bench led to them being suspended and fined by Rangers, with the SFA simultaneously announcing that Ferguson and McGregor &quot;will no longer be considered for international selection&quot;. Yet Smith&apos;s stance appeared to soften today when asked directly if that ban was in place for life. &quot;I can&apos;t answer that,&quot; said the chief executive. &quot;That&apos;s something that will have to be looked at in the future. The statement that came out on Friday is quite clear, at the moment they will not be chosen.&quot; In reality, that statement was more unequivocal than he has suggested. It was subsequently put to Smith that a new manager, for instance, may want to select the shamed pair. &quot;There are many circumstances that can arise,&quot; he added. &quot;I can&apos;t say that. The situation is that at the moment the ban is in place and they will not be chosen for the international team. You can speculate on that.&quot; Ambiguity remains the order of the day in this affair. Last Thursday, Smith said the matter was closed as far as the SFA were concerned. Less than 24 hours later, bans had been issued with George Peat, the president, insisting Burley reported events in full at today&apos;s board gathering. It is, in truth, tricky to decipher who is undermining who. &quot;The president felt that the directors didn&apos;t really know about the circumstances of Cameron House Hotel [the location of the drinking session],&quot; Smith said. &quot;There is always a situation where you say &apos;have a beer and go to bed&apos; and that&apos;s what happened. If you say that to the players and they disregard that then they have gone against regulations.&quot; Burley, along with four players who had been in Ferguson and McGregor&apos;s company for at least some of their drinking time, was cleared of any wrongdoing by the SFA board. A set of rules, however, will be put in place for future international gatherings and distributed to squad members. &quot;We will put in a code of conduct to ensure the players act in a certain way rather than giving the players the responsibility to act in a responsible manner,&quot; Smith explained. &quot;If the players can&apos;t see themselves how they should behave on a trip then we need to have some input on that. We will therefore need to put down regulations.&quot;", "sentences": ["Ferguson and McGregor were dropped to the substitutes bench for the match with Iceland on 1 April after a drinking session following the fixture with Holland in Amsterdam four days earlier lasted from 4am until midday."], "title": "FA refuse to rule out Scotland return for Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/09/barry-ferguson-allan-mcgregor-scotland", "tags": ["Scotland", "Rangers", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-10T23:01:00Z", "article": "It&apos;s a crisp Andean morning, and South America&apos;s prettiest colonial capital is coming to life with people, pigeons and sunshine. &quot;Papas! Aguita! Papitas!&quot; A street vendor in a bowler and with a child strapped to her back carries a stack of golden crisps. City clerks in sharp suits scan today&apos;s paper, while shoe-shiners get to work on their shoes. Schoolgirls in tartan skirts swap gossip and chewing gum. And watching over us all from her Panecillo hilltop is Quito&apos;s famous Virgin.  While the city awakens, I sip coca-leaf tea at the window of the new Hotel Plaza Grande. Actually, it&apos;s quite venerable, but like much of the old town has recently been restored to its former belle \u00e9poque splendour. The porters wear top hats and white gloves, and there are inkwells and gold-tipped quills in the rooms. Here at the leafy Plaza Grande, the belle and the less belle epochs of the city converge. It is a historic hot-spot that boasts the presidential palace and a baroque cathedral. And it was here that the first expeditions into the Amazon started, and where the lives of at least one president and one bishop ended rather messily. With an irony that is pitch-perfect, the bishop&apos;s palace now houses a restaurant called Mea Culpa. Vendors like the crisps seller are rare these days. Most of them have been given stalls in the new markets as part of a regeneration project. Well-groomed parks dot the seven sacred Inca hills, and Quito is now the continent&apos;s greenest capital. Brightly coloured facades jazz up the streets and derelict buildings have been turned into attractive homes for the wealthy. Once a seedy backwater, the old town is becoming a trendy place to live and visit. True, it was exciting before, but now you are much less likely to be relieved of your wallet. Two years ago, it wasn&apos;t safe to stay in the old town; today it would be madness not to. The night-life used to consist of pickpockets and prostitutes, but now the cobbled barrio la Ronda is the trendiest place to hang out. You can watch the street from the new upstairs restaurant Los Geranios, while savouring yaguarlocro, a black pudding soup with a bloody history. If you&apos;re lucky, you might hear the pasillo, Ecuador&apos;s equivalent of Portuguese fado, sung in one of la Ronda&apos;s bars. What delights me is that there are no scheduled tourist-pleasing events. Just turn up and stick around.  By day, la Ronda&apos;s main street is lined with workshops, galleries and craft shops. An orphan mission run by Italian nuns has opened as a cafe. In the courtyard of Misioneras de la Ni\u00f1ez you can enjoy freshly-baked pastries and Ecuadorian hot chocolate. Two years ago, you couldn&apos;t buy a bar of Ecuadorian chocolate because it was all exported. Now there are single-origin varieties for discerning chocoholics. Shopping has also arrived in the old town. My head is encased in a Panama hat from Ecuador&apos;s oldest hat-maker, Homero Ortega, who has a new shop in Plaza San Francisco. The gallery-shop Sinchisancha at San Francisco has top-notch Amazonian crafts, and the Corporacion Metropolitana has opened a shop in Plaza Grande, where you can buy Ecuadorian cigars and coffee.  Quito is still a relatively shy star, but new boutique hotels in old colonial mansions are already competing for the increasing flow of visitors. I spent a few days at the Patio Andaluz, a Moorish mansion whose courtyard restaurant serves Ecuadorian lunches. The staff wear red Andean capes, an extravagance that somehow stops short of being kitsch. This is the thing about the new, old Quito: it is made of such durable stuff. And to make sure that it never falls prey to falsehood, a new generation of artists is being created at the Escuela Taller de Quito I, an artisanal school for underprivileged teenagers. Together, apprentices and masters have restored a colonial maternity hospital into the most charming school I&apos;ve ever seen. You can visit between 8am and 4pm and meet tomorrow&apos;s stone-carvers, carpenters and restorers, all trained in yesterday&apos;s crafts. Already they are making altar pieces and carved columns so eye-wateringly beautiful that they could easily slip into Quito&apos;s emblematic monastery San Francisco and pass as the real thing. These kids are the latest graduates of the Quite\u00f1o style, the colonial offspring of the gunshot wedding between Spanish catholicism and indigenous aesthetics. Everywhere you look, you see cupolas, spires, baroque follies, life-like Virgins and Inca suns.  The San Diego cemetery, perched above the town, is a thing of beauty, with its mausoleums and melancholy angels. Inside the spooky 16th century San Diego convent next door, where nuns scurry in the shadows, I spot the most extreme Christ in a country where gory crucifixions adorn every church and even the odd restaurant. &quot;This is how you love,&quot; says a note that someone has pinned to his feet.  The mystic 17th-century Quite\u00f1o artist Miguel de Santiago allegedly killed one of his students to make his shocking sculpture of the dead Christ, and today you can still wonder at it in the San Augustin Monastery, where monks live in seclusion.  But the greatest marvel at the heart of the old town is San Fransisco, the continent&apos;s most extravagant religious centre. It has miraculously survived countless earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and only now is it under restoration for the first time.  I climb the scaffolding with the head architect to get baroque vertigo near the gilded, Arab-influenced ceilings and grinning cherubs. &quot;This is the biggest restoration project Quito has seen,&quot; Se\u00f1or Cheka tells me. &quot;This place was built on the remains of the palace of Atahualpa, and nobody has touched it since. We are digging up skeletons under the church floor. Who knows what else we&apos;ll dig up before we open to the public.&quot; Atahualpa was the last Inca chief, and there is a legend about the gold he left to his protege, Cantu\u00f1a. Most likely, the gold is nowhere to be found, because it was used to build San Francisco, just like all the gold the Spaniards found. In return, they gave the indigenous people the promise of salvation, and mirrors which supposedly contained their souls.  This summer, Quito is putting on a big fiesta to celebrate 200 years since South America&apos;s first independence uprising. It ended with bloodshed, but freedom followed. The Spaniards have been long subsumed into the indigenous pool. Old Quito hums with new energies, and the future belongs to the children of Atahualpa.

The free tickets, provided by a naive, young, rugby-loving PE teacher, were part of his losing battle to persuade us to play this alien sport so beloved of private school games masters everywhere.  There was only one solution: a first-ever journey to Edinburgh where the streets were paved with shortbread and where, we had been told, the locals, never normally eager to part with hard poppy, would none the less pay over the odds for the tickets we possessed.  The trip was a resounding success. The prices we secured were enough to get us into Celtic Park for the rest of the season and we found that Edinburgh store detectives had all been trained by Inspector Clouseau. Fifteen summers more were to elapse ere next I visited Auld Reekie, but this lovely old city had found favour with me. As we made our merry way back west, exulting in our good fortune and joyously dodging the train fare by jouking in and out of the lavatories, we had the warm glow you get when you have just been to your severe but kindly maiden auntie&apos;s. The one with a past whispered about only when the sherries flowed at yet another family christening.  And though she had admonished you again for your slovenliness and checked that you had washed behind your ears, nevertheless she had that glint in her eye as she slipped a pound note into your hand and you just knew that once upon a time she had travelled with a native man-servant.  I harbour yet that same secret thrill whenever I sally forth along the M8, but recently it has become evident that my Edinburgh is hurting and the reasons why are not hard to fathom.  The hand-wringing and introspection started when the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland began their swift and catastrophic collapses, revealing a core rotting with the sort of risky financial adventurism Edinburgh would normally disdainfully associate with we spendthrift and reckless Glaswegians. Until the last weeks of 2008, RBS and HBOS had stood like sentinels guarding all those values that Edinburgh held to be sacrosanct: thrift, caution and temperance.  Now they could not have been more mortified if they had found that grandfather had sold the big house in Bruntsfield and had been found blowing hashish rings into the sweaty armpits of a Turkish rent boy in a souk in Istanbul.  Yet the anger and recrimination over Sir Fred&apos;s folly is as nothing compared with the civic war that has been raging over the city&apos;s \u00a3100m tram system. It&apos;s unnecessary, it costs too much, it&apos;ll be a year late and Princes Street will be like a building site while the work takes place. Anyone who has seen what Edinburgh City Council has allowed to happen to their main street over the last 30 years may conclude, though, that a building site would be an improvement. Is there any other main capital thoroughfare in the world where such a divinely appointed vista of Castle, Mound and Royal Mile is faced with a scowling road of shops that resembles Bucharest High Street before the revolution?  When the Edinburgh latterati are not enduring a dark night of the soul over their banks and their trams, they can usually be heard clucking over the plight of the grand old Scotsman newspaper. And it&apos;s true, the old girl is having a torrid time of it. The circulation has collapsed and last week their financial masters refused to bear the cost of sending a football writer to Amsterdam to cover Scotland&apos;s most important match in years. It is not difficult to lampoon the douce citizenry of Edinburgh when they get like this. Indeed, it is not difficult to have fun at their expense on most occasions. As when you ask whose turn it is to purchase the next round of drinks and suddenly find that a terrible silence has descended, broken only by Craig and Charlie of the Proclaimers on the jukebox. Or when you discover that most have never been to Glasgow because they get nosebleeds at the Harthill services.  Yet in the 10 years when I laboured on their newspaper presses, I grew to love the natural reserve, the refusal to rush to judgment and the Presbyterian rectitude. These did not spring from an absence of warmth or affection, but simply a natural wisdom in Edinburghers&apos; dealings with people as they assessed your fitness for their friendship. And when my Glaswegian &quot;How&apos;s it gaun&apos;?&quot; gallusness required occasionally to be punctured, then there was never a shortage of kind volunteers. So it pains me to see my beloved capital so vexed. For once, not so very long ago, this beautiful old city took me in, gave me sanctuary, listened to my woes, took pity on me and set me on my path again. And now it is my turn to return the kindness. The douce citizens of Edinburgh must not worry about the trams, they will be a resounding success. More people will be inclined to travel on them rather than buses because their special routes will bear them to their offices much more quickly. Traffic congestion will be cut and with it pollution. They will be pleasing to the eyes. Just ask the people of Nottingham and Dublin, who are now clamouring for expanded routes, when once they were aghast at the very idea.  Nor should they be concerned about their newspapers; they have stood for nigh on 200 years and, like the foundation garments of a Morningside matron, they will not be down for long. And they must not fash themselves over their banks for they simply cannot have everything. Already they have the brilliant Scottish parliament building, every one of our national art galleries and the world&apos;s best music, art and books festivals. There are some things, though, that it would not be worth their while to covet. And so they must leave style to Glasgow, for we simply do it better.", "sentences": ["The circulation has collapsed and last week their financial masters refused to bear the cost of sending a football writer to Amsterdam to cover Scotland&apos;s most important match in years."], "title": "Kevin McKenna on why Edinburgh will prosper again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/12/edinburgh-financial-crisis", "tags": ["Scotland", "UK news", "Edinburgh City"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-11T23:01:00Z", "article": "In a semi-derelict building in Lambeth, south London, amid collapsed sofas and empty wine bottles, a group of squatters in their 20s are playing a word-association game. It started off with &quot;laws&quot; and is followed round the circle with &quot;breaking&quot;, &quot;entering&quot; and then &quot;exiting&quot;. Accidentally or otherwise, here is the common perception of squatting in four words. But squatting itself is not a crime in England (unlike Scotland), and this group&apos;s presence - making films, building sculptures and busily renovating as they paint walls as well as canvases - is completely legal, albeit very much a secret from the building&apos;s owner. &quot;I don&apos;t feel we should apologise for being here. We&apos;re opportunists,&quot; says Ed, a mustachioed 26-year-old who works in video. &quot;I&apos;m damned if I&apos;m going to work six days a week to pay for a studio space.&quot; He is not alone. Over the past few years an &quot;art squat&quot; subculture has been quietly growing in the UK to include not just opportunists like Ed, but creative and ambitious groups for whom the decision to squat - for working or living or both - comes as much from an idealistic, DIY ethos as it does from financial expediency. Few young artists can afford to pay rent on housing and studio space at the same time. Fewer still can afford the luxury of a vast exhibition space they can do what they want with. Straitened times call for ever greater resourcefulness. They also - luckily for artists if not the former occupants - mean more empty buildings than ever. According to England&apos;s Empty Homes Agency, 784,495 are unoccupied, and the number rises each day. Taking their cue from similar movements in Berlin and Amsterdam, artists in this country are realising that squatting provides not just freedom from paying rent but also extraordinary creative freedom. The chance to make large-scale work, to put on frequent, artist-curated exhibitions and to form collaborative relationships based on sharing a space, has made squatting more than simply a housing solution. In some cases, the squatters even have the backing of local authorities. Wandsworth, in south London, is one of several councils encouraging artists to make good use of the &quot;slack space&quot; of shops left empty by the recession by offering them grants, and a similar scheme is under way in Dursley, Gloucestershire where artists use empty shops as galleries. However, such a broad-minded approach to squatting is still the exception. The start of the year saw a sustained spluttering of media outrage over the &quot;posh squatters&quot; - a young art collective who hoisted their anarchist flags and took up residence in two multimillion-pound mansions in Mayfair. The &quot;posh&quot; seemed to refer as much to the grand residences they were occupying as to their own backgrounds, which were very much in the mould of the archetypal &quot;bo-bo&quot; or &quot;bourgeois bohemian&quot;. Is a spell of fashionable squalor set to become a rite of passage for graduates? The Da! Collective The grand facades of Mayfair&apos;s mansions are an incongruous setting for the two scruffy 20-somethings showing me around. Steph, whose only luggage is a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray, is wearing yellow boots, patterned tights and one of the purple jackets worn by free paper distributors. The stitching on its back has been neatly modified to read &quot;the londonraper&quot;. &quot;Yeah, one day I&apos;ll set up a publication of the same name - an antidote to the raping of minds that thelondonpaper does.&quot; She is part of a group of artists who found themselves in a media storm when they moved into a Grade II-listed mansion on Grosvenor Square. The attention intensified when they moved down the road to a building on Clarges Mews worth even more millions. &quot;Papers were tracking down people&apos;s families, there were character assassinations ...&quot; says Thomas, a tall, unshaven man in his twenties.  Soon after the property&apos;s location was identified in the press, the group was evicted, and moved to live and work in another property in south London whose whereabouts is &quot;undisclosed&quot;: it may be legal, but few landlords are sympathetic to squatting and most act fast to get rid of uninvited guests. Not that this particular group should give them cause for concern - a &quot;leave no trace&quot; policy was firmly enforced for any rooms with period features and Steph stresses that &quot;it&apos;s always about the space that you&apos;re in, as far as what we do. You&apos;ve got to be sensitive to that.&quot;  At the Clarges Mews property they called their project &quot;The Temporary School of Thought&quot;. The name invokes the anarchist tradition of the &quot;free school&quot; - a network of people sharing knowledge - yet also seems to include a wry acknowledgement of the grandiose ambition of establishing a &quot;school&quot; in the artistic sense. But rather than an artistic manifesto, this group seems to have formed around humbler desires - above all the desire to live in some kind of creative community. The school itself was certainly a community-minded enterprise, even if Mayfair&apos;s wealthy denizens weren&apos;t among those visiting. With an eclectic timetable of classes (labyrinth-building and French book-binding included) it was open - and free - to anyone. &quot;It was amazing,&quot; Steph says. &quot;There&apos;d be the charleston going on in one room and then a really intense discussion about infrastructure in another room. Everyone was just really happy to be there.&quot;  Artspace Lifespace From outside, the boarded-up Bridewell police station and fire station in Bristol&apos;s town centre look utterly lifeless: my cab driver repeatedly asks whether I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t want the other police station, the functioning one. Yet once inside the complex, the cells and offices are thrumming with activity. At the beginning of last year a squatting group called Artspace Lifespace took over the site, renamed it &quot;The Island&quot; and have been busily transforming it into a community arts centre ever since. This huge complex of buildings had stood empty since 2005, which seems shockingly wasteful for a space at the heart of the city. Jono, a street artist, who returned to Bristol inspired by the squat culture of Berlin, agrees: &quot;There are so many properties in Bristol that are empty. Doing this brings a vibe to the city and it&apos;s a great thing.&quot; As Doug Francis, who founded the group in 1992, observes, the buildings have proved strangely suitable to the group&apos;s various creative purposes; in particular, the old cells in the police station provide a series of mini-galleries for various street artists to exhibit in. Especially striking is a white-tiled cell whose walls are now half-covered in childish paintings of birds and a poem about freedom. One artist, as Francis recounts with a chuckle, found himself showing his graffiti in the very same cell that he&apos;d once been held in for the same crime. Appropriately, their latest show is themed around justice. At 40, Francis may be older than the average squatter but having experienced the recession in the 1990s, his sympathies are very much with his younger counterparts. &quot;I imagine they&apos;re quite disillusioned to have come out on this downturn. I think a lot of people are looking for alternatives. The skips are full of materials for artists to use and people are more aware of the wasteful nature of society these days.&quot;  Hannah Barry Gallery/Lyndhurst Way     The Hannah Barry Gallery in Peckham are a group of young artists who make work and curate shows, photographed in their gallery space in south London. (L-R) Christopher Green, Hannah Barry, James Capper, Oliver Griffin, Sven Mndner, Bobby Dowler and Benjamin Walther.    Owning your own gallery at the age of 25 is remarkable enough. But when that gallery owes its existence to a rat-infested squat in Peckham, the achievement seems all the more incredible. Hannah Barry, whose recent shows at a huge former glue factory sent mutters of excitement through the national press, declares herself indebted to 78 Lyndhurst Way, both an address and the name of the squat that sprung up there. The house is now a scrubbed, newly painted building awaiting a wealthy owner, but somewhere in between utter dilapidation and its current incarnation it was home to a prodigiously productive group of artists. While living and working there they embarked on an exhaustive process of renovation, transforming it into a white-walled gallery space which from November 2006 to June 2007 hosted six shows - all while the threat of eviction was imminent. &quot;There was always the possibility that the curtain would fall and it would all be over,&quot; says Barry. &quot;But we just got on with what we could do while we could. I knew that it was taking us forward somewhere.&quot; In 2007 the curtain did fall. Planning permission was granted for the property but, minutes down the road, the artists found an empty Victorian pub, the Bickleigh, and took up residence. Here, one of the artists, Bobby Dowler, 25, pays the owner \u00a35 a month in a caretaking agreement similar to the one-painting-a-month deal he had with the owner of Lyndhurst Way. Asceticism is an unlikely thing to find in a squat, or indeed an old pub, but Barry describes Dowler&apos;s life in the Bickleigh as &quot;very strange, calm&quot; and &quot;organised, frugal, and without things&quot;. Barry initially lived and worked in the Bickleigh for a year after she left her job in PR to start the gallery. &quot;For people for whom it isn&apos;t a means to an end, there is always a romance to a building for which there is no fee. But my time there was no more or less romantic than any other building I&apos;ve lived in.&quot; And most other buildings don&apos;t come with bucket showers, or indeed, room entrances via cramped cupboards. &quot;It conserves heat,&quot; explains Dowler, firmly shutting the door behind him as we squeeze into the main living space on the first floor. He describes himself as &quot;a bit of a dictator&quot; yet, strangely, the rigid house rules and hierarchy grant a certain amount of mental freedom. Knowing who&apos;s doing the washing-up that day, he explains, gives everyone more space to think about their art.  !WOWOW!/The Centre of the Universe     Matthew Stone and members of !WOWOW! an artist collective based in Dalston, east London    &quot;Squatter&quot; must rank among the oddest answers to &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; but for Matthew Stone, an artist at the centre of the !WOWOW! collective, it&apos;s an unconventional childhood dream that&apos;s been energetically lived out. &quot;When I found out about it as a kid I remember being really worried that it would be illegal by the time I was able to do it,&quot; he says. &quot;I was obsessed with the idea of it, but also with getting to London and being part of a dynamic group of young people doing things. It&apos;s that romantic idea of having a space that is your own that you can kind of do anything with.&quot; After graduating from Camberwell College of Art, Stone and his friends squatted their first building, a Co-op flagship store from the 1930s in south London. The space may not have been his own in any formal sense but he and his friends certainly did &quot;kind of anything&quot; with it. Four empty floors, including a huge old ballroom, were filled with exhibitions, screenings, performances and, of course, some large parties. These have taken on a bit of a mythic quality, particularly the one where George W Bush&apos;s niece, Lauren Bush, turned up with security guards in tow: &quot;a nightmare&quot; says Stone, &quot;it was one of our bigger parties - 1,500 people, massive sound system, half the people in fancy dress, just very friendly and silly, but we spent the whole night running around fulfilling the requests of the police who took a sudden interest in the safety of people at our party.&quot; He admits that as far as the group&apos;s reputation goes, parties have tended to eclipse the art. His photographs of club kids on comedowns, all dreamy gazes and entangled limbs, have done little to dampen this image.  However, the latest project is heavier on the seriousness. This &quot;nomadic art space&quot; - a gallery putting on exhibitions and performances wherever it can beg and borrow space - is called &quot;The Centre of the Universe&quot;. While modesty may be in short supply, humour is not. Stone laughs at the project having a &quot;musical director&quot; and as for his title, &quot;I haven&apos;t thought of one ostentatious enough to give myself yet. But as much as it&apos;s tongue in cheek it&apos;s also a recognition of the fact that we&apos;re serious about what we&apos;re doing.&quot; This seriousness also informs his reasons for squatting. Amid the romantic zeal is a more political motivation - the desire for &quot;art to be able to exist in its own context, without the primary aim of commodifying its output. Squatting is a necessity for an artist trying to find ways to work without commercial constraints.&quot; Many would feel that a life free of commercial constraints is a luxury rather than a necessity but Stone is quick to point out that he and his friends never claimed benefits. &quot;Everybody was just finding a way in the city to survive. People would make 20 quid a week doing a DJ gig or something and we&apos;d use supermarket bins for food. I have no problem with artists selling work but I think it&apos;s a really important message to send out to young people - that we can take creativity back into our hands rather than having it sold back to us at a higher price.&quot; Stone is something of a hero to a sizeable swathe of said young people, but fellow !WOWOW! member Gareth Pugh has achieved even more fame as a fashion designer. Stone recounts a group of models arriving for a fitting only to be told by a policeman that they&apos;d got the wrong building because &quot;only homeless people live there&quot;. There aren&apos;t many fashion designers feted by Vogue who live in squats. So is there something odd about seeing his friend&apos;s designs on Beyonce and co? &quot;I think it&apos;s amazing, that&apos;s exactly what he wanted to achieve and he&apos;s worked tirelessly to do it. I think this idea of defining an underground as something which a minority of people can appreciate is quite an elitist idea anyway.&quot;  And despite hosting a weekly salon, and the preponderance of &quot;all my abstract rhetoric&quot;, Stone is anything but elitist. Inclusivity and an enthusiasm for collaboration come bound up in the idea of optimism, to which he has so sincerely wedded himself that Norman Rosenthal declared he had coined a fresh &quot;-ism&quot;.  But as Stone acknowledges, every new generation has its idealism. &quot;There is that phrase &apos;youthful optimism&apos;, but I think we need to work to find ways to extend the life of it. The truth is, anybody can change the world.&quot; He pauses. &quot;It&apos;s important! It&apos;s heroic!&quot; and then he bursts into laughter.

The governing body&apos;s handling of the whole incident has been criticised and Burley was keen to set the record straight about his own role in the affair. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s been handled greatly,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I just want to clarify a few matters and be black and white about the facts. It&apos;s important people know how the SFA works. &quot;The Scotland manager doesn&apos;t decide who is banned.

They decide whether to ban anyone and decide if somebody should get back in the squad. &quot;They might come back to me in the future and ask for my opinion, which I will give them.

They then hit the headlines again by flicking V-signs during the game at Hampden, which led to them being told their Scotland careers were over, as well as earning a two-week suspension from Rangers. Reports at the time claimed Burley had given permission for his players to have a couple of drinks after returning in the early hours of the morning from Amsterdam. But he insists that was not the case. &quot;The players all went for food and two of my staff innocently agreed to allow them to have a drink,&quot; he said. &quot;I was unaware the players were at the bar. If I had known, I would have arranged for someone to make sure they went to their beds after one drink.&quot; Meanwhile, the former Scotland player Kenny Dalglish has commended Rangers for suspending the duo for two weeks. &quot;As a professional you&apos;ve got a responsibility to conduct yourself in a certain manner,&quot; said Dalglish. &quot;Not just on a Saturday night because when they were sitting on the bench in front of all the cameras, they&apos;ve got a responsibility of how to behave. &quot;After what they did sitting on the bench something had to be done. It&apos;s a great credit to Rangers. They were punished for the Saturday night and that&apos;s where it should have finished. But they carried it on to Wednesday. I think Walter Smith as [Rangers] manager is dignified and supportive of his players and it&apos;s a disappointment for him. &quot;Not only have they let themselves down, they&apos;ve let Scotland and more importantly their employers down and I think Walter had no option but to take action.

Traditional windmills for example. People wearing wooden shoes. Decorum. And real wingers. Not since Marc Overmars have Holland had a proper winger in the old Dutch mould. A winger who comes back to the dressing room with chalk on his legs from time spent alongside the sidelines and byline. How we yearn. They&apos;re a dying breed. No more. Heerenveen&apos;s right-winger Roy Beerens and FC Twente&apos;s left-winger Eljero Elia are breathing new life into a lost art, tormenting full-backs no longer used to wingers going around the back. Beerens relies on savvy and Elia on skill and sheer athleticism. &quot;Elia does things that are anatomically impossible. I would tear everything,&quot; Twente keeper Sander Boschker said recently of his team-mate&apos;s explosive pace. Anchoring Heerenveen&apos;s potent attack, Beerens has turned in nine goals and 10 assists while Elia has been crucial in Twente&apos;s surprise run, tearing open opposing back-lines and creating space for his fellow attackers. This very scarce resource is in high demand. Elia was bounced from the Ajax academy aged 15 after just two years there. Beerens was released on a free by PSV despite a promising debut. But both players are attracting interest not only from the aforementioned clubs, but from just about every other side that&apos;s ever dreamed of keeping the field wide. Which begs the question: when Ajax and PSV had these players of such obvious endowment in their academies, why did they let them go? Had they become so used to coping without proper wingers that they decided they had no place for them? Back in 1981, the still-active Johan Cruyff, who could play as a classic left-winger and as a striker, saw it coming. &quot;In the youth leagues you don&apos;t see a single winger who goes around the outside and crosses it,&quot; he warned. &quot;Why is that? I think because too many things are taken away. You can tell a first-team player &apos;you can&apos;t do this&apos; or &apos;watch that&apos;. But a 10- or 12-year old boy shouldn&apos;t be given assignments.&quot; Perhaps the stifling over-coaching of youth and unwillingness to exile players to the far corner of the field are to blame. Perhaps the position has gone out of fashion. Or perhaps the players are in fact there but are going unnoticed, the way Beerens very nearly slipped off the radar in the U-16 Second XI at PSV. Another staple of Dutch football, the No10, the playmaker \u2013 an endangered species in its own right \u2013 has recently eluded the Big Three (Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord), all of whom could have done with such a conductor for their orchestras this year. Not entirely coincidentally, they&apos;ll soon be better known as The Three, as their stranglehold on the Eredivisie will be broken by AZ in the next week or two. To add insult to injury, the team that will beat them to second place, Steve McClaren&apos;s Twente, do boast just such a puppetmaster in Kenneth Perez. The same Kenneth Perez Ajax have discarded twice and the same Kenneth Perez deemed surplus to requirements by PSV. All of which accounts for one of the feel-good stories of the season: Perez&apos;s revenge. After coming to Holland in 1997, Perez spent nine productive, if unremarkable, seasons with MVV and AZ. Then came Ajax. But he wasn&apos;t able to compete with Wesley Sneijder, and, having been bought by a previous manager, Danny Blind, never gained the necessary trust from the new boss, Henk ten Cate, although he did score 12 goals in 27 games. He forced a transfer at the end of the season and joined PSV. A successful first half of the season followed, until manager Ronald Koeman left for Valencia in October. His interim-successor, Jan Wouters, had no use for Perez. Nor did his interim-successor Sef Vergoossen. So in January, Perez went back to Ajax where Ten Cate had been replaced with - no, really - another interim: Adrie Koster. Under Koster, Perez played well, ending the season with 15 goals from 30 matches. But Koster was replaced by Marco van Basten, who replaced Perez with Isma\u00efl Aissati, who had previously stood in his way at PSV. Having been relegated to the reserves, Perez even went to court to demand a place in the first-team squad. He lost. His contract was dissolved. The very next day, Perez signed with Twente. On Saturday, Perez masterminded Twente&apos;s 4-2 trampling of Roda, contributing three assists and delaying AZ&apos;s impending championship parade. Elia was instrumental in the first goal and scored the fourth. AZ meanwhile overcame the last skeleton in their closet. Having beaten ADO \u2013 the only other team to beat them in the league this year \u2013 last week, the Alkmaarders exerted their wrath over NAC, who knocked them out of the Cup and beat them on opening day. Courtesy of Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9&apos;s now weekly 50-yard solo, AZ won 1-0 in an acrimonious contest in which a laissez-faire referee allowed several harsh kicks on Mounir El Hamdaoui&apos;s and the latter&apos;s happy-slapping of an opponent to go unpunished. AZ need just one more win to clinch the championship. FC Utrecht rolled over in their contest with PSV on Sunday, granting a pair of goals on a platter through gauche defending. Knowing full well that Utrecht haven&apos;t scored in nearly two months, PSV sat back and cashed in their three points. And for the first time this year Roy Makaay was almost worth his wages as he scored three for Feyenoord on Sunday, courtesy largely of phenom Georginio Wijnaldum. Eventually running out to a 5-1 triumph over Heracles, it was Feyenoord&apos;s second good showing of the year; their first since Week Two. Willem II had never before won in Amsterdam ... and by no means did that change on Saturday. It took Ajax less than two minutes to break the meek resistance courtesy of Dario Cvitanich. Then Eyong Enoh scored. Then Cvitanich scored another. Then Luis Su\u00e1rez scored. Then Urby Emanuelson scored. Then Su\u00e1rez scored again. And again. 7-0. Oh, and Roda JC and Fortuna Sittard decided not to merge in the end, after local government decided their debt was too severe to shoulder. Results: NAC 0-1 AZ, FC Twente 4-2 Roda JC, PSV 2-0 FC Utrecht, De Graafschap 2-2 NEC, Feyenoord 5-1 Heracles, Ajax 7-0 Willem II, FC Groningen 2-3 Vitesse, Heerenveen 1-0 FC Volendam.", "sentences": ["Willem II had never before won in Amsterdam ... and by no means did that change on Saturday."], "title": "Dutch wide boys back in vogue while AZ edge nearer to the title", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/13/eredivisie-round-up-dutch-holland-football", "tags": ["Heerenveen", "Twente", "Ajax", "PSV Eindhoven", "Feyenoord", "AZ Alkmaar", "Roda JC", "NAC Breda", "Utrecht", "Hercules", "De Graafschap", "NEC Nijmegen", "Groningen", "Vitesse", "European club football", "Holland", "Eredivisie", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-13T23:01:00Z", "article": "Maria Curcio, who has died aged 89, was one of the most influential and sought-after piano teachers of the second half of the 20th century. Although it can be as misleading to judge teachers by their students as it is to judge pianists by their teachers, the many distinguished artists who turned to her for help and advice attest to her legendary status. These include Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Martha Argerich, Myung-Whun Chung, Barry Douglas, Jos\u00e9 Feghali, Leon Fleisher, Peter Frankl, Claude Frank, Anthony Goldstone, Ian Hobson, Terence Judd, Radu Lupu, Rafael Orozco, Alfredo Perl, Hugh Tinney, Geoffrey Tozer and Mitsuko Uchida. Curcio was born in Naples, the daughter of a wealthy Italian businessman and a Brazilian mother, a pianist in her own right, who spotted the girl&apos;s exceptional talent at a very early age. The young Maria gave her first concert aged three and was excited to receive flowers, toys and chocolates from the audience. Her mother became overly ambitious: Maria was tutored at home to leave more time for practising and was urged to accept too many engagements too soon, causing her to describe her childhood as &quot;not a happy one&quot; because there was no time to play or have friends. Her mother did, however, see to it that she received the best possible training, arranging for her to study with Alfredo Casella, Carlo Zecchi and, in Paris, with Nadia Boulanger. When she was invited to play to Mussolini, the seven-year-old, with characteristic strong-mindedness, refused to appear in front of &quot;this man who is ruining our country&quot;. When Maria was 15, Zecchi took her with him to attend the pianist Artur Schnabel&apos;s masterclasses at Lake Como. She played for Schnabel, who immediately accepted her as a student, describing her as &quot;one of the greatest talents I have ever met&quot;. At Schnabel&apos;s home, she also met her future husband, Peter Diamand, who was Schnabel&apos;s secretary. She accompanied the students of Schnabel&apos;s wife, the renowned lieder singer Therese Behr, from whom she claimed to have learned as much as from Schnabel. When he was on tour, she had lessons with Fritz Busch. This was a wonderfully happy time - she worshipped Schnabel and seemed set for a big international career. The outbreak of the second world war changed all this. Schnabel went to America and Diamand returned to Holland, where he would eventually become director of the Holland festival. Curcio went along and stayed with him and his mother in Amsterdam. She performed often until Jews were banned from playing in public, and she turned down all offers of engagements in protest. The Diamands were Jewish and Curcio was in considerable danger through her close association with them. Urgent appeals from her parents to return to Italy were ignored. The situation deteriorated and Diamand and his mother went into hiding. Curcio looked after them, risking her life to get food and obtain forged identity papers for them. Through stress, deprivation and malnutrition, she contracted tuberculosis and had to spend many months in a sanatorium after the war. She was left far too weak to play but, with great dedication, she started to rebuild her technique, giving concerts when she was well enough to do so. Artists she collaborated with included Benjamin Britten, Carlo Maria Giulini, Szymon Goldberg, Otto Klemperer, Josef Krips, Pierre Monteux and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. After hearing her in recital, the conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler suggested to Walter Legge that she should record Schubert for HMV, but another health crisis prevented this from happening. Curcio and Diamand married in 1947. Her health meant a performing career was no longer an option, so she turned her attention to teaching, believing she had always had a gift for it, having worked with Schnabel&apos;s students, many of whom were older than her. She also coached singers at the behest of Krips when he conducted the Netherlands Opera. As an Italian, she had a natural affinity with bel canto and it is no surprise that Mozart and Chopin featured prominently in the repertoire she assigned to students. With the help of Britten, she settled in London in 1965 and it was here that her &quot;second career&quot; really took off. Annie Fischer, Giulini and Rostropovich sent students to her and soon young pianists were flocking to her door. She was insistent that students should progress step by step and if anyone appeared unrealistically ambitious, she would say: &quot;One does not build a house from the roof.&quot; I started studying with Curcio in 1970, and so began an inspirational association that would last almost until 2006, when she moved to Portugal. I used to marvel at the acuteness of her aural perception. She would sometimes stand with her back to the piano and say: &quot;I think your left wrist is rather high.&quot; How she could do this without seeing my hands, used to puzzle me until I realised that for her there was no division between music and technique. A &quot;beautiful sound&quot; was of little interest to her - what she searched for was a sound that would convey the essence of a work. Although she advocated studying away from the instrument, &quot;we must hear what we see and see what we hear&quot;, she was immensely practical in dealing with the physical aspects of piano playing. Her willingness to adapt to each student, and her generosity (she sometimes taught without charge those who could not afford lessons) testify to her desire to help others. Curcio was no Schnabel clone. Although his edition of the Beethoven Sonatas was always at hand in her studio, she preferred students to work from the Henle Urtext. The Austro-German repertoire was central to her teaching but, thanks to her studies with Casella, she was equally at home with French music. When I played Jan\u00e1c...#728;ek&apos;s rarely performed Capriccio for her, her insight seemed so instinctive that I wondered if she had encountered the work before. &quot;No darling, but I do know Jenufa,&quot; she replied. Her interests ranged far beyond music. She spoke Italian, English, French, Dutch and German and collected art. As her teaching career began to draw to a close, Curcio became increasingly aware of her musical legacy and, during one of our last conversations, she expressed her happiness that her former students taught at each of the four London conservatoires, and many worldwide. Her marriage to Peter was dissolved in 1971. Maria was lovingly cared for during her final illness by her one-time housekeeper, Luzia Pidgon. Barry Douglas writes: Maria Curcio was an extraordinary human being, musician, teacher, cook and friend. She clarified music and technique and, to this day, I benefit from her wisdom. She told me she had worked out all these answers while lying in a hospital bed in Holland; she was recovering from TB. Apparently Otto Klemperer was in the same hospital and flirted dreadfully, managing to spill all her orange juice over her. Maria&apos;s lessons lasted for hours and I would go every day. She never stood still, but continually renewed and relearned her craft and passed it quickly on to her students. Once she showed me a particular muscle at the top of the arm of the right hand which enabled her to play with more of a singing tone, and I use it to this day.  \u2022 Maria Curcio, pianist and teacher, born 27 August 1919; died 30 March 2009", "sentences": ["Curcio went along and stayed with him and his mother in Amsterdam."], "title": "Obituary: Maria Curcio", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/14/obituary-maria-curcio", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-14T11:16:24Z", "article": " Preamble Hello. In The Usual Suspects, while appraising the prospect of walking into apparently certain death, McManus claims &quot;there&apos;s nothing that can&apos;t be done&quot;. The fact that he was cold and stiff within half an hour suggests flawed judgement a slightly misplaced braggadocio , and his theory doesn&apos;t really stand up top the most cursory look at tonight&apos;s non-contest between Bayern Munich and Barcelona. In the history of European football, no side has ever overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit to go through. It is not going to happen tonight. But when there&apos;s an opportunity to watch this extraordinary Barcelona side, arguably the most aesthetically appealing in the game&apos;s history (Sid Lowe aptly said on yesterday&apos;s Football Weekly that they are playing &quot;a different sport&quot; to Real Madrid), who gives one? Sure they won&apos;t bring their A-game tonight, but then their B-sides are superior to anything else out there. Think of this as the Talk Show Host to the Street Spirit of the first leg; the Glad To See Y&apos; Back Again to the first leg&apos;s Bluetonic; the Magpie to the first leg&apos;s Girls &amp; Boys. Okay, so it falls down there. Why did Blur produce such rubbish B-sides for the first four albums? Anyway, there is also a chance that Barcelona might want to rub Bayern&apos;s nose in the malodorous stuff. They still owe them one for 1998-99, when Bayern effectively put Barcelona out of their European Cup (the final was at the Camp Nou, and it was their 100th anniversary) by beating them home and away in the group stage.  Failing all that, there&apos;s always Liverpool v Chelsea I suppose. And Murder, She Wrote is on Alibi+1 at 8pm.  At least one team has come back to win 4-0 after being hammered away in the European Cup Sadly for Cypriot side Omonia, their 4-0 victory over Ajax in 1979-80 followed a 10-0 evisceration in Amsterdam. Ajax were without Ruud Krol and Frank Arnesen for that second leg, but I&apos;d still like to know what was in their pre-match meal to lose 4-0 to that shower. Anyway, this YouTube video of that second leg is priceless: the Requiem for a Dream music, delirious celebrations upon making the aggregate score 1-10, and then 2-10 and 3-10 and finally 4-10, a pitch invasion, and some topless bloke charging on the field with a flag.  Team news Lucio and Philipp Lahm return for Bayern, a couple of competent stablehands arriving just in time to watch the horse bolt off into the distance. Bastian Schweinsteiger isn&apos;t in the squad. Hamit Alintop is out with what ITV man has just called a &quot;calf industry&quot;. Barcelona leave Thierry Henry, who has a high temperature, on the bench. Seydou Keita comes in so Andres Iniesta, one of the few Total Footballers in the modern game, moves into the front three. Bayern Munich (4-1-4-1) 22-Hans Joerg Butt; 30-Christian Lell, 6-Martin Demichelis, 3-Lucio, 21-Philipp Lahm; 17-Mark van Bommel; 20-Jose Ernesto Sosa, 16-Andreas Ottl, 15-Ze Roberto, 7-Franck Ribery; 9-Luca Toni.

Referee Roberto Rosetti (Italy)  Yellow-card situation The only Barcelona player who will not play in the first leg of the semi-final against Chelsea is he is booked tonight is the substitute Sergio Busquets. All 18 of the Bayern squad will not play in the first leg of the semi-final, whether they are booked, sent off, hit by polio or just quite well behaved.  The alternative view, from Saj Hussain &quot;This tie isn&apos;t finished yet, as difficult as that may be to fathom. Bayern at home with the crowd behind them are formidable (most of the time). Looking at the teams I predict Ribery and Ze Roberto to double up on Bayern&apos;s left-hand side. Dani Alves is fantastic going forward, but can&apos;t defend for toffee. I expect plenty of crosses going in for Luca Toni, and can see Puyol and Pique struggling aerially. Barca, are 1.02 on Betfair to lay, might be worth risking a couple of quid! Well I managed to persuade myself anyway....&quot;  There&apos;s a full house at the Allianz Arena, which has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that tickets were sold before the first game.  7.45pm A slightly delayed start. No idea why. &quot;While Saj Hussain makes some good points,&quot; begins Matt, &quot;none of that is going to matter if Bayern can&apos;t get the ball off Barca.&quot;  1 min The kick off is precisely 100 seconds late. Barcelona, in yellow, take it and are kicking - no, caressing - from left to right.  3 min Bayern&apos;s coach Jurgen Klinsmann is wearing hideous shoes, pointy-brown numbers that were last seen in Trinny&apos;s worst nightmares. What happened to the fashionista who wore those thrillingly tight white shirts at the last World Cup?  5 min Luca Toni misses an absolute sitter. Abidal gave the ball away to Sosa on the right wing, and he fired over a beautiful cross towards the head of Toni, six yards out and completely unmarked. The height and pace were perfect; it was crying out to be thumped past Victor Valdes. Yet it barely skimmed off Toni&apos;s head and flew to the other side of the field. He mistimed it completely, and that&apos;s a truly appalling miss.  7 min Toni has a goal rightly disallowed. He was approximately 747 yards offside when a cleared corner was bundled back into the box. The corner came after Ribery skinned Alves and Puyol on the Bayern left.  8 min &quot;I know it made it on to &apos;Leisure&apos;, but wasn&apos;t &apos;Sing&apos; originally a B-side?&quot; says Oliver Pattenden, languidly flicking Vs in my direction. &quot;They wrote fewer songs better than that one. I mean, overall you&apos;re right, too many middling covers and inexplicable attempts at music hall revival. It all changed with &apos;Woodpigeon Song&apos;...&quot; It was, and it&apos;s a great song, but I think the B-side was a slightly less accomplished version than the album version. It all changed with &apos;All Your Life&apos;, surely. Mind you that was only used as a B-side because Damon Albarn decided to symbolically reject basically everything he&apos;d ever done up to that point.  11 min Bayern are dominant, and playing with zest and enthusiasm. I give it half an hour before reality bites and they start crying inside.  12 min &quot;Why in the name of God is Messi out there with two yellows?&quot; asks Jeff Woodman. He only has one, doesn&apos;t he? Thanks Howard Webb! Unless this is a truly desperate joke about Barcelona&apos;s yellow kit.  13 min Saj Hussain was right, up to a point: Ze Roberto and Ribery are regularly doubling up on Dani Alves.  14 min Toni&apos;s reverse pass finds the increasingly influential Ribery on the edge of the box. He twists Puyol&apos;s blood, just for laughs, but then fires a fairly tame effort over the bar.  17 min Barcelona haven&apos;t really threatened; there is an understandable absent-mindedness to their passing.  18 min Just in case one or two of you were still reading this, it&apos;s Chelsea 0-1 Liverpool after a wonderfully quick-witted free-kick from Fabio Aurelio/a disgraceful howler from Petr Cech. Bye then!  19 min Dani Alves is booked, correctly, for pulling down Ribery. As I said earlier, only Busquets of the Barcelona XVIII is on a yellow card here. Well, Alves is now, obviously, but you know what I mean.  20 min Alves&apos;s excellent, dipping cross from fairly deep on the right is headed wide by Eto&apos;o, 12 yards out. It was no sort of chance, really, as he had to jump sideways and backwards to reach the ball as it dipped over Lell&apos;s head.  21 min Barcelona have got the passing carousel - what a great phrase that is - going now. Messi plays a gorgeous, curving pass to Iniesta on the left of the box. He ducks inside and finds Eto&apos;o, who can&apos;t control the ball inside the box. Incidentally, am I only the only who, every time I see Messi play, thinks what kind of moron thinks Cristiano Ronaldo or Steven Gerrard is the best player in the world. There&apos;s not even an argument.  22 min The best Blurry B-side was actually Graham Coxon&apos;s &apos;Right To Pop&apos;. Fact.  25 min Now Puyol is booked for an overzealous challenge on Ribery. I say overzealous; it was a shambles, a grotesque scissor-challenge-cum-dry-hump from behind when Ribery was offering no sort of threat by the touchline. They might regret these cards later in the tournament.  26 min So it&apos;s now Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool. Honestly.  29 min Sorry, I&apos;ve lost the thread, trying to comprehend what the hell is happening at Stamford Bridge.  30 min &quot;What you call &apos;less accomplished&apos; (8 mins) I&apos;d call &apos;more delicate and cerebral&apos;,&quot; says Oliver Pattenden, languidly tossing etcs, &quot;but isn&apos;t the real issue not that the B-sides were unappealing before the self-titled album, but that it was the only album with decent B-sides at all (with the possible exception of &apos;So You&apos; and &apos;All We Want&apos;)?&quot; I thought Think Tank had some good B-sides, myself. And what about Daisy, Daisy? Oh.  31 min Somewhere in between minutes 20 and 30, Bayern&apos;s players and fans had their last bit of hope extinguished. So if you want to follow Liverpool&apos;s 47-0 win at Chelsea, you can do so by clicking here.  35 min Alves crunches one just over from the edge of the box. Barcelona are starting to teach Bayern another lesson now, just because they can. This could get what&apos;s another word for messy so it doesn&apos;t look like I&apos;m making a dreadful pun if Barcelona get one before half-time.  36 min Messi escapes Ottl with thrilling ease, then runs the last man Demichelis into the box. It looks like Messi is clear, but Demichelis just stretches out a leg to concede a corner. It&apos;s all Barcelona, and Bayern have no option but to play on the break. At 4-0 down. For one of the great clubs of world football, that&apos;s pretty humiliating.  38 min It&apos;s still Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool. You will know this, of course, as you&apos;re all reading that page. I don&apos;t mind; for once I can legitimately delude myself that it&apos;s not me.  40 min It&apos;s a statement of the obvious, I know, but this Ribery is a player. He has just rolled Puyol with the most delightful turn, although Pique eventually cleaned up the mess.  41 min Van Bommel has just done a number on Messi, as I believe he did last week. In truth I&apos;m not sure he meant it, but as he tried to win possession from the side his fist banged into Messi&apos;s face. Anyway, Messi&apos;s okay now.  42 min Demichelis is booked for a poor sliding challenge on Eto&apos;o by the touchline. He will miss the first leg of the semi-final, should Bayern win this game 77-1.  43 min Van Bommel&apos;s cute reverse pass releases Toni on the left edge of the box, but he slices his effort wide at the near post. It was a three-fifths chance maybe.  44 min This is what Bayern Munich will be listening to at half time.  Half time: Bayern 0-0 Barcelona As expected, that was pleasant, ambient, harmless stuff. Bayern had to score early, but the shambling lummox that is Luca Toni missed a glorious early chance and after that Barcelona began to exert their usual hypnotic control. I&apos;d tell you to come back for the second half but, really, you&apos;ll be wanting to follow events at Stamford Bridge, where it&apos;s Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool.  Half-time chit-chat &quot;We all know about the travelling band of aesthetes that is Barcelona going forward, but does anyone know anything about the goalkeeper Victor Valdes?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;He is kept out of the national side by two useful performers, so he might be good, but he might not. As Chelsea are showing with the genuinely sad post-Stephen Hunt decline of Petr Cech, you don&apos;t win anything with a dodgy keeper.&quot; Tell that to Pele and Jairzinho. It&apos;s inexplicable, but there is a degree of precedent for sides winning things with dodgy keepers. And Valdes is, at the highest level, a joke. You&apos;re right about Cech, though, on both counts.  46 min Off we go again.  47 min &quot;The cornelius remix of tender is the best Blur B-side bar none. Glad we cleared that up,&quot; says Alen Barden, who goes by the stage name Cornelius.  GOAL! Bayern 1-0 Barcelona (Ribery 47) Ah this is a delightful finish. He was played in behind a pretty shoddy offside trap by Ze Roberto, and faced up to Valdes just outside the six-yard box. He dummied Valdes once and then twice to sit him on his doubtless pert bottom, and then rammed the ball high into the net between the defenders who had got back on the line. He really is a Proper Player, and I want him in my gang.  49 min &quot;Rob,&quot; begins Alex Netherton. &quot;Re: the other match. What are we going to do? What are we GOING TO DO? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?&quot; Savour football&apos;s vicissitudes with a smile on our face and do a little dance: that&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do.  51 min Barcelona have been stung by that and have had approximately 99 per cent of the ball since the goal.  52 min John Theodore has asked me not to reveal the Chelsea score, for those of you planning to watch it as live later, so I won&apos;t. It&apos;s not like yoGETINTHEREu&apos;ll be able to disOHOOHOOHOOcern the flow of the game by my mood.  53 min What happened there? Well I suppose I should describe it really. Alves bent another gorgeous ball to the far post for Messi, charging into the box, but he sliced his volley square and into the sliding Lucio, from where it bobbled this far wide of the post. Barcelona went up for a penalty but replays showed it smacked Lucio in the phizog.  55 min Jurgen Klinsmann is excited - and to his credit his shirt is pretty tight - but there is still no real sense that this could happen. Indeedc Barcelona look far the more likely to score. Iniesta pitter-patters past a couple and into the box; then he goes down under a challenge from Van Bommel, but the referee waves him up. Hard to see if it was a foul or not at first look; I suspect not.  56 min &quot;A Song and St Louis from the Charmless Man single are etched on to my ear retinas from repeated listens, but you&apos;re right - they are better post Great Escape. Polished Stone on the Song 2 single is my super mega fave.&quot; I love those lovely super mega faves.  59 min Ribery is causing genuine problems every time he gets the ball. Luca Toni, however, is a desperate lump and attacks keep falling down around him like Jenga towers that have just been sat on.  60 min &quot;The best B-side ever, bar none,&quot; says Gary Naylor, aged 79. It&apos;s this one for me, aged only 78.  62 min Messi, running through on goal onto a simply exquisite disguised through-pass from Iniesta, is wrongly flagged offside. It was brutally tight, but he was just onside.  63 min What a joy Iniesta is. He had the ball on the left, by the halfway line, and teased his way inside and then back outside Van Bommel, whose attempts to win the ball were becoming exponentially malevolent. Then he lifted the ball past Lell, who scythed him down risibly and was booked.  66 min I won&apos;t tell you the Liverpool score I won&apos;t tell you the Liverpool score I won&apos;t tell you the Liverpool score I won&apos;t tell you the Liverpool score I won&apos;t tell you the Liverpool score I won&apos;t tell you the Liverpool score. But you can find it out by clicking here.  67 min Ze Roberto swings a cross into the box, and Toni dives pitifully under no pressure from Pique. That was pathetic, but thankfully the referee was having none of it.  70 min A marvellous goal-saving tackle from Lucio. A long, low, straight pass put Messi behind the defence on the right, and he passed it square across the box, apparently for Eto&apos;o to finish from right on the penalty spot. But just as he was cocking his right foot, Lucio got back to intercept with a telescopic leg. Wonderful stuff.  71 min Messi spanks high and wide from 12 yards after a smart free-kick on the left from Xavi.  GOAL! Bayern 1-1 Barcelona (Keita 73) Well this is another belter. Some chillingly quick one-touch passing, again centred around the wonderful Iniesta, ended with Iniesta on the left of the box fizzing a pass at Xavi on the penalty spot. He controlled it and turned in one movement before laying it off for Keita, 20 yards out, to spank a wonderful left-foot shot into the top corner.  75 min Yes, I do want Andres Iniesta&apos;s babies.  76 min &quot;Just thought I&apos;d end the discussion by reminding you that The Fall&apos;s &apos;Xmas With Simon&apos; is not only the best B-side ever, it&apos;s also the finest Christmas song of all time,&quot; chirps Mac Millings.  77 min A flurry of substitutions. Hamit Altintop - I thought he had a groin thing - replaces Sosa, Borowski replaces Ze Roberto; and, for Barcelona, Alexandr Hleb (remember him?) replaces my future husband. What a truly glorious player Andres Iniesta is. All those dreadful 0-0 draws we have had to endure down the years; all that thud and blunder and witless garbage and Francis Benali; it&apos;s all worth it every time you watch him play*. And he&apos;s going to be mine! *I suppose you could just watch Barcelona games. I hadn&apos;t thought of that.  78 min Lahm does one of those familiar slaloms infield from the left, past a couple of Barcelona midfielders, but his low shot from the edge of the box is straight at Valdes.  80 min Borowski has a goal disallowed. I have no idea why, as my attention was taken by yet another goal at Stamford Bridge. THere were no complaints, though, so I suspect a legitimate offside decision.  81 min Make that yet another goal at Stamford Bridge. Anyone mind if I turn over?  82 min &quot;No,&quot; says Alex Netherton, before adding, for clarity: &quot;No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.No. No. No. No. No.No. No. No. No. No.No. No. No. No. No.No. No. No. No. No.&quot; He is a Bayern fan, obviously.  84 min So this is Tom Bason&apos;s nomination for the best-ever B-side. But surely that&apos;s only good when it&apos;s part of this.  85 min From the left corner of the box, Xavi bends a free-kick into the side netting at the near post. Nice effort.  87 min It&apos;s just drifting to sleep now. David Pleat, on ITV, says that Jurgen Klinsmann hasn&apos;t been brave enough; that Bayern haven&apos;t got in Barcelona&apos;s faces. He might have a point but it&apos;s a fine line between showing too much respect for a team and knowing full well you&apos;re hopelessly out of your depth against one of the greatest club sides in living memory.  Full time: Bayern Munich 1-1 Barcelona There are just four seconds of added time, and that&apos;s that. Barcelona did what they had to do, and their only regret will be yellow cards for Puyol and Alves in the first half, although they will still be available for the first leg against Chelsea or Liverpool in a fortnight&apos;s time. Thanks for all your emails and B-side links, which I&apos;ll rummage through when I get home.

Rangers had fined the pair and banned them for two weeks over their drinking session after returning from Scotland&apos;s World Cup qualifier in Amsterdam last month and for making V-signs as they sat on the substitutes&apos; bench during the match against Iceland. Although a fortnight ago Smith had privately made it clear that neither would play for Rangers again, they will return to training tomorrow. He said that stance had changed following comments made by the SFA president, George Peat, and George Burley, the international manager. &quot;I did say in an off-the-record briefing to journalists that they would not play for the club again,&quot; the former Scotland manager explained. &quot;Since then I have had a think about it and I have looked at the way it has been handled by the SFA. The president said the issue, the original problem [the drinking session], was not handled properly, then George Burley said it had not been handled properly. &quot;So I ask myself: if the SFA admit they did not handle it properly, am I being harsh?

When I was four or five this really scared me because of the line &quot;I can look inside your head&quot;. Years later, I was in Amsterdam and declaiming the song to my then-girlfriend, and I almost had a citizen&apos;s arrest put on me by passers-by who objected to my rendition. Then recently I was watching an awful Piers Morgan programme about Monte Carlo, and I was reminded of the song again as it describes a poor girl from Naples joining the jet-set.  My first love affairBurning up, Madonna (1983) I started going out with this girl when I was 21 - I was a late developer - and she wasn&apos;t really bothered about music. She had three records: Madonna&apos;s first album, Parade by Prince and, weirdly, Howard Devoto&apos;s solo album. At the time I would never have listened to Madonna, being Mr Alternative, but being limited by my girlfriend&apos;s musical choices I found myself hearing this track a lot, and ultimately really liking it. It educated me about my latent musical snobbishness. Hearing it now reminds me of a happy period.  The song that reminds me of art schoolFrench Kiss, Lil Louis (1989) It&apos;s the end of the 80s and the beginning of my raving days, and this track encapsulates that time. If you described it to someone it would be nudge nudge, wink wink because it features a woman faking an orgasm, but it&apos;s revolutionary. It features one riff that goes on and on, and when you&apos;re at one of those parties and you might have partaken of a substance it makes perfect sense. It exists in its own space-time continuum and certainly isn&apos;t a song in a normal sense: more a stimulus for dancing based around a simulated orgasm.  The song that reminds me of my sonMilk and alcohol, Dr Feelgood (1978)It&apos;s unfortunate that I associate this with my five-year-old, and it certainly doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;ve been using alcohol to pacify him. I&apos;d look at the most played list on iTunes - it&apos;s interesting because you create your own charts that way - and I was surprised that this was in the top five. Then I realised: my son had learned to use my computer and he kept playing Milk and Alcohol. The composer Raymond Scott made great electronic music for kids, but that gets taken off as soon as I put it on. Why my son likes Dr Feelgood so much, I don&apos;t know.  The last song I heardThe whole world&apos;s got the eyes on you, Legendary Tigerman (2008)It&apos;s important to be looking for new things, to stay interested. I was wandering around Paris recently when I went into a new record shop and they were playing this. Legendary Tigerman appears to be a guy from Portugal without the greatest grip of English, if you go by the title. This song sounds a bit like Alan Vega from Suicide when he went solo - minimal rockabilly made by a guy with a guitar and a drum machine. Tigerman&apos;s got a highly designed website, and he likes pictures of himself with naked or semi-naked women.  Strange and possibly true 1 Cocker&apos;s mother maintains that gravel-voiced singer Joe Cocker - no relation - fitted the fire for her first flat in Sheffield in the early 60s. 2 The first song Cocker ever wrote, Shakespeare Rock, features the line: &quot;Said baby you make me sick / She said Alas, poor Yorick.&quot;  3 His biggest hit with Pulp, Common People, was based on the story of a fellow pupil at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, who could have been on any fine art course but &quot;sculpture&quot; sounded better.  4 Playing with the pegs of a toy guitar, Cocker&apos;s son created an unusual tuning that he then used as the basis for two songs on his 2006 debut solo album.  5 His second solo album, due to be released in May, has been produced by former Big Black and Rapeman frontman Steve Albini.

He was the coolest guy around. With his uniform of white Levis and huge cigar, he cut an intriguing modernist figure. He had great charisma, and his eloquence was dazzling. When he spoke, you felt plugged in to all the excitement and beauty of the new pop age.  He would give us projects, and then give a critique of our work at the end of the week. It could be quite difficult to follow, but in the sense that he led by example it was also very inspiring. I was aware that he was doing his own work in his studio, and as the months went by I got the sense of his importance as a great artist. The school was polarised into the hip crowd, who followed Richard and a Pop approach to art, and others who preferred the more European, older school of painting. Richard&apos;s work was remarkably modern - and I found it hugely inspirational to discover paintings where the subject could be the contour of an American car or Marilyn Monroe. It seemed very fresh and of the time that we lived in. And yet there was a sense of great skill here too; here was somebody who could not only draw brilliantly, but who also had an amazing conceptual power. Some artists perfect one particular kind of picture throughout their career. Hamilton is much more diverse, and you get the sense of a cool intelligence leaping around. Some people found the work soulless, but I didn&apos;t. He made art become much more a part of my life, to the point that I found it was influencing everything I did. I knew that I wanted Roxy Music to be very eclectic, stylistically, but I wasn&apos;t conscious of wanting to create a particular style. There was a lot of music in my head, and when I started writing songs all manner of influences came up, juxtaposed. And so the Hamiltonian concept of collage does spring to mind, taking elements from here, there and everywhere, and from them creating something new... It is difficult to overestimate the influence that Richard has had on British art and design. He is revered by several generations, and is in many ways both our Warhol and our Duchamp - a pioneer artist and conceptual master. Which can be, for any true innovator, a very lonely and exposed position to occupy.  He once remarked that I was his &quot;greatest creation&quot; - which I find hard to believe... However, I have no idea what he thought of my work as a student; I don&apos;t see as much of him as I would like. We are both quite private people, who tend to be preoccupied with our own work. I have always admired him immensely from afar, and I would not have been the same artist were it not for his tremendous example. Lars Ulrich on Asger Jorn The Cobra movement was the closest you will get to a European equivalent of the Abstract Expressionist movement that came out of the States after the second world war. Cobra stands for Copenhagen Brussels and Amsterdam - it was a bunch of painters, poets, writers and intellectuals that got together in 1948 and signed a manifesto to try to come up with a new way to try to approach art. Which was basically to approach art without a particular starting point; almost with an innocence or even the ignorance of a child. There would be a relationship with the moment.  Certainly the painters in the movement - Asger Jorn, Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky - were most successful. I felt a particular kinship, especially with Jorn, who was Danish like me. He&apos;s probably the painter I&apos;ve studied and collected the most. He spent most of his life, up to 1945, painting without any sense of inspiration or direction. But in 1945 he started painting a lot of almost troll-like figures, very small in the canvas, stuff that had a relation to Nordic myth. There were lots of threads here to, for instance, African art, like with what Jean Dubuffet brought up with his visits to Africa in the 1930s and 40s. Jorn and Dubuffet became close - they even made records together! Later in the 50s Jorn became a lot more abstract. But most people who champion him would say the 60s were his strongest decade, up until his death in 1973. I own a bunch of his stuff - for me, he&apos;s one of the few artists that every different thing he painted had a particular meaning and strength to it. Art to me is not decorative; it&apos;s a passion.  Mike D on Sage Vaughn Friends had told me about Sage Vaughn&apos;s paintings, because he lives in [Los Angeles hipster &apos;hood] Silverlake and there&apos;s a lot of people he knows I know. And then completely coincidentally, here in New York, he had a show in 2005, Where Eagles Dare, at the Dactyl Foundation. My wife wandered in and immediately called me - &quot;You&apos;ve got to see this show.&quot; Which is something that generally never happens.  The show encompassed exactly what I think of when I think of Sage&apos;s work: big, seemingly beautiful pastoral canvases. Then, after you look at them for more than 10 seconds, you realise that, actually, they&apos;re incredibly dark. There&apos;s this intense combination of human beauty and violence and death.  We live in New York now but for a while in the 90s the Beastie Boys had a studio in LA and a lot of that industrial iconography and language that you see in his paintings was like the area where the studio was located. It was in a weird area called Atwater and from the outside you almost could have been in a small town, but then if you went a couple of blocks off the main street there were riverbeds and gangs. Misfit (American Nightmare) (2008), is great - a kid in a Spider-Man costume, with a burning car behind him. Sage is weird - he comes from some punk rock and graffiti background. But I would never think of lumping him in with street art in any way, other than I think the vocabulary he uses makes it relevant [to that scene]. Nitin Sawhney on Antony Gormley I&apos;ve always admired the way Antony Gormley approaches things from a very humanistic perspective. He&apos;s very accessible, people feel an immediate empathy with his work because it&apos;s from the perspective of the human form. I&apos;ve always been interested in Renaissance art and humanism, and I think he&apos;s really drawing on a lot of those ideas.  I went to the White Cube gallery in London to see Firmament (2008) and found it very powerful. So I asked him if I could make a response to it and did a concert at the gallery, performing by the sculpture. It&apos;s made of what seemed like scaffolding but as you stand back, it is amazing to see that it is a human form. Although he works from the point of view of his own body, he sees that body as being completely connected to everything else. That&apos;s what I respond to in his work.  That sense of how everything links up is kind of what I made my album London Undersound about. He came down to the studio while I was making the album. We had no agenda in mind, he just wanted to hear it. But he enjoyed it enough to respond artistically. He asked me if he could have a copy - I think he was the first person I gave it to - and he came back with all this amazing art. It was quite weird how he captured the intention, and the feelings, and the thoughts behind a track perfectly. It&apos;s almost like I could have made the music to the drawings, rather than the other way around. He sent me the original of the work that&apos;s on the front cover of the album, which I was blown away by. Alison Goldfrapp on Hans Bellmer Hans Bellmer was one of the surrealists. He&apos;s best known for his photographs of strange dolls, called Die Puppe (1934). Some of those images are pretty graphic and morbid; some are undoubtedly pervy. He definitely objectifies the female body. I&apos;m more fond of his drawings, engravings and lithographs. I love the delicateness of the pencil and ink on paper. What&apos;s amazing is the intricacy and draughtsmanship, the precision and detail. And they&apos;re erotic and morbid and luxurious. The Beatles&apos; withdrawn &quot;butcher&quot; album sleeve was supposedly influenced by him.  There&apos;s one image called Double Cephalopod, which features a girl wearing stripey stockings. It&apos;s about recreating the body and making it one big erogenous zone, if you like. And stripey socks have definitely influenced my visual references, especially during the Black Cherry period.  I&apos;m attracted to surrealism in general, I think. My Dad used to have lots of books on surrealist artists when I was a kid, and I used to love looking in them, at all these crazy objects that were very dreamlike. I think kids like surrealism because it is just these crazy things mashed together, like in collage. It&apos;s very simple.  I just saw these beautiful erotic drawings. I never saw that they could possibly be sinister - even though they were young girls. And now I know that I think, Oh God! But I try to ignore that because he&apos;s a brilliant artist. Kayne West on Takashi Murakami It was my road manager who first introduced me to the work of Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. He showed me a bunch of his work and said he was his favourite artist. I really liked the colours that Murakami used, and how fine the lines were; I thought he was amazing. When I saw his Hiropon sculpture for the first time, the female statue with the big breasts, I just really wanted to buy it. I was like, &quot;I want that statue, I need that statue in my life, it represents me so much.&quot; Then I saw his My Lonesome Cowboy, which I really liked as well. So, first, I went to see the sculptures in person, and then we just started talking with Murakami about doing some jewellery together. We were drawing on pieces of paper and I said: &quot;Man, you should just do the album cover.&quot; So he did the cover art for Graduation [West&apos;s 2007 album], and it was just an incredible thing, a really great collaboration. I definitely find someone like Murakami to be more inspiring nowadays than another musician. I&apos;m more influenced by awe-inspiring art, film and visuals than by listening to someone&apos;s music. It&apos;s like, if I went by Murakami&apos;s or David LaChapelle&apos;s studio and I saw what they were doing and working on, then that would inspire me to just go away and create some music that was on that level. Paul Weller of Peter Blake The first thing I was aware of was his sleeve for Sgt Pepper. I just loved the detail. Then when I was a bit older, being such a 60s-centric freak, I went to exhibitions, bought books on Pop Art. Hearing Pete Townshend talk about it had a big impact. Having Peter Blake work on the sleeve for Stanley Road came about through Simon Halfon, who&apos;s done all my sleeves. I thought someone like Peter would be unapproachable, but he was so down to earth. Simon and I told him what areas of his work we really liked - the collage work, which is his forte. So we brought in bits and pieces, and Peter added stuff. The cover is a painting of me as a kid, taken from an old photo, and in it I&apos;m holding a photograph of me as I was then, in 1995.  The only Peter Blake I own is a print of Stanley Road, which Peter gave me. And I&apos;ve got a reproduction of the 1968 Babe Rainbow tin poster. Peter&apos;s associated with the 60s but his work is like anything classic: it&apos;s going to last. Such people might go underground but they don&apos;t really go away.

On the other side of the car park is a Subway and a Pizza Hut. Over the roundabout, a 24-hour Tesco. Around the corner, a leisure centre. And everywhere, the endless flow of cars. Above all, stretching out into the distance, there are bland, modern houses: neat cubes with white garage doors, tidy patios and small windows. &quot;You know, they&apos;re mortgaged to the hilt,&quot; says Gregory Burke, who knew this well-heeled part of Dunfermline when it was all fields. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a bad thing that people have nice houses and cars, but it&apos;s not sustainable. My dad had a mortgage for \u00a310,000 in 1979 - and he was astonished anyone could owe that much.&quot; Burke&apos;s new play Hoors (a Scottish rendering of the word &quot;whores&quot;) is set in these houses. It tells the story of Andy, a young man who fails to make it back home alive from his stag weekend in Amsterdam, a trip that sees him join the mile-high club. The play is a black comedy with a stark message for our straitened times: the days of plenty are over.  The end, in the form of unemployment and repossessions, is nigh. And places such as Dunfermline, sustained by borrowing, will feel it first.  Until recently, Burke, now 41, was touting Hoors as the &quot;disappointing follow-up to Black Watch&quot; - displaying the self-deprecating humour typical of this man brought up in the tough expat naval community of Gibraltar, and in a working-class area of Dunfermline during the miners&apos; strike. But he does have a point: it will be tough for Hoors to match the success of Black Watch, his riveting story of &quot;The Gallant Forty-Twa&quot;, as the now-amalgamated Scottish regiment was known. Based on interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, Black Watch hurtled its cast from a smoky Fife pool room to a world of bullets, bombs and brutal death. Last month, it picked up four Olivier awards, including one for best new play.  Today, Burke is feeling much more positive about Hoors, which opens at Edinburgh&apos;s Traverse next month before touring the UK: &quot;I really like the script. It&apos;s funny and it&apos;s done all the things I wanted it to do.&quot; There are several reasons why Burke chose the play&apos;s title. &quot;It&apos;s not a searing verbatim exploration of the sex industry. It&apos;s a metaphor. We&apos;re all whores. We all believe in what we believe at the time, and say what we want to get somewhere. How often do we reveal our true feelings?&quot; Behind the drama&apos;s ribald comedy is the suggestion that not only is its lead character no more, but so is the very lifestyle he led. The era of cheap flights and wild weekends in Amsterdam is over. &quot;I always had this idea that Andy was a builder who&apos;d made a bit of money and had a nice life,&quot; he says. &quot;But it was all an illusion. As soon as he dies, his fiancee is relieved - because she didn&apos;t want the money but couldn&apos;t articulate that at the time.&quot; We stop for coffee at the Inn on the Park, a place where a man can order a lunchtime pint while two elderly women chat over a pot of tea, as Sky Sports plays in the background. They don&apos;t get many playwrights in these parts. Yet it was these parts, and the people who live in them, that inspired Burke&apos;s first play, back in 2001. The story of two factory workers who take a visiting manager prisoner, Gagarin Way bagged an Edinburgh Fringe First award, blazed into the National and then transferred to the West End. Hailed by this newspaper as a &quot;blistering, brilliant, crazily confident first play&quot;, it was an astonishing feat for a novice playwright, and it allowed Burke to chuck in his job making inkjet cartridges at a factory in Rosyth.  Burke&apos;s big influence is Alan Bleasdale, who showed a similar gift for gallows humour in his portrayal of raw working-class life in the 1982 TV series Boys from the Black Stuff. Burke, too, is branching out into small-screen drama. One Night in Emergency, a TV play about to start filming in Glasgow, tells the story of a man whose life falls to pieces during a day he spends in an overworked casualty department, where his wife has been admitted for a minor complaint. He finds himself drawn into the labyrinthine building, where violent patients are tended by drug-addicted staff.  Like Bleasdale, Burke seeks out the humour in tragedy: &quot;I like raucousness,&quot; says the playwright, whose severe, shaven-headed looks belie a friendly and garrulous demeanour. &quot;The trick is to use it with subjects that mean something. When I&apos;m asked to write a hard-hitting drama, I can&apos;t do it - because when I&apos;m writing about the hard-hitting aspect, I just think, &apos;This guy would be having a laugh and making a joke of it.&apos; That&apos;s the natural instinct of people in those situations, and that&apos;s the way you can make it entertaining to an audience. I hope Hoors is hilariously funny about the end of the economic boom that&apos;s going to turn everybody&apos;s lives to dust.&quot;  A few days after we meet, news breaks that the town&apos;s 130-year-old Dunfermline Building Society is in trouble and up for sale, having lost \u00a326m in the property market. For Burke, this probably came as little surprise. &quot;How many people actually like this life? Do they really want this? We all buy into consumerism, we have been allowed to indulge ourselves, but it doesn&apos;t make us happier&quot;.", "sentences": ["It tells the story of Andy, a young man who fails to make it back home alive from his stag weekend in Amsterdam, a trip that sees him join the mile-high club.", "The era of cheap flights and wild weekends in Amsterdam is over."], "title": "Gregory Burke's Black Watch follow-up, Hoors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/20/gregory-burke-hoors-black-watch", "tags": ["Gregory Burke", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-20T22:23:51Z", "article": "At the start of the season 12 of Holland&apos;s foremost football pundits were asked to predict the final standings of the season for Voetbal International&apos;s season guide. Ten picked Ajax to become champions and two backed PSV to win a fifth straight title. None chose AZ Alkmaar. In fact, none selected AZ to come second either. Varying from third to 13th, the sum of the pundits&apos; votes predicted that AZ would come fifth or sixth. However ludicrous they appear now, those picks were hard to fault. In the previous season AZ had come 11th and had even faced relegation, after blowing the title on the final day of the season prior to that. Near the end of 2007-08 the manager, Louis van Gaal, had decided to leave the club by the end of year, only to be swayed by a desperate squad. With hardly a new player of note and the same manager at the helm, there was not much reason to suspect things would be better this year. Sure enough, AZ were hopeless in their first two Eredivisie games of the season. But after losing away to a spirited NAC, 2-1, and ADO, 3-0, something changed. In spite of claiming that the ADO game had been &quot;AZ&apos;s best in six months&quot;, Van Gaal abandoned his stubbornness at long last and placed pragmatism before idealism, turning his side into a deadly counter-attacking team rather than a classical Dutch pressing-and-possession side. The impact was immediate. At home to PSV, AZ managed to hold shape against the in-form defending champions long enough for Maarten Martens to score the only goal for the Alkmaarders with a nifty chip in the 82nd minute. Growing more comfortable with their system as the season progressed, their combination-football appeared ever more fluid and natural. Inevitably AZ passed their way to the most convincing championship in recent memory. AZ had not even lost a league game since making the change until Saturday, when one last win would have assured the title. Before their adoring home crowd against a poor Vitesse side they had every chance of winning. But they blew it, losing 2-1. &quot;We were much better than Vitesse but just didn&apos;t play well,&quot; said van Gaal, flashing his inimitable logic. &quot;The way their goals fell, it was unbelieveable. I told the lads in the dressing room that Vitesse&apos;s were lucky goals. You can&apos;t imagine this ahead of time, that you lose through two deflected shots.&quot; Indeed, Ricky van Wolfswinkel&apos;s goal had come courtesy of a lucky bounce off AZ defender Gill Swerts while Alexander B\u00fcttner saw his shot bounce off Swerts again and drop into the net after Mounir El Hamdaoui had given AZ the lead. But the only remaining team with a mathematical chance of keeping AZ from glory, Ajax, took a 6-2 tonking at the hands of PSV on Sunday, making AZ champions by default. Deciding the title in the most anticlimactic of ways was fitting for a season defying logic and reason. That was no comfort to Ajax. &quot;This shouldn&apos;t be possible in a situation where a coaching staff and a squad have been training, talking, celebrating and mourning together for nearly 10 months,&quot; said Maarten Wijffels of Algemeen Dagblad. But it was deserved. Despite seeing their 28-match unbeaten run come to an end, AZ&apos;s dominance was total. There were good wins, mediocre wins and bad wins. But they were wins, nonetheless, unlike last season. Championships, after all, are won in the bad games, not in the good ones. The first champion not named Ajax, PSV or Feyenoord since 1981, when AZ won their only other championship, certainly benefited from an off-year by all the others. But to write this title off as a statistical aberration would do it wrong, as it was won fair and square, and the poor displays of their rivals was just as much a product of AZ&apos;s dominance as it was of their own dysfunctionality. Many credit the chairman and owner, Dirk Scheringa, a wealthy banker who started out as a policeman, filling out friends&apos; tax forms and supplying the occasional loan, who turned a failing club around. &quot;Praise often concentrated on Van Gaal, the man allowed to complete Scheringa&apos;s life&apos;s work,&quot; wrote the columnist Chris van Nijnatten. &quot;But this title has to be credited to Scheringa&apos;s account. In 15 years he built, with his own means, a big regional club.&quot; Van Gaal, of course, credits himself. &quot;It&apos;s incredible what we&apos;ve achieved. The other clubs, Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord, have a much higher budget. We&apos;ve had to make due with lesser players and lesser means,&quot; said Van Gaal, whose squad, however, is the best in the country and whose infrastructure and transfer budget are among the best. &quot;This is great for the players. For me, personally, this championship will be my greatest little masterpiece,&quot; he had said earlier, though there should have been a greater one \u2013 he failed to get the most talented Holland side of all time to the World Cup in 2002. When he wanted to leave, the players &quot;wanted to show that they are worthy of Louis van Gaal,&quot; added the aforementioned, whose neurosis is such that he even instructs the guy mowing the field how many millimetres the grass should measure. But Van Gaal&apos;s love for tooting his own horn through a megaphone does not take away from AZ&apos;s performance. The 1981 AZ champions had a budget that was on a par with the &apos;Big Three&apos;, whereas the current squad lag a little behind. And, unlike 28 years ago, AZ have learned to put the fans first, taking to the streets right after Ajax&apos;s hammering, rather than celebrating privately, the way they did then. Van Gaal did lament his inability to address the crowd. &quot;If I&apos;d had a microphone it would have been more fun,&quot; he said. &quot;The people do really want that \u2013 for me to talk to them.&quot; Aside from now being AZ&apos;s longest-serving manager ever, Van Gaal also won his 12th big prize in charge of a Dutch side, equalling Guus Hiddink&apos;s record. Van Gaal now counts four domestic titles, a Champions League, a Uefa Cup, an Intercontinental Cup and some other scrap metal accumulated at Ajax and Barcelona, including a Liga title or two. But life after Van Gaal, who plans one more season at AZ, looks just as promising. Their support in elementary schools in the Noord-Holland province, a bastion of Ajaxness, is now reputedly on a par with the giants from Amsterdam. &quot;AZ are the champions of hope,&quot; said Willem Vissers of De Volkskrant. &quot;The province has struck again and victory has befallen Alkmaar.&quot; &quot;Once a year PSV become champions of the Netherlands,&quot; concluded Nik Kok of Algemeen Dagblad. &quot;But not this year.&quot; After 28 years the Eredivisie hegemony of Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord has been broken. AZ are the undisputed champions of the Netherlands. The kings are dead. Long live the king.

They are going to play against Chelsea on 30 May. That means, if they will able to win the Cup, the four teams out of the first five in Premier League table will be beaten by them on the road,&quot; notes Firat Topal, speaking on behalf of a number of Everton fans who emailed us this week. &quot;Has this ever happened before? Has any team ever had to take a tougher road to winning the FA Cup? Where to start with this one. Perhaps the clearest way would be to first establish a points system, whereby a team&apos;s opponents&apos; final league positions (from 1-92 and beyond if necessary) are converted into points. By that criteria a team with the lowest Total Toughness Rating\u2122 can be considered to have had the hardest Cup run (no, it doesn&apos;t take away games into account or the league positions at the time of the Cup ties, but this is going to be complicated enough as it is). Everton&apos;s Total Toughness Rating\u2122 this season - were they to beat Chelsea, and assuming teams remain in their current league positions - would be worked out thusly: Macclesfield 88 points Aston Villa 5 points Middlesbrough 18 points Liverpool 2 points Manchester United 1 point Chelsea 3 points TOTAL 117 points (or an average of 19.5) Chelsea&apos;s, in contrast would be: Southend 52 points Ipswich 29 points Watford 36 points Coventry 35 points Arsenal 4 points Everton 6 points TOTAL 162 points (or an average of 27.6) So of the previous 127 Cup winners has anyone had a harder ride than David Moyes side? On this statistical criteria, we&apos;ve turned up plenty and below are a handful of examples. Let&apos;s turn the clock back exactly 100 years to Manchester United&apos;s victory in 1908-09: Brighton (18th in the Southern League) 58 points Everton 2 points Blackburn 4 points Burnley 34 points Newcastle 1 point Bristol City 8 points TOTAL: 107 points And, particularly impressively, to United&apos;s Cup win in 1947-48: Aston Villa 6 points Liverpool 11 points Charlton 13 points Preston North End 7 points Derby 4 points Blackpool 9 points TOTAL 50 points United&apos;s 1998-99 victory (suggested by one Red in the Guardian office), also weighs in at a Total Toughness Rating\u2122 of 79 (Middlesbrough 9th, Liverpool 7th, Fulham 45th, Chelsea 3rd, Liverpool 2nd and Newcastle 13th). More recently, Arsenal in 2001-02 can claim a TTR\u2122 lower than Everton&apos;s: Watford 34 points Liverpool 2 points Gillingham 32 points Newcastle 4 points Middlesbrough 12 points Chelsea 6 points TOTAL 90 points So can Everton&apos;s city rivals, Liverpool, in 1985-86: Norwich 23 points Chelsea 6 points York City 51 points Watford 12 points Southampton 14 points Everton 2 points TOTAL 108 points And 2005-06: Luton Town 30 points Portsmouth 17 points Manchester Utd 2 points Birmingham 18 points Chelsea 1 point West Ham 9 points TOTAL 77 points But all this does seem rather unfair on the Toffees. As Gareth fears, it&apos;s that third round tie against Macclesfield that is skewing their stats. Indeed, replace the Silkmen with a mid-table Championship side and Everton would dip very close to Liverpool&apos;s &apos;06 Total Toughness Rating\u2122. It&apos;s only fair, then, that we try another tack \u2014 has any side won the Cup having beaten four of the top-flight&apos;s top five? You can see above that Manchester United beat three of the top four in 1909, and in 1948 beat six of the league&apos;s top 13. The 11-time Cup winners also beat four of the top nine in 1998-99. Arsenal beat three of the top six \u2014 Chelsea, Newcastle and Liverpool \u2014 in 2001/02. In 1895-96, Sheffield Wednesday beat three of the top five \u2014 Everton, Bolton and Sunderland. In 1905-06, Everton themselves beat three of the top four \u2014 Preston, Wednesday and Newcastle \u2014 on the way to the trophy. In 1951-52, Newcastle United beat Aston Villa (6th) at St James&apos;s Park and Tottenham (2nd), Portsmouth (4th) and Arsenal (3rd) and the mid-table second division teams of Blackburn and Swansea on the road. But no one, according to the Knowledge&apos;s in-depth it&apos;s-taken-us-all-ruddy-day research, has beaten four of the top of five en route to the Cup. Of course, if Everton themselves pip Villa to fifth place, they&apos;ll deny themselves a potential place in history. Does that mean a victory for Moyes&apos; boys on 30 May would be the hardest-earned Cup win ever? That&apos;s open to debate, but it would certainly stake a decent claim. FEWER DRAWS THAN A MAN ALLERGIC TO UNDERWEAR &quot;Sporting Gijon have played 30 games this season in La Liga and are yet to earn a draw. Has anyone from a major European top flight league ever gone throughout a whole season without a draw?&quot; asked Ed Hall last week. Well, &apos;sort of&apos; is the answer we can glean from this correspondence from Davids Ekstrand. &quot;\u00c5tvidaberg managed to play 22 games in the Swedish Allsvenskan 1968, winning 11 and losing 11,&quot; writes David, playing fast and loose with the word &quot;major&quot;. &quot;Helsingborg also managed to go through the 1946-47 season without a draw as did AIK in 1943-44. Two more examples are AIK in 1924/25 (winning 12 and losing 10) and Helsingborg (or H\u00e4lsingborg as the name was spelled back then) in 1926/27 (winning 16 and losing 6) though it should be noted that Allsvenskan, despite being the highest league in the country, did not officially get the title of Swedish Championship until the 1930/31 season.&quot; CONTACT SPORT (2) Last week we looked at the players who have been stymied by contact lens problems during games, but we hadn&apos;t heard of a botched Acuvue that had serious repurcussions for the player&apos;s team. Until now, that is. &quot;Back in 1997, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid played Ajax in the Champions League quarter finals,&quot; writes Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Pedraza. &quot;Atl\u00e9tico got a 1-1 draw in Amsterdam, and played the second leg at home, in the Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium. &quot;Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s right-back, Carlos Aguilera, lost one of his contact lenses, and went to the touchline to put it back in. In the meantime, Marc Overmars ran through the open space in the Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s right side, passed to Jari Litmanen and who set up Ronald de Boer for the equalizer for Ajax (Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s Kiko had previously opended the scoring).&quot; In extra-time, the Dutch side ran out 3-2 winners. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Back in those sepia-tinged days of 2005, Kate Haldane wanted to know: &quot;What is the earliest time a professional match has ever kicked off?&quot; During the 2003-04 season, Barca were scheduled to play a midweek game against Sevilla prior to an international weekend. Since Fifa rules stipulate players summoned for international duty must be released by their clubs four days before the match, Barca hoped to host Sevilla on the Tuesday, September 3, rather than the next day when their internationals would have been missing. However, sensing a chance to take on a below-strength opponent, Sevilla refused, pointing out that a club can not play two matches within 48 hours (after the Sunday fixture programme), unless both teams were agreed. Quick-thinking suits at the Catalan giants then hit upon a novel idea: play the game as early on Wednesday morning as possible and hope their international stars would still be allowed to play. Thus, the game kicked off at 12.05am - alas, the only national association to accept Barca&apos;s ploy was the Portuguese one, who allowed winger Ricardo Quaresma to take part. Incredibly, 80,000 fans turned up ... though it&apos;s not actually incredible at all when you consider that the club laid on free gaspacho and 100,000 complementary Kit Kats. Also, stand-up comics entertained the crowd before live telephone link-ups with Ronald Koeman and Hristo Stoichkov worked them into a frenzy. The players ran out to the Village People&apos;s YMCA [no, we&apos;re not sure either], but it clearly worked, as the supporters only hushed once during the match, when Jose Antonio Reyes&apos;s penalty gave the visitors the lead. Ronaldinho&apos;s first - spectacular, naturally - goal for the club salvaged a 1-1 draw, the roar greeting his strike reportedly registering on the city&apos;s earthquake monitors. A special mention must also go to Coventry City&apos;s [then known as Singer&apos;s FC] FA Cup match with Burton Swifts in 1892, as Joe Myall explains. &quot;As Burton played in a higher division, they had the right to arrange the game as and when they felt it would least impinge on their league programme.&quot; The match kicked off at 8am. For more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? &quot;IK Start coaching legend Karsten Johannessen ended his first managerial stint in 1955 and was last employed as head coach in 1996 , 41 years later,&quot; writes Eivind Lindeberg. &quot;However - on his way there - he was hired as head coach no less than nine different times.

This is an excerpt from his diary: Wednesday 4.45am Woke up and started operating. A 15-year-old boy with severe blast injuries to his abdomen. He was on his own and in shock. Surgery took about two and a half hours and he was reasonably stable. The last I heard, at least, he was stable. But our concern is what happens to him now. This is a hospital with 450 beds, three intensive care beds, and we now have 1,700 patients with up to 50 coming in a day. There are patients on the floor, in the corridors, even outside. This boy is going to be on the floor. Infection is the main worry. The wounded take days to get to us by bus and infection has often set in by the time they get here. Many of them are dying on the buses that bring them, and the bodies are taken off along with the living. 7.45am I did the rounds of the emergency department. We have cases of people with their feet blown off waiting 13 hours to go into theatre. Three-quarters of the patients we see have blast injuries. 10am We had some discussions on how to increase the flow. There are teams working around the clock. We have three surgeons: myself, a Sri Lankan surgeon and another MSF surgeon from Tampa Florida. We have put two operating tables in one theatre. Things are fairly tight and congested but we get by. There are an extremely hardworking team of Sri Lankan anaesthetists and the Sri Lankan nurses here have been working 20 hours a day. 1.45pm Went back to surgery. A head injury to a child - a boy about nine. It took about two and a half hours and went OK. The problem is the internal damage to the brain. Only the next few days will tell how bad that has been. 4pm Began work on a lower leg amputation. A man had stood on a landmine. He had been with his wife and his daughter. We will operate on the wife tonight. The child has already had some surgery to remove pieces from her arm. Technically, the surgery on the man went well, but the problem is the landmine blasted soil into his leg. There is always the fear that infection will set in. 6pm I did a series of small cases - gunshot wounds. Over the course of the day I operated on 16 patients, five of them amputations on children. These are deeply traumatised people. The children in the emergency wards see people brought in with major blast limb injuries and are just sitting silently, emotionless, in the middle of all this, so we try to treat them and move them quickly out to the surgery or the ward.  9pm Finish surgery for the day. Going to find something to eat and then get some sleep. Friday 2.30pm I have been in the whole time and do not have the big picture, but in the last 24 hours we have seen, for the first time, fewer patients coming in. Only 44 severely wounded patients came in to the hospital yesterday, although more have come in this morning. It might be that some of the other casualties are going elsewhere, to other hospitals. We&apos;ve sent a team on a exploratory mission to try and find out exactly what&apos;s happening.  One of the patients I have seen is a little girl of about seven or eight who has a severe leg injury. Her elder sister is in the same bed with wounds on her arms and legs. A third sister has burns to her face. Their mother has been killed and their father is in intensive care. With the level of aftercare that we can provide at the moment he has a 50/50 chance of making it, at best. We have done 71 major operations over the past 24 hours. A lot of the these operations have been catching up on the last few days. It has been bedlam in the hospital. But it hasn&apos;t got worse in the last 24 hours. We are only seeing the acute casualties. There are many people who are ill, several of the injured people also have chickenpox. We are hearing reports that there have been outbreaks of chickenpox in the camps because peoples&apos; immune systems are so weak. I hear that some extra nurses are being sent to the hospital. The Sri Lankan medical authorities have made a real effort to send extra staff to help out. There are simply too many people to treat them all. We are not able to save some people because we need to provide more aftercare. There are simply not enough nurses.  \u2022 Paul McMaster is a retired surgeon from Droitwich, now based in Amsterdam.", "sentences": ["\u2022 Paul McMaster is a retired surgeon from Droitwich, now based in Amsterdam."], "title": "Sri Lankan war: 'We have 450 beds and now have 1,700 patients'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/25/sri-lanka-war", "tags": ["Sri Lanka", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-27T14:54:12Z", "article": "New Scientist just flagged up a fascinating visualisation project by David Crandall and a team at Cornell University, New York.

You&apos;ll have to wait until then for his views on the craziness of Schubert (he&apos;s playing the Great C major symphony with the Vienna Phil in September), his pessimism on the future of classical musical culture in general, and his green slippers. His passion and energy make it hard to believe he&apos;s 80 this year. But he also told me something unrelated to any of that, which got me thinking. &quot;I have just discovered that the last three Mozart symphonies are an instrumental oratorio.&quot; Not bad for a bombshell just before I left his flat in Amsterdam: all that he had time to tell me was that it&apos;s because the 39th Symphony is the only one with an introduction, and the 41st, the Jupiter, the only one with a proper finale; and that there are thematic connections across all three symphonies - and not just the four-note tag that dominates the finale of the Jupiter. When Harnoncourt performs them together \u2013 as he did earlier this year, as well as on a famous recording with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe made in the Mozart year, 1991 \u2013 he takes a break between each of the symphonies (&quot;You have to, they are so intense&quot;), but he thinks of them as one meta-symphony, one meta-oratorio. It sounds bizarre, but I think his theory has got something going for it: Neal Zaslaw in his huge book on the symphonies was among the first to notice that the theme of the Jupiter&apos;s finale (the first eight bars) are closely modelled on the Credo from a much earlier Mass, K192. OK, that doesn&apos;t make it an oratorio on its own, but when you consider that Mozart was obsessed with Baroque music around 1788 (he wrote the symphonies just before he made arrangements of Handel&apos;s Acis and Galatea and Messiah), and that there was no known reason for him to compose these pieces, the idea of some grander conception is at least a possibility.

Henry resigned from the agency - whose clients include Nissan, Apple and Adidas - in July after two years at the helm after what was believed to be a difference of opinion between him and the group president, Tim Lindsay, about the direction of the firm. The Canadian-born Hunter, who has been executive creative director at Euro RSCG London for the past two years, was today described by Lindsay as the &quot;brightest and the best&quot;. In a statement, TBWA London said: &quot;Since Steve Henry&apos;s enforced departure in July last year, the agency has been looking for an individual who embraces the agency&apos;s commitment to disruptive and culturally relevant creative work.&quot; While at Euro RSCG London, Hunter was involved in an &quot;intensive internal renovation project&quot; which saw the agency win new business from clients such as Chivas Regal Worldwide, the Conservative Party, CityJet and Magners Pear Cider. Before joining Euro RSCG, Hunter was creative director on Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam&apos;s flagship Nike account for three years. Before that, he spent five years at BBH London working on most of their key accounts, including Lynx, Impulse, Audi, Bertolli, Johnnie Walker and Levi&apos;s.

He has died aged 43 from heart failure in Bangkok, where he had gone to view the rough-cut of his latest production, Nymph.  In its first years Fortissimo worked principally as a sales agent, but in 2000 Barendrecht embarked on work as executive producer with Clara Law&apos;s The Goddess of 1967. In the past seven years he was producer, co-producer or executive producer on more than 30 films, including works by European directors such as Peter Greenaway, Alex van Warmerdam, B\u00e9la Tarr and Sergei Bodrov and the American gay directors Gregg Araki and John Cameron Mitchell, whose Shortbus shocked and invigorated Cannes audiences in 2006. The greater part of Barendrecht&apos;s work, however, was with Asian directors. In Thailand, where he established a second home, he had worked with Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang, for whom he produced four films, including the still-unfinished Nymph. Springtime in a Small Town (2002) revived the career of the mainland Chinese director Tian Zhuangzhuang, who had been prevented from making a film for nine years after his film Blue Kite was overly critical of the Chinese government. Recent notable prize-winning films have included Zhang Yang&apos;s Getting Home (2007) and Kiyoshi Kurosawa&apos;s Tokyo Sonata (2008), which won last year&apos;s jury prize at the Chicago international film festival. Fortissimo&apos;s most recent production, Tsai Ming-liang&apos;s Face (2009), has been selected to compete in the Cannes festival. When honoured with an industry toast at the Hamptons international film festival last year, Barendrecht was styled &quot;the playboy of the Pacific rim&quot;, and his zest for life was enormous. The secret of his success lay not just in his passion for films and his excellent and catholic taste, but much more in his gigantic and embracing personality. It was near impossible to catch him without the beaming and always sincere smile. He was a persuasive marketer too. If he told you a film should be seen, you took care to see it.  Born in Amsterdam, Barendrecht was the son of an insurance company manager and a nurse. He studied theatre sciences at the University of Utrecht - although he had already made his mark at 15 with a well-argued liberal political treatise, which caught the attention of the Dutch royal family. Film quickly came to dominate his interests, and from 1987 to 1990 he was an energetic contributor to the Rotterdam international film festival and its Cinemart. In February 1990 he moved briefly to the Berlin film festival as a press officer for the Forum des Junges Films. In 1991, he returned to Rotterdam to become co-ordinator and programme adviser, with particular concern for Cinemart. Established in 1984, this was the first platform of its kind to offer film-makers the opportunity to launch their projects to the international film industry. Many films of the last quarter-century owe their existence to Cinemart, of which Barendrecht became a board member after leaving the festival in 1997. In 1991, he formed Fortissimo Films, joined in 1995 by Michael Werner, who in 2000 became his co-chairman. The two seemed an ideal partnership, and Fortissimo went rapidly from strength to strength. Initially based in Amsterdam, in 1997 - on the suggestion of the director Wong Kar-Wai - Fortissimo set up an office in Hong Kong, which was the base for most of the production activities.  Barendrecht&apos;s gift of friendship was phenomenal. He was known and loved worldwide, but seemed capable of returning every friendship. He delighted in his homosexuality, which made him, throughout his career, an influential supporter of gay cinema. His most lasting legacy, however, will remain his success, through his productions and influence, in changing the international market for and the international perception of Asian films. He was founder and honorary adviser of the Hong Kong-Asia film financing forum, a member of the advisory board of the Thai film federation and panel consultant for the Asian film awards. In 2007 he and Werner received the CineAsia award of excellence. He is survived by his parents and his brothers. A foundation has been established in his name to support talented young film-makers.  \u2022 Wouter Barendrecht, film producer and marketer, born 5 November 1965; died 5 April 2009", "sentences": ["Born in Amsterdam, Barendrecht was the son of an insurance company manager and a nurse.", "Initially based in Amsterdam, in 1997 - on the suggestion of the director Wong Kar-Wai - Fortissimo set up an office in Hong Kong, which was the base for most of the production activities."], "title": "Wouter Barendrecht", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/30/obituary-wouter-barendrecht", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-04-29T23:01:00Z", "article": "If you want to beat the best software in the world at a classic board game, the only one left to you is the strategy game Go. It&apos;s long been considered the last bastion of human gaming superiority, holding out against the onslaught of computational brute force and artificial intelligence techniques, while draughts, Othello, backgammon and chess have all fallen. But to be a human winner at Go, you&apos;re going to have to get good in a hurry. The end, with computers ruling, is in sight. In February, the software MoGo, developed at the University of Paris-Sud, achieved what was once thought impossible: it won two games, on a 19x19 board, against professional Go players. (It did benefit from a handicap - in effect, a number of free turns at the start of the game.) The same month, a program called Many Faces of Go, with a seven-turn handicap, beat a professional in a game played during the general meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. (Click here for the human-computer Go challenges page.) The wins did require a lot of computing power, however. MoGo was running on 640 cores of the Huygens supercomputer in Amsterdam; Many Faces of Go on a 32-core 3.2GHz Xeon, eight quad cores networked together. Next month the bar is likely to rise again as programmers fine-tune their code for the annual International Computer Games Association tournament, the computer olympiad, in Pamplona, Spain. Yet even a few years ago Go looked like an impossible computing task: the &quot;search space&quot; for each move was too big. At each turn, especially in the beginning, there are hundreds of possible places to play (the board has 361 points, compared to chess&apos;s 64), and deciding on which will turn out better a number of moves ahead - a comparatively simple task in chess and draughts - turns into a morass, with hundreds of almost-equal possibilities and a few hundred moves over which to compare them. Standard &quot;minimax&quot; methods that work for chess (picking the move that gives your opponent the fewest high-value moves in future) don&apos;t work in Go. Across the board What&apos;s changed has been the development of the UCT algorithm, a special case of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. UCT first appeared in 2006 applied to small 9x9 Go boards, and now academics, and professional Go programmers, are extending and refining its techniques. It has led to a revolution in Go program development. David Fotland, the US-based commercial developer behind Many Faces of Go, says the results represent a major leap. But he&apos;s realistic about the achievement. &quot;My machine can beat a good amateur, but not a great amateur.&quot; In 2008 he spent six months incorporating UCT into his software, combined with his traditional Go algorithm (&quot;the new algorithm has some blind spots&quot;), and won that year&apos;s computer olympiad. At the event every program incorporating UCT beat all the ones using traditional methods. Go pieces are called stones, are black or white, and identical. Playing alternately, the object is to use one&apos;s stones to surround as many blank intersections (called &quot;territory&quot;) as possible. Games typically have a couple of hundred moves. The Go rating scale for amateurs starts at 35 kyu, and moves towards 0: the highest level is 1 kyu. The next amateur rank is 1 dan, up to 7 dan. Above them are professionals, who start at pro 1 dan going up to pro 9 dan, the highest level possible. &quot;Handicapping&quot; allows weaker competitors to play on a level footing with stronger ones: each difference in grading is given as one stone&apos;s start. Thus a 20-kyu player would get nine stones in a game against an 11-kyu player. Many Faces of Go&apos;s result puts it at about a 1-dan amateur ranking. David Silver, who&apos;s researching Go for his PhD at the University of Alberta, says that: &quot;Anyone who would have suggested this [could happen] a couple of years ago would have been laughed out of town.&quot; Silver contributed to MoGo in 2007, developing UCT, which led to the first victories against human pro players on 9x9 boards. But when he started his PhD, pre-UCT, he was discouraged from studying the game by the head of the university&apos;s games research group. Too many good minds had been wasted on it, and the research was doomed to failure, it was thought. Game of chance For the past 30 years, Go programs have evaluated positions by using handcrafted heuristics based on human knowledge of shapes, patterns and rules. However, professional Go players often play moves according to intuitive feelings that are hard to quantify. Encoding their knowledge into machine-understandable rules has proved to be a dead end. UCT works on the idea of playing out games over and over again, choosing moves at random, but it is biased to what&apos;s been successful before. It does this while still allowing alternative lines to be explored. Now, Silver says: &quot;I feel very fortunate doing research during this revolutionary period. MCTS is in its infancy, but the rate of performance improvement is pretty rapid.&quot; He thinks a machine to beat all humans could appear in four to five years. Yet humans haven&apos;t lost all their tricks. As the human v computer Go challenges page notes: &quot;In every case where each player [computer and human] won at least one game, the human lost the first game played and won the rest. This may be because of experience gained in the first game, or because of techniques learned from discussions with the other players.&quot; But the randomisation the UCT algorithm brings may make that result less likely. Fotland thinks the UCT-based work responds to a certain amount of processor supercharging, but then plateaus. &quot;There is a certain kind of large-scale fighting in Go that requires a kind of thinking the algorithm not good at. [The ranking] 1 dan amateur is where people start being good at these large-scale fights.&quot; Wacky races His rival Mick Reiss, the commercial programmer behind Go++ (bit.ly/AnJ9s), released his version incorporating UCT in Japan this month. His publisher says it matches the Japanese commercial version of Many Faces of Go in strength. Reiss doesn&apos;t think UCT is the total answer. Of pure UCT-based programs, he says: &quot;A lot of them play in a wacky way, which doesn&apos;t really work. Because it&apos;s so different to what Go players are used to, in the early games they get beaten. Once they get a bit of practice they get their revenge.&quot; The highest level of his own program is based on a combination of the old-style Go approach and the UCT program. &quot;It does less of the strangeness of the pure UCT programs. It plays in a more conventional way.&quot; Fotland is still circumspect about when computers will dominate Go. &quot;I&apos;d say 20 years. There&apos;s got to be several algorithm breakthroughs, and 20 years of Moore&apos;s law.&quot; And then? The end of an era? Certainly. But the end of playing Go? Thankfully, as the evidence shows, we still enjoy the simple pleasure of just playing games. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 1 May 2009.

Prosecutors said the incident had deliberately targeted the royal parade but was not an act of terrorism. Police did not indicate why the popular queen might have been the target of an attack. A Dutch male, aged 38, driving a small black Suzuki appeared to deliberately try to ram the royal family&apos;s bus at high speed as they celebrated the queen&apos;s day national holiday with a parade through the city of Apeldoorn, 55 miles (90km) east of Amsterdam. The car ploughed through police cordons metres away from the royal bus before crashing into a stone monument to the late Queen Wilhelmina. Police declined to identify the injured driver saying he had no police record or history of mental illness. He had been arrested but could not be questioned immediately as he was being treated in hospital. Twelve people were injured in the attack; four were in a serious condition. Dutch media reported people flying through the air after the car swerved through railings and a large flag-waving crowd who had lined up to watch the popular royals parade past, waving to their subjects en route to the Het Loo palace. Members of the royal family watched from their bus in shock as the car careered past them. Television footage showed Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and his wife, Princess Maxima, standing at their seats. Maxima held her hand over her mouth in apparent horror. This year&apos;s Dutch national holiday celebrations had been marred by rumours that Queen Beatrix was about to abdicate to make way for her son. Dutch monarchs have a tradition of stepping down to favour their offspring. When Crown prince Willem-Alexander, an expert in water management, celebrated his 42nd birthday earlier this week, media speculated his time had come. His mother Queen Beatrix was 42 when her mother stepped down to let her take the throne. &quot;No one doubts that Willem-Alexander is ready to take over. He has been steadily groomed for his position as monarch,&quot; said NRC Handelsblaad this week, noting that the prince had lived down his young bachelor days as &quot;Prins Pils&quot; (the beer prince). He and his photogenic wife and three young daughters regularly appear in European society magazines. The queen has 85% approval ratings and is more powerful than other European monarchs, playing a role in the running of government and overseeing legislation.

The fair, on the north-west outskirts of Milan, covers four times the surface area of the British Museum. Each of its 24 pavilions is the size of a football pitch. The event has been going for 48 years, aiming to showcase new products, from lamps to beds, garden furniture, objects, textiles, chairs, rugs \u2013 anything found in a home, an office, or garden. For one week, 2,723 designers and furniture companies, a third of them from outside Italy, show off their latest designs, many of them prototypes. They are hoping to attract the interest of some of the 350,000 professionals \u2013 buyers, manufacturers, fellow designers and journalists \u2013 attending. Many regulars go straight to the four pavilions dedicated to Design with a capital D \u2013 the fashionable, high-concept stuff \u2013 and ignore the rest. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be seen dead at the others,&quot; whispers a well-known Brazilian designer&apos;s assistant. &quot;They only exhibit kitsch furniture, the kind that you&apos;d see in a luxurious brothel.&quot; After this, we can&apos;t resist having a peek. In pavilion 6, scantily clad young goddesses demonstrate how to operate enormous rotating round beds (designed by Italian furniture brand Prealpi); while in another, two very tall, tanned ladies in black show off a cream leather sofa with assorted pouffes. In the corridors, between stands, impeccably dressed Italian men keep guard. Now on to pavilions 12 and 8, two of those dedicated to Design with a capital D. It&apos;s a different world here \u2013 a world of innovation and radical thinking. Some products, you suspect, will prove too fashionable to last; others are simply too surprising. But it&apos;s not all like that. Many designers here are seriously attempting to answer the challenges the world faces. A quick tour round of the stands points up this year&apos;s trends: environmental concerns, sustainability and carbon-free technology seem to top many designers&apos; agendas, though there&apos;s plenty of playfulness too. Take, for instance, the German designer Nils Holger Moorman&apos;s minimalistic Steckling wardrobe, made of a 6-foot-high untreated maple-wood pole into which three aluminium hangers insert; or his ingenious Liesmichl bedside table, a birch plywood construction that&apos;s also a book holder for paperbacks. Moorman&apos;s studio, located in the Alpine landscape of Upper Bavaria, manufactures all his prototypes through local firms. At another stand, Casamania, it&apos;s all comic colours and shapes. I notice visitors smiling at the sight of Opus Incertum 100%, recyclable polypropylene bookcases designed in a colourful honeycomb structure by 41-year-old Sean Yoo, which can be used either indoors or out.  Belonging to the same trend, which La Repubblica&apos;s critic Aurelio Magist\u00e0 calls &quot;crazy design&quot;, Italian company Segis offers its highway loop sofa, &quot;a modular seating system where the flat seat wraps itself to form a vertical loop&quot;, essentially a long, undulating tape-like structure that can be folded over itself to form seats. Designed by veteran Italian architect Carlo Bartoli \u2013 whose works feature in the permanent collections of Moma and the Vitra Design Museum \u2013 the sofa, made of polypropylene and steel, claims to be 70% recyclable. &quot;Objects are dissected, deformed, liquidified as if contaminated by a surrealist virus&quot;, writes Magist\u00e0. Amsterdam-based Pieke Bergmans actually uses the name &quot;design virus&quot; for her latest collection of lamps, each uniquely shaped, which look like huge water drops. On the other hand Matteo Ragni studio&apos;s brochure claims that, for them, &quot;objects are solid poetry. They must be irreverent but always concrete, purposeful and anti-ideological&quot;. Their latest is called REDbar, a sleek red bicycle with an inbuilt Campari-soda bar that is (perhaps not surprisingly) the first Campari bar on wheels. Could it take off on Mediterranean beaches this summer? The furniture and design fair proper shouldn&apos;t, however, overshadow another important event, Euroluce, taking place in an adjacent pavilion. Euroluce, with its 525 exhibitors from 25 different countries, transports visitors into an eerie world and a mind-blowing variety of styles. You&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that in some countries normal lamps don&apos;t exist, just diamond-encrusted six metre high gold chandeliers or Niagara Falls replicas in gold, lit from within. Star lighting designers Flos and Artemide are here, but also, and perhaps more importantly, newcomers such as Inga Semp\u00e9. Semp\u00e9&apos;s new Vapeur lamp is made of pleated paper sheets and looks rather like a chef&apos;s inflatable toque: it is witty, simple and beautiful. Milan design week, however, wouldn&apos;t be nearly so successful without SaloneSatellite, its fringe fair, the only one open to the public (albeit for one day), which is dedicated to designers under the age of 35. This, in many ways, is where the heart of the fair beats. It features 702 carefully selected young designers, graduates from 20 leading schools across the world. You can&apos;t help but be struck by the freedom of their ideas \u2013 perhaps because they haven&apos;t had yet to comply with any commercial diktats. Store Muu Design, a collective of three young Japanese designers, have created Pit In, a wooden docking station for cyclists. Once the bicycle is parked, the cyclist doesn&apos;t have to move: their saddle becomes their seat, they can rest their arms on a wooden stand, their feet on platforms, and they can spread a newspaper on the table in front or take their laptop out for a quick work session. &quot;With this docking station, which we&apos;d love to see installed in streets, cyclists only have to &apos;plug their bicycles in&apos; and then take a break,&quot; explain Ippei Kimoto and Masahiro Asakura, while their colleague Daisuke Ito demonstrates the concept, smiling, mug in hand. My eye is also caught by international studio Out of Stock&apos;s Naked chairs, which need no tools to be assembled \u2013 their featherlight steel and wood frames fit together using butterfly nuts. Their designer, Wendy Chua, then shows me what looks like a classic pencil eraser, elegantly cased in wood. The case hides a USB stick. Just as I&apos;m leaving I see the stand of Aun2h4 studio, a collective of five young Japanese designers. People are queuing to try an armchair called I On the Flower. Made of polypropylene petals, the armchair opens up under your weight. It is surprisingly comfortable.

Plying this rugged route, which connects the country&apos;s metropolitan heart to the depths of its ravishing rainforest, the traveller lives life alongside the locals and begins to feel strangely at home. My voyage into the heart of South America&apos;s little-known jungle begins at 7am in the capital, Paramaribo, on a bustling street named Saramaccastraat. Last night&apos;s rains have passed, the tropical sun has begun its burn, and all around me are the signs and symptoms of life in a poor but ecologically blessed corner of Amazonia.  An army of dilapidated minivans, the ubiquitous wagis of Suriname, line both sides of the street, their chassis coated with red bauxite dust. The aromas of fresh fish and wild game waft from the Central Market, behind which the black ebb of the Suriname river slinks north toward the sea. An entrepreneurial man holds court, a pair of haggard capuchin monkeys perched on his shoulder, two-for-the-price-of-one. Every few feet or so, ancient Maroon women crouch at the curbside, hawking fresh oranges, bananas and pampelmous. Suriname, Old Dutch Guiana, is the closest thing left to a forgotten land. Nestled above Brazil on the northeast shoulder of South America, it is the continent&apos;s youngest, smallest, least-populated and arguably least-travelled country. Most westerners struggle to locate it on a map, and are stunned to learn it is home to the earth&apos;s largest tract of pristine tropical rainforest.  With sky-high inflation, near-zero population growth and an export economy based largely on dwindling bauxite reserves, one might expect Suriname to become the next victim of clear-cutting by multinational logging corporations. But slowly, and against all odds, it is rebranding itself as a paradise for eco-tourists.  The hope is that Suriname will thrive by renting out its forests instead of cutting them down, generating ecotourism on a par with Costa Rica, where it now dwarfs the timber industry. Over the past few years, countless tour operators have sprung up in Paramaribo, offering a range of eco-experiences: visits to the Caribbean&apos;s largest nesting ground for leatherback turtles (Galibi), three-day treks to the summit of a sacred rainforest mountain (Kasikasima), jungle stays beneath a remote table-top peak (Tafelberg), and memorable birdwatching (Central Suriname nature reserve).  All the trips are considerably more affordable than similar excursions in more developed countries. They become even better value, of course, when you eschew tour companies and do everything yourself - hence my hammock, bug net, blanket and backpack of canned food. Once traded to the Dutch by the British in return for a little island named Manhattan, Suriname remains virgin territory for the modern backpacker. And the time to go is now, because if entrepreneurs have their way, Suriname&apos;s relative obscurity won&apos;t last forever. The Brownsberg nature reserve, where I&apos;m headed, is one of its oldest parks. It is the easiest place to lose yourself in the dense, dripping mass of the jungle, just a four-hour drive from Paramaribo. With arguably the country&apos;s finest rainforest views, this is where every newly-arrived tourist should spend a day or two acclimatizing, before setting off on more ambitious adventures. I find a wagi headed for Brownsberg and wedge myself into the last empty seat. A rice sack is perched precariously above the man next to me. It bulges with worrying weight - in the tropics, I&apos;ve learned, rice sacks are the ideal vessels for transporting live snakes. Saramaccastraat is the gateway to Suriname&apos;s lush rainforest interior to the south. But for the Maroons on my wagi, Saramaccastraat is also the start of a journey home. The Maroons are descendants of west African slaves who began escaping the Dutch plantations 400 years ago. Those brave fugitives founded a new society in Suriname&apos;s teeming jungle, and today, most Maroons still live in vaguely African villages, on remote shores of Suriname&apos;s major rivers. The only way to reach them is by long-distance wagi rides along poorly maintained roads. Our child-driver, Joseph, punches the gas, and we leave Saramaccastraat in a cloud of exhaust, only to spend the next two hours running down supplies on the outskirts of Paramaribo. Each time we lurch to a stop, the old man to my left (Benjamin) swears under his breath, the young woman to my right (Lily) sucks her teeth in anger, and the rice sack above us threatens to slip from its perch.  Finally, with the new supplies tied haphazardly to the roof, we leave the capital, joining the southbound Martin Luther King Highway. Buildings give way to pastureland, and the start of Surinamese savannah. The bauxite refinery at Paranam looms, a post-apocalyptic warning of what&apos;s to come.  A collective groan rises up and Joseph turns the music down. We hang a left onto the Afobaka Highway and Benjamin grips my thigh with his gnarled fingers. The boy at the wheel floors it. A familiar, bone-rattling clatter rises from beneath our feet.  The Afobaka is renowned as Suriname&apos;s worst road. It was cut through pristine jungle to service the hydroelectric dam barricading the Suriname river 20km to our south. The majority of traffic on this route - VS Naipaul dubbed it The Red Road because of the waste bauxite on its surface - is massive dump-trucks or 18-wheelers loaded with fresh timber. Its surface is a rutted, rust-coloured, potholed nightmare. Our wagi sounds like it&apos;s about to burst apart: a high-pitched whine of metal shearing against metal. Somehow, we go faster. No one speaks. We swerve left and right to avoid the oncoming trucks, their wakes coating our windows in viscous red mud. We brace ourselves against each other, trying to minimize the bruising and the pain of our bodies colliding. And then my worst fears come true: the rice sack above us slips free and lands on Benjamin&apos;s lap. Lily screams. I nearly jump into her lap and she nearly leaps through the window. Benjamin just laughs, lifts the sack carefully from his thighs and places it softly beneath his feet.  After two hours, we hang a right onto a smaller road, and, after about 20 minutes, the wagi falls eerily quiet. The road is paved. The punishment is over. Soon we&apos;re cruising down the main drag of Brownsweg, one of the largest villages in Suriname&apos;s rainforest. On one side are traditional Maroon settlements, clusters of huts with wood siding and zinc roofs. On the other a glimpse of a likely future - bulldozed plots of land for government housing  We pull over beneath an enormous fig tree and everyone tumbles out into the sun. Someone releases the hatchback, a mountain of gear crashes to the earth, and some passengers claim their belongings. Not me. Joseph and I are continuing towards the mountain. Just south of the village, Joseph guns the engine, and we swerve up a steep muddy incline, where we&apos;re engulfed by tangled rainforest. The air grows cooler and the light turns a surreal shade of green. Everywhere I look, something is growing, stretching, reaching for the sun. The abundance is stunning, especially compared with the barren highway.  At the summit, I&apos;m welcomed at the small visitor&apos;s centre by a friendly teenage girl, who despite her youth, is a Surinamese tourism official. She hands me a map of the hiking trails and shows me to a modest hammock camp, complete with sinks and flush toilets. Joseph promises to pick me up in two days. I hang my hammock and open a can of tuna as the sun drops down. Built on the top of a jungle mountain, Brownsberg is about as rustic as an ecotourism destination can get. For those who prefer beds to hammocks, three guesthouses can be rented by the night or week. Each lodge is equipped with a small kitchenette and can sleep 4-8 people, and each has a terrace overlooking the teeming jungle 500m below. Electricity is provided every night via generators, and clean drinking water via the rain. Brownsberg&apos;s ecological footprint is small indeed, highlighting its dual roles as tourist camp and education centre for Suriname&apos;s youth.  Halfway through my meagre dinner, I hear cackles of laughter from around the visitor&apos;s centre. Upon investigating I find four German tourists holed up in Leki Tongo (Lick Your Lips), the park restaurant and bar. They have just seen the most beautiful sunset of their lives, and are celebrating with bami kip (fried chicken and noodles) and jugs of Parbo beer. Three hours later I return to my hammock, tipsy and shivering. It is as if this park were in the middle of nowhere and not a stone&apos;s throw from civilisation; the Germans and I are the only ones here. Over the next two days, the pounding of the wagi leaves my bones as I soak up life inside Suriname&apos;s majestic jungle. I hike the maze of forest trails, stalk rumbling armadillos and take regular baths beneath the reserve&apos;s numerous waterfalls. I come across a playful troop of bearded sakis, one of Suriname&apos;s eight species of monkey, and track them through the canopy. Screaming piha birds electrify the air, and flocks of toucans shriek from the canopies of fruiting trees.  With the walaba trees in full bloom, countless hummingbirds zip to and fro. On my way back to camp one evening, alone and with the sun setting, I find a startling sign embedded in the dirt: a feline paw print. Jaguars are known to haunt this reserve at night. Finally, the night before I leave, my new German friends and I hike out to Mazaroni Top - the famed viewpoint looking out upon the Brokopondo valley. Suriname&apos;s vast interior lake, the reservoir created by the Afobaka Dam, shimmers in the fading light, and from its shores stretches unbroken jungle all the way south to Brazil. The air chills, the sun melts to red on the horizon, and as if on cue, a mournful howl like that of a pack of crazed dogs rises from the surrounding bush. Red howler monkeys, the loudest land animals on earth, are claiming their territory for the night.  These are the sights and sounds of the Surinamese rainforest experience. Packaged tours are becoming more popular here, and it will soon be impossible to go anywhere without a cushy bus-seat, a guide and a group of total strangers. But I find it hard to imagine fully appreciating places like Brownsberg without having first earned the experience, painfully, on the tremendous Red Road.  This is western nostalgia of the worst kind, of course. It&apos;s hard to disagree with the idea that a more professional version of ecotourism is Suriname&apos;s economic future. But having spent many months navigating my way through this surreal little country, I feel the best way to travel here will always be packed shoulder to shoulder in a village wagi, or walking through the jungle gloriously alone.

But, 119 years after his death, the tortured post-Impressionist&apos;s bloody ear is at the centre of a new controversy, after two historians suggested that the painter did not hack off his own lobe but was attacked by his friend, the French artist Paul Gauguin. According to official versions, the disturbed Dutch painter cut off his ear with a razor after a row with Gauguin in 1888. Bleeding heavily, Van Gogh then walked to a brothel and presented the severed ear to an astonished prostitute called Rachel before going home to sleep in a blood-drenched bed. But two German art historians, who have spent 10 years reviewing the police investigations, witness accounts and the artists&apos; letters, argue that Gauguin, a fencing ace, most likely sliced off the ear with his sword during a fight, and the two artists agreed to hush up the truth. In Van Gogh&apos;s Ear: Paul Gauguin and the Pact of Silence, published in Germany, Hamburg-based academics Hans Kaufmann and Rita Wildegans argue that the official version of events, based largely on Gauguin&apos;s accounts, contain inconsistencies and that both artists hinted that the truth was more complex. Van Gogh and Gauguin&apos;s troubled friendship was legendary. In 1888, Van Gogh persuaded him to come to Arles in the south of France to live with him in the Yellow House he had set up as a &quot;studio of the south&quot;. They spent the autumn painting together before things soured. Just before Christmas, they fell out. Van Gogh, seized by an attack of a metabolic disease became aggressive and was apparently crushed when Gauguin said he was leaving for good. Kaufmann told the Guardian: &quot;Near the brothel, about 300 metres from the Yellow House, there was a final encounter between them: Vincent might have attacked him, Gauguin wanted to defend himself and to get rid of this &apos;madman&apos;. He drew his weapon, made some movement in the direction of Vincent and by that cut off his left ear.&quot; Kaufmann said it was not clear if it was an accident or an aimed hit. While curators at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam stand by the theory of self-mutilation, Kaufmann argues that Van Gogh dropped hints in letters to his brother, Theo, once commenting : &quot;Luckily Gauguin ... is not yet armed with machine guns and other dangerous war weapons.&quot;", "sentences": ["While curators at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam stand by the theory of self-mutilation, Kaufmann argues that Van Gogh dropped hints in letters to his brother, Theo, once commenting : &quot;Luckily Gauguin ... is not yet armed with machine guns and other dangerous war weapons.&quot;"], "title": "Art historians claim Van Gogh's ear 'cut off by Gauguin'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/may/04/vincent-van-gogh-ear", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Germany", "Netherlands", "World news", "Paul Gauguin", "Van Gogh", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-05T12:15:35Z", "article": "The scrubby jatropha tree has been touted as a wonder biofuel with unlimited potential. But questions are now emerging as to whether widespread jatropha cultivation is really feasible or whether it will simply displace badly-needed food crops in the developing world.by jon r. luoma The widespread publicity surrounding a seeming wonder-plant called Jatropha curcas began in earnest in the mid-2000s. A good-news story, it went like this: In the mildly toxic, oval-shaped, oily seeds of this hardy, shrubby tree was a near-miraculous source of biofuel. Since jatropha could grow on arid, barren lands, cultivating it would avoid displacing food crops such as corn and soybeans \u2014 a major drawback of so-called first generation biofuels. The world&apos;s thirst for combustible fuels could be slaked, according to the buzz surrounding jatropha, with energy harvested from wastelands rather than from fertile fields. Native to Central America and well-adapted to the tropics and subtropics, jatropha seemed a boon for the very places with some of the highest rates of poverty and plenty of hot, dry lands: the global south, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. Not only was the cultivation of jatropha supposed to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere than it released, but the miracle tree could also stabilize and restore degraded soils. That&apos;s surely why Scientific American in 2007 called jatropha &quot;green gold in a shrub,&quot; a plant that &quot;seems to offer all the benefits of biofuels without the pitfalls.&quot; Fast forward a couple of years. By 2009, governments from China to Brazil, along with several major biofuel companies, had planted \u2014 or vowed to plant \u2014 millions of acres of jatropha. In India alone, the government has announced plans to subsidize an intensive program to plant jatropha for biofuels on 27 million acres of &quot;wastelands&quot; \u2014 an area roughly the size of Switzerland. And the jatropha push is on in other countries such as Myanmar, Malaysia, Malawi, and Brazil. Despite all this, however, it&apos;s not at all clear that jatropha will ever be the green gold it&apos;s been cracked up to be. In fact, no one yet seems to know for sure if the kind of large-scale jatropha plantations that would make a real dent in world fuel demand can actually be productive, while also avoiding the problems associated with growing corn, sugar cane, and soybeans for biofuel. Today, most jatropha grown for biofuels is cultivated on plots of less than 12 acres and is primarily used locally. A global biofuels market for jatrophais only just beginning to emerge. One of the handful of companies involved in large-scale jatropha production is D1 Oils, a U.K.-based biofuels technology company that says it already has more than a half-million acres under cultivation, much of it in India. A 2008 report by jatropha producers said that 242 cultivation projects existed globally, growing the tree on 2.2 million acres; by comparison, Brazil alone grows sugarcane for ethanol on 7.2 million acres of land. A key issue surrounding jatropha is the productivity of the tree in the dry, degraded lands on which it is said to thrive. Rob Bailis, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies, along with Yale Ph.D. candidate Jennifer Baka, recently launched the first detailed &quot;life cycle&quot; environment assessment of jatropha as a biofuel. Although their study is in its early stages, Bailis notes that it&apos;s already clear that, while jatropha can indeed grow on lands with minimal water and poor nutrition, &quot;if you plant trees in a marginal area, and all they do is just not die, it doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re going to get a lot of oil from them.&quot; He says evidence suggests that the tree will grow far more productively on higher quality land with more rainfall or irrigation. Indeed, even executives at D1 Oils warn against overestimating jatropha&apos;s potential to produce economically viable yields on severely degraded lands. &quot;If you grow jatropha in marginal conditions, you can expect marginal yields,&quot; says Vincent Volckaert, the Africa regional director for D1. And there&apos;s the rub, says Bailis. &quot;If you grow it in better agricultural conditions, all the alarm bells go off as you get into the same food-versus-fuel debate we&apos;ve seen with [biofuel from] corn.&quot; Although it may still be early in the jatropha story, some of those alarm bells have already sounded. Consider India&apos;s great push to plant jatropha. According to the Indian environmental group, Navdanya, government foresters have drained rice paddies in order to plant jatropha in the poor and mostly tribal state of Chhattisgarh. As early as mid-2007, protests broke out in the mostly desert state of Rajasthan over a government scheme to reclassify village commons lands \u2014 widely used for grazing livestock \u2014 as &quot;wastelands&quot; targeted for biofuel production, primarily jatropha. On Mindanao, the second-largest of the Philippine islands, protests erupted in late 2008, with indigenous leaders insisting that jatropha plantations had begun to displace needed crops of rice, corn, bananas, and root vegetables. A striking symbol of jatropha&apos;s pitfalls can be found in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Late in 2005, Myanmar&apos;s military dictatorship \u2014 newly enamored with what&apos;s been called &quot;the biofuel tree &quot; \u2014 ordered all of that nation&apos;s states and other political divisions to plant about a half-million acres each. In a predominantly agrarian country where child malnutrition is rampant, entire plantations have sprung up where food crops once grew. Under the threat of imprisonment, households have been forced to buy seed and plant jatropha in backyard gardens. Human rights groups report that teachers and their pupils, along with medical and government workers, have all been pressed into service to plant jatropha. Yet according to scattered stories that have leaked out of a country generally closed to the foreign news media, the same government that infamously bungled its response to a devastating May 2008 typhoon did not have the foresight to build adequate infrastructure to mill the jatropha seeds or process them into biofuel. The seeds \u2014 grown at the expense of food crops \u2014 were left to simply rot on the ground. It&apos;s not all bad news. In the West African nation of Mali, on the southern edge of the Sahara, jatropha had long been grown as a sort of living fence to keep wildlife from crops, and sometimes as a source of handmade soap. In recent years, often with the help of nonprofit groups like the Denmark-based charity Folkecenter, local jatropha processing mills have appeared in hundreds of villages, providing fuel for lamps, cookstoves, and generators. The biofuel is not only cheaper than conventional oil and diesel, but it is available during rainy seasons, when impassable roads can block conventional fuel delivery. Even the solid &quot;press cake&quot; left over after the oil is squeezed out of the seeds has value as either an organic fertilizer or, if processed to neutralize the natural toxicity, animal feed. But for jatropha to reach wonder-plant status \u2014 to make even a meaningful dent in a world that presently consumes 80 million barrels of oil every day \u2014 the tree would have to be grown on a scale far beyond the village level. Jatropha&apos;s potential was recently underscored by highly publicized jet test flights using a mix of jatropha and other biofuels. Boeing reported that at altitudes where fuels must last hours at sub-zero temperatures, the jatropha/biofuel mix not only performed well, but actually had a higher freezing point than conventional jet fuel. Jatropha fuel also contains more energy per gallon, meaning less fuel weight has to be lifted off the ground. In March, Boeing officials told a Congressional hearing that they were &quot;very confident&quot; that jet fuels from plants such as jatropha could power their planes in a low-carbon future. In an early 2008 test, Virgin Airlines flew a jet from London to Amsterdam powered with a dollop \u2014 about five percent \u2014 of a similar biofuel, this one made from coconut oil. Never mind that the British magazine, New Scientist, calculated that it could take 150,000 coconuts to fully power even that short flight. Virgin CEO Richard Branson suggested that jatropha grown on arid soils could be the ticket for a green-fueled aviation industry, whereupon New Scientist calculated that it would take land twice the size of France to grow enough jatropha to power the world&apos;s jet fleet. (Dramatic boosts in yields could improve that equation.) If jatropha is to be grown on an industrial scale, the plant will need to be tamed and cultivated, and its oil yields vastly enhanced through conventional plant breeding or genetic manipulation. A San Diego start-up company, SG Biofuels, says it has amassed the world&apos;s most complete library of jatropha genetic material and, with a cadre of scientists on its staff, believes it is on the way to quadrupling oil yields from 200 gallons per acre to 800 gallons per acre. A comparable boost in yields came after rubber trees were domesticated. Even if enterprises like SG and D1 Oils can push the genetic envelope enough to make jatropha profitable, will the world actually be able to benefit from growing and processing the plant on a large scale? The jury&apos;s still out. Yale&apos;s Bailis says his life-cycle study still hasn&apos;t established that jatropha biofuel will ever be &quot;carbon positive,&quot; meaning that growing the plant absorbs more CO2 from the air than it releases. He says he suspects that it can be, but he also points out that if cultivating the plant means leveling forests or plowing up native vegetation, large volumes of carbon would be released, possibly canceling out any benefits. Whether jatropha will turn out to be the wonder plant it was originally touted to be will depend a great deal on how and where it is grown \u2014 an issue that must be resolved by scientists, businesses, and governments. &quot;Whether it turns out to be a positive or a negative is going to depend a great deal on how it&apos;s addressed at the policy level,&quot; Bailis says. The best outcome might be to slow down the jatropha steamroller and let science sort out whether it can be grown on a mass scale in ways that make it preferable to food-based biofuels. If not, it may turn out that the world will still have to wait for a second generation of truly viable biofuels.  \u2022 From Yale Environment 360, part of Guardian Environment Network", "sentences": ["In an early 2008 test, Virgin Airlines flew a jet from London to Amsterdam powered with a dollop \u2014 about five percent \u2014 of a similar biofuel, this one made from coconut oil."], "title": "Hailed as a miracle biofuel, jatropha falls short of hype", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/05/jatropha-biofuels-food-crops", "tags": ["Biofuels", "Food", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-05T16:58:23Z", "article": "For the string quartets, go for the Henschel Quartet on Arte Nova (you can also hear their recordings of the complete cycle of six-and-a-bit quartets on Spotify).  My favourite recording of the Octet, and the first I ever heard, is the one led by Iona Brown with the Academy Chamber Ensemble, accompanied by a fantastic coupling of the B flat major String Quintet, Op 87 \u2013 just another of the hundreds of Mendelssohn pieces we should be hearing more often on concert programmes.  For a version of the oft-coupled Scottish Symphony and Hebrides Overture, check out the Scottish Chamber Orchestra with Joseph Swensen on the Linn label. I wasn&apos;t sure about the Hebrides performance when I first heard it \u2013 too laid-back, too calm, I thought \u2013 but it&apos;s grown on me, and Swensen builds the whole piece as a single tidal force, a wave that finally crests in the work&apos;s climax. I heard Nikolaus Harnoncourt in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago conduct Psalm 42 with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, a piece he described to me as the solar plexus of German romanticism, and a revelation for me; try Philippe Herreweghe&apos;s recording with La Chapelle Royale on Harmonia Mundi. And for the three symphonies (1,2, and 5) that hardly anyone performs in public, Claudio Abbado and the London Symphony Orchestra are my pick. Listen out for Mendelssohn&apos;s premonition of Wagner&apos;s Parsifal in the first movement of the Reformation Symphony, numbered as 5: both make use of the so-called Dresden Amen (a 19th century Saxon church melody and cadence), and I think you&apos;ll be shocked \u2013 if you know your Wagner but not your Mendelssohn \u2013 at how closely Mendelssohn&apos;s string scoring of the theme resembles Wagner&apos;s harmonisation and treatment of the melody in his last opera. For all his splenetic, toxic criticism, Wagner knew how much he owed Mendelssohn: he privately admitted to his wife in 1879 that, decades earlier, he had nicked some of Mendelssohn&apos;s Calm Sea and Prosperous Overture for his incidental music to Theodor Apel&apos;s play Columbus. And if you haven&apos;t heard the string symphonies, which Mendelssohn wrote between the age of 12 and 14, go for Concerto K\u00f6ln&apos;s performances on Warner.

But it&apos;s hard to maintain your interest in a play in which so little actually happens during the 90 minutes on stage. Every character in Hoors has reached a moment of crisis, but by setting the play so firmly at the still point of the turning world, Burke lands the audience in dramatic limbo. His conceit has big comic potential. Vicky has been forced to turn her wedding day into a funeral after Andy, her fiance, has died during a hedonistic stag weekend in Hamburg and Amsterdam. It would be a bleak scenario were the young woman not happier without him. His death has opened a new world of opportunity for her. Returning home for the occasion, her financially successful sister Nikki carries a similar sense of leaving the past behind. When Andy&apos;s friends call - partly out of respect for the dead, but mainly for the chance to chat up the women - they, too, come to realise his passing marks the end of an era. For father-of-two Tony, it&apos;s a last glimpse of a life he once had; for stuck-in-the-mud Stevie, it&apos;s the shock of seeing the world moving on without him. But by focusing on this moment of transition - a vivid life left behind, an unknown vista ahead - Burke introduces an uncharacteristic feeling of inertia. Perhaps that&apos;s why Conor Murphy&apos;s set revolves more and more as the play goes on. Taking us from living room to bedroom, this bourgeois domestic interior brings its own circling choreography to Jimmy Fay&apos;s production, as if to compensate for the lack of dramatic action. Unfortunately, its overly grand scale and tendency to start turning before a scene is over also saps much of the energy from Burke&apos;s writing. At its best, the playwright&apos;s language has the scabrous bite and hilarious attack that helped make Black Watch such a hit. Even as he searches for narrative tension, Burke can still deliver volleys of darkly funny barbs and one-liners. Michael Moreland (Stevie) and Andy Clark (Tony) are perfectly attuned to Burke&apos;s rhythms, driven as they are by a forthright swagger and a need to say the unsayable. Despite spirited performances, Catherine Murray (Nikki) and Lisa Gardner (Vicky) seem to trust the language less, which adds to the production&apos;s uneven tone.  A less lavish staging would give greater vent to the upfront force of the script, releasing more of its Ortonesque darkness, but Burke has not set the stakes high enough to do justice to his themes.", "sentences": ["Vicky has been forced to turn her wedding day into a funeral after Andy, her fiance, has died during a hedonistic stag weekend in Hamburg and Amsterdam."], "title": "Theatre review: Hoors / Traverse, Edinburgh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/07/hoors-traverse-edinburgh-theatre-review", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-07T20:39:54Z", "article": "It may have been banned in France and Germany this year, but there was no problem getting hold of Spice in Camden, north London, today.

De Jong was signed from Hamburg for \u00a314m in January and immediately installed as the midfield enforcer in a Manchester City side that desperately needed reinforcements. It is what Eric Cantona once famously described as the water-carrier&apos;s role: to win the ball, break up opposition attacks, get your foot in. Nothing too flashy or elaborate. De Jong had his own nickname at Hamburg because of the way, like Hughes, he used to chop down everything in front of him. He was Rasenm\u00e4her, the Lawnmower. The paradox is that De Jong grew up as a &quot;real footballer&quot;, which at Ajax meant someone who played lavish passes with the outside of his boot and knew all sorts of different ways to bring a crowd to its feet. De Jong was a fast-running forward, a training-ground show-off who dreamed of being the next Dennis Bergkamp. At 18, he seemed on course when, in an early game against Arsenal at Highbury, he lobbed a beauty into the top corner. Back in training, he would try to nutmeg his team-mates with back-heels. Or try shots from impossible distances. So what has happened? How did the Ajax footballer become, in essence, a German footballer? Simon Kuper, the doyen of Dutch football writers, has written that it is &quot;as if a kid who had dreamed of being a rapper had instead turned into a world-class accountant&quot;. Henk Spaan, author of a book on the 100 best Dutch footballers ever, has described the new De Jong as a &quot;right-footed Edgar Davids&quot;. &quot;I was always a striker, or a No10,&quot; De Jong says. &quot;Even in my last year at Ajax I was on the right side of attack. But then I moved to Germany and the Hamburg coach, Huub Stevens, said: &apos;Listen, this might be a surprise but I&apos;m going to turn you into a defensive midfielder so trust me.&apos; &quot;It was a shock because I&apos;d always played in a more glamorous position but I&apos;d always admired that kind of player. I looked at it like this: Zinedine Zidane couldn&apos;t have done his job without Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9. Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke couldn&apos;t have scored those goals without Roy Keane. Fernando Redondo, Patrick Vieira, Fernando Hierro; a team cannot operate without these players. It&apos;s about discipline and doing a job for the team. So let the other players fight it out to be the main man. My job is to defend then give the ball to the players who have the creativity.&quot; His combative streak is a legacy, in part, to his upbringing in immigrant Amsterdam-West. De Jong was raised in Neighbourhood 9 and, like most Amsterdam Surinamese, football was in the family. His father, Jerry, was a full-back at PSV Eindhoven and Maastricht, with three caps for Holland, and now works as an amateur coach. &quot;He tries to take young kids off the streets,&quot; his son says. &quot;The idea is to get them into football to give them a better life.&quot; But Jerry was an absent parent. Nigel, the eldest of five children, became the man of the apartment. His mother, Marja, had a kidney problem and was frequently in hospital. &quot;I had to grow up quickly,&quot; he says. &quot;My childhood wasn&apos;t easy. We didn&apos;t have a lot and we had to fight for everything we got. There was no time to play around and not a lot of spare cash. When you grow up in that kind of area you can go one of two ways, and one is on the streets. I don&apos;t want to make it too dramatic but there were other kids from my neighbourhood who got into a bad way of life. I&apos;ve seen friends die from being on the streets.&quot; There are plenty of smart, streetwise kids, of course, who have come from tough backgrounds to make a living in professional sport. What makes De Jong different is that he has simultaneously developed a successful career running a classic-car business in Germany and Abu Dhabi. &quot;My mother always told me the two things in life that were important: your family and your education. Even as a young kid, I was intrigued by the financial side of life and when I joined Ajax I always knew I needed something else. You see examples of players going bankrupt and they don&apos;t have a degree or education to fall back on. We&apos;ve seen it in Holland with Glenn Helder [formerly of Arsenal] and I was determined I would never go that way. The most important thing for me was to finish my schooling and then to see what football might hold for me. So I worked hard and I ended up with a degree in economics.&quot; At Ajax and Hamburg, De Jong was almost permanently in the top three of the Eredivisie and Bundesliga. &quot;For seven years I had known nothing else but a mentality of &apos;We have to win, we have to win&apos;.&quot; But City were languishing just above the relegation zone when De Jong signed and had just been eliminated from the FA Cup by a Nottingham Forest side fighting relegation to League One. &quot;It&apos;s been on and off,&quot; he admits. &quot;The results have been mixed, especially the difference between the home form and the away form. We need to improve on that but it&apos;s a beautiful club and it&apos;s been good for me to see the club in a, quotes, &apos;bad season&apos; and experience the downside, knowing there are successful years to come. The success was never going to come straightaway. I knew that from the start. But I met the chairman [Khaldoon Al Mubarak] and he told me his plans. &quot;We just have to have patience. Of course, it&apos;s not easy for the fans when there are bad results but we all have to believe in Mark Hughes. I&apos;m hoping he is going to stay. I&apos;m happy with him, he&apos;s happy with us, and we have to give him a chance for next season. That was the chairman&apos;s idea, to stay focused with the same people, build something nice. &quot;He told me about the expectations of the club and the way some people expected them to take the club to the top in the first six months. It doesn&apos;t work like that, of course. It takes time. Everyone seems to think the new owners are pumping in all this money without using their minds but I talked to the board and \u00adKhaldoon and they are trying to build something with a mind behind it. You just have to have patience and work your bollocks off to get it right.&quot; &quot;Patience&quot; has become the watchword at the City of Manchester stadium. But how long will it take? &quot;I&apos;ve got a four-year contract and, in that time, I think we could challenge Manchester United. It&apos;s going to be difficult but everyone has to have the right mentality to think we can do it. We need to look at a club like Bayern Munich where they all have that state of mind: &apos;We are the best.&apos; We have to develop a winning mentality. But if you look at the players it&apos;s not a group with a lot of experience.&quot; He has settled into the footballers&apos; enclave of Bowdon, a few miles south of Manchester. But his visits into the city centre have surprised him. &quot;There are so many more Blues than Reds,&quot; he says. &quot;If I take a cab, the driver is a City fan. If I go to the shopping centre, all I see are City shirts. I was astonished when I first arrived because everyone was a Blue and I was asking everyone: &apos;How does that work? Manchester United are the biggest club in the world, aren&apos;t they?&apos; &quot;People would explain to me: &apos;That&apos;s just a global thing, the real workers&apos; club is Manchester City.&apos; And it&apos;s true, it&apos;s a working club, and the people in Manchester can relate to this club because they are working people. They are very proud of it. That&apos;s why Manchester City is so big locally \u2013 not worldwide maybe, but definitely locally.&quot;", "sentences": ["My job is to defend then give the ball to the players who have the creativity.&quot; His combative streak is a legacy, in part, to his upbringing in immigrant Amsterdam-West.", "De Jong was raised in Neighbourhood 9 and, like most Amsterdam Surinamese, football was in the family."], "title": "Manchester City's Nigel de Jong admits his side needs to find a winning mentality", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/09/nigel-de-jong-manchester-city-interview", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-09T23:01:00Z", "article": "Many years ago, a guitarist friend of mine was roused to eye-gouging levels of blistered rage when, after one slightly so-so set, a fellow-musician gave faux consolation by saying he had been &quot;technically very competent&quot;. Subsequently, as the charming Scots vernacular goes, violence was offered. Something similar happened here, in the opening week of the much-awaited new work from Scotland&apos;s playwright hero Gregory Burke, whose Black Watch last year took so much of the world by storm and gave splendid scalding hope to his land&apos;s cultural and political renaissance: he was damned by faint applause. The four-strong cast rushed back on with frankly indecent haste to take a second bow before the sporadic clapping died like bored spit on a tepid griddle. Technically very competent. This isn&apos;t a bad play. It&apos;s just that the hopes engendered by the savagely dynamic success of Black Watch, its beautifully authentic take on the language and obsessions and heroism and stupidity of Fife squaddies in Iraq, quite fail here to even sprout wings, let alone fly. Hoors is, essentially, a domestic drama-in-the-round \u2013 literally, with a revolving stage swinging from cheesily glassy living room to bling-y bedroom \u2013 with a grand premise, wholly unrealised. At its very best, which is too seldom, it&apos;s like Abigail&apos;s Party gone roughly askew, or Ayckbourn on a rare off-day. Vicky and her slightly sassier younger sister Nikki are together the night before what should have been Vicky&apos;s wedding: it is now the due date of her fiance&apos;s funeral, big Davey having died during an amphetamine-fuelled stag weekend in Amsterdam. His pals Stevie and Tony come along this same night, white coffin in the corner of the white-leather room, to pay their respects, snort white coke off the white coffin and try, in their various rough sly ways, to get their legs over. Hoors \u2013 Scots for &quot;whores&quot; \u2013 is Burke&apos;s nice double-drift of a title suggesting that, despite the laissez-lay ease of the Dutch girls in the stag-night brothels, the real sluts are here: all four of them angry, confused, boastful, drunk, toked, lying, horny. Part of the problem, as with many well-written but rightly unsuccessful books, is that you don&apos;t, in the end, care what happens to them. There is not one likable character. There is fine acting throughout. Michael Moreland, as the slightly desperate whiny ginger Stevie, and Andy Clark, as the &quot;sexier&quot; Tony, have some fabulous Scots-male silences together, stirring one-liners left hanging and sweating in awkwardness. Catherine Murray and Lisa Gardner, as the sisters who don&apos;t particularly like each other (or, apparently, anyone) belt it out with bravo and style and not a little sex appeal.  This might sound terribly simplistic, but it&apos;s hard not to wonder whether Burke&apos;s often wonderful words work better in the mouths of men: whether, to be blunt, he can&apos;t write so well for women. The opening, for instance, involves a slightly laboured gag between the girls about perfume packaging. It&apos;s almost funny, but not really, and you and I have heard/read/seen that kind of thing done a hundred times better in even the most woeful pieces of female comedy of the past 50 years (stopping short, of course, of The Vicar of Dibley). Stevie and Andy bicker raw, bright truths at each other: Vicky and Nikki bicker blithe, lazy truisms. Within the first two minutes here, with a terribly willing Edinburgh audience failing to muster a titter, I began to think it was all about to go very, very wrong. It didn&apos;t, really. But it didn&apos;t get much better. There were insights, yes: and better laughter, and a couple of intakes of disgusted breath; and drama, good drama, at times, but ultimately it was something of a let-down, unless you had wanted to go out and be reminded, bleakly, of the grim vicissitudes of modern sex wars, and what hoors men are. At times, sadly, you were waiting for the stage to whirl again to see what was happening in the next room: not because you really cared, but because you were bored with what was happening in the one you were watching. Technically very competent. Hell, I also seem to have written, above, &quot;fine acting throughout&quot;, which is perhaps even more damning. I have to say, though, back on the guitar thing: Niall did play a blistering set and solos the very next night.

Keating wrote the song for his lookalike Brinck who, like many of this year&apos;s contenders, is highly successful in his homeland (his last album hit number one on Danish iTunes). Brinck has a voice like Keating too, albeit crossed with James Blunt, and he remembers fondly the moments when the uninitiated would listen to his music and say, &quot;That&apos;s a cool tune, but who&apos;s doing those power vocals?!&quot; In other news, the video features Brinck contemplating the happy days of his past while sitting in fields of rape seed.

Allow Nelly Ciobanu to explain: &quot;All the mountains, all the seas, are dancing chora / It&apos;s a dance you&apos;ve never seen, from a country called Moldova.&quot; It&apos;s easy to imagine this song with a drum&apos;n&apos;bass remix, but for now, Nelly must console herself with more modest achievements; she&apos;s getting ready to go on tour to Korea and China.            NetherlandsThe Toppers \u2013 Shine Resembling a boy band crossed with the cast of Last of the Summer Wine, the Toppers are apparently huge in Holland. More than 850,000 people have seen the band perform live since they formed in 2004, and their shows at the Amsterdam Arena are sellouts.  Of the punters who pay to watch this band, one can only assume they are high on life, and other substances. Men about to turn 50 should know better than to sing about how &quot;Love will make us glow in the dark&quot;. If it makes it to the final (and the Dutch haven&apos;t qualified since 2004), thousands will be left psychologically scarred. And the song&apos;s dirty wobbling bassline will do something similar to their bowels.            RomaniaElena \u2013 The Balkan Girls You may have thought that it was Guildford girls who like to party, like nobody, like nobody, but Elena is here to set you straight. The song begins with the line: &quot;It&apos;s time for me to unwind, I&apos;m going to start the weekend with gin tonic and lime,&quot; and what follows is an uptempo piece of Shakira-ish pop, that is a thinly-veiled hymn to getting your drunk on. The lyrics are cool \u2013 &quot;My hips are ready to glow&quot;, &quot;The groovy light will shine all night&quot;, etc \u2013 and there&apos;s a natty stab of Balkan horns at the end of each chorus (even the Spanish have thrown some Eastern influences into their song this year, in the hope of impressing the regional bloc vote). In other news, Elena comes from a family of priests and has her own dance school.            RussiaAnastasia Prikhodko \u2013 Mamo This is the entry from the defending champions, and one can only assume that they&apos;re so scared of winning again and being accused of a stitch-up, they&apos;ve decided to throw the whole thing. This dirge of a ballad is performed by a woman whose facial expression befits someone burying their pet dog. What&apos;s more, it&apos;s sung in a low growling voice that seems intent on channelling the deceased Fido&apos;s spirit. By the end of the song she is quite literally barking. Interestingly, Anastasia is not only named after the missing Princess (though we can probably assume she&apos;s not still on the run 91 years later) but is Ukrainian too. There&apos;s some political undercurrent there all right, but goodness knows what.            UkraineSvetlana Loboda \u2013 Be my Valentine! (Anti-Crisis Girl)  If Russia is going to lose, who&apos;s going to win? The smart money is heading to Norway&apos;s Belorussian fiddler, but the less smart money (ie mine) would be heading towards Russia&apos;s partner in gas-pipe squabbling, the Ukraine.  Be My Valentine! is a fantastic pop tune, a Britney-esque romp with the obligatory Balkan element transformed into a bassline that Timbaland would be proud of. Elsewhere, there&apos;s needless repetition of the phrase &quot;crazy ball&quot; and a video that consists entirely of nubile young men and women being covered in melted chocolate. If that wasn&apos;t enough, Svetlana has her own clothing label that expresses &quot;social protest against false glamorous trends and sticky stereotypes.&quot; What more do you want? A fiddle? Oh.            United KingdomJade Ewen \u2013 It&apos;s My Time Many countries send their best selling artists. Others, their most iconic performers. Here in the UK, we send the winner of a TV talent show that isn&apos;t even very popular. OK, so it&apos;s composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and, during the live show, he may back Jade on piano as he does on the video, but ALW&apos;s not a popstar, he&apos;s a composer/impresario for goodness&apos; sake. What&apos;s more, this song could have been lifted straight from the second act of one of his musicals. It&apos;s contemplative rather than stirring, and the fact Jade sounds a bit like Mariah Carey will cover up nothing. The Eurovision semi-finals take place tonight and tomorrow night.

Heathrow&apos;s Terminal Five provided welcome new facilities for passengers and to allow for bigger planes, but it didn&apos;t deliver a single new take-off or landing slot. It is because of the lack of runway capacity at Heathrow that airlines are forced to choose between old destinations and new \u2013 or to go elsewhere entirely. Last month alone Leeds/Bradford and Durham Tees Valley airports both lost their links to Heathrow as airlines shuffled their slots, while Air India decided to base its European hub at Frankfurt because it couldn&apos;t secure slots at Heathrow. As the global economy tilts towards the emerging Asian economies we should all be concerned that Frankfurt has direct links with six Chinese cities. London&apos;s five airports have flights from just two, both to Heathrow \u2013 which, because of the transfer traffic it attracts, is the only UK airport which can make such flights viable. It is little wonder that so many businesses and business organisations, such as the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce, favour new Heathrow capacity within strict environmental limits; both to improve reliability and to provide space for new destinations, as is the case at Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. As we recover from recession it is my job as BAA&apos;s chief executive to make the business case for our proposed new runways at Stansted and Heathrow. But whoever forms the next government will need to make strategic decisions for the next few decades on where those runways should be, particularly in the south-east where no new full-length runway has been built since 1945. The shadow transport secretary announced this month that she is against a new airport in the Thames Estuary as the mayor of London has proposed, to add to her opposition to expansion at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The pros and cons of individual runway proposals will I&apos;m sure continue to be debated, but it is surely necessary for politicians of all parties to make difficult decisions \u2013 and those decisions are increasingly urgent if we are to keep the UK competitive in the even more globalised world that will emerge from the recession.", "sentences": ["It is little wonder that so many businesses and business organisations, such as the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce, favour new Heathrow capacity within strict environmental limits; both to improve reliability and to provide space for new destinations, as is the case at Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt."], "title": "We need to expand our airports | Colin Matthews", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/may/13/theresa-villiers-airport-expansion", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Transport policy", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "Travel & leisure", "Travel", "Environment", "Business", "Conservatives", "Theresa Villiers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-13T21:35:01Z", "article": "We have received a complaint from solicitors acting for Trafigura about this article. Read Trafigura&apos;s statement here   On a July day in 2006 workers at the port in Amsterdam began their usual task of removing &quot;slop&quot; from a ship that had sailed to the Netherlands from Algeciras in Spain. As they pumped waste from the Probo Koala \u2013 a vessel chartered to the British-based oil trading company Trafigura \u2013 they were expecting the usual mix of water and oil left over from the tank after it had been washed down with water. But the workers, employed by Dutch company Amsterdam Port Services (APS), noticed the waste was different from the ordinary material they were used to dealing with. Pitch black in colour, it gave off such a vile smell that some of the workers became sick, attracting the attention of the environmental authorities. APS refused to continue disposing of the pungent waste unless its payment was increased. Refusing to pay the extra, Trafigura decided to pump the material back on board the ship. The Probo Koala then set sail again, carrying its foul-smelling cargo to west Africa. As the ship made its way to the Ivorian port of Abidjan a company with no previous experience in waste removal was applying for licences which would allow it to handle the material. Armed with its new licences, &quot;Tommy&quot; agreed to handle the highly toxic material for a sum 20 times less than the amount demanded by APS in Amsterdam. The Probo Koala docked in Abidjan on 19 August 2006. In darkness at least 12 hired lorries began carrying loads from the ship&apos;s 400 tonnes of waste and carrying it to as many as 18 sites around the city. As the sludge was emptied out into roads and sewers, crowds starting to form, protesting at the stench, forcing truck drivers to abandon their work. Over the following weeks thousands of residents in Abidjan found themselves choking and coughing, some vomiting. At least 10 are said to have died from sickness. The episode is now the centre of a civil suit being played out at the high court in London. Of the 100,000 Ivorians said to have fallen sick, 30,000 are suing the secretive oil trading firm Trafigura in Britain. Three of the firm&apos;s key directors \u2013 Graham Sharp, Claude Dauphin and Eric de Turckheim \u2013 were based in London. Company bosses repeatedly insisted at the time the Probo Koala had only routinely discharged ordinary slops. Sharp, for example, wrote to the New York Times: &quot;The vessel slops we discharged \u2026 were not capable of causing the harm that happened there. In particular, we are certain they did not contain hydrogen sulphide.&quot; De Turckheim appeared on BBC television to tell Jeremy Paxman the same thing. Yet three years on, after a series of legal developments, lawyers for the victims say they are now able to paint a completely different picture of what really happened \u2013 one that would not be out of place in a John Grisham thriller. Documents have emerged saying that about two tons of highly poisonous hydrogen sulphide was indeed present in a sample of what was a potentially lethal sulphur and caustic soda cocktail. Asked to comment about the potential toxicity of such a mix, John Hoskins, a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, told BBC2&apos;s Newsnight last night: &quot;If you dropped this in Trafalgar Square, you would have people being sick for several miles around and that would involve millions of people. You&apos;d see the effects out to the M25. &quot;It&apos;s not very hard to imagine that if a pregnant woman was poisoned her body reacts by aborting the foetus. There will be long-term effects. These things are chronically damaging and, once you&apos;ve damaged your lungs, kidneys, that damage will not recover.&quot; It is alleged that what Trafigura was really doing was very far from routine: that the company was trying to transform consignments of cheap and dirty petroleum, heavily contaminated with sulphur, into something more profitable. Trafigura employees were trying to remove sulphur from the so-called &quot;coker gasoline&quot;, it is claimed, by adding highly-corrosive caustic soda and a catalyst. This process leaves the improved petroleum in a top layer and a toxic sludge underneath. Lawyer Martyn Day, acting for the claimants, says the oil traders first tried the chemical process on land in early 2006 at the Tunisian port of La Skirra. &quot;The resulting waste and toxic gases caused significant health problems leading to the port authorities banning them,&quot; he said. Day says the firm next tried the &quot;highly unusual and dangerous step&quot; of carrying out do-it-yourself refining in a tanker at sea off the coast of Gibraltar. They tried to dispose of the resultant toxic waste in Amsterdam and &quot;unsuccessfully attempted to pass it off as ordinary waste&quot;. When they were asked to pay extra by the Dutch disposal firm, Trafigura admits it pumped the waste back on board and subsequently took it down the west African coast where it could be disposed of at a fraction of the cost, hiring a local contractor to take it away. Day says a final Trafigura attempt to continue its desulphuring operations in Norway, using a different ship, led to a tank explosion &quot;causing a sulphur gas cloud to affect hundreds in the local population&quot;. An analysis of the sample obtained from the Amsterdam authorities and seen by the Guardian shows that, despite all Trafigura&apos;s denials, it did contain large quantities of sulphur compounds and poisonous hydrogen sulphide gas. These were by-products of desulphurisation attempts, not ordinary tank-washings. Trafigura director Dauphin found himself temporarily jailed alongside two company executives when he went out to the Ivory Coast in an attempt to handle the dumping crisis. He was only released when the company paid more than \u00a3100m to the African government for clean-up costs and individual compensation, although it continued to deny any link between the payment and his release. A local contractor and a port official were convicted and jailed in Abidjan for their part in the dumping. Trafigura faces possible prosecution in Amsterdam for illegally exporting toxic waste. But the company also faces the massive group litigation from Day. The trial is due to open in October in London. In a significant legal move last year, Trafigura agreed to compensate claimants if they could prove a link between their illness and exposure to the waste, a cause-and-effect relationship which they continue to strenuously deny. The firm said it would only pay up to anyone who could prove to legal standards that the toxic waste directly caused their medical condition. Day, for the claimants, says this move has the effect of excluding from the courtroom all the history of the voyage of the Probo Koala. He claims that Trafigura has followed up its move by attempts to induce claimants to change their stories. Witness statements allege that Simon Nurney, a partner in Trafigura&apos;s solicitors, Macfarlanes, interviewed a lead claimant who had been flown business class to a luxury hotel in Morocco, and was later offered money to retract his evidence. The high court has, as a result, banned Trafigura from further contact with witnesses. In a statement to the Guardian yesterday, Macfarlanes admitted Nurney had met the witness but denied any wrongdoing. &quot;Following advice from leading QCs and having informed the client, Macfarlanes arranged to meet the individual in Morocco,&quot; the statement says. &quot;Given the extreme sensitivity of any meeting between that individual and Macfarlanes, he specifically requested that the meeting should take place outside the Ivory Coast.\u00a0 Macfarlanes were represented in Morocco by one of our partners, who acted with the full knowledge and support of the firm and the client. &quot;This partner and another member of the legal team were present at the meetings in Morocco.\u00a0 Macfarlanes paid the individual&apos;s travel and related expenses in relation to these meetings, but neither made nor offered any other payment or inducement. &quot;At no time has anyone from Macfarlanes or Trafigura&apos;s legal team, our client or their agents acted improperly or offered any inducements whatsoever to any witnesses or claimants.&quot; Trafigura&apos;s latest move has been to claim that further publicising these allegations would put the lives of their local employees in danger \u2013 presumably from hostile residents of Abidjan. Because of those fears, Mr Justice McDuff allowed Trafigura to hold secret hearings yesterday, ruling that the press and the public could not attend as he considered whether to impose witness anonymity and other protective measures. The privately-owned oil trading group claims to be one of the biggest in the world, with claimed revenues of $73bn (\u00a348.2bn) and undisclosed share ownership. It was set up offshore in 1993. Trafigura managers worked until then for Marc Rich, the oil trader who became notorious for South African and Iranian sanctions-busting. Rich was a fugitive from US justice for alleged tax evasion and trading with Iran, but was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.", "sentences": ["Read Trafigura&apos;s statement here   On a July day in 2006 workers at the port in Amsterdam began their usual task of removing &quot;slop&quot; from a ship that had sailed to the Netherlands from Algeciras in Spain.", "But the workers, employed by Dutch company Amsterdam Port Services (APS), noticed the waste was different from the ordinary material they were used to dealing with.", "Armed with its new licences, &quot;Tommy&quot; agreed to handle the highly toxic material for a sum 20 times less than the amount demanded by APS in Amsterdam.", "They tried to dispose of the resultant toxic waste in Amsterdam and &quot;unsuccessfully attempted to pass it off as ordinary waste&quot;.", "An analysis of the sample obtained from the Amsterdam authorities and seen by the Guardian shows that, despite all Trafigura&apos;s denials, it did contain large quantities of sulphur compounds and poisonous hydrogen sulphide gas.", "Trafigura faces possible prosecution in Amsterdam for illegally exporting toxic waste."], "title": "The boat that reeked \u2013 toxic voyage of the Probo Koala", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/13/trafigura-ivory-coast-waste", "tags": ["Pollution", "Ivory Coast", "World news", "Environment", "UK news", "Oil and gas companies", "Business", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-13T23:01:00Z", "article": "How would you react to someone who tried to sell you a car that runs on fresh air? Perhaps you would think he was peddling a potentially planet-saving technology. More likely you would dismiss him as a conman or a fantasist. Yet that is precisely the pitch being made by French auto engineer Guy Negre, a good-humoured man in his mid-60s who claims to have developed a car powered by compressed air: one that produces a fraction of the carbon emissions of a standard engine, reaches speeds of 30mph-plus, that can travel 65 miles on a one-minute recharge and, best of all, costs from just over \u00a33,000. Negre is quick to point out the drawbacks of existing eco-car technology. &quot;Hybrids are only marginally less polluting than the most efficient combustion engines,&quot; he says. &quot;Hydrogen power is expensive and impractical. Fuel cells are expensive and unproven and electric cars are reliant on expensive, unreliable battery technology.&quot; Given the number of false green-auto dawns, you might wonder why air-powered cars should be any different. While Negre&apos;s air cars have similar carbon emissions to electric cars (it all depends how the electricity to power the pumps that fill their air tanks is generated), he argues that air-power is a superior technology. &quot;Compared to electric cars, air-powered cars cost a fraction of the price to buy, they don&apos;t need expensive batteries to be replaced every five years or so and crucially they take only a fraction of the time to recharge.&quot; Negre previously designed racing engines for Renault and has devoted the last 13 years to developing compressed air technology at his factory in Carros, outside Nice, in southern France. He believes air power has a real chance of putting a rocket up the $2tn-a-year global auto industry, radically improving the quality of urban life and making a serious dent in global carbon emissions in the process. I confess I was so sceptical that I reserved judgment until I had driven one of his cars. On the day I visited the factory, most of the cars were at Schipol airport in Amsterdam, where from next month they are being trialled as replacements for the huge fleet of electric service vehicles operated by Air France KLM. So the version I drove was an early prototype, a three-wheeler with no bodywork, steered by a joystick. OK, it didn&apos;t deliver the smoothly upholstered power so beloved by conventional car enthusiasts. And it possessed all the glamour of a souped-up lawnmower. But it worked, easily reaching speeds above 25mph in the limited space of the factory car park, which doubles as a test track. In full-scale production, air-powered vehicles will range from three-wheeled buggies to a four-wheeled, five-door family saloon. Although the number of models on offer now is limited for cost reasons, they could eventually include vans, buses, taxis and boats. The cars are made of fibreglass, which is lighter and 10 times stronger than steel, claims Negre. The compressed air is stored at high pressure in shatter-proof thermoplastic tanks surrounded by a carbon-fibre shell. (The same tanks used to contain the fuel in gas-powered buses.) The air is released through pistons in the engine, which drive the wheels. Unlike conventional internal combustion engines, air-powered engines run very cold and thick ice quickly forms on the engine. This means that the only feature that comes for free in the air car will be air-conditioning.  Each car has an onboard pump that can refill the tank overnight. But Negre has also developed a high-pressure air pump - imagine a heavy-duty version of the tyre pumps found on a garage forecourt - that can fill the tanks in less than a minute. These could be powered by clean electricity - hydro, wind or solar - making the air car completely pollution-free. Even if carbon-generated electricity is used, CO2 emissions are still only 10% of a petrol engine&apos;s, claims Negre. That&apos;s great for urban driving where journeys are typically a few miles. For longer journeys there&apos;s a hybrid, battery-assisted version, which Negre claims can reach 100mph and travel 900 miles on one gallon of petrol. Clearly the idea is being taken seriously by KLM. Independent energy experts are also cautiously optimistic. &quot;I&apos;ve looked at this technology and it can work,&quot; says Ulf Bossel, a sustainable energy consultant and organiser of the European Fuel Cell Forum. &quot;It looks good over 50km or so. I see no reason why this shouldn&apos;t be a successful form of urban transport in the near future.&quot; But perhaps the most credible endorsement of air power comes from a \u00a330m deal the makers recently signed with Indian car giant Tata to license the technology in Asia for use in the ultra-cheap Nano. Negre has also signed deals to manufacture the car in the US, Latin America, and several European countries, but none as yet in the UK. However, he says he is close to sealing an agreement that could see air cars on sale in the UK within three years. But if cars running on fresh air fulfil their promise, why stop there? With just a few alterations, Negre claims a hybrid version of his new engine could even be used to power aircraft.", "sentences": ["On the day I visited the factory, most of the cars were at Schipol airport in Amsterdam, where from next month they are being trialled as replacements for the huge fleet of electric service vehicles operated by Air France KLM."], "title": "On the road with the Airpod air-powered car", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/14/air-powered-car-hybrid-france", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Energy", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Automotive industry", "Environment", "Business", "France", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-14T15:36:19Z", "article": "The Dutch government is planning to spend \u20ac4m (\u00a33.6m) to pay the salaries of 60 young journalists to work on otherwise commercially funded regional and national newspapers across the Netherlands.

The initial bursary is expected to fund junior positions for two years, with the first journalists expected to start at the end of the summer, NIS News, an English-language Dutch news service, reported Plasterk as saying.

He had lived in Hong Kong for more than 35 years. Tough-talking and always ready with a quip, Van Es was considered by colleagues to be fearless and resourceful.. &quot;Obviously he will be always remembered as one of the great witnesses of one of the great dramas in the second half of the 20th century,&quot; said Ernst Herb, president of Hong Kong&apos;s Foreign Correspondent Club. &quot;He really captured the spirit of foreign reporting. He was quite an inspiration.&quot; Van Es arrived in Hong Kong as a freelancer in 1967 and joined the South China Morning Post as chief photographer. He got a chance the following year to go to Vietnam as a soundman for NBC News, and took it. After a brief stint, he joined the Associated Press photo staff in Saigon from 1969-72 and then covered the last three years of the war for United Press International. His photo of a wounded soldier at the May 1969 battle of Hamburger Hill, with a tiny cross gleaming against his dark silhouette, became well known. Then his shot of the helicopter escape from a Saigon rooftop on 29 April 1975 became a metaphor for the desperate US withdrawal and its policy failure in Vietnam. As North Vietnamese forces neared the city, more than 1,000 Vietnamese joined American military and civilians fleeing the country, mostly by helicopters from the US embassy roof. A few blocks away, others climbed a ladder on the roof of an apartment building that housed CIA officials and families, hoping to escape aboard a helicopter owned by Air America, the CIA-run airline. From his vantage point on a balcony several blocks away, Van Es recorded the scene with a 300-mm lens \u2013 the longest one he had. He said later that it was clear not all the people on the roof would be able to escape. The photo earned Van Es considerable fame, but he told friends that he spent a great deal of time explaining that it was not a photo of the embassy roof, as was widely assumed. Van Es was upset when the image he so famously captured was used in the musical Miss Saigon, which featured Americans evacuating the city from the embassy roof by helicopter. He considered legal action but decided against it. Born in Hilversum, the Netherlands, Hubert Van Es learned English as a child from hanging out with soldiers during the second world war. He said he decided to become a photographer after going to an exhibition at a local museum when he was 13 and seeing the work of the legendary war photographer Robert Capa. After graduating from college, he started working as a photographer in 1959 with the Nederlands Foto Persbureau in Amsterdam, but Asia became his home. When the Vietnam war ended in 1975, he returned to Hong Kong where he freelanced for American and European newspapers and magazines and shot still photos for many Hollywood movies on location across Asia. Van Es, who was president of the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents Club in the early 1980s, was often found holding court there, his firsthand accounts and opinions sought out by reporters new and old. &quot;His presence there is really memorable,&quot; Herb said. Van Es covered the Moro rebellion in the Philippines and was among the journalists who flew into Kabul to cover the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. A CBS cameraman, Derek Williams, got through immigration but everyone else was stopped and held in the transit lounge. &quot;As they were then being shepherded back to the plane,&quot; Williams recalled, &quot;Hugh saw an open door to his left, and just made a break for it with only his camera bag. He ran through the terminal and jumped into a taxi to try to get to the Intercontinental Hotel.&quot; Afghan police arrested Van Es, but the plane had taken off so they took him to the hotel. Williams said he and Van Es spent three days in Kabul before being expelled. Van Es&apos;s still photos, for Time magazine, were the first to capture Soviet tanks rolling into Afghanistan. He met his wife in Hong Kong and they were married for 39 years.

Imagine a looming rugger thug who defines his physique as voluptuous, not tough, and behaves like a shy adolescent of indeterminate sex. Is he a futuristic being whose home is not on this earth or a throwback from some other time? Lou Reed, one of his earliest supporters, said: &quot;When I heard him, I knew that I was in the presence of an angel.&quot; The performance artist Laurie Anderson, Reed&apos;s partner, responded with an intimidated shudder: &quot;It&apos;s like seeing a Viking!&quot; And how, if we respect the binary logic of human biology, do we classify the idiosyncratic Antony? Even his own designation, transgender, hardly does justice to his mutability. One of his songs announces, not altogether happily: &quot;Today I Am a Boy&quot;, which leaves open the possibility that he may grow up to be a woman. But another song, delivered with quavery vocal inflections and fluttering fingers, abandons lumpish humanity altogether and reports: &quot;I Am a Bird Now.&quot;  In earlier days, as he vogued through the Lower East Side in Manhattan, he often wore a filmy black slip with a pair of stomping combat boots, and inked &quot;Fuck Off&quot; on his forehead as a riposte to gaping passers-by. Now, for concerts with his band Antony and the Johnsons, he entwines himself in a Grecian-looking wrap that makes him look like the Statue of Liberty without a spiked crown. His face has a pancaked pallor, screened by a lank, black, Gothic curtain of hair.  His voice is equally dualistic, a keening tenor that could belong either to a white man or a black woman. Nationally, too, he bestraddles boundaries. Born in Sussex in 1971, he has lived in New York since 1990. But his speaking voice retains a well-bred English softness and he must be the only New Yorker to make the proper, prissily exact dental sounds on the double t in that magic word, Manhattan.  When we met last weekend in Madrid, he materialised in the dim hotel lobby like an indistinct, sleepy shadow that had taken on substance, scarily large but disarmingly gentle. As we walked to a cafe on the muggy, screeching Gran Via, he began to sniffle and, like a true diva, fretted about his precious high notes. &quot;It&apos;s my allergies,&quot; he whispered. &quot;This weather&apos;s terrible for my cords, I just wish it would rain.&quot; Soon he was soothing his scratchy throat with an unseasonal cup of hot chocolate.  The young American composer Nico Muhly, who lushly scored Antony&apos;s compositions for his Barbican concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra last year, calls those songs &quot;playgrounds for the voice&quot;. It is a voice that plays with words, distorting and elasticising them with a kind of seraphic bleating, and ventures into perilous upper registers where it threatens to crack without ever doing so. No wonder it has such emotional resonance for his listeners: it is the sound made by an inner child or by the femininity that most men nervously conceal.  &quot;I had this voice when I was in high school,&quot; he told me, &quot;except nobody thought much of it then. I developed it by imitating singers I admired - Alison Moyet, Boy George, later on Nina Simone. I didn&apos;t really value it until I lost it for a while 10 years ago. I had a health issue, and the cords just seized up. The only sound that came out was a hoarse scream. With the help of steroids, I got the voice back and then I realised how crucial to my feeling of joy and well-being the experience of singing was.&quot;  The experience is one of self-revelation. Antony is unflamboyant: he permits us to overhear him, to eavesdrop on his secrets, but he does so almost reluctantly. &quot;Boy George always told me to stop noodling, he wanted me to belt like Ethel Merman.&quot; Visually, he also plays a teasing game of hide and seek. At the Barbican, he sang the first group of songs in darkness, forcing us to listen because there was nothing but a silk-swathed bulk to look at.  After &quot;Today I Am a Boy&quot;, he inserted an agonisingly long interval of silence, forcing the audience, as he said to me, &quot;to fill it up with their imaginations - to create their own music. It was a deliberate choice to start without a spotlight. For me, a theatre is a dark place. It should be mysterious, it&apos;s where we go to get away from all the utilitarian things we do in the daylight. We learn gradually to see things differently and that&apos;s why it gets slowly brighter; there&apos;s supposed to be a kind of enlightenment, not just one three-minute song after another.  &quot;I didn&apos;t set out to be a singer. Actually, the earliest creative efforts I made were drawings, copied from comics we got every week at the newsagent, or rearranging photos I cut out and pasted in scrapbooks. I applied to the Royal College of Art, though I didn&apos;t get accepted. That didn&apos;t matter; I was just looking for an escape, an excuse to get to a big city.&quot;  Rejected in London, he moved to New York to enrol in an experimental theatre course. On his first night in the city, he found his way to the Pyramid Club, a dive on a wrecked block of Avenue A over- run, as he remembers, by &quot;toothless drug addicts and gender mutants - all these amazing creative people&quot;. For Antony, creativity is synonymous with eccentricity and the capering of an unbridled id.  With a transvestite collective known as Blacklips, he performed at another club called Mother in the meat-packing district on 14th Street, the unofficial boundary between respectable uptown and the funk of downtown Manhattan. The shows were gory, with much chucking of bleeding offal scavenged from nearby butchers. &quot;We were in the thick of Aids. Blacklips was a Rorschach blot of the city&apos;s psyche; we were camping on the graves of all those queens who had died.&quot;  This end of 14th Street is now a consumerist shopping mall, where the emporiums of Stella McCartney and Diane von Furstenberg have supplanted the cross-dressing hookers and manacled men in black leather to whom the street once belonged. &quot;Yeah, the sex has migrated,&quot; Antony said. &quot;Who knows where? But it can&apos;t have disappeared off the face of the earth. The area was free to fester because it wasn&apos;t policed; now the land is so valuable that it&apos;s sold and cleaned up and given over to retail. Back then it was a cultural frontier, where people were trying out new ways of living as well as making new art. That world was actually dying when I arrived in New York; I got there for the death.&quot;  The morbidity of the times turned him, as he put it, into &quot;a historian&quot;. He reconstructed a family tree for himself, exhuming forebears who had recently died of Aids - self-created monsters like the rampant drag queen Divine, who feasts on a poodle turd in a film by John Waters, or Klaus Nomi, who sang soprano arias in a mewing falsetto while dressed in a skintight space suit.  &quot;I was already imprinted with these secondary sources. Their characters had such allure for me and what I found out about them helped me to discover myself. But it was all posthumous and in 2003 it all changed for ever. There was this new wave of kids, Nico Muhly&apos;s generation, who didn&apos;t think of urban culture in the same ghettoised way and had no sense that what they belonged to was something alternative and underground. They wear location like a very loose garment. Nico works for Philip Glass and for the Metropolitan Opera.&quot;  The kids Antony recognises as the next generation are less than a decade younger than he is, but the pace of change has turned him into a marginalised granny, wishing the juvenile avant-garde well. &quot;Culture is organised so differently now, and it&apos;s more elusive. If you&apos;re staging radical events, you do it where you won&apos;t be observed by CCTV. The internet has made the whole scene virtual, so the city&apos;s kind of obsolete. Someone makes a video in their bedroom in Perth, Australia, and then becomes the talk of three continents. I suppose there are still subcultural extremities in America, but not in New York - in Appalachia, maybe?&quot;  With a twinge of remorse, Antony acknowledges that he, too, lives in exile from the foetid cellars and profaned church crypts which used to be his arenas of operation. &quot;Being an artist downtown meant that you weren&apos;t paid and no one was listening. Now I do get paid and there are people listening - bless them, they bought my apartment for me - but it&apos;s not the same.&quot;  Deprived of the subculture&apos;s bunker-like protection, Antony, a specialist in transgressing bounds and slipping across entrenched frontiers, has instead become a connoisseur of cultural relativity, as the tour for his new disc, The Crying Light, progresses from one territory to the next.  &quot;In Europe, culture isn&apos;t homogenised, the way the media have made it in America. I love the sense of locality, the way it produces different reactions to me. We started in Scandinavia. In Norway, everyone was on the same page as me about the environment; when I talked to people they asked such clear, clean, beautiful questions. Then in Switzerland, I&apos;d get these twisted Jungian queries about identity. A journalist asked me, &apos;Why should we trust you? You put yourself out there as so vulnerable, you want us to take care of you.&apos; I thought that was very Swiss: so suspicious and paranoid.  &quot;Next is Portugal, which I really love. They recognise their own culture in me, they pick up on the wistfulness in my music and treat me like a fado singer complaining about fate. It&apos;s all pretty different from the treatment I got in America when I was touring there. Everyone was obsessed with my meat and potatoes, what kind of underwear I had on, what bows were tied to what bits of my body. I humoured them to be educational, for the sake of other transgender people who have to stay invisible.&quot;  Touring, however, afflicts him with qualms of conscience. &quot;I hate taking flights to these gigs - though I&apos;m not as bad as you, coming to Madrid from London on a day return! The nuts and bolts of this touring really worry me. I argued for travelling by bus, but the flights will leave whether we&apos;re on them or not, so it makes no difference. In the future, if there is one, people will spit on us for the reckless way we used up the earth.&quot;  A lament for parched, poisoned nature recurs in The Crying Light , though his self-excoriation goes beyond facile regrets about the environment. &quot;I hate the idea that I&apos;m serving capitalism, helping it turn music into an industry. Am I a success because hundreds of people buy what I&apos;m selling? Is that all it&apos;s about? I know what I&apos;m taking from the earth, how many tons of carbon I&apos;m producing. Just what am I giving in return, what&apos;s the worth of it? I was walking round Madrid this morning thinking that it&apos;s a done deal with the human species. It&apos;s all over thanks to capitalism and Catholicism - or maybe I should say patriarchal monotheism. Why do we have to have endless evolution, perpetual change? Why not stability, balance, keeping things sustainable?&quot;  The equilibrium between the genders is, for Antony, a model of how the world should conduct itself, making peace between opposites rather than provoking friction. He then began a quiet rant about global salvation and the need for a &quot;profoundly feminine perspective&quot;. &apos;Jesus was a girl, you know - or she will be, when she reappears. My song &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; is about a female Jesus who&apos;s born in Afghanistan 70 years from now, with the oceans rising all around, the human race dying out, only a few dogs and deer left. And the other night at my gig I started talking about Benazir Bhutto. Why did we kill her? John Lennon got so much more airplay, but was he as saintly as Benazir? She was a Joan of Arc, she went back to Pakistan to save her country, even though she knew she&apos;d be murdered. I think I&apos;m going to write an album about Benazir, I can feel it cooking in me.  &quot;And look at our new president: sure he&apos;s a man, but see who he&apos;s married to. Michelle was a senior lawyer when they met, he had to beg her for a date. Everything he does is serving and honouring the feminine. People say it&apos;s the end of testosterone politics, of all that bullying and swaggering by Bush and Cheney, but why can&apos;t they celebrate the emergence of oestrogen? All Obama&apos;s family is female - remember how he loved his grandmother, he has two daughters ...&quot;  I interrupted this eulogy to Magna Mater by reminding Antony that Bo, the Obama dog, possesses an inconvenient pair of testicles. He pursed his lips tetchily. &quot;Well, I do have a sense of humour, but this is serious. That&apos;s why I&apos;m evangelising. I&apos;m not a Christian but I am prepared to worship Jesus if she&apos;s a girl, and all leaders in the world should do the same. And you know why I&apos;m allowed to say this? Because I&apos;m a transgender person and that makes me a witch!&quot;  I thought it best not to disagree, for fear of being hexed. But I recalled a stray glimpse of Antony lapping up his hot chocolate, which showed me someone less supernatural and more lovable. &quot;Look at this,&quot; he said as he slurped, &quot;it&apos;s so thick it&apos;s almost a pudding!&quot; His blue eyes, startlingly at odds with his dyed black hair, shone with greedy delight. I felt I was talking to a Peter Pan who was swelling into Billy Bunter, an innocent creature who has had the good fortune, vocally and in all other ways, not to grow up.  The epiphany didn&apos;t last for long and as we said goodbye, Antony&apos;s wide shoulders slumped beneath the weight of a doomed world. He then abruptly turned off the Gran Via - the main street of life, the noisy, thronging thoroughfare of normality - and wandered down a seedy alley, in search perhaps of a subculture to which he might belong.  \u2022 Antony and the Johnsons&apos; UK tour starts at Brighton Dome on Thursday as part of the Brighton Festival.

He is not hard to spot: his snow-white hair and beard are both long and flowing and he is wearing an acid-bright tie-dye T-shirt, faded denims and plastic sandals. He resembles a reincarnated and even more rotund Jerry Garcia.  &quot;You made it, man,&quot; he says, clasping my hand in the universal hippie handshake and embracing me in a gentle bear hug. He guides me over to a waiting golf cart. I climb on board and, with Duke at the wheel, we trundle over the brow of the hill and into rock history. A few minutes later, we are standing at Hippie Ground Zero, the spot where the Woodstock festival stage once stood. The hill that rises gradually away from us looks smaller than I had imagined, a fraction of the acreage of Glastonbury, say, but it was here, on the now legendary weekend of 15-18 August 1969, that an estimated quarter of a million young people gathered, with the same number spread out though the surrounding woods and all along the car-choked roads nearby. On the second day of the festival, the traffic stretched back to the George Washington Bridge in New York City - two hours&apos; drive and 90 miles away. As Arlo Guthrie announced from the stage, &quot;The New York Thruway is closed, man. Ain&apos;t that far-out.&quot; And, for once, it really was.  Duke had travelled all the way from Texas with his best friend, arriving on the Thursday night to find more than 50,000 people already there. The stage was still being built and the fence around the site was still being erected. People lay on the grass, stoned, watching and waiting, while road crews fuelled on Blue Sunshine LSD worked frantically through the night. When it started to rain, the crowd retreated under the trees nearby; a portent of what was to come. &quot;Me and my buddy drank some beer and smoked some weed,&quot; says Duke, grinning, &quot;then we got separated in the crowd and I ain&apos;t seen him since.&quot; Now approaching retirement age, Duke has been living in and around Bethel since that weekend 40 years ago. When the Centre for the Arts opened last year, he landed every ageing hippie&apos;s dream gig. His title is &quot;Site Interpreter&quot;, which means he&apos;s the official tour guide for the Woodstock festival theme park. &quot;They should excavate the site,&quot; he says as we wander around. &quot;They&apos;d find all kinds of artefacts in the earth. Everything that was buried by the bulldozers: sleeping bags, flags, shoes, T-shirts, bottles, hash pipes. It&apos;s all in the earth, man, relics of another time.&quot;  He points out two huge lumps of concrete lying in a corner of the field, part of the stanchions on which the stage was erected. Nearby, under a fluttering American flag, is a monument that looks like a tombstone for the hippie dream. In the centre of the field, a totem pole stands with the faces of three of the hippie fallen carved on it: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jerry Garcia. Everything else about the landscape, though, is neat and well-tended, fenced in and fenced off. There are paved car parks where tents once stood and you now have to pay to walk on the site of the world&apos;s most famous free festival. Yesterday&apos;s mass utopian moment has become today&apos;s hippie-themed heritage site.  There is something sad and sadly inevitable about the transformation but Duke is still flying the freak flag, still channelling the cosmic energy of that long gone moment. &quot;It&apos;s still a sacred place,&quot; he says as we stand where Sly laid down his supercharged soul-funk, Santana whipped up a Latin-rock storm, and Hendrix reinterpreted The Star-Spangled Banner as an anthem for America&apos;s doomed youth, drafted to fight in Vietnam. &quot;You can still feel the energy,&quot; says Duke. &quot;I recently took David Crosby around the site. We stood right here and he looked up at the hill and said: &apos;Duke, I can feel it, man. The vibe is still here.&apos;&quot;     Hippies jamming at Woodstock. Photograph: Bill Eppridge/Time & Life Pictures    Woodstock has entered the public consciousness as the high watermark of hippie idealism - &quot;Three Days of Peace &amp; Music&quot; - but it was an event that succeeded against almost insurmountable odds. Fraught with organisational and logistical difficulties, dogged by bad weather and chronic shortages of food, water and toilets, it was first declared a financial disaster then a human one.  It took place a year after violent anti-war protests had rocked the Chicago Democratic convention and a week after the Manson Family murders in Los Angeles. &quot;Apart from the Moon landing the previous month, &apos;68 and &apos;69 were horrible years,&quot; says Country Joe McDonald, one of the performers most tied to the Woodstock myth, who plays a 40th anniversary show at the Bethel Woods Centre on 15 August. &quot;The news was all about riots, war and governments falling. You had Vietnam escalating and the Manson killings on prime-time news. It was not a great time and it suddenly seemed a long way from &apos;67 and the so-called Summer of Love.&quot; &quot;People are cynical about Woodstock now,&quot; says photographer Elliott Landy, then, as now, a Woodstock native, whose images of the festival have become part of its enduring mythology, &quot;but the single most important thing to remember is that people who believed in peace and love were allowed to be together to practise their beliefs. The New York State Police were taken by surprise by the sheer numbers and, by then, were too late to control it or stop it. That&apos;s a big reason why it worked as it did. But you cannot just leave a vast sea of humanity to its own goodwill unless the people therein have the values of goodwill - and love, peace and togetherness - in the first place.&quot;  For all that, the vast audience that created the original Woodstock vibe, who descended on the hamlets and scattered farms of Bethel, frightening the livestock and angering the locals, were drawn there primarily by the promise of great music from some of the biggest acts of the time, including Hendrix, the Who, Sly and the Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane and, playing only their second gig, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.  Tim Kelly, a trim, middle-aged man who now runs his own roofing firm, has returned to the site for the first time since he came here as a 15-year-old rock fan in 1969. The first thing he saw then was a bunch of guys pushing part of the security fence down and a huge crowd streaming through. &quot;I arrived at the actual moment it became a free festival,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;That&apos;s one of my big memories, that and Creedence Clearwater Revival&apos;s set. They hit the first note of Born on the Bayou on Saturday and this mass of humanity rose to their feet as one. It was just awesome. Me and my friends were blown away by that. The power of rock&apos;n&apos;roll.&quot;  To middle America, watching the television news, Woodstock was more than just another rock festival, though. It made the news first as a social phenomenon, the scale of which seemed almost unbelievable: nearly half a million kids, smoking dope, bathing naked and listening to loud rock music that seemed designed to soundtrack the youth revolution. To the New York Times, it was &quot;an outrage&quot; and an affront to American values of decency and duty. The parents, concluded a mean-spirited editorial, were to blame.  Then, when food and water ran out and the rains came, Woodstock made the news again as a disaster zone. &quot;HIPPIES MIRED IN SEA OF MUD&quot; ran the headline to another unapologetically gleeful front page story.  &quot;The heavy rain started just as Joe Cocker finished his set,&quot; remembers Becky Sandmann, from Wilmington, Delaware, who has come back to visit the site with her teenage 60s-obsessed son. &quot;Then it became the world&apos;s biggest mud bath. Local kids with tractors were charging $10 to drag cars out of the mud. The thing is, though, a lot of people were prepared for the rain. You don&apos;t hear so much about that. I mean, we were hippies but practical ones. We had water, food, waterproof clothes. We were seasoned campers. We only heard it was a disaster area when we rang our parents afterwards.&quot; For the organisers, though, the festival became a disaster as soon as it became free. Flashback to Saturday 16 August 1969, backstage at Woodstock. Artie Kornfeld, co-organiser of the festival, is being interviewed for TV news. TV reporter: &quot;Mr Kornfeld, is this a financial success?&quot; Kornfeld: &quot;No, man, it&apos;s a financial disaster. [Laughing] .... Financially, this is a total disaster.&quot; TV reporter: &quot;But you look so happy.&quot; In 1969, Art Kornfeld, at 26, was one of the most successful and hippest young guns in the music business, the writer of more than 75 hit songs and the youngest ever vice-president of Capitol Records. He had become good friends with another ambitious young hipster, Michael Lang, who managed rock groups and shared his fondness for grade A marijuana. They were planning to build a recording studio in Woodstock, where Kornfeld had a second home.  &quot;We were talking and smoking one night in my apartment in New York and I had this kind of vision,&quot; says Kornfeld, who, at 66, remains an ebullient character with a neat line in shameless self-mythology. &quot;Suddenly I didn&apos;t see a studio but a huge gathering. I saw the possibility for something new, something that would reflect all this new music that was coming through, these new ideas, this sense of a change - social and political - that was in the air. That&apos;s why I was so blown away when I saw the crowds at Woodstock, man. People thought I was stoned when I was talking to that TV guy but I wasn&apos;t. I was shocked in a kind of shamanistic way because I had seen it already a whole year before.&quot;     Hell's Angels beat Meredith Hunter with pool cues at the Altamont Free Concert. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    This may be so but, from the off, the event was conceived as a profit-making three-day concert that would feature the best groups of the era. In February 1969, Kornfeld and Lang had visited the Manhattan offices of a company called Challenge International, which was run by two Wall Street mavericks called John Roberts and Joel Rosenman. The previous year Roberts and Rosenman had placed an advert in the New York Times that read, &quot;YOUNG MEN WITH UNLIMITED CAPITAL LOOKING FOR INTERESTING, LEGITIMATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND BUSINESS IDEAS.&quot;  They had then spent months sifting through more than 5,000 replies, none of which captured their keen entrepreneurial imaginations. Then two stoned-looking hippies came knocking on their door with a vision of love, peace, music... and big bucks. A few hours later, Kornfeld and Lang left with a guarantee of $165,000 to stage a three-day festival that would cater to around 50,000 punters, each of whom would pay $6 per day. From the off, there was big money riding on Woodstock. At one point, the Beatles and Dylan were mooted as headliners, but, by then, the once Fab Four were disintegrating back in Blighty and Bob, ironically, was holed up in a mansion in the small town of Woodstock in the woods in upstate New York, deep in retreat from fame, hard drugs and his own carefully created mythology. The first big problem for Kornfeld and Lang was finding a suitable site not far from New York. The event was due to take place in Saugerties until residents objected to the event being staged in or near the town. Then, with posters already printed announcing a new venue - a disused industrial park in Wallkill, 35 miles south of Woodstock - another 11th-hour protest by locals led to a second successful injunction. Enter Elliot Tiber, a 34-year-old interior designer from Brooklyn whose holidays were spent helping his family run the struggling El Monaco motel near White Lake, just east of Bethel Woods. When Tiber heard of the Wallkill debacle, he rang Lang and invited him to base his operations at the motel, adding almost as an afterthought that, as president of the Bethel Chamber of Commerce, he already had a permit to run a yearly arts festival, albeit on a small scale. (Until now, Tiber has been the forgotten man of Woodstock, but his book, Taking Woodstock, has just been turned into a film by Ang Lee, director of Brokeback Mountain It was Tiber who put Lang and Kornfeld in touch with the late Max Yasgur, the local farmer from nearby Bethel Woods on whose land the festival took place. In Woodstock: Three Days That Rocked the World, one of a number of new books marking the anniversary, Max&apos;s son, Sam, explains his father&apos;s raison d&apos;\u00eatre. &quot;The summer of &apos;69 was a very wet summer. We couldn&apos;t get hay in the barn. When you have that many cattle and you&apos;re going to have to put up enough hay to get &apos;em through the winter....&quot; In other words, Kornfeld and Lang were the answer to this struggling farmer&apos;s dream. His neighbours, though, were incensed, fearing a hippie invasion that would damage their land. But the extraordinary thing about Woodstock was that there was very little trouble; even when the rains came, the crowd responded by caring for each other. &quot;The hippies were polite, man,&quot; says Duke. &quot;It was all &apos;please&apos; and &apos;thank you&apos; and &apos;sorry to bother you&apos;, and that won over a lot of the locals who let them use their phones and showers and gave then water. But we left a mess, man, an unholy mess. I stayed around with the crew of volunteers who cleaned up afterwards, and it wasn&apos;t all mud. There was a hell of a lot of shit, man. I spent a lot of time explaining to locals that if you have 500,000 people in one place, somebody&apos;s going to shit on your lawn.&quot; As it turns out, it wasn&apos;t just the locals who were worried about trouble. Kornfeld tells me that in the months leading up to the festival, he travelled the country, trying to make contact with every left-wing revolutionary underground group in America - the Black Panthers, the SDS, the Weathermen, the Yippies. &quot;I invited them to come along for free in the spirit of peace and love, not violent revolution. They all showed up, too,&quot; he says, laughing his strange stoner laugh. &quot;I remember a huge gang of Black Panthers arriving on motorcycles, and, right away, they started up with some serious attitude - &apos;No white middle-class mofo is going to tell us where to park our bikes.&apos; I said: &apos;Listen, guys, you can park your bikes where you want. Have a nice day.&apos; That&apos;s all it took. Our entire security was 1,600 peaceful volunteers. No guns. No anything. We had a simple policy: no confrontation. And for three days, man, it worked. It really worked.&quot;  When the crowd grew restless, performers were cajoled to play impromptu sets. During one lengthy gap, Country Joe strolled on stage with an acoustic guitar and sang his I-Feel-Like-I&apos;m-Fixin&apos;-to-Die Rag, leading 500,000 people in his Fuck Cheer - &quot;Gimme an F, gimme a U...&quot;. Did he sense trouble simmering? &quot;Oh yeah. There were a few troublemakers, all right. There was this militant group from Manhattan, The Motherfuckers. They torched a hamburger van. I guess they didn&apos;t like hippie capitalists. Their whole trip was, &apos;It&apos;s a free festival, motherfucker, and that applies to your hamburgers too.&apos;&quot; It may have been one of this gang then, who, high on bad acid, pulled a gun on Artie Kornfeld in the backstage area. &quot;I was chatting to David Crosby and Stephen Stills when this crazy revolutionary dude suddenly appears and sticks a gun to my forehead,&quot; says Kornfeld, still sounding freaked out. &quot;He&apos;s shouting, &apos;I&apos;m going to blow you away, you fuckin&apos; hippie capitalist pig!&apos; It looked bad, then Stills&apos;s roadie, who was a big guy, jumped him from the back and took him down. But it was scary, man. I thought, &apos;I&apos;m going to die right there in the middle of all this peace and love.&apos;&quot; In the end, only two people died at Woodstock: one kid got run over accidentally by a tractor, another overdosed on heroin. &quot;The audience was mainly middle-class kids with long hair from New York,&quot; says Country Joe. &quot;Most people were there to dig the music and to party. The audience wasn&apos;t dissatisfied, man, the audience was happy. Abbie didn&apos;t get that.&quot; Abbie Hoffman was the arch political prankster of America&apos;s late 60s radical left, a ubiquitous and, to some, intensely annoying presence at every hippie gathering. A veteran of the Chicago Convention riots and a defendant in the ensuing &quot;Chicago Eight&quot; conspiracy trial, Hoffman gatecrashed the festival with his fellow Yippie activists intent on &quot;liberating&quot; Woodstock from the hippie capitalists. He even inveigled $65,000 out of the organisers on the very eve of the event with his threats to turn it into a rerun of Chicago. With the money, he hired a printing press to disseminate the Yippie message of mischievous revolution to the bedraggled masses and set up a crash tent for the inevitable hordes of drug casualties. Alongside another collective, the Hog Farm, who gave out free food, the Yippies, ironically, helped keep Woodstock peaceful. &quot;There&apos;s no morality here,&quot; Hoffman told a journalist. &quot;The helicopters bring champagne for Janis Joplin&apos;s band, and people are sick in the field. I&apos;m the conscience of the movement.&quot; He had a point.  Surprisingly, even Kornfeld agrees. &quot;I loved Abbie, man. He was the Thomas Jefferson of the underground. A dissenting voice. The only thing is, he never shut up. He had some kind of power, though, the power of the court jester to say what people needed to hear but didn&apos;t want to hear.&quot;  Ever the scene-stealer, Hoffman walked on stage during the Who&apos;s set and tried to make a speech drawing the audience&apos;s attention to the plight of his friend, John Sinclair, the jailed leader of the White Panther party and one-time manager of Detroit band the MC5. &quot;I think this is a pile of shit while John Sinclair rots in prison,&quot; he shouted just before Pete Townshend&apos;s guitar caught him on the back of the head and sent him reeling into the crowd. &quot;Fuck off my stage,&quot; screamed Townshend, adding: &quot;The next person that walks across the stage is going to get killed. You can laugh but I mean it.&quot; Little was heard of Hoffman at Woodstock after that.  In his entertaining and characteristically self-serving speed-written book, Woodstock Nation, Hoffman wrote in uncharacteristically humble fashion: &quot;Two days ago (the day after the whole Woodstock thing was over) I realised I had badly misjudged the event... It might have been the green tab, the red one, the blue... the four joints, no food, hash, no sleep for five days ... whatever, I had a bummer. One of those rare trips when everything caves in... It culminated with a battle on stage with the Who. The battle symbolises my amity-emnity attitude towards that rock group in particular and the whole rock world in general.&quot;  That&apos;s Abbie&apos;s version anyway but, like his brief but dramatic onstage intervention, it does highlight the chasm that already existed between the radical hippie underground of the late 60s and the emerging rock superstar elite, and by extension, the mass audience that worshipped them. Of all the performers at Woodstock, Townshend, tortured proto-punk that he was, seems to have been the one least drawn to its ethos, seeing only chaos and disorder where others saw peace and harmony. &quot;All those hippies wandering about thinking the world was going to be different from that day on,&quot; he said later. &quot;As a cynical English arsehole, I walked though it all and felt like spitting on the lot of them...&quot; Country Joe, though, sees it differently. &quot;I saw Townshend pull up in his limo, then do his set, and leave. That&apos;s the sum total of his experience of Woodstock. He played at it but he wasn&apos;t really part of it.&quot;  Therein lies the ultimate irony of the Woodstock nation - the distance between the utopian ideals and the rock groups who inspired, often voiced, and supposedly symbolised them; the distance, in fact, between the suddenly exalted rock performers and the increasingly passive audiences who idolised them. And after the violence of Chicago, as Peter Doggett wrote in his book, There&apos;s a Riot Going On: Revolutionaries, Rock Stars and the Rise and Fall of &apos;60s&apos; Counter-Culture, &quot;it was impossible to envisage a mass assembly of the counterculture without cynicism and even fear&quot;. As the revolutionary ideals of the underground dissipated, though, the rock gig became less of a truly communal event, and more of an old-style form of entertainment.  Peter Coyote, an actor, writer and veteran activist - though he hates the word - helped set up the Diggers, the most celebrated of all San Francisco&apos;s many radical collectives. &quot;We put on shows at Golden Gate Park with the Dead and Jefferson Airplane, and the groups were part of the community they emerged out of, not some superstars. We had multiple stages, diversions, communal entertainment. There is something slightly fascistic about sitting in a huge auditorium focusing all the energy on one group far away on stage. It reduces the audience to pure passive consumers. There&apos;s nothing radical about that.&quot; That distance and passivity would be illustrated in the most darkly dramatic terms just over three months later when another huge rock festival took place, this one in northern California, an event that has since come to be seen as the death of the peace and love era that Woodstock so symbolised. No other group, not even the Who, illustrated the distance between performer and audience like the Rolling Stones. By 1969, the Stones&apos; outlaw attitude had shaded into a kind of cavalier, almost aristocratic arrogance and, more often than not, their audience was on the receiving end of it.  The Stones toured America on the back of Let it Bleed, a darkly powerful album with tracks such as Midnight Rambler - about a deranged serial killer - and Gimme Shelter, which told of &quot;a storm a-threatenin&apos;&quot; wherein rape and murder would be &quot;just a shot away&quot;. In July, founder member Brian Jones had become the first rock&apos;n&apos;roll casualty of the era, drowning in his swimming pool after taking a lethal cocktail of drink and drugs. As the tour rumbled though America - with Jagger singing Sympathy For the Devil in a magician&apos;s cloak and pentagram-embroidered vest - the news broke of the arrest of Charles Manson and his so-called Family, a collective-cum-cult who had descended from the hills of the Californian desert to torture and murder their victims. Here was America&apos;s hippie nightmare made murderously real.  From within the radical counterculture came rumblings of discontent, mainly centred on the high cost of tickets - seven or eight dollars instead of the usual four or five. &quot;Can the Rolling Stones actually need all that money?&quot; asked the influential music journalist Ralph Gleason, adding: &quot;Paying six or seven dollars for an hour of the Stones a quarter of a mile away because the artists demand such outrageous fees says a very bad thing to me abut the artists&apos; attitude to the public. It says they despise their audience.&quot;  Though the Stones had intended playing a show that lasted only half an hour, but were convinced otherwise by incensed promoters, Gleason&apos;s very public criticism stung Mick Jagger. At a press conference in New York in late November, he announced that the group would play a free show in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco on 6 December. Unfortunately, no permission had been granted for the concert and it was almost immediately denied. The Stones then contacted Woodstock promoter Michael Lang, who, together with the Grateful Dead&apos;s manager, Rock Scully, began flying around California in a helicopter trying to find another suitable outdoor venue. Their frantic search ended just days before the concert date and, on 5 December, Californian radio stations announced that the show would take place the next day at the Altamont Speedway, way out in the harsh and isolated desert scrublands of northern California. Altamont was the inverse of Woodstock, although the two had much in common: a last-minute relocation to a different site, camera crews recording the event for feature films (Woodstock and Gimme Shelter), three groups - CSNY, Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead - and the presence of potential troublemakers intent on puncturing the illusion of universal peace and love. At Altamont, though, the troublemakers did not even have to contend with the onsite security; they were the onsite security.  It is still unclear how the Hells Angels were invited to provide security for the Rolling Stones free concert. The music writer Stanley Booth later recalled in his chillingly evocative book, The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones, that Rock Scully met the Stones at their concert in Oakland, California in November 1969 and insisted &quot;The Angels are righteous dudes. They carry themselves with honour and dignity.&quot;  The infamous biker gang was a fixture at rock gigs on the West Coast and often assumed the role of guardian angels, having forged an uneasy alliance with groups including the Dead and Steppenwolf as well as Ken Kesey&apos;s travelling troupe of fabled peaceniks, the Merry Pranksters. The Hells Angels were not peaceniks, though, nor pranksters. In his history of the Grateful Dead, A Long Strange Trip, Dennis McNally describes a meeting between Sam Cutler, the Stones&apos; tour manager, and two Bay Area Hells Angels, Sweet William and Frisco Pete, in which the fateful contract was drawn up between the world&apos;s &quot;baddest&quot; band and the world&apos;s baddest biker gang.  &quot;We don&apos;t police things,&quot; Sweet William said. &quot;We&apos;re not a security force. We go to concerts to enjoy ourselves and have fun.&quot; &quot;Well, what about helping people out - giving directions and things?&quot; asked Cutler. &quot;Sure, we can do that.&quot; When Sam asked how they might be paid, Sweet William replied, &quot;We like beer.&quot; The deal, McNally wrote, was done for 100 cases. From the start, the Altamont festival was a disaster in waiting. The stage was too low, the crowd too close, the Angels too wired on beer and bad acid. Such was the rush to stage the festival that there were no food or drink outlets, and few toilets.  &quot;It was a strange and ominous place,&quot; says Eamonn McCabe, the Guardian photographer who attended Altamont as a 20-year-old, having pitched up in San Francisco to study film. &quot;I arrived quite early in the day and it was so packed and so claustrophobic. I was intent on filming the Stones on my little Super 8 but it took me hours to push my way though to the front of the stage. I got there for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and it all seemed quite peaceful. Then, during the Airplane&apos;s set, I saw this kid being attacked by Hells Angels. He was a big guy, obviously off his head, and he started stripping off. The nudity seemed to anger them and they waded in. I tried to run like everybody else, but there was no room to run.&quot; Jefferson Airplane&apos;s Marty Balin was beaten unconscious when he jumped into the crowd to try and stop the Angels pummelling another hippie kid with pool cues. He was the only musician who physically intervened. When the Stones arrived by helicopter in mid-afternoon, Jagger was punched in the face by a spooked-out kid screaming, &quot;I hate you! I hate you!&quot; The backstage area looked like a field hospital as casualties were carried in, unconscious, and announcements were made over the PA for medical assistance.  &quot;Fights were breaking out everywhere, one hair-raising thing after another,&quot; wrote Rolling Stone writer David Dalton years later in his scathing essay Altamont: An Eyewitness Account. &quot;Jerry Garcia&apos;s old school bus became the Dead&apos;s dressing room. Jerry was shaking and huddling with Mountain Girl on the floor of the bus through the worst of the fighting - the Hells Angels and guns and pool cues and all of that. They&apos;d arrived fully medicated - gummy opium, mescaline and half a key of rolled joints, but all the dope in the world wasn&apos;t going to help a bummer like this.&quot; Events reached their deadly climax when a young black man, Meredith Hunter, taunted by the Angels until he produced a small pistol and waved it in the air, was set upon, knifed several times in the neck and shoulders and then beaten to death while the Stones played on unawares.  &quot;What I remember is that as the darkness fell, the danger seemed to increase,&quot; says McCabe. &quot;The drama was always going to be the Stones. Mick going through his Satanic stage. But when the violence stated erupting all around him, he suddenly seemed so small and vulnerable.&quot; By then, the Grateful Dead had already fled the site in a helicopter, refusing to play, such was the fear that gripped them in their hallucinogenic haze. The Stones soon surrendered the stage and did likewise, their entourage piling into the choppers that awaited them. They landed minutes afterwards, shell-shocked, in a LA airport terminal. &quot;Mick sat on a wooden bench...,&quot; wrote Stanley Booth. &quot;He was bewildered and scared, unable to comprehend what had happened - who the Hells Angels were or why they were killing people at his free peace and love show... &apos;I&apos;d rather have the cops,&apos; Mick said.&quot;  Like Woodstock, the Altamont free festival was also filmed for posterity and when directors the Maysles brothers played back their footage they found that the killing of Meredith Hunter had also been captured on camera. The resulting movie, Gimme Shelter, remains the most chilling document of a tumultuous time, as disturbing and shocking still as the Woodstock film is celebratory. After Altamont, as Stanley Booth later put it, &quot;the Stones did comedy&quot;. Well, not quite, but they did sail close to rock cabaret at times.  Forty years on, it seems extraordinary that Woodstock and Altamont - one the dream, the other the nightmare - were less than four months apart. &quot;People like bookends,&quot; says Country Joe McDonald. &quot;Woodstock and Altamont seem like bookends to the great social experiment of the late 60s. But, really, they weren&apos;t. Altamont went wrong for practical reasons - a bad site, bad organisation, greed, arrogance, stupidity. Woodstock worked because people didn&apos;t feel used. If you want to attach big social significance to Woodstock, I really don&apos;t see anything negative about it. It was progressive, gender-wise, race-wise. It was a triumph of technology. A template for every successful festival since.&quot; He takes a deep breath. &quot;And what&apos;s so bad about peace and love and looking out for each other? But it frightened people then, and still does now. The conservative right still blame it for every damn thing. Well, take a look around you. The alternative isn&apos;t looking so great right now, is it? For me, Woodstock was never the beginning; it was a beginning. Real change takes time.&quot;  He stops and laughs, as if to himself. &quot;Then again, it&apos;s 40 years on and I can&apos;t believe that I&apos;m still getting mileage out of it.

They sacrificed their youth to fight evil, hundreds of thousands laying down their lives in acts of bravery that must never be forgotten. It was British troops who liberated the concentration camp, Bergen-Belsen. We rightly remember them and pay tribute to their courage. But in the midst of occupied Europe, there were also a handful of British civilians who displayed courage in a different way, facing phenomenal dangers to aid and rescue Jews. These people may not have worn military uniform, but they were heroes nonetheless. They were ordinary individuals aware of the desperate situation facing European Jewry, whose consciences would not allow them to sit by and see innocent people murdered. June Ravenhall was an ordinary woman from Warwickshire, who lived in Amsterdam during the war, raising her son Ron while her husband was interned by the Nazis. Life was not easy for Ravenhall as it was, but something made her take an almost unimaginable risk. She took a young Jewish boy named Louis Velleman into her home and sheltered him from the Gestapo agents who sought him. Not only was she risking the retribution of the Nazi occupying forces, she was risking the health of her family \u2013 because Louis was suffering from tuberculosis. Her son Ron, now a local councillor in Rugby, later recalled that Louis had been stumped when asked how he felt about Ravenhall&apos;s actions. &quot;The English are not brave \u2013 they are mad,&quot; was the only explanation he could summon. Mad or not, the humanitarian instincts that drove British citizens like Ravenhall to heroism during the dark days of the Holocaust ought to be both remembered and celebrated. It seems extraordinary, but while this small band of heroes like Ravenhall have been recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, Israel&apos;s Holocaust memorial authority, few have ever received formal recognition in Britain. During a moving debate about these people in the House of Commons recently, MPs of all parties came forward to highlight stories of courage, recognising in unison that these were Britain&apos;s unsung heroes of the Holocaust. Rugby&apos;s Conservative MP Jeremy Wright spoke with pride about Ravenhall, who hailed from his constituency. Russell Brown, MP for Dumfries and Galloway, who initiated the debate, told the story of Jane Haining, the Scottish missionary in Hungary who chose to remain with the Jewish children in her care \u2013 and so was deported with them to the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Another hero was Frank Foley. Foley was an MI6 agent posing as a passport officer at the British embassy in Berlin. By issuing fake exit papers it is estimated that he saved the lives of 10,000 Jews. Individuals like Ravenhall, Haining and Foley are among a small group of exceptional people, heroes who have never been recognised by the British government. Some local communities have honoured their brave sons and daughters, but at a national level there has never been acknowledgement of their deeds, until now. A fortnight ago, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, announced that these individuals would finally be given some form of award, and with the support of the opposition parties the cabinet office minister, Liam Byrne, will drive this forward. Finally, we can pay tribute to these individuals and their selfless actions. Finally, we can record the fact that they were British people upholding our nation&apos;s values. Above all, we can now ensure that these heroes&apos; acts remain in the national memory as an example to young people today and to future generations. They provide a powerful template of courage \u2013 they are the ultimate role models. They demonstrate that we do not have to achieve a position of high influence to make a difference \u2013 that we can all play a role making society better. Their stand against injustice and the positive action they took to try and overcome it ought to be a source of enduring pride and inspiration to all of us in Britain. As the European and local elections approach, we are again subjected to poisonous propaganda from the far right, who seek to extend an exclusive claim over &quot;Britishness&quot; and who purport to represent our country&apos;s heritage. But the hatred and division they peddle is the very antithesis of what Britain stands for. In remembering our British heroes of the Holocaust, we must ensure that we also carry their mantle. We cannot afford to be complacent about the forthcoming elections \u2013 and each of us has a duty to vote and encourage others to do so. Indifference and cynicism are oxygen to the far right, only through activism can we starve them of it. Individuals like Ravenhall embody true British values; humanity, courage, tolerance and selflessness. We are right to honour them \u2013 and to let them guide our actions today.", "sentences": ["June Ravenhall was an ordinary woman from Warwickshire, who lived in Amsterdam during the war, raising her son Ron while her husband was interned by the Nazis."], "title": "Heroes of war teach us courage | Karen Pollock", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/17/british-war-heroes-jews", "tags": ["Second world war", "Judaism", "Holocaust", "Politics", "UK news", "European elections", "European Union", "Elections 2009", "Religion"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-19T23:01:00Z", "article": "The Dutch photographer Hugh van Es, who has died aged 67, became famous for his iconic picture of Americans leaving Saigon, on one of the last helicopters out, on 29 April 1975, the day before the city was captured by the North Vietnamese army at the end of the Vietnam war. At the time he was working as a staff photographer for United Press International (UPI).  The photograph has usually been assumed to be of the US embassy, but in a newspaper article a few years ago, Van Es wrote: &quot;If you looked north from the office balcony, towards the cathedral, about four blocks from us, on the corner of Tu Do and Gia Long, you could see a building called the Pittman Apartments, where we knew the CIA station chief and many of his officers lived. Several weeks earlier, the roof of the elevator shaft had been reinforced with steel plate so that it would be able to take the weight of a helicopter. A makeshift wooden ladder now ran from the lower roof to the top of the shaft. Around 2.30 in the afternoon, while I was working in the darkroom, I suddenly heard Bert Okuley [a UPI staffer who escaped that evening] shout &apos;Van Es, get out here, there&apos;s a chopper on that roof!&apos;&quot; Van Es grabbed his camera and dashed to the balcony. &quot;Looking at the Pittman Apartments,&quot; he said, &quot;I could see 20 or 30 people on the roof, climbing the ladder to an American Huey helicopter. At the top of the ladder stood an American in civilian clothes, pulling people up and shoving them inside. Of course there was no possibility that all the people on the roof could get into the helicopter, and it took off with 12 or 14 on board ... Those left on the roof waited for hours, hoping for more helicopters to arrive. To no avail.&quot; After shooting about 10 frames, Van Es went back to the darkroom and prepared a print for his regular 5pm transmission to Tokyo. It took about 12 minutes to send a single print with a caption but, as he laconically put it: &quot;Editors didn&apos;t read captions carefully in those days.&quot; The picture was erroneously described as showing the embassy roof and, after years of trying to put the record straight, the photographer gave up. &quot;Thus,&quot; he said later, &quot;one of the best known images of the Vietnam war shows something other than what almost everyone thinks it does.&quot; Van Es was a convivial snapper of the old school but, beneath the expletive-laden, gruff exterior, a bit of a softie. His friends knew him as &quot;Vanes&quot;, and he was not only a fully paid-up war veteran but also a gregarious and dominant presence at the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club in Hong Kong, his base in later years. Friends fondly, but ironically, described him as &quot;the Dutch ambassador for couth and culture&quot;. &quot;But it was he,&quot; said Annie, his devoted wife of almost four decades, &quot;who always remembered the birthdays.&quot; And it was he who, in the early 1980s, on a photo-shoot in the New Territories, heard whimpering from a dustbin, and came back with a tiny puppy abandoned by its Chinese owners. The dog became the cherished family pet. Typical Vanes: tough shell, soft centre.  He was born Hubert van Es in Hilversum in the Netherlands and learned his profane and always apparently rudimentary English while hanging out with allied troops at the end of the second world war. He had decided he wanted to become a photographer at the age of 13, after going to a photo exhibition at the local museum which featured the work of the war photographer Robert Capa, who became his lifelong hero.  Van Es began work as a photographer with the Nederlands Fotopersbureau in Amsterdam in 1959. After arriving in Hong Kong as a freelance in 1967, he joined the South China Morning Post as chief photographer, and the following year had a chance to go to Vietnam as a soundman with NBC News. After a brief stint there, he joined the Associated Press staff and was with them in Saigon until 1972, when he transferred to UPI, with whom he spent three years.  The only money he ever made from the famous photograph was a one-off bonus of $150. Proud though he was of the picture, he was even more pleased with the shots he had taken during the battle for Hamburger Hill. Van Es stayed on in Saigon and took pictures of the North Vietnamese, made safer by the Vietnamese words Boa Chi Hoa Lan, meaning Dutch press, which he stuck in his camouflage hat along with a miniature plastic Dutch flag. After Vietnam, he made Hong Kong his base and also covered the Moro rebellion in the Phillipines and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

When the first sample came back positive for cocaine, Daum demanded that the second sample be tested.

HP England&apos;s dental work \u2013 England, 1996 When England&apos;s Euro 96 squad travelled back from a break in Hong Kong just before that summer&apos;s tournament, they did \u00a35,000 worth of damage to a TV screen on the plane. But so debauched was the trip that the screen wasn&apos;t the half of it.

The players responded to the inevitable barrage of criticism during the tournament, Teddy Sheringham using a water bottle to help Gazza to reference the incident after scoring a spectacular volley against Scotland.

That&apos;s a big chunk of change for a 17-year-old to stump up for the privilege of watching an emotional Wayne Rooney attempt to pull. But up they stumped because in the corridors of Old Trafford there is no arguing with Captain Rio, or Scholesy, or the Neviller.

WB Ferguson and McGregor boozing for Scotland \u2013 Loch Lomond, 2009 In these times of solemnity and sports science, it is a relief to find that there are those who still honour the old customs. The Scotland captain Barry Ferguson and his Rangers team-mate Allan McGregor were both banned from the World Cup qualifier with Iceland in April this year. They had played four days earlier in a 3-0 loss to Holland in Amsterdam after which the squad got back to its Loch Lomond base at about 4am. Several players went straight to the hotel&apos;s Great Scot bar - but Ferguson and McGregor were both still there as people began to arrive for Sunday lunch. KM Five go mad in Copenhagen \u2013 Scotland, 1975 Few drunken football-related furores hold a candle to the pathetic stramash the infamous Copenhagen Five put on in 1975. Scotland had just beaten Denmark 1-0 when goalscorer Joe Harper, captain Billy Bremner and three other players - Pat McCluskey, Willie Young and Arthur Graham - went out on a drinking spree. Police were called to a nightclub, where McCluskey threatened an officer with his shoe, but the cops took a softly-softly approach and merely gave them a ticking off. Bad move: back in the Scotland hotel bar, Bremner drenched a barmaid with a glass of Bacardi after he was told to stop swearing and shouting. The five were banned for life by the SFA. Though Harper would play for Scotland again, that too seems to have been some sort of karmic punishment: he played in Scotland&apos;s humiliating 1-1 draw with Iran at the 1978 World Cup finals. SM Five Bellies burn-up \u2013 Pub, Hexham, 1998 It takes a strong constitution to be Paul Gascoigne&apos;s pal. The footballer reportedly bet Jimmy &quot;Five Bellies&quot; Gardner \u00a31,000 that he couldn&apos;t stand the heat of a cigarette lighter against his nose for five seconds. Gardner remembers the event differently, claiming that it was just his friend&apos;s way of waking him up after he had fallen asleep in a Hexham pub. Gascoigne did more expensive harm on other occasions, as when crashing the Middlesbrough team bus into a wall. In many of the &quot;pranks&quot; there was a sense that the man himself was out of control and his suffering in recent years has been no surprise. KM Foulke chases referee into broom cupboard \u2013 Sheffield United, 1902 Willie Foulke, Chelsea&apos;s first and England&apos;s fattest goalkeeper, weighed in at 22st 3lb (142 kg) so there was plenty of him that had to be passed in order for the opposition to score a goal. Hilariously nicknamed Little Willie, he won an FA Cup winner&apos;s medal with Sheffield United in 1902 after a replay. In the first match Foulke was so disgusted by the referee, Tom Kirkham, awarding Southampton an equaliser that he pursued him, naked, through the corridors at Crystal Palace. Kirkham took refuge in a convenient broom cupboard. Point made, Foulke retired to his dressing-room for his post-match snack (often a hog roast). Known affectionately to the fans as Fatty or Colossus it was he not George Foreman who first delivered the line: &quot;I don&apos;t mind what they call me as long as they don&apos;t call me late for lunch.&quot; CB Fry admiringly referred to him as &quot;no small part of a mountain. You cannot bundle him&quot;. Sadly after leaving Chelsea for Bradford City he piled on the pounds, reaching 25st (159 kg). He died of a chill in 1916 having spent the last few years on Blackpool Sands trying to make money from a &quot;beat Little Willie&quot; penalty-kick challenge. WB Patsy Gallacher&apos;s dress code \u2013 Celtic, 1925 Celtic winger Patsy Gallacher&apos;s greatest moment on the pitch came in the 1925 Scottish Cup final against Dundee, when he scored the winning goal by jamming the ball between his feet in a crowded penalty area and somersaulting into the net. His greatest off-pitch moment was no less cheeky: while on a training weekend in a luxury hotel in Dunbar, Gallacher decided to break curfew and go out for a drink. He managed this by befriending a hotel chambermaid - and borrowing her dress one night so he could slip out for a dram. Such were Patsy&apos;s feminine wiles, he even allowed Celtic manager Willie Maley to hold the door open for him as he made good his escape for the night. SM Gazza&apos;s TV burp \u2013 Lazio, 1993 When Paul Gascoigne was dropped by Lazio for a match against Juventus in January 1993, he was asked to comment by RAI, the Italian state broadcaster. He responded with a rasping belch. Polite society in Italy was mortally offended - and the country&apos;s minister for tourism was asked to conduct a parliamentary enquiry into the episode, an MP asking for her to give a &quot;valuation of this episode of civil courtesy from Albion&quot;. Gazza was fined \u00a39,000 for the burp. &quot;It was not a pretty gesture,&quot; admitted his manager Dino Zoff. &quot;Everyone in England would have laughed,&quot; countered Gazza&apos;s advisor Mel Stein. SM Gennady assassination \u2013 Dinamo Minsk, 1991 The key thing if you&apos;re a player out on a bender is not to get caught. In that respect the moment things started to go wrong for the Dinamo Minsk goalkeeper Gennady Tumilovich can be pinpointed to his decision in 1991, after a few vodkas, to steal the team bus. Police gave chase, caught him and were busy beating him up when one recognised him. Three years later he turned up at training wearing a plaster on his leg to explain a hangover-related absence the day earlier, before another ill-advised drinking session left him in a car hanging precariously over the edge of a cliff. JW Ginola not fat \u2013 Aston Villa, 2000 With his film-star looks and mercurial talent, David Ginola had been a favourite with supporters at Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United. It soon became clear that winning over his Aston Villa manager, John Gregory, might be a little tougher. Frustrated with his chairman&apos;s decision to sign the Frenchman, in December 2000 Gregory began to put it about that Ginola had a few weight problems, specifically that the winger was &quot;carrying a bit of timber&quot;. A furious Ginola responded by tearing off his shirt when he scored against Manchester City a few days later to reveal the kind of torso that causes women to go weak at the knees. In a less predictable move, he also consulted Cherie Blair, the prime minister&apos;s wife and an expert in employment law, about the possibility of taking legal action against Gregory. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe what John Gregory said about me, it was terrible,&quot; Ginola later said. &quot;Every day I trained as hard as possible and he was saying I was like Mr Blobby.&quot; SJ Goram naked and lost \u2013 Rangers, 1994 As the title of his autobiography suggested, Andy Goram&apos;s career was a catalogue of &quot;birds, battles and booze&quot;, but perhaps the most notorious incident came in 1994. He had been allowed to go on a family holiday to regain his fitness, but missed his flight back after a bender, and instead of appearing for Rangers in the Scottish Cup final against Dundee United, ended up stranded in a Mediterranean resort with neither passport nor clothes. Rangers lost 1-0 and Goram was transfer listed.

The first key test of official secrecy occurred in 1994, just after the European Council and European commission introduced a new disclosure code. John Carvel, then the Guardian&apos;s European affairs editor, applied for documents detailing discussions at the first meeting of the council of justice and home affairs ministers. After he was refused access to a number of key documents, Carvel successfully challenged the council&apos;s decision in the European court of justice. The court&apos;s ruling set a precedent \u2013 EU documents could not automatically be withheld and in every case EU institutions must weigh the public interest in disclosure against the need for confidentiality. In the EU, this issue is called access to documents not freedom of information (FOI). Unlike FOI \u2013 where general requests are made about a subject and the government finds the documents for you \u2013 under the EU system, access to documents is based on public registers of all EU documents. Unlike in most national FOI systems, which do not maintain public registers, applicants ask for specific documents. The 1997 Amsterdam Treaty was meant to enshrine the public&apos;s right of access to documents but it then took four years to get a EU regulation in place, ensuring this right in the council of the European Union (the 27 governments), the European commission and the European parliament. Since 2001, FOI campaigners have been fighting to reduce the numerous grounds on which access to documents can be refused. These include public security, defence matters, international relations, documents under discussion (policy-making), those from third states (like the USA) and disclosure in the public interest (which has never happened). The fundamental principle of access to documents is that voters can find out what measures are being discussed before they are adopted. In the EU this presents a real problem. EU institutions are meant to provide a public register listing all their documents but actually the European commission references less than one in 10 of its documents and has even raised the surprising argument of &quot;when is a document not a document&quot;. In contrast, the European council lists most of its documents but often refuses access to draft EU policies. As if the various systems weren&apos;t dysfunctional enough, in April 2008, the commission proposed a number of amendments to the regulations. Over a year later, all three EU institutions are completely at odds over what should be done. The European parliament has agreed a report with a number of improved rights of access but the council claims 27 amendments are &quot;inadmissible&quot; as they go beyond the scope of the Amsterdam Treaty. It has also censored[pdf] the legal service opinion upon which this claim is based, threatening legal action against anyone who publishes the full document. This means that its proposed changes are only available in a secret document[pdf]. The European parliament&apos;s own legal opinion[pdf] contends that all its amendments bar one are admissible but it has not formally adopted a position. The European commission says that it will not consider changing its proposals until both the council and the European parliament have formally adopted their positions. As the council and the parliament both have to agree any changes it looks as though we are heading for an impasse. Access to documents is the lifeblood of a healthy democratic system. It allows the public to find out about proposals, to debate and discuss them, and to make their views known. We are still waiting for the enshrined right of access promised in the Amsterdam treaty and the present discussions mean this right is still a long way away. The failure of transparency over MPs&apos; expenses in the UK and MEPs in Brussels, refusing access to details of the allowances they claim, only serves to emphasise why we must claim a right to know what is being done in our name.", "sentences": ["The 1997 Amsterdam Treaty was meant to enshrine the public&apos;s right of access to documents but it then took four years to get a EU regulation in place, ensuring this right in the council of the European Union (the 27 governments), the European commission and the European parliament.", "The European parliament has agreed a report with a number of improved rights of access but the council claims 27 amendments are &quot;inadmissible&quot; as they go beyond the scope of the Amsterdam Treaty.", "We are still waiting for the enshrined right of access promised in the Amsterdam treaty and the present discussions mean this right is still a long way away."], "title": "Open government in the EU | Tony Bunyan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/may/20/freedomofinformation-eu", "tags": ["Freedom of information", "European Union", "MPs' expenses", "Government data"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-05-20T23:01:00Z", "article": "Oxford&apos;s unusual exorcise \u2013 Kassam Stadium, 2001 When Oxford United moved to their new stadium they suffered a run of indifferent home form.

HP Osgood&apos;s fashion disaster \u2013 Mitcham, London, 1970s Footballers traditionally have a poor record when opening boutiques. None were poorer than Peter Osgood, whose attempt to give the fashion industry in Mitcham a shot in the arm &quot;closed after 18 months due to lack of interest, especially mine&quot;. From the start the project had lacked impetus, as Osgood admits: &quot;I did a friend a favour.

One day after the exhibition opened, the display cabinet housing it was found open and empty - the cup had been stolen. The police efforts to recover the trophy were hilariously inept - a Detective Inspector Charles Buggy of the Flying Squad apprehended a petty thief called Jackson, but found he had nothing to do with it - but happily a week later a dog called Pickles sniffed it out from under a bush in South Norwood. Pickles went on to star in a sub-Ealing comedy, before choking himself to death with his own lead in 1971 while chasing a cat. SM Sonny Pike goes to Amsterdam \u2013 Ajax, 1990 Hundreds of sportsmen are prematurely anointed as the next so-and-so. This is just about understandable, if still irresponsible, when players are in their teens, but the heartbreaking case of Sonny Pike was a little different. He was just seven when he signed for Ajax, and prompted comparisons with the likes of George Best and Diego Maradona. It was all too much for Pike, who eventually suffered a nervous breakdown at the age of 16. &quot;I couldn&apos;t take it, and I got ill, really screwed up,&quot; he said. &quot;Looking back, it&apos;s amazing how low I was. Ajax completely forgot about me; they didn&apos;t want to know.&quot; He decided to quit professional football and was last heard of studying psychology at Dundee University. RS Pistone gets a sheep&apos;s heart \u2013 Newcastle, 1998 Secret Santa theoretically provides an opportunity to get a colleague an ingenious Christmas gift (or spend as little as possible safe in the knowledge that they won&apos;t know you are the skinflint). But in 1998, Newcastle&apos;s footballers took it as an opportunity to tell other members of the squad what they really thought of them. Especially those pesky foreigners. The Italian full-back Alessandro Pistone was given a sheep&apos;s heart, as a sign of his perceived commitment, or lack thereof. Duncan Ferguson, who had done time in 1995, was given a prison shirt. And Dietmar Hamann - he&apos;s German, you see - unwrapped a copy of Mein Kampf. Suddenly a deodorant set from Superdrug didn&apos;t seem so bad. RS Prince stops play \u2013 Kuwait, 1982 There are millions of playground examples of teams refusing to accept the validity of an opponent&apos;s goal and walking off in a huff, but the World Cup is supposed to be a slightly more mature affair. It wasn&apos;t during the France v Kuwait match of 1982. France had apparently gone 4-1 ahead late in the game through Alain Giresse, but the Kuwait players complained that they had stopped playing because they heard a whistle. This led to a complete farce in which Prince Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the president of the Kuwait FA, came on to the field and demanded the goal be disallowed. When that failed he told the players to walk off the field; suddenly the Russian referee Miroslav Stupar relented and disallowed the goal. The striking thing about this is how utterly pointless it was: with only 10 minutes left and France palpably superior, Kuwait had absolutely no chance of a comeback, and France scored another a few minutes later. Stupar never refereed another World Cup game, while the Prince was fined some loose change: $15,000. RS Re Cecconi&apos;s tragic end \u2013 Rome, 1978 Luciano Re Cecconi - nicknamed the Blond Angel - was an integral part of Lazio&apos;s first-ever Serie A title-winning side in 1974. The dashing box-to-box midfielder would tragically meet his maker four years later, in the most farcical of circumstances. Walking into a Rome jewellery shop with two friends, he decided to play a practical joke. &quot;Stop!&quot; he screamed. &quot;This is a robbery!&quot; The jeweller, who had his back to the shop, spun round and shot him. &quot;It&apos;s a joke, it&apos;s a joke,&quot; gasped Re Cecconi. Within 30 minutes he was dead. SM Red Star play for penalties \u2013 Bari, 1991 It&apos;s such a shame that the 1991 European Cup final has gone down in history as arguably the dullest ever - because eventual champions Red Star Belgrade were one of the greatest teams ever to win the trophy. Boasting the likes of Robert Prosinecki, Dejan Savicevic and Sinisa Mihaijlovic, Red Star knocked out a decent Rangers side in the second round. When Walter Smith was sent by Graeme Souness to scout them before the match, he came back with the two-word report: &quot;We&apos;re fucked.&quot; Red Star then bested Bayern Munich 4-3 in a semi-final tie which, given the amount of chances created by both sides, resembled a basketball game. The final, against an exciting Marseille side containing Chris Waddle and Jean-Pierre Papin, was almost certainly going to be a let-down - and it was, Marseille freezing and Red Star playing for penalties from the off, leaving star man Darko Pancev stranded upfield. It made for eye-bleedingly tedious fare - as if Red Star cared as they lifted the cup. SM Ref Rego blows up early \u2013 Montevideo, 1930 France were up against it from the off in the first-ever World Cup in 1930. They took more than two weeks to get to Uruguay by boat, then were asked to play in one of the tournament&apos;s concurrently held opening matches. They started well, Lucien Laurent scoring the first-ever World Cup goal on 19 minutes in a 4-1 win over Mexico, but were then asked to play their second match two days later against tournament favourites Argentina. Outplayed, they held on staunchly for 81 minutes before conceding - then, when on the attack three minutes later, were stopped in their tracks by referee Gilberto de Almeida Rego&apos;s final whistle. It&apos;s unlikely his decision to blow up on 84 minutes was anything other than inept - he was Brazilian after all - but it sucked the life out of France, who were forced to argue vociferously to get the last six minutes of the match played, then failed to pick themselves up after the restart. Chile beat them 1-0 four days later, and they were sent on the long journey back home. SM Richards swears on it - Villa Park, 2006 Manchester City&apos;s 17-year-old defender Micah Richards had just scored a deserved last-minute equaliser at Aston Villa on his fourth first-team appearance to take the tie to a replay. With his adrenalin still pumping, he was interviewed by Garth Crooks in the tunnel live on BBC1. GC: &quot;Well Micah, an extraordinary finish. What did you make of it?&quot; MR: &quot;Oh, it was just great to be out there ... [looks up to the ceiling, a broad smile on his face as he catches his breath] fuck yeah, you know ... I just can&apos;t believe it. One minute we were 1-0 down then, last minute, we got the goal. So there&apos;s not much more I can ask for, really.&quot; GC: &quot;Well, you&apos;re a young lad and we can understand your excitement, but this is going out to a national audience so be careful what you say ...&quot; DF Lazy Andy Ritchie \u2013 Greenock Morton, 1976-83 Perhaps the ultimate lazy genius was Andy Ritchie of unfashionable Greenock Morton. Having already blown his chance at Celtic, Ritchie became a legend at Morton, famed for his ability as much as his lethargy, he was affectionately called the Idle Idol and fans believed he was as good as any Scotland international. One of his greatest goals came against Dundee United. It was described thus in the book Greenock Morton 1874-1999: &quot;Big Andy was standing at the centre circle, hands inside his shirt sleeves, looking at the seagulls, bored out of his skull, when Davie Hayes blootered the ball out. It was just Andy and Paul Hegarty. Andy, you couldn&apos;t slip a copy of the Greenock Telegraph under his feet when he jumped. Hegarty jumped and missed and Ritchie did what Pel\u00e9 couldn&apos;t and volleyed the ball past Hamish from the half-way line!&quot; Ritchie described himself as a &quot;sick pup&quot; in a recent interview. &quot;I really needed someone to have some faith in me, but I was 26 and ended up taking a non-football job in London and gave up.&quot; GR Rush&apos;s decline \u2013 Sunderland, 1992-99 At the age of 20, David Rush played for Sunderland in an FA Cup final. By 27 he was playing Sunday league for Hylton Castle Arms. Accused of driving after having his licence suspended, the then Hartlepool United forward explained to an unsympathetic judge that he couldn&apos;t use public transport because if he did he&apos;d be mobbed. During his time at Oxford, fans would chant &quot;When he has a pint, he has a fight, David, David Rush.&quot; JW Rush misquoted \u2013 Turin, 1987-88 Ian Rush&apos;s solitary year in Turin playing for Juventus has become notorious for his failure to adapt to the Italian way of life. The gaucheness of the Welshman was summed up by his pithy explanation on his return to Anfield a year later. &quot;I couldn&apos;t settle in Italy,&quot; he was reported to have said. &quot;It was like living in a foreign country.&quot; There&apos;s only one problem with the story - he never said it. It was a joke uttered by Kenny Dalglish at the homecoming press conference and the phrase was stuffed into Rush&apos;s mouth to paint a picture of a parochial ing\u00e9nue who struggled among continental sophisticates. To Rush&apos;s chagrin it has continued to appear in all the best lexicons of quotations, a lazy urban myth that takes precedence over the facts. RB St Mirren sack Fergie \u2013 Paisley, 1978 Sir Alex Ferguson has won 10 league titles, five FA Cups, four Scottish Cups, six European trophies - but he has only been sacked once. It seems fair to assume that he won&apos;t be adding to that tally before his retirement. So the then St Mirren chairman, Willie Todd, will forever hold the distinction of being the only man to give the boot to perhaps the greatest manager in the history of British football, though as he told the Guardian last year it was not because he didn&apos;t consider the master tactician good enough, but because he was about to leave anyway. &quot;I knew perfectly well that he had told all the staff he was moving to Aberdeen ... it was a clear breach of contract.&quot; Still, it&apos;s one hell of a boast.

It seemed a good idea - well, absolutely vital - for us at the Bath international music festival to mark the occasion with some kind of celebration. But what started out as one concert quickly became several performances of different shapes and sizes, not all of them conventional. We have a theatre group retelling classic myths for children, an installation of electronic music in the ghostly workshops of the Museum of Bath at Work, an open-air marching band, big percussion pieces and intimate chamber works. All this climaxes in a big, ritualistic extravaganza of choral and brass music at Bath Abbey, with 70 performers. One formal type of concert simply wasn&apos;t enough to do justice to the complexity and magnitude of Harry&apos;s output and personality. I wanted to make some connections between his music and some of Harry&apos;s favourite Tudor and Elizabethan composers, to get children involved, and invite local students to share the stage with professionals. Birtwistle&apos;s music is often considered so complex that only a certain kind of &quot;specialist&quot; musician can play it, but I want to open the door marked &quot;Danger - New Music&quot; for young people early on. It&apos;s easy to label Birtwistle a &quot;hard&quot; composer. Some readers might remember switching on the Last Night of the Proms a few years ago for a comforting singalong only to be confronted by Panic, a sensational piece for sax, percussion and orchestra, which apparently traumatised the shires for several weeks afterwards. I remember listening to Sue Lawley on Desert Island Discs testily demanding to know exactly who he was writing for. But composers don&apos;t get up in the morning wondering who can they upset today - the good ones don&apos;t, anyway. They write what they hear, and express what needs to be expressed. Like sculptors, they patiently hew and shape their music, often following a private narrative arc from piece to piece. They write alone, slowly and diligently. Some of them, like Harry, find their voice very early on and examine their personal mythologies carefully with each new work. The problem with &quot;hard&quot; classical music is that the audiences can be self-selecting, aided and abetted by some critics who imply you need a PhD before you&apos;ll be sold a ticket. But you don&apos;t need to control the music, or fight it. If you let it happen, you&apos;ll be surprised at how beautiful, deep and lyrical even the most challenging contemporary scores can be. Sure, Birtwistle&apos;s written some very loud, dissonant music (let&apos;s not panic about Panic again); but I find it exhilarating, rather than threatening, and it&apos;s never without some kind of emotional punch. The melodic lines may be angular or stratospheric, but they&apos;re unmistakably melodies. The first time I worked with Harry was on his huge piano concerto Antiphonies, in 1992; I was asked to take over an extraordinarily complex score at the last minute, and flown out to Paris to meet the conductor, Pierre Boulez, in Ircam, his underground labyrinth of electronic studios. Boulez thought the piece very tough and asked me to work through the entire score with him at sight. (This, in case you&apos;re wondering, is the stuff of musicians&apos; nightmares: trying to sightread Birtwistle in front of Boulez.) The orchestration (for huge forces, including a massive battery of percussion) was so dense you could&apos;ve walked into it like an Anish Kapoor installation. I loved the music, the depth and fierceness of it; the way it went absolutely against the idea of a conventional piano concerto, and the way we all had to cling on for dear life, even in Boulez&apos;s supremely capable hands. Those first three performances with the Philharmonia, in Paris, Antwerp and London, were formidably powerful - even if the critics weren&apos;t crazy about it - and 18 months later we recorded it in Amsterdam, with a somewhat less friendly Dutch Radio Orchestra. There was much complaining, particularly from the string section. At the end of tense recording days, I remember weaving in between trams with Birtwistle, whipped by below-freezing winds, and diving into snug bars very late. (The recording turned out very well, despite the high-noon atmosphere.)  Complex modern music always has antecedents. I&apos;ve never met a composer who doesn&apos;t have a strong affinity with the past; often they&apos;re reworking, reimagining or just plain arguing with what&apos;s come before. You can find out a lot from the company a composer keeps, and there&apos;s a nice line to be traced from the early English composers John Dunstable and John Dowland to Birtwistle: it&apos;s a shared quality of mystery and melancholy, of shadows and pauses and memory. The first piece I remember hearing of Birtwistle&apos;s, and falling in love with, was Meridian, a love song scored for mezzo soprano, chorus and ensemble. It entwines the glorious poetry of the Elizabethan lyricist Thomas Wyatt with Christopher Logue. I can remember with absolute clarity how I felt at this performance, more than 30 years ago: I was lifted up and transported, by this rapturous music, to a place where the deep past and present meet. This quality in Birtwistle&apos;s music is a gift for programming: there&apos;s nothing more satisfying than forging links between ancient and modern worlds, so the listener can engage with contemporary music on two levels. Birtwistle revisits rituals, myths and stories over and over again, and there&apos;s a sense that his music is one long processional, emerging from a distant past, circling slowly round, and back again. Finally, remember all composers are human beings. They have family lives, friends, gardens, hobbies, like you and me. Because he&apos;s known for long, involved scores, it comes as a surprise that over the years Harry has written several brief, intimate piano pieces, which I&apos;m getting some young students from Bath Spa University to play for him (he will be attending all the concerts). All have lovely dedications to newborn grandchildren, or close friends; they&apos;re usually brief lullabies, or tangos, or humorous little exercises in rhythm with a metronome. And even his most fearful music is intended to be playful.  Some years after Antiphonies, I premiered a huge cycle called Harrison&apos;s Clocks, five pieces based on John Harrison&apos;s 18th-century maritime clocks. Boy, they were hard - millions of notes, with fantastically complicated rhythms travelling at the speed of light. Many other pianists at the time quaked, turned pale and shook their heads. But everything moves on - that was more than 10 years ago, and what&apos;s considered unplayable gradually becomes - well, not exactly easy, but possible. Harry told me that recently teenage pupils at the Purcell School had split the piece up, taken a movement each, and played them to him. On the phone the other day, sorting out some details for our Bath concerts, I mentioned to Harry I was spending the rest of the evening in the company of these fiendish Clocks. I must&apos;ve sounded glum. &quot;But they&apos;re not hard!&quot; he exclaimed in his soft Lancashire burr, trying to cheer me up. &quot;They&apos;re fun.&quot; And I thought, yes, he&apos;s right. Just because they&apos;re complicated doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re not fun. \u2022 Joanna McGregor is a pianist and artistic director of Bath International Music Festival, which opens tonight.

The pretty Riccione backstreet is a sea of spandex, rippling its way towards the town&apos;s main thoroughfare in waves of glowing thighs and strong calves. Luminous cycling jerseys clash brutally with the sunlight bouncing off white walls and swimming pools and every few seconds you can hear the click, click of a rider attaching their feet to their pedals, ready for the word go.  I can feel the anticipation in the air. It&apos;s akin to a warm up ride before a stage of the Giro d&apos;Italia, Italy&apos;s premier cycling race, which whips through this area of Emilia-Romagna this weekend. We, I confess, are not quite so professional. We&apos;re guests of the Hotel Dory, part of the Italy Bike Hotels&apos; consortium, which caters for the specific needs of cyclists. There are some Brits among us but it&apos;s mainly Italians, Germans and Swedes. Under the watchful eye of one of its five expert cycling guides, we are about to cycle either 70km, 100km, 105km or 120km, depending on which group we join. And this is just the first day. &quot;I think you are a cappuccino,&quot; says manager Stefano Giuliodori, eyeing my floral cycling skirt suspiciously.  This information comes as something of a relief as it means I&apos;ll be cycling a mere 100km at an average speed of 25km/h. I had been toying with joining the super-cappuccino group (105km, more hills and an average speed of 28km/h) until I realised its guide was ex-professional rider Richard Steiner who has raced with, among others, cycling legend Eddie Merckx. I decide to leave the super-capp challenge until later but resolve not to be relegated to the Borghi e Castelli (countryside and castles) group at the one hour assessment stage. We head off through the town like a motley peloton, dodging potholes and sensible Italians doing what people should do in 30-degree heat, which is sipping coffee in the shade.  It soon becomes clear that Italy&apos;s Adriatic coast is perfect for cycling long distances. Huge swathes of flat vineyards are punctuated with sharp hills crested by beautiful medieval towns - San Marino, San Leo, Verucchio - all offering cool sanctuary under their stone arches for hot cyclists. The worst climb of the day is the Passo del Grillo, which, at 434 metres high and with a 7km slog to the summit, is hardly Alpine.  Yet the top of the pass provides a timeless vista - a patchwork of green fields, poplar trees, farmhouses and wobbly rows of grapes, all doused in hazy May sunshine. &quot;Vai! Vai!&quot; yells guide Drelli, as romantic notions of cold beers start to take hold. We plunge down 4km of switchbacks to join a busy highway already thick with cyclists and head back to the hotel. Here the most remarkable thing happens. Not only is there lunch ready and waiting, but our cycling kit is swept up into plastic bags and taken off to be laundered fresh for the following day&apos;s ride. Our bikes are stowed securely in a large lock-up complete with mechanic and workshop to fix any technical issues. Hotel Dory is not simply bike friendly - it is bike heaven, combining a challenging cycle trip with a relaxing, hotel-based holiday. And indulging in plate after plate of the local seafood speciality, spaghetti allo scoglio - literally &quot;spaghetti of the clifftops&quot; - is remarkably guilt-free when eaten after four hours of pedalling, cappuccino style. Re-energised, I headed up the coast to another IBH member, the Hotel Lungomare in Cesenatico. The town is a cycling landmark in Emilia-Romagna - it was the home of Marco Pantani, one of the greatest, and most controversial, climbers in cycling history, winner of both the Tour de France and the Giro in 1998.  The town&apos;s Pantani Museum is full of his bikes, trophies and press cuttings. Cesenatico&apos;s cobbled streets are constantly criss-crossed by cyclists inspired by his passion for the sport - everyone appears to be on a bike. With a beautiful port canal through its centre, designed by Leonardo da Vinci and lined with tempting restaurants, it looks more like Amsterdam than Italy. Tomorrow it hosts the Nove Colli, or Nine Hills race for amateurs and professionals alike.  This is the place I decide, after regarding the ease with which men on the beach strip down to their Speedos, to exchange my cycling skirt for racing lycra. Vicenzo from the Lungomare deposits me, my bike and regulation banana into the safe hands of guide Daniello. Compared to life with the cappuccinos this is plain sailing. But Daniello&apos;s English is limited, my Italian crumbling and when I shout &quot;Vite, vite!&quot; at him, the look in his eye tells me I may have urged him to do more than merely pick up the pace.  Still, we are going at a fair old lick along the gently rolling terrain surrounding the Rubicon river and eventually pull into Santarcangelo, a large Arc de Triomphe-style arch topping off our route to the plaza. I feel like I&apos;ve just won the Tour de France.  A flower market is in full bloom, with women who look like they have just stepped out of a Gucci advert gliding between the stalls. I settle down at a cafe, covered in bike grease and clad in skintight lycra, to enjoy a latte. No-one bats an eyelid. A monk cycles past on a clanking old bike. I order another latte. By the time we head back to lasagne, beer and an afternoon on the beach I&apos;ve got the next 30 years mapped out and each one includes a week&apos;s cycling in Emilia-Romagna. I&apos;ve been sizing up Pantani&apos;s bike in the museum and I&apos;m pretty sure it will be perfect.

Zidane, who is seen wearing a hooded cloak that has echoes of the master/student theme seen in films such as Star Wars and martial arts movies, will feature in Adidas content over the next year on a global quest to find out what makes the world&apos;s best players tick. &quot;To the football audience, a big TV spot is only a moment long, but an intriguing series of films, clues, product previews and digital tools can sustain this consumer and entice them to engage with our product and brand and put us in their consideration set for purchase,&quot; said Eric Liedtke, senior vice president of brand marketing for Adidas. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Chicago&apos;s weird. There&apos;s no real downtown: it&apos;s just shops. Very consumer-oriented. And it&apos;s kind of strange going off to these things on your own. It&apos;s almost as if time has been taken from you and you get to know yourself again in a strange way, because you have only yourself as company, wandering the Chicago streets. I like my own company. The new space is huge and beautiful, with lots of light. And like most of these situations, the modern art looks fantastic, but the contemporary art needs more space. The opening was straight out of a Woody Allen movie. Lots of old, rich people. The great and the good. A very glamorous society event. I was sitting next to the artist Ellsworth Kelly, who was very nice. He was describing one of his paintings to me - Study for White Plaque: Bridge Arch and Reflection - and he drew it for me and told me to keep the drawing, which was very nice of him. Then I went back to Amsterdam, where I get back to some sort of domestic normality. In the evening, I watch a documentary film called I Heard It Through the Grapevine which features James Baldwin going back to the south for the first time since his self-imposed exile in France after the assassination of Martin Luther King. The year is 1980 and Baldwin traces the steps of the civil rights movement starting in Washington and ending in Mississippi.  It&apos;s a strange sort of time capsule looking at it today. One must ask oneself after watching this documentary: have the lives of African Americans really moved on after the election of Obama? The charismatic Baldwin is one of those storytellers, or narrators, as he is in this documentary, who knows how to press the right buttons to get as close as he can to the essential questions  I am still doing press for Hunger. It hasn&apos;t opened in Germany yet. I&apos;ve been promoting this movie for more than a year now. I had no idea when I started that you could be on the road with a movie for 18 months. But I&apos;m very proud of it and I&apos;m very pleased for Michael Fassbender, who played Bobby Sands in the film. He rang me up on my way to Venice on Tuesday to say he&apos;s looking forward to working with me again and I felt very honoured. He was telling me that Andrea Arnold&apos;s Fish Tank just won joint Jury Prize at Cannes and that the Tarantino film, Inglourious Basterds, which he is also in, did fairly well too. We were reminiscing about our extraordinarily special time in Cannes last year. Michael is a genius. He&apos;s going to be a big star.  It&apos;s all hammers and nails right now in the Giardini, where the Venice Biennale happens. It&apos;s interesting how the sound of the garden has changed: the birds and the wind have been overtaken by electric saws and rusty wheelbarrows. We&apos;re working away, getting everything ready for the Biennale opening on 7 June. The whole art world is going to be here so there is a certain anxiety. Even if you think you&apos;re ready, something can always go wrong. The Biennale is unique to the art world; it&apos;s the only situation I can think of where art and nationality come together. It&apos;s a big honour to be representing Britain this year. I&apos;m very happy. You can only do it once and then it&apos;s over. And I was lucky in that I had an idea of what I was going to do before they asked me. They only give you a year&apos;s notice, which is pretty short, so it was good that I sort of knew. Right now, I am working with people from the British Council, who have done a really marvellous job. The British pavilion is one of the best in here. It&apos;s like a fortress, a very English kind of castle in the middle of the garden, and we&apos;ve got a great veranda that you can look out from and see who&apos;s coming before they arrive. It&apos;s kind of nice to have a bit of camaraderie in this situation. But I am not saying a word about the installation itself.  Venice is just breathtaking. Walking between meetings or going back to the hotel or taking a vaporetto is a luxury; I went to the church in St Mark&apos;s Square for the umpteenth time - it is so beautiful. And of course the food is fantastic.  I have only been to one Biennale before this - I was involved in the Italian pavilion two years ago - so it&apos;s all still new and exciting for me. Last time, I was stuck in boring dinners. This time, I won&apos;t make the same mistake again. David Holmes, who did the music for Hunger and the Ocean&apos;s films and is basically Mr DJ, asked me if he could play at the Biennale, and I was thrilled. I am sure it&apos;s going to be one of those occasions when I can really enjoy myself. All I want to do is dance.  After two years of intense work - Hunger, the Biennale and the ongoing Queen and Country, my project to commemorate on postage stamps British servicemen and women killed in Iraq, which, I hope, with the support of the public, will be realised as real stamps - this will be one of those moments when I can catch my breath with my close friends and family and be with the ones I love.

You can&apos;t win them all \u2013 but a run of 25 games unbeaten is an all-time record in Europe for any club. Winning the Club World Cup in December seems long forgotten, but it was an awesome achievement, and securing the title for the third consecutive season says it all. The highlights for me were Macheda&apos;s winner against Villa and destroying Arsenal at the Emirates. Happy with the gaffer? He just keeps rolling on, picking up silverware every season. And some of the emerging talent he has blooded looks awesome: Macheda, Welbeck, Possebon, Tosic and the Da Silva twins. He and his staff deserve huge credit. Who were the stars \u2013 and who flopped? Rooney, Van der Sar, Ronaldo, Tevez \u2013 all great, but special mention goes to Darren Fletcher, who forced one of the biggest turnarounds of fan opinion ever. Nani had a difficult second season, though \u2013 and Berbatov needs to practise his pens... Who were the best, and worst, away fans? The Hull fans sang non-stop, but Blackburn and Bolton have an unshakeable bleakness about them. Top hate figure at another club? Ben\u00edtez&apos;s rants take some beating, but special mention must also go to Phil Brown and his gargantuan ego. TOP FIVE BEST OPPOSITION PLAYERS 1 A Young (Aston Villa); 2 Lennon (Spurs); 3 Torres (Liverpool); 4 Arshavin (Arsenal); 5 Valencia (Wigan) MIDDLESBROUGH Andy Morgan ComeOnBoro.com How was your season? Unprintable. Abject, disappointing, demoralising, incompetent. I don&apos;t think the English language has enough negative adjectives to describe the Boro this season. Happy with the gaffer? I think Steve Gibson is the only one who is. This season Southgate has never had a plan\u00a0B, resorted to defending one-goal leads when our defence is shaky, sold all our experienced players and not replaced them, played players out of position and imparted all the motivation of a sloth after a heavy session in an Amsterdam caf\u00e9. Who were the stars \u2013 and who flopped? Everyone has flopped at some time this season. Tuncay went missing for two months (when Chelsea were allegedly courting him) but he has been the best of a bad bunch. Marlon King has flattered to deceive while Alves, well, deary me. Who were the best, and worst, away fans? Best were Stoke \u2013 it was early season and everyone apart from the Potters&apos; fans thought they would go straight back down. How wrong we all were. Fulham were small in number and fairly quiet. But then, it was a rather dull 0-0 draw. Top hate figure at another club? Ronaldo. His continual cheating, petulance and general smugness grates. TOP FIVE BEST OPPOSITION PLAYERS 1 Schwarzer (Fulham); 2 Kranjcar (Portsmouth); 3\u00a0Elmander (Bolton); 4 Lawrence (Stoke); 5 Lennon (Tottenham) NEWCASTLE Holmes Family Observer readers How was your season? Tragic. Going out of the Premier League without even a whimper at Villa was a predictable end to a shameful period in the club&apos;s history. Five different managers in one season says it all and it&apos;s the fans who&apos;ve suffered the most. The squad have been degraded year after year and we were left with a collection of overpaid underachievers. It could be a long road back. Happy with the gaffer? Shearer has Newcastle in his heart and we&apos;d like him to stay. He&apos;s shown passion and instilled discipline, but should have been appointed much earlier. The previous management teams (bar Keegan) were unable to coax a decent performance from this turgid team \u2013 it&apos;s no surprise we went down. Who were the stars \u2013 and who flopped? Bassong was excellent, though he blotted his copybook against Fulham. Most of the squad flopped, especially the Allardyce/Wise signings who promised much but have delivered little. Who were the best, and worst, away fans? Best \u2013 the ever-noisy West Brom. Worst \u2013 Man United have no class. Top hate figure at another club? Phil Brown, though Dennis Wise if he was at another club. TOP FIVE BEST OPPOSITION PLAYERS 1 Gerrard (Liverpool); 2 Carrick (Man United); 3 Ireland (Man City); 4 Arteta (Everton); 5 Hughes (Fulham) PORTSMOUTH Mick &amp; Robin Dunford Pompey.org How was your season? High expectations were quickly dampened as the club cashed in on Muntari, Mendes and Diarra. The fact that the best remaining midfielders played little due to injury or managerial pig-headedness made the situation worse. After a quick exit from Europe, the sudden departure of Redknapp for the second time and the Adams debacle, which resulted in us losing any ability to retain a lead, safety from relegation was the name of the game. Happy with the gaffer? Hart and Kidd deserve some credit for making us more difficult to defeat and for getting us clear of relegation, but the loss of Kranjcar revealed tactical inflexibility and a bizarre midfield selection policy. Who were the stars \u2013 and who flopped? Johnson was a star. Davis held the side together, but James, Distin and Campbell were shadows of the rocks they were last season. Mullins and Hughes worked hard, but would look average in the Championship. And Nugent didn&apos;t reveal the hidden depths. Who were the best, and worst, away fans? Best were Bristol City \u2013 the worst, Wigan.  Top hate figure at another club? Jermain Defoe. TOP FIVE BEST OPPOSITION PLAYERS 1 Ireland (Manchester City); 2 Arshavin (Arsenal); 3 Bellamy (West Ham and Manchester City); 4 Deco (Chelsea); 5 Wigan&apos;s crossbar. STOKE Nick Dunn The Oatcake How was your season? So much better than anyone expected. To do so well when the &quot;experts&quot; had predicted we would do so badly only added to the fun. Happy with the gaffer? Very much so. He&apos;s shown an ability to bring in good players at minimal cost and then get the best out of them once they&apos;re here. He also seems to have good plans in place for the long-term. Who were the stars \u2013 and who flopped? Abdoulaye Faye&apos;s ability and professionalism have been impressive and it&apos;s wonderful to see him celebrate like a true Stoke fan eavery time we win. Ricardo Fuller and James Beattie have both done well, giving the team a cutting edge and providing the goals we needed. Thomas Sorensen has been superb, too, especially considering he was a free transfer. Things didn&apos;t work out for Dave Kitson, but perhaps things will be different next season if he starts scoring early on. Who were the best, and worst, away fans? The Spurs and Blackburn fans were noisy despite their situations at the time. But I was disappointed that so few fans made the short trip from Wigan and West Brom. Top hate figure at another club? Cristiano Ronaldo. Impossible to like.

A decision in the Amsterdam court of appeal on Friday has cleared the way for approximately $352.6m (\u00a3218.5m) in compensation to be paid out to non-US shareholders. The court&apos;s verdict follows a hearing in November and shareholders believe it is an important step in avoiding US-style class-action suits. The Dutch settlement is not the result of litigation but part of a collaborative approach agreed and supported by both Royal Dutch Shell and European institutional investors and pension funds. It is being conducted in the Netherlands, where Shell is headquartered, and takes place under Dutch collective settlement arrangements introduced in 2005. Private shareholders seeking compensation need to contact VEB, a Dutch private shareholders association that has been funded to assist individual shareholders who want to participate in the Dutch settlement. Aviva Investors said: &quot;We are delighted with the decision by the Amsterdam court of appeal. The settlement provides welcome closure to the reserve \u00admis-statements for both the company and its shareholders. &quot;The case has also set important precedents, both for shareholder collaboration and for the jurisdictional scope of such cases. It&apos;s important now for pension funds and others to ensure that their claims will be properly filed.&quot; The proposed settlement will cover approximately 9.5% to 12.8% of estimated damages \u2013 a larger amount than is often achieved by US class-action lawsuits. The payout for investors has been on the cards since 2007 when Shell promised to offer compensation &quot;without admitting any wrongdoing&quot;. It has already set aside \u00a3250m in its accounts for investor compensation. News that the oil giant had overstated reserves in submissions to the US regulator, the securities &amp; exchange commission, led to the departures of both Watts and Walter van de Vijver, Shell&apos;s then exploration chief. It came as a serious shock to investors and left Shell&apos;s reputation \u2013 and share price \u2013 in such tatters that there was speculation it would be taken over by a resurgent BP.

In a survey of great tits living in and around 20 urban areas in the UK, researchers also found that city birds were more likely to recognise the songs of their fellow urban dwellers than those in the country. These birds may only live a few miles away from the city-slickers but sing lower-pitched songs. &quot;Most man-made noise is of a fairly low frequency \u2013 the rumble of traffic, the clatter of machinery, that sort of thing,&quot; said Rupert Marshall of Aberystwyth University, who led the survey. &quot;So the great tits in the city sing at a higher pitch to overcome that.&quot; Male great tits are territorial birds and they sing to defend their patch - usually around 100m sq - against other males. They also use the songs to attract mates. In their research, published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Marshall&apos;s team recorded the songs they heard in city centres and also in the nearby rural areas. They found that, on average, the city songs were higher pitched than the countryside songs. Marshall&apos;s team also went a step further. &quot;We played back the songs we&apos;d recorded in the cities to the birds in the rural areas and vice versa. And we also played the city birds other city bird songs and the same in the countryside. We found that they responded much more strongly to the songs of the birds form the same area, birds with a similar noise background.&quot; This inability to recognise songs from members of its own species could lead to problems, said the researchers. If a city bird moves to a new area to attract mates or find food, its song may not be attractive to mates, nor would it be a warning to local males to stay away from its territory. &quot;We know that great tit songs are largely determined by what they hear in the first year of their life and only small changes are known to occur after this stage,&quot; said Marshall. Great tits do move their territories over the years, so those at the edges of towns might be most at risk. Previous research on birds in continental Europe has suggested a difference in song pitch between rural and city birds. In 2006, scientists at Leiden University in the Netherlands recorded the songs of great tits in 10 European cities including London, Prague, Paris and Amsterdam and compared the songs with birds of the same species in nearby forests. They found that not only was the pitch of city songs higher but also the urban birds sang faster, shorter, songs. Marshall&apos;s study is the first to show that birds of a single species respond differently to the different songs. He said the next stage of the research would be aimed at working out whether female great tits also responded differently to the songs of males from different areas. The changes in song could mark the first step in an evolutionary process called speciation - when an organism splits into two or more different species because of the differing environmental pressures facing different populations. But, given that such an evolutionary change would take many generations to occur, it is impossible to be certain whether great tits were already heading down this path. \u2022 Listen to the urban great tit song here and the rural song here.", "sentences": ["In 2006, scientists at Leiden University in the Netherlands recorded the songs of great tits in 10 European cities including London, Prague, Paris and Amsterdam and compared the songs with birds of the same species in nearby forests."], "title": "City birds sing higher than country cousins, scientists find", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/03/great-tit-city-bird-song", "tags": ["Birdwatching", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Science", "Animal behaviour", "Zoology", "UK news", "Birds", "Animals"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-06-03T12:30:58Z", "article": "Samantha Orobator, who has been sentenced to life for drug trafficking in Laos, was born in Nigeria in 1988 and moved with members of her family to the UK when she was eight years old. Her uncle, who was described as her father figure, was killed in Nigeria and the family were given UK asylum status as a result. Her mother, Jane, who is a student, now lives in Dublin with Samantha&apos;s three younger siblings. Her father remains in Lagos. Described as a &quot;bright and friendly&quot; pupil by her former teachers, Samantha Orobator was raised by an aunt in south London. Family and friends said her arrest came as a complete surprise. She had told them she was going for a holiday to the Netherlands. The next they heard from her, she was in jail in Laos facing the death penalty. Orobator had in fact flown from Amsterdam to Thailand before travelling on to Laos, where she was arrested. Her mother told the Guardian after the arrest that there was no evidence her daughter had been involved in drugs before and her friends said she was not a drug user. Jane Orobator said Samantha was &quot;very fragile ... I can&apos;t begin to imagine what she is going through.&quot; It is understood that in her defence, Samantha told the Laotian authorities that she was placed under duress. The human rights organisation Reprieve said that in the past she had been the victim of violent men. The circumstances under which Orobator became pregnant, four months after being jailed, are unclear. It appears she conceived in December despite being in an all-female prison. Reprieve says it is not clear whether the pregnancy was voluntary, and it is campaigning for her to receive proper antenatal care. Last week, the English language newspaper and website the Vientiane Times reported that Orobator obtained the sperm of another prisoner so she could avoid the death penalty. There is no independent confirmation of this \u2013 the story quotes the Laotian police. The paper&apos;s coverage of the case has followed the government line that Orobator has been treated well throughout and that her mother is happy with the legal process. Prior to the trial, Orobator was reportedly required to sign a statement exonerating the Laotian authorities of any responsibility for her pregnancy. It is understood that unless she signed the statement, the trial would not proceed. The Laotian government has been angered by foreign press coverage of the case. If transferred to a UK jail she could serve her sentence in Holloway prison, north London, which has a mother and baby unit.

I was waiting for a bus home to Twickenham after a rehearsal at Richmond Little Theatre, when a sleek maroon car drew up and a man with a big cigar in his mouth leant over to the passenger window and said, &quot;Want a lift?&quot; Of course my parents had told me, my teachers had told me, everyone had told me, never to accept lifts from strange men, but at that stage he didn&apos;t seem strange, and I hopped in. I liked the smell of his cigar and the leather seats. He asked where I wanted to go and I said Clifden Road, and he said fine. I told him I had never seen a car like this before, and he said it was a Bristol, and very few were made. He told me lots of facts about Bristols as we cruised - Bristols always cruised - towards Twickenham. He had a funny accent - later, when I knew him better, I realised it was the accent he used for posh - but I asked if he was foreign. He said: &quot;Only if you count Jews as foreign.&quot; Well of course I did. I had never consciously met a Jew; I didn&apos;t think we had them at my school. But I said politely: &quot;Are you Jewish? I never would have guessed.&quot; (I meant he didn&apos;t have the hooked nose, the greasy ringlets, the straggly beard of Shylock in the school play.) He said he had lived in Israel when he was &quot;your age&quot;. I wondered what he thought my age was: I hoped he thought 19. But then when he said, &quot;Fancy a coffee?&quot; I foolishly answered, &quot;No - my father will kill me if I&apos;m late.&quot; &quot;School tomorrow?&quot; he asked, and, speechless with mortification, I could only nod. So then he drove me to my house, and asked: &quot;Can I take you out for coffee another evening?&quot; My life might have turned out differently if I had just said no. But I was not quite rude enough. Instead, I said I was very busy rehearsing a play which meant that, unfortunately, I had no free evenings. He asked what play, and I said The Lady&apos;s Not for Burning at Richmond Little Theatre. Arriving for the first night a couple of weeks later, I found an enormous bouquet in the dressing room addressed to me. The other actresses, all grown-ups, were mewing with envy and saying, &quot;Those flowers must have cost a fortune.&quot; When I left the theatre, hours later, I saw the Bristol parked outside and went over to say thank you. He said: &quot;Can&apos;t we have our coffee now?&quot; and I said no, because I was late again, but he could drive me home. I wasn&apos;t exactly rushing headlong into this relationship; he was far too old for me to think of as a boyfriend. On the other hand, I had always fantasised about having an older man, someone even more sophisticated than me, to impress the little squirts of Hampton Grammar. So I agreed to go out with him on Friday week, though I warned that he would have to undergo a grilling from my father. My father&apos;s grillings were notorious among the Hampton Grammar boys. He wanted to know what marks they got at O-level, what A-levels they were taking, what universities they were applying to. He practically made them sit an IQ test before they could take me to the flicks. But this time, for once, my father made no fuss at all. He asked where Simon and I had met; I said at Richmond Little Theatre, and that was that. He seemed genuinely impressed by Simon, and even volunteered that we could stay out till midnight. So our meeting for coffee turned into dinner, and with my father&apos;s blessing. Simon took me to an Italian place in Marylebone and of course I was dazzled. I had never been to a proper restaurant before, only to tea rooms with my parents. I didn&apos;t understand the menu, but I loved the big pepper grinders and the heavy cutlery, the cr\u00eapes suzettes and the champagne. I was also dazzled by Simon&apos;s conversation. Again, I understood very little of it, partly because his accent was so strange, but also because it ranged across places and activities I could hardly imagine. My knowledge of the world was based on Shakespeare, Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Brontes, and none of them had a word to say about living on a kibbutz or making Molotov cocktails. I felt I had nothing to bring to the conversational feast and blushed when Simon urged me to tell him about my schoolfriends, my teachers, my prize-winning essays. I didn&apos;t realise then that my being a schoolgirl was a large part of my attraction. Over the next few weeks, it became an accepted thing that Simon would turn up on Friday or Saturday nights to take me to the West End. Sometimes we went to the Chelsea Classic to see foreign films; sometimes he took me to concerts at the Wigmore or Royal Festival Hall, but mostly we went to restaurants. The choice of restaurants seemed to be dictated by mysterious visits Simon had to make on the way. He would say, &quot;I&apos;ve just got to pop into Prince&apos;s Gate&quot;, and would disappear into one of the white cliff-like houses while I would wait in the car. Sometimes the waiting was very long, and I learnt to take a book on all our dates. Once, I asked if I could come in with him, but he said, &quot;No, this is business&quot;, and I never asked again. Besides taking me out at weekends, Simon would sometimes drop in during the week when he said he was &quot;just passing&quot;. (Why was he passing Twickenham? Where was he going? I never asked.) On these occasions, he would stay chatting to my parents, sometimes for an hour or more, about news or politics - subjects of no interest to me. Often the three of them were so busy talking they didn&apos;t even notice if I left the room. I found this extraordinary. It was quite unprecedented in our house for me not to be the centre of attention.  Perhaps I should explain about my parents. They were first-generation immigrants to the middle class and all their hopes were invested in me, their only child. They had no relatives in London, and no friends who ever came to the house - my father had his bridge club, my mother her amateur dramatics, but all they talked about at home was me, and specifically my schoolwork. My father often quoted Charles Kingsley&apos;s line &quot;Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever&quot;, but he said it sarcastically - he wanted me to be clever, and let who will be good. I had been reared from the cradle to pass every possible exam, gain every possible scholarship and go to the best possible university. By the time I met Simon, I was well on track. I had a scholarship to an independent school, Lady Eleanor Holles, a royal flush of O-levels, and my teachers predicted that I would easily win a place at Oxford to read English. But still my parents fretted and worried. Their big fear was that my Latin would &quot;let me down&quot;. Simon in theory represented everything my parents most feared - he was not one of us, he was Jewish and cosmopolitan, practically a foreigner. He wore cashmere sweaters and suede shoes; he drove a pointlessly expensive car; he didn&apos;t work in an office; he was vague about where he went to school and, worst of all, boasted that he had been educated in &quot;the university of life&quot; - not a teaching establishment my parents recognised. And yet, inexplicably, they liked him. In fact, they liked him more than I ever liked him, perhaps because he took great pains to make them like him. He brought my mother flowers and my father wine; he taught them to play backgammon; he chatted to them endlessly and seemed genuinely interested in their views. I suppose it made a change for them from always talking about me.  Yet none of us ever really knew a thing about him. I think my parents once asked where he lived and he said &quot;South Kensington&quot;, but that was it. I never had a phone number for him, still less an address. As for what he did, he was &quot;a property developer&quot; - a term I suspect meant as little to my parents as it did to me. I knew it was somehow connected with these visits he had to make, the great bunches of keys he carried, the piles of surveyors&apos; reports and auction catalogues in the back of his car, and the occasional evenings when he had to &quot;meet Perec&quot; which meant cruising around Bayswater looking for Perec (Peter) Rachman&apos;s Roller parked outside one of his clubs. Rachman would later give his name to Rachmanism when the press exposed him as the worst of London&apos;s exploitative landlords, but at that time he was just one of Simon&apos;s many mysterious business colleagues. Simon was adept at not answering questions, but actually he rarely needed to, because I never asked them. The extent to which I never asked him questions is astonishing in retrospect - I blame Albert Camus. My normal instinct was to bombard people with questions, to ask about every detail of their lives. But just around the time I met Simon I became an existentialist, and one of the rules of existentialism as practised by me and my disciples at Lady Eleanor Holles School was that you never asked questions. Asking questions showed that you were na\u00efve and bourgeois; not asking questions showed that you were sophisticated and French. I badly wanted to be sophisticated. And, as it happened, this suited Simon fine. My role in the relationship was to be the schoolgirl ice maiden, implacable, ungrateful, unresponsive to everything he said or did. To ask questions would have shown that I was interested in him, even that I cared, and neither of us really wanted that. Simon established early on that I was a virgin, and seemed quite happy about it. He asked when I intended to lose my virginity and I said: &quot;17&quot;, and he agreed this was the ideal age. He said it was important not to lose my virginity in some inept fumble with a grubby schoolboy, but with a sophisticated older man. I heartily agreed - though, unlike him, I had no particular older man in mind. He certainly didn&apos;t seem like a groper. I was used to Hampton Grammar boys who turned into octopuses in the cinema dark, clamping damp tentacles to your breast. Simon never did that. Instead, he kissed me long and gently and said: &quot;I love to look into your eyes.&quot; When he kissed me, he called me Minn and said I was to call him Bubl but I usually forgot. Eventually, one night, he said, &quot;I&apos;d love to see your breasts&quot;, so I grudgingly unbuttoned my blouse and allowed him to peep inside my bra. But this was still well within the Lady Eleanor Holles dating code - by rights, given the number of hot dinners he&apos;d bought me, he could really have taken my bra right off. And then one day, on one of his drop-in visits, Simon said he was going to Wales next weekend to visit some friends and could I go with him? I confidently expected my parents to say no - to go away, overnight, with a man I barely knew? - but instead they said yes, though my father added jocularly, &quot;Separate rooms, of course.&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; said Simon. So off we went for the first of many dirty weekends. I hated Wales, hated the grim hotel, the sour looks when Simon signed us in. We shared a room, of course, and shared a bed, but Simon only kissed me and said: &quot;Save it till you&apos;re 17.&quot; After that, there were many more weekends - Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges, and often Sark in the Channel Islands, because Simon liked the hotel there, and I liked stocking up on my exciting new discovery, Sobranie Black Russian cigarettes. They brought my sophistication on by leaps and bounds. As my 17th birthday approached, I knew that my debt of dinners and weekends could only be erased by &quot;giving&quot; Simon my virginity. He talked for weeks beforehand about when, where, how it should be achieved. He thought Rome, or maybe Venice; I thought as near as possible to Twickenham, in case I bled. In the end, it was a new trendy circular hotel - the Ariel? - by Heathrow airport, where we spent the night before an early morning flight to somewhere or other, I forget. He wanted to do a practice run with a banana - he had brought a banana specially. I said, &quot;Oh for heaven&apos;s sake!&quot;, and told him to do it properly. He talked a lot about how he hoped Minn would do Bubl the honour of welcoming him into her home. Somewhere in the middle of the talking, he was inside me, and it was over. I thought: &quot;Oh well, that was easy. Perhaps now I can get a proper boyfriend.&quot; (I think the word that best describes my entire sex life with Simon is negligible. He was a far from ardent lover - he seemed to enjoy waffling about Minn and Bubl more than actually doing anything. And whereas my games mistress was always bellowing across the changing room, &quot;But you said it was your period last week!&quot;, Simon always took my word for it when I said that Minn was &quot;indisposed&quot;.) The affair - if it was an affair - drifted on, partly because no proper boyfriends showed up, partly because I had become used to my strange double life of schoolgirl swot during the week, restaurant-going, foreign-travelling sophisticate at weekends. And this life had alienated me from my schoolfriends: if they said, &quot;Are you coming to Eel Pie Jazz Club on Saturday?&quot;, I would say: &quot;No, I&apos;m going to Paris with Simon.&quot; Of course my friends all clamoured to meet Simon, but I never let them. I was afraid of something - afraid perhaps that they would see through him, see, not the James Bond figure I had depicted, but this rather short, rather ugly, long-faced, splay-footed man who talked in different accents and lied about his age, whose stories didn&apos;t add up.  Because by now - a year into the relationship - I realised that there was a lot I didn&apos;t know about Simon. I knew his cars (he had several Bristols), and the restaurants and clubs he frequented, but I still didn&apos;t know where he lived. He took me to a succession of flats which he said were his, but often they were full of gonks and women&apos;s clothes and he didn&apos;t know where the light switches were. So these were other people&apos;s flats, or sometimes empty flats, in Bayswater, South Kensington, Gloucester Road. He seemed to have a limitless supply of them.  But by now there was a compelling reason for staying with Simon: I was in love. Not with Simon, obviously, but with his business partner, Danny, and his girlfriend, Helen. I loved them both equally. I loved their beauty, I loved their airy flat in Bedford Square where there was a harpsichord in the corner and pre-Raphaelites on the walls. At that time, few people in Britain admired the pre-Raphaelites, but Danny was one of the first, and I eagerly followed. He lent me books on Rossetti and Burne-Jones and Millais, and sometimes flattered me by showing me illustrations in auction catalogues and saying &quot;What do you think? Should I make a bid?&quot; I found it easy to talk to Danny; I could chatter away to him whereas with Simon I only sulked. Helen was a different matter. She drifted around silently, exquisitely, a soulful Burne-Jones damsel half hidden in her cloud of red-gold hair. At first, I was so much in awe of her beauty I could barely speak to her. But gradually I came to realise that her silence was often a cover for not knowing what to say and that actually - I hardly liked to use the word about my goddess - she was thick. I was terrified that one day Danny would find out. And there were sometimes hints from Simon that Danny&apos;s interest in Helen might be waning, that there could be other girlfriends. Knowing this, keeping this secret, made me feel that it was crucial for me to go on seeing Helen, to protect her, because one day, when I was just a little older and more sophisticated, we could be best friends. Simon always refused to talk about business to me (&quot;Oh you don&apos;t want to know about that, Minn&quot;) but Danny had no such inhibitions. He loved telling me funny stories about the seething world of dodgy property dealers - the scams, the auction rings, the way the auctioneers sometimes tried to keep out the &quot;Stamford Hill cowboys&quot; by holding auctions on Yom Kippur or other Jewish holy days, and then the sight of all these Hasidic Jews in mufflers and dark glasses trying to bid without being seen. Or the great scam whereby they sold Judah Binstock a quarter acre of Ealing Common, without him realising that the quarter acre was only two yards wide. Through Danny, I learnt how Peter Rachman had seemingly solved the problem of &quot;stats&quot; - statutory or sitting tenants - who were the bane of 1960s property developers. The law gave them the right to stay in their flats at a fixed rent for life if they wanted - and they had a habit of living an awfully long time. But Rachman had certain robust methods, such as carrying out building works all round them, or taking the roof off, or &quot;putting in the schwartzers&quot; (West Indians) or filling the rest of the house with prostitutes, that made stats eager to move. So I gathered from Danny that the property business in which Simon was involved was not entirely honest. But my first hint of other forms of dishonesty came about 15 months into the relationship when I went to a bookshop on Richmond Green. Simon had taken me there several times to buy me books of Jewish history and the works of Isaac Bashevis Singer - I was glad to have them, though I never read them. But on this occasion, I went alone and the bookdealer, who was normally so friendly, asked: &quot;Where&apos;s your friend?&quot; &quot;What friend?&quot; &quot;Simon Prewalski.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know anyone of that name,&quot; I said truthfully. &quot;Well, whatever he calls himself. Tell him I&apos;m fed up with his bouncing cheques - I&apos;ve reported him to the police.&quot; That evening I said to Simon&quot; &quot;Do you know anyone called Prewalski?&quot; &quot;Yes - my mother, my grandparents, why?&quot; I told him what the book dealer had said. Simon said: &quot;Well don&apos;t go in there again. Or if you do, don&apos;t tell him you&apos;ve seen me. Say we&apos;ve broken up.&quot; &quot;But what did he mean about the bouncing cheques?&quot; &quot;How should I know? Don&apos;t worry about it.&quot; So that was a hint, or more than a hint. But soon there was unmistakable proof. Simon and Danny were buying up a street in Cambridge called Bateman Street, so we often stayed there. One weekend I was moaning - I was always moaning - &quot;I&apos;m bored with Bateman Street&quot;, so we drove out towards Newmarket. At a place called Six Mile Bottom, I saw a thatched cottage with a For Sale sign outside. &quot;Look, how pretty,&quot; I said. &quot;&apos;Why can&apos;t you buy nice places like that, instead of horrible old slums?&quot; &quot;Perhaps we can,&quot; said Simon, so we bounced up to the cottage and an old lady showed us round. I was bored within minutes, but Simon seemed unconscionably interested in the bedroom corridor which he kept revisiting. Then I saw him going out to the car, carrying something. Eventually we left and went for lunch at a hotel in Newmarket. We were having a rather lugubrious meal when two men came into the dining room and one pointed the other towards our table. The man introduced himself as a detective. He said: &quot;We&apos;ve had a complaint from a Mrs so and so of Six Mile Bottom. She says a couple visited her cottage this morning and afterwards she noticed that a valuable antique map by Speed was missing from one of the bedrooms.&quot; &quot;Oh, Simon!&quot; I said. He shot me a look. &quot;Perhaps we could have this conversation outside,&quot; he suggested. He went outside with the policeman. I waited a few minutes and then went to the Ladies, and out the back door and away down the street. I had just enough money for a train back to London. I hoped Simon would go to prison. He didn&apos;t of course; he bounced round to Clifden Road a few days later and took me out to dinner. &quot;How could you steal from an old lady?&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t steal. She asked me to have the map valued.&quot;  &quot;No she didn&apos;t - I was with you.&quot; &quot;All right, she didn&apos;t ask me. But I recognised that the map was by Speed and I thought if I got it valued for her, it would be a nice surprise.&quot; I knew he was lying, but I let it go. I said: &quot;If you ever really stole something, I would leave you.&quot; He said: &quot;I know you would, Minn.&quot; But actually I knew he had stolen something and I didn&apos;t leave him, so we were both lying. When I did try to leave him a few weeks later, it was not out of moral outrage but because I was bored. I was bored with Minn and Bubl, I was bored with the endless driving round, the waiting while he ran his mysterious errands, the long heavy meals in restaurants, the tussles in strange bedrooms, the fact that we never met anyone except Danny and Helen. I told Simon: &quot;We&apos;re finished - I&apos;ve got to concentrate on my A-levels.&quot; He said: &quot;We&apos;re not finished. I&apos;ll come for you when you&apos;ve done your A-levels.&quot; On the evening after my last A-level, Simon took me out to dinner and proposed. I had wanted him to propose, as proof of my power, but I had absolutely no intention of accepting because of course I was going to Oxford. Eighteen years of my life had been dedicated to this end, so it was quite impertinent of him to suggest my giving it up. I relayed the news to my parents the next morning as a great joke - &quot;Guess what? Simon proposed! He wants me to marry him this summer!&quot; To my complete disbelief, my father said, &quot;Why not?&quot; Why not? Had he suddenly gone demented? &quot;Because then I couldn&apos;t go to Oxford.&quot; My father said: &quot;Well - is that the end of the world? Look,&quot; he went on, &quot;you&apos;ve been going out with him for two years; he&apos;s obviously serious, he&apos;s a good man; don&apos;t mess him around.&quot; I turned to my mother incredulously but she shook her head. &quot;You don&apos;t need to go to university if you&apos;ve got a good husband.&quot; This was 1962, well before the advent of feminism. But even so, I felt a sense of utter betrayal, as if I&apos;d spent 18 years in a convent and then the Mother Superior had said: &quot;Of course, you know, God doesn&apos;t exist.&quot; I couldn&apos;t believe my parents could abandon the idea of Oxford. But apparently they could and over the next few days they argued it every mealtime - good husbands don&apos;t grow on trees, you&apos;re lucky to get this one (&quot;And you not even in the family way!&quot;), why go to university if you don&apos;t need to? Simon meanwhile was taking me to see houses, asking where I wanted to live when we were married. I couldn&apos;t resist telling my schoolfriends: &quot;I&apos;m engaged!&quot; And they were all wildly excited and thrilled for me, and said &quot;You&apos;ll never have to do Latin again!&quot; Even so, I was queasy - I&apos;d always liked the sound of Oxford, I even liked writing essays, I wasn&apos;t so keen to give up the idea. Events overtook me in the last few days of term. Miss R Garwood Scott the headmistress somehow got wind of my engagement and summoned me to see her. Was it true I was engaged? Yes, I said, but I would still like to take the Oxford exams. She was ruthless. I could not return to school (in those days you had to stay for an extra term to do Oxbridge entrance) if I was getting married. When was the wedding and which church would it be in? Not in church, I said, because my fianc\u00e9 was Jewish. Jewish! She looked aghast - &quot;Don&apos;t you realise that the Jews killed Our Lord?&quot; I stared at her. &quot;So I won&apos;t take the Oxford exams,&quot; I said. My little gang was waiting for me outside her study. &quot;I told her I was leaving,&quot; I announced. &quot;She tried to persuade me to stay but I refused.&quot; They all congratulated me and begged to be bridesmaids. Then I went to the bogs and cried my eyes out. I told my parents: &quot;I&apos;m not going to Oxford, I&apos;m marrying Simon.&quot; &quot;Oh good!&quot; they said. &quot;Wonderful.&quot; When Simon came that evening, they made lots of happy jokes about not losing a daughter but gaining a son. Simon chuckled and waved his hands about, poured drinks and proposed toasts - but I caught the flash of panic in his eyes. A few days later, probably no more than a week later, we were in the Bristol on our way to dinner when he said he just needed to pop into one of his flats. Fine, I said, I&apos;ll wait in the car. As soon as he went inside the house, I opened the glove compartment and started going through the letters and bills he kept in there. It was something I could have done on any one of a hundred occasions before - I knew he kept correspondence in the glove compartment, I knew the glove compartment was unlocked, I was often waiting in the car alone and had no scruples about reading other people&apos;s letters. So why had I never done it before? And why did it seem the most obvious thing in the world to do now? Anyway the result was instantaneous. There were a dozen or more letters addressed to Simon Goldman, with a Twickenham address. And two addressed to Mr and Mrs Simon Goldman with the same address. I behaved quite normally that evening though at the end, when he asked if Minn would welcome a visit from Bubl, I replied smoothly that she was indisposed. By that stage, I was at least as good a liar as Simon. As soon as I got home, I looked in the phone book - and why had I never thought of doing that before? - and sure enough found an S Goldman with a Popesgrove (Twickenham) number, and the address I&apos;d seen on the letters. It was only about half a mile from my house, I actually passed it every day on the bus to school. I spent the night plotting and rehearsing what I would say, working out scripts for all eventualities. When I finally rang the number the next morning, it was all over in seconds. A woman answered. &quot;Mrs Goldman?&quot; I said. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m ringing about the Bristol your husband advertised for sale.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;is he selling it? He&apos;s not here now but he&apos;s usually back about six.&quot; That was enough or more than enough - I could hear a child crying in the background. I took the train to Waterloo, and walked all the way to Bedford Square. Helen was in, and guessed as soon as she saw me - &quot;You&apos;ve found out?&quot; Yes, I said - &quot;It&apos;s not just that he&apos;s married - he lives with her. And there&apos;s a child.&quot; &quot;Two, actually.&quot; &quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m sorry. I wanted to. The other night when you said you were engaged, I told Danny we must tell you, but he said Simon would never forgive us.&quot; This was - what? - my third, fourth, fifth betrayal by adults? And I had really thought Helen was my friend. &quot;What was Simon planning to do?&quot; I asked her. &quot;Commit bigamy?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; she said soberly. &quot;That&apos;s exactly what he intended to do. He felt he&apos;d lose you if he didn&apos;t. He loves you very much you know.&quot; I went home and raged at my parents - &quot;You did this. You made me go out with him, you made me get engaged.&quot; My parents were white with shock - unlike me, they had no inkling before that Simon was dishonest. My mother cried. When Simon came that evening, my father went to the door and tried to punch him. I heard him shouting, &quot;You&apos;ve ruined her life!&quot; From my bedroom window, I saw Simon sitting in the Bristol outside with his shoulders shaking. Then my father strode down the front path and kicked the car as hard as he could, and Simon drove away. I found the sight of my father kicking the car hilarious and wanted to shout out of the window, &quot;Scratch it, Dad! Scratch the bodywork - that&apos;ll really upset him!&apos; It was a strange summer. My parents were grieving and still in deep shock. I, the less deceived, was faking far more sorrow than I felt. After all, I never loved Simon whereas I think perhaps they did. I stayed in my room playing Cesar Franck&apos;s Symphony in D Minor very loudly day after day. My main emotion was rage, followed by puzzlement about what to do next. I had no plans for the summer or - now - for the rest of my life. When my A-level results came, I not only got the top marks I fully expected in English and French, but also - mirabile dictu - top marks in Latin. I slapped the letter on the breakfast table and said, &quot;You see? I could have gone to Oxford.&quot; My father took the day off work, probably for the first time in his life, and went to see Miss R Garwood Scott. God knows what humble pie he had to eat - and he hated humble pie - but he came back with a grim face and a huge concession. She had agreed I could be entered for the Oxford exams as a Lady Eleanor Holles pupil, and I could sit the exams at school. But she was adamant that I could not attend the school - it was up to him to arrange private tutorials. Mum and Dad talked far into the night about how they would find a tutor, and how they would pay. A day or two later - presumably at Miss R Garwood Scott&apos;s instigation - one of my English teachers rang and volunteered to be my tutor. So I spent that autumn writing essays and going to tutorials, working hard and feeling lonely. My parents were in such deep grief that mealtimes were silent. Once or twice I saw the Bristol parked at the end of the street, but I was never remotely tempted to go to it. I sat the Oxford exams, I went for interviews, I was accepted at St Anne&apos;s. In my second term at Oxford, one of the nuns at the convent where I boarded handed me a note which she said a man had brought. It said &quot;Bubl respectfully requests the pleasure of the company of Minn for dinner at the Randolph Hotel tonight at 8.&quot; I tore it up in front of the nun. &quot;Don&apos;t ever let that man in,&quot; I told her. &quot;He&apos;s a con-man.&quot; I went round to Merton to tell my boyfriend, Dick, and he said, &quot;Well, I&apos;d like to meet him - let&apos;s go to the Randolph.&quot; So we did. Simon was sitting in the lobby - on time, for once in his life - looking older, tireder, seedier than I remembered. His face lit up when he saw me and fell when I said, &quot;This is my boyfriend, Dick.&quot; Simon said politely, &quot;Won&apos;t you please both stay to dinner as my guests?&quot; &quot;How are you going to pay for it?&quot; I snapped and Dick looked at me with horror - he had never heard me use that tone before. Simon silently withdrew a large roll of banknotes from his pocket and I nodded, OK. Dick was enchanted by Simon. He loved his Israeli kibbutz stories, his fishing with dynamite stories, his Molotov cocktail stories. I had heard them all before and sulked throughout the meal. As Dick walked me back to my convent, he said, &quot;I see why you were taken in by him - he is quite a charmer, isn&apos;t he?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I said furiously, &quot;he&apos;s a disgusting criminal con-man and don&apos;t you dare say you like him!&quot; Was Simon a con-man? Well, he was a liar and a thief who used charm as his jemmy to break into my parents&apos; house and steal their most treasured possession, which was me. Of course Oxford, and time, would have stolen me away eventually, but Simon made it happen almost overnight. Until our &quot;engagement&quot;, I&apos;d thought my parents were ignorant about many things (fashion, for instance, and existentialism, and why Jane Austen was better than Georgette Heyer) but I accepted their moral authority unquestioningly. So when they casually dropped the educational evangelism they&apos;d sold me for 18 years and told me I should skip Oxford to marry Simon, I thought, &quot;I&apos;m never going to take your advice about anything ever again.&quot; And when he turned out to be married, it was as if, tacitly, they concurred. From then on, whenever I told them my plans, their only response was a penitent &quot;You know best&quot;. What did I get from Simon? An education - the thing my parents always wanted me to have. I learned a lot in my two years with Simon. I learned about expensive restaurants and luxury hotels and foreign travel, I learned about antiques and Bergman films and classical music. All this was useful when I went to Oxford - I could read a menu, I could recognise a fingerbowl, I could follow an opera, I was not a complete hick. But actually there was a much bigger bonus than that. My experience with Simon entirely cured my craving for sophistication. By the time I got to Oxford, I wanted nothing more than to meet kind, decent, straightforward boys my own age, no matter if they were gauche or virgins. I would marry one eventually and stay married all my life and for that, I suppose, I have Simon to thank.  But there were other lessons Simon taught me that I regret learning. I learned not to trust people; I learned not to believe what they say but to watch what they do; I learned to suspect that anyone and everyone is capable of &quot;living a lie&quot;. I came to believe that other people - even when you think you know them well - are ultimately unknowable. Learning all this was a good basis for my subsequent career as an interviewer, but not, I think, for life. It made me too wary, too cautious, too ungiving. I was damaged by my education.

Books How to Improve Your Man in Bed, The Heyday of Natural History, Mostly Men, and Demon Barber Turning point In 1986, when interviewing her ex-employers Bob Guccione and Kathy Keeton, she decided to write for the first time in the first person: &quot;I felt I&apos;d finally found my voice. I never believed in &apos;objective&apos; interviews anyway - if there are two people in the room, you can&apos;t pretend the interviewee is talking into space.&quot;  Personal life Married David in 1971, with whom she had two children, Rosie and Theo. Hobbies Gossip, lunch, birdwatching, contemporary art. How my young love story was turned into a film When a version of this story first appeared in Granta, a young woman called Amanda Posey said she&apos;d like to buy the film rights and said she had a screenwriter in mind. I thought she was mad, but the screenwriter turned out to be her then boyfriend, now husband, Nick Hornby and they spent literally years honing the script and finding backers till it finally went into production last year. Amanda asked if I&apos;d like to watch some of the filming, and said I should come to the Japanese School, Acton, to watch one of the classroom scenes. Only as I was driving there did I think: why on earth would they film my story in a Japanese school and why is there a Japanese school in Acton anyway? And at that point I registered the date - 1 April - and decided I must have been the victim of an April Fool. But no - the Japanese school was there and in fact turned out to be the old Haberdashers&apos; Aske&apos;s girls&apos; school which we used to play at lacrosse. It was so eerily like my old school, Lady Eleanor Holles, that I kept looking at the school photos in the corridors to see if I could see myself in them. And entering the classroom was a real madeleine moment because it even smelt like my old classroom. I met the Danish director, Lone Scherfig, and Carey Mulligan who plays me in the film, and was knocked out by the brilliance of the acting and the incredible care and authenticity that had gone into getting the period detail right. I saw an early rough cut of the film last summer and the finished version at Christmas. It comes out at the end of October and I firmly believe it will be a hit. Carey Mulligan is amazing - when the film was shown at Sundance earlier this year (and won the audience prize) all the critics hailed her as a star. But the other actors are great too - Peter Sarsgaard as my dodgy boyfriend, Rosamund Pike and Dominic Cooper as Helen and Danny, Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour as my parents, Emma Thompson as my hated headmistress, Olivia Williams as the good teacher who saved me. Of course I now routinely refer to it as &quot;my&quot; film and have almost convinced myself that I not only wrote it but produced and directed it - but anyway huge thanks to Nick Hornby, Amanda Posey, Finola Dwyer, and Lone Scherfig for making such a good job of it. And if anyone wants to believe that I was as pretty as Carey Mulligan when I was l6, by all means go ahead.", "sentences": ["We shared a room, of course, and shared a bed, but Simon only kissed me and said: &quot;Save it till you&apos;re 17.&quot; After that, there were many more weekends - Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges, and often Sark in the Channel Islands, because Simon liked the hotel there, and I liked stocking up on my exciting new discovery, Sobranie Black Russian cigarettes."], "title": "Lynn Barber on her liaison as a 16-year-old with an older man", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jun/07/lynn-barber-virginity-relationships", "tags": ["Culture", "Relationships", "Life and style", "Carey Mulligan", "Rosamund Pike", "Sexuality"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-06-08T11:12:46Z", "article": "The headlines on Friday morning in Amsterdam looked not unlike those in the international press around the world: &quot;Far right wins big in Holland&quot;.

Yet no matter how big the font or how many exclamation points they use, the power of the far-right voters in the Netherlands is not the only development in 2009. What failed to get much more than a two-line afterthought in all these reports over the weekend is that the Freedom party (PVV) was not the only party to have made gains for the Dutch. Among them, the D66, a progressive-liberal party that has historically championed issues like gay marriage, euthanasia, legalised prostitution and the decriminalisation of drugs, also gained seats. While the PVV leapt from zero to four seats, the most pro-European party in the Netherlands went from one to three seats. According to the party&apos;s platform, it favours a federal Europe, with more co-operation in regards to the environment, immigration and foreign policy. A far cry from a PVV that wants the Dutch to reduce the amount of money and resources the country dedicates to the European Union. With more modest gains than either the PVV or the D66, little recognition has been given in the international press to the Groen-Links (Green Left) party, which also made gains in this election. The party will now have a total of three seats in Brussels. Once again, the news about steady growth by a pro-European party from the Netherlands which favoured the European constitution and more co-operation on issues like climate change, immigration, and peacekeeping is overshadowed by the story of the far right. The Freedom party and its leader, Geert Wilders, are the best game in town when it comes to tapping into a significant amount of Dutch fear when it comes to hanging on to the prosperity many of its citizens have experienced over the past decades. Ironically much of that money has come from business done outside of the Netherlands, through their savvy business sense and successful brand names recognised throughout Europe and the world. The party is also good at building on fears or ignorance regarding Moroccan and Turkish immigrants, two groups without whom the Netherlands could never have achieved its economic prosperity over the course of more than three decades. They throw around terms like &quot;the Islamisation of the Netherlands&quot; in hopes that the combination of terms will scare up and mobilise more voters. They also benefit from the soundbite culture of today&apos;s mainstream media, for which the term makes a fine headline. Clearly both these tactics have helped them make big gains. While it might grab headlines and turn some heads, the story does not end there. If you want the complete story, it should be stated that a pair of progressive pro-European parties are also on the rise. And in a country where far-right parties rise and fall flat on their faces in only a few years, these parties have a well-established tradition of not only winning seats, but also of developing successful policy. Beyond that, unlike Wilders, they will actually go to Brussels and represent their constituency.", "sentences": ["The headlines on Friday morning in Amsterdam looked not unlike those in the international press around the world: &quot;Far right wins big in Holland&quot;."], "title": "Europe votes: Dutch courage in Europe | Mark Fonseca Rendeiro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/08/geert-wilders-netherlands-europe", "tags": ["Netherlands", "European elections", "The far right", "World news", "Geert Wilders", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-06-10T08:30:05Z", "article": "Tax return.

He&apos;d been telling me about his stomach cancer, how he could barely walk, and was working only to pay for his funeral. But when he saw Europa, he leapt out, danced a jig on the quayside and insisted on carrying my bags on board, just to get a closer look.  She was incredible. A gleaming white barque with sails furled on three masts, a vast deck where countless ropes sat neatly coiled around wooden pegs, and a big wooden wheel. Downstairs, a wood-panelled cabin had dining areas and bunks for 50 people.  She was the sort of ship you see in films or imagine in novels - it was hard to believe that any old landlubber can book a voyage on board.  Europa was, for me, just part of a much longer, three-month journey. As a passionate beer lover, I wanted to recreate the semi-mythical voyage of India Pale Ale (IPA), the greatest beer ever brewed. But no ship had attempted this 18,000-mile voyage for almost 150 years.  Before the Suez Canal opened in 1869, the old East Indiamen ships that took IPA from England to India had no choice but to cross the Atlantic via the Canaries, veering as far west as Brazil (due to trade winds), round the Cape of Good Hope, up the east coast of Africa and across the Indian Ocean.  Travel agencies specialising in sea voyages told me the route was impossible to reproduce, but I managed to piece together an approximate recreation, with a 20-litre barrel of beer in tow. It comprised journeys by barge, cruise container ships - and Europa, a century-old tall ship that seemed to capture the romance of great sea voyages. The only way I could get around the Cape was to take a container ship from Rio de Janeiro. To get to Brazil, I boarded Europa in Tenerife, where she began a long voyage to the Antarctic.  I was one of 25 &quot;trainee crew&quot; - holidaymakers who loved the sea, and fancied taking time out of the world for a few weeks. I didn&apos;t know the first thing about sailing. I didn&apos;t even know whether I&apos;d be seasick. But after some rudimentary safety training, we dropped our lines and were away. Our route would take us via Cape Verde, through the Doldrums and across the equator, carried by the same trade winds that took early European explorers to India on the spice route. We set off south, Tenerife to our starboard side and the distant shadow of Gran Canaria off to port. As I watched planes descend towards Tenerife airport, it felt like we were already on an adventure few 21st century holidaymakers could imagine. After the first day, land disappeared and we were alone in the middle of a giant disk seemingly made of beaten silver.  We were organised into three watches - four hours on, eight hours off - rotating through day and night. My first duty was to take the helm. We took our shifts in pairs, standing either side of the wheel with a view of the whole ship before us, watching others perform minor repairs - or work on their tans.  Steering wasn&apos;t easy at first. The captain gave us a bearing, and it was simply a question of sticking to it. But when my concentration slipped - easy when dolphins or whales appeared - or the wind dropped, the ship started to lollop from side to side and lose speed.  When I got it right, the interplay between helm, sails, wind and waves made me feel part of the ship, and soon I was channelling the spirit of Jack Sparrow, grinning with the wind in my hair and a song on my lips. Mealtimes were the main social events, and the well-stocked galley was supplemented by the occasional barracuda caught from the back of the ship, landed and gutted by Captain Klaas, served marinated with salad.  Dog Watch - the midnight shift - quickly became my favourite. While most of the crew slept below, I watched phosphorescence light up our wake, flying fish strobing off the bows in the moonlight, the wind thrumming through the rigging like a Gregorian chant. I realised I had never properly seen the Milky Way before; a thick, creamy swathe down the middle of the sky, crossed by shooting stars. After six days we reached Cape Verde and went ashore for the evening at Mindelo, the largest settlement on the island of S\u00e3o Vicente. It had a deserted air, but we drank the town dry of beer and were giddy to be back on land, even if it appeared to be made from compacted cigarette ash and ruled by flies.  A week later we crossed the equator. Maritime tradition dictates that any sailor doing so for the first time is subjected to ducking and shaving. We trainees had to perform humiliating forfeits, bathe in three weeks&apos; worth of left-over food then be blasted with a high-pressure sea water hose. Finally, three weeks after leaving Tenerife, we spotted land poking up from the horizon, and as the sun set the lights of Salvador, Brazil&apos;s oldest city, came into view. The smell of the coast - seaweed, fuel and a hint of sewage - announced that our journey was almost over.  As we put on shoes and socks for the first time in weeks and lugged our bags into the dinghy to go ashore, some of the permanent crew were clearly unhappy at being close to land again.  At first we too felt a little freaked out by the noise and activity of Salvador. But it&apos;s such a great party city it didn&apos;t take us long to adjust. I was less than half-way through my three-month journey. I had near misses with pirates and gun-wielding Iranian guards ahead of me. But since coming home and attempting to live a landlubber&apos;s routine, there&apos;s not a day when I haven&apos;t longed for the Europa.

Conceivable answers get dreamed up every few years. Myths, all of them, insofar as no one can ever know for certain.  Here&apos;s a cue for such a myth. In the 1990s, archaeologists began excavating the Blombos cave on South Africa&apos;s Cape coast, a site occupied by Homo sapiens at least 75,000 years ago. There they found two hand-sized blocks of iron oxide inscribed with tidy cross-hatched grids. These have been hailed as the earliest records of humans making symbolic markings. In fact, however, the type of object chosen for these patternings has been found repeatedly at sites that long predate Blombos. Hominins, even before the emergence of our own species, had a habit of collecting lumps of soft, smeary ochre. Why? For no other reason, seemingly, than that they were red, and that they made whatever they touched red.  &quot;Any universality in the experience of colour is an illusion,&quot; claims Ann Temkin, the curator of the Colour Chart exhibition that has recently opened at Tate Liverpool. Citing anthropological studies, she explains that some other languages fail - bizarrely, you might think - to distinguish between the experiences that English identifies as &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot;. But she exaggerates. All known languages agree in finding a distinctive term for the spectrum&apos;s longest wavelengths, those thrust at us by blood and fire. Red is for sound reasons the most powerful of chromatic cues for attention. It makes sense to think of it as the starting point from which human colour consciousness gradually expanded.  Surely it follows that red, in mineral form, was the natural raw material for our earliest schemes of visual symbolism? At the least, the proto-artists would have picked up the chunks of ochre because they stood out from their environs. They were earth that was not wholly earthlike: small, dense, potent events holding their own against the landscape&apos;s otherwise unremarkable continuities, its blues, yellows, greens and greys. For not everything in visual experience is equally imbued with colour. If we consider that something&apos;s coloured, we demarcate it, we isolate it. We treat it as a special event for the eyes. Take that demand for visual stimulation; take the urge to inscribe a symbolism within the stuff of colour; and fastforward them, through the long history of pigment and metal and glass technology, to ... the early 1960s. On the rise of Liverpool&apos;s Mount Pleasant, the city&apos;s Metropolitan Cathedral looks down over the docks a mile away where the Tate has more recently made its home. Look up and around as you enter its celebrated conical concrete &quot;wigwam&quot; - designed and built within five years from 1962 - and you get drawn into one of 20th-century Britain&apos;s grandest colour experiences. John Piper and the stained-glass master Patrick Reyntiens got to glaze the interstices where the structure&apos;s 16 big trusses straddle the chapels beneath, and they were given free rein with the great central lantern tower that the trusses rise towards. The arch fills douse you in a deep yet sunlight-suffused azure, washing away whatever mental residues you have brought in from the street, before you raise your eyes to the lofty cylinder of light-flakes that coalesce here around red, there around blue, there yellow. No figures disfigure Piper&apos;s and Reyntiens&apos; designs. It&apos;s not surprising, though, that their thoughts were set on the Trinity as they made that lantern, and that the shots of red specking the blue below were conceived as pentecostal tongues of fire.  Piper first hit the British scene as an avant-gardist in touch with the continental modernism of the 1930s, but within a short time he became known as an inspired reinterpreter of the nation&apos;s old traditions: he&apos;s one of those figures who seem to have steered this island&apos;s visual history on a whole other course to art overseas. The artists in Colour Chart are mostly American or mainland European, and light years might seem to separate their frames of reference from those brought to bear on the glazing of the cathedral. But Colour Chart is just one facet of a debate about colour - a counter-argument, in fact - and the cathedral is its nearest effective foil. The cathedral shows how colour can detatch us from our normal environs, sucking attention into a special, strange zone. An inward zone, a thoughtlike zone, one suited to symbolic ordering - whether by theology or by optical science. Such is the modernism of the lantern tower, where the three primaries unite in a single rotation. It&apos;s echoed in various display cases at the Tate. You can find a colour-trinity diagram by Turner, Kandinsky&apos;s mystical manifesto On the Spiritual in Art and the dedicated researches of the Bauhaus&apos;s Josef Albers, published in Interaction of Color; also, a mini-analogue to the cathedral in the form of an &quot;Ostwald Double Cone&quot;, a slatted spinning top co-ordinating all Winsor &amp; Newton&apos;s colour samples in a dainty totality, circa 1930. But these exhibits skulk obscurely amid a busy layout of entirely contrary projects brought over from MoMA in New York, where Temkin first staged the show last year.  Temkin&apos;s thesis is punchy, and it dovetails with many another American account of how modernism changed course or maybe came to an end. As of the early 1960s, while Piper was working on his maquettes for Liverpool&apos;s cathedral, all those doctrines that colour could deliver &quot;inner experience&quot;, &quot;spiritual value&quot; and &quot;harmonious interrelation&quot; were coming to sound like banalities. For artists such as Frank Stella, Andy Warhol or Gerhard Richter, they were no more than the bleatings of a pass\u00e9 expressionism, a sentimental clinging to subjectivity. And to strike a distance from such clich\u00e9s, what format could be more apt than the sample sheet that lends the show its name? Compact slabs of paint-company product-lines set out in a grid - preferably with their order randomised; preferably not fine oils from Winsor &amp; Newton, but rather house and car paints. Such a decisive way both to bring colour down to ground, away from airy spiritualities, and to bring it up to date, in an entirely artificial environment. To declare that it was quite simply a set of material facts in a commercial world, not to be mistaken for a ticket to transcendence. The gambit had first been essayed (like so many others) by Duchamp; next Ellsworth Kelly, then Rauschenberg; during the course of the 1960s, it captivated artist after artist, duly becoming a clich\u00e9 in its own right.  One way to read Colour Chart is as the traces of a late-20th-century mania - the zany, obsessional methodologies that artists embraced in their zeal to have done with self-expression. Richter resolutely laying down his chart of 4096 Colours is far exceeded by On Kawara, who each day for more than 40 years has lettered the date on a new canvas covered with a new blend of acrylic. The rigorous shades into the ridiculous with Fran\u00e7ois Morellet in 1962 getting his family to read him every number in the phone book: if it was odd, he painted a little square of scarlet; if even, cobalt - he had 40,000 squares to fill. And the ridiculous into the rueful, as Bas Jan Ader filmed himself in 1974 uncertainly shuffling red, blue and yellow carnations, by way of a backhanded homage to the colour schemes of his fellow countryman Mondrian. That video&apos;s sense of sad d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu settles in as the keynote of so many subsequent postmodernist projects, down to Damien Hirst&apos;s insistently derivative spot paintings.  Alternatively, you could relate the show to a longstanding culture clash. These artists&apos; interpretations of the world are frenetically urban. Amid their lime and olive sample-squares, their viridian car enamel and their baize, you never get to glimpse the greens of open country. The residents most at home in the crammed and jangly hang are two recent British arrivals settled on the floor: Jim Lambie with his trademark jazzy blare of tape-strips and David Batchelor with his recyclings of inner-London detritus. The overall accent of Temkin&apos;s project, however, surely comes from Manhattan. Here&apos;s an ultra-sharp downtown gang, she seems to propose, keen to show those woozy chromatic romantics the door. Lush Howard Hodgkin, pretty land art, even the refined reasonings of Bridget Riley - all hicks, all nowhere! Art history has been round this block various times before. In the 17th century, just as refined Poussin in Rome was prodding painting towards music theory, talking of colour &quot;harmonies&quot; and colour &quot;modes&quot;, the no-nonsense Amsterdam art pundit Samuel van Hoogstraten was slating painters who &quot;acquire a manner of colouring, as things were bound to their manner of painting rather than their manner of painting being bound to the nature of things&quot;. Get out to the market, Hoogstraten advised, bring back fresh fruit and flowers to your studio. &quot;You will find colours no painter ever put to work.&quot;  Nowadays, the goods in the anti-idealist&apos;s shopping basket no longer come from the fields. Yet, in a sense, the Asian-American Byron Kim has carried on where the Dutch still-lifers left off. His own colour chart, painted in oils in 1991, consists of 265 panels, 10in x 8in - brownish, pinkish, yellowish. Each records, as faithfully as possible, the colour of a certain individual&apos;s skin. The mania of this particular project started to worry its executant: staring at each subject&apos;s arm to find its local colour, he began &quot;wondering whether local colour was what I was after, after all ... What is the right colour? Is there any meaning in it?&quot; Is there any meaning in colour? Well, patches of colour are holes the mind would like to fill somehow. With identity: just as each of those panels pertains to a certain person, you can go round the exhibition savouring the chromatic individuality of some 40 different sensibilities, from disarming Warhol to the austere Blinky Palermo. With wonder: next to Palermo&apos;s minimalistic fabric stitchings from 1970 hangs a majestic late piece by Donald Judd, a bold-hued metal-box construction that magically enhances the quality of your focus on colour and on form. Is the nearby exhibit dedicated to &quot;Don Judd, colourist&quot; - five upright fluorescent T-shapes, created by his friend Dan Flavin - likewise a matter of magic? It inevitably invites the epithets &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;hieratic&quot;. Flavin said he wasn&apos;t too happy to be told that &quot;It&apos;s like going to church.&quot; He would rather hear people trace his neon art back to riding the subway. But, he concluded, &quot;It&apos;s all in there; and I don&apos;t want to sort it out.&quot; It&apos;s &quot;all in there&quot;, insofar as strong colour comes first, and interpretation comes after. The meanings that can be drawn out of the stained glass on the hill cannot, it is true, be drawn out of any of the exhibits down by the river. Even so, the line of thought that runs through Colour Chart can equally be described as mythic. These artists have been driven - often obsessionally - by dreams (or nightmares?) of a perfectly random, perfectly subject-free, totally artificial world. Their urban myths of colour have sometimes been fertile, but after some 60 years the habitual appeal to sales display modes gets to look less terse than turgid. If you really wanted to get some new grip on colour, you&apos;d be thinking green. You&apos;d track pigment to its sources, maybe - the refineries, the opencast mines. Trace it back to the earth.  \u2022 Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour, 1950 to Today is at Tate Liverpool until 13 September.

Or it could be argued otherwise. Mika certainly divides opinion - once calling himself a love-it-or-loathe-it &quot;Marmite artist&quot;. The Guardian&apos;s Alexis Petridis memorably compared listening to his 2007 debut Life in Cartoon Motion to &quot;being held at gunpoint by Bonnie Langford&quot;, which alarmingly led to Brian May of Queen leaping to Mika&apos;s defence with a blog posting. But the record didn&apos;t feel contrived or saccharine to the 5.6 million people around the world who bought it, his audience comprising lots of children and their parents, gay people, a high percentage of women, some worryingly extreme fans and the general public, in general. (In other words, those who are more often than not the early adopters of the best pop.) Fortunately for him, Mika recognises that he has never been cool and his rise was unfashionably swift. His first interview as a fledgling pop star was with this magazine in August 2006 (OMM36) and by the end of last summer, he had toured the world twice over, climaxing with a spectacularly conceived sell-out show to an audience of 55,000 at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris. For his detractors, the bad news is that his second album - the recording of which he started in LA following very little holiday (he went gorge walking and scaled a canyon) - will only increase his ubiquity. Due for release in the autumn, it&apos;s a more mature album, exploring the theme of what it means to be a teenager and alive to endless possibilities, whereas Life in Cartoon Motion was &quot;very much my schoolyard record&quot;. Does that mean it&apos;s a more demanding record? Not exactly, because again, it&apos;s bursting with melodies and sounds dazzlingly carefree. But hidden depths are lurking. It&apos;s worth repeating: Mika is very strange. When I arrive at the studio of producer Greg Wells in Culver City, near Venice Beach, Mika bounds to the door, 6&apos;3&quot;, lithe, wearing a bowler hat, short-sleeved blue shirt, jeans, white plimsolls, no socks and a chunky green fluorescent watch. Most of Life in Cartoon Motion was recorded here, and he is now completing its sequel. He takes me into the small control room, where there is a sign that reads &quot;DO NOT PLAY LOUD, DO NOT HURT MIKA&quot; and where he and Wells are watching the finest horn section for hire in Los Angeles at work on a song called Dr John. It sounds like it could be a single, I say. &quot;No, no, no!&quot; Mika insists. Just out of the line of sight of trumpet player Jerry Hey and his crew, whose credits include Michael Jackson&apos;s Thriller as well as endless Hollywood soundtracks, Mika suggests a change to the part. Wells relays the idea: &quot;Mika&apos;s only comment, with which I wouldn&apos;t disagree ... is can we make it a bit more loose and a bit more playful, and what about doubling that line at the end?&quot; Forty-five minutes in, Mika says: &quot;There&apos;s another part that I&apos;ve always heard in there.&quot; &quot;Well, let&apos;s get it then,&quot; Wells replies. &quot;I don&apos;t want to push them to the end of their tether,&quot; says Mika, fastidiously polite and also consistently conscious of costs. &quot;Don&apos;t worry, they&apos;re very well paid.&quot; So far, so normal, but now he wants a break and, clutching his mug of PG Tips, tries to explain the genesis of the song. &quot;When you&apos;ve had too much to drink and you&apos;re reminded of things you&apos;d rather forget ... I always wished there was this mystical figure I could talk to. I started to call him Dr John. He&apos;s this triangular-shaped, perfect older man with just the right ingredients of madness and humility ... he&apos;s got a big white beard and he&apos;s covered in feathers that he steals from his pet peacock.&quot; Seeing that I look baffled, he adds: &quot;There&apos;s this whole world that goes with my songs.&quot; He leads me back to the small front room, where he has fashioned his own creative environment and where I become even more confused. The slogan &quot;Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months&quot; - taken from Oscar Wilde - is pasted on the wall, beside drawings and pages torn from magazines of the work of celebrated contemporary illustrators such as Richard Sala and Tony Millionaire (plus David McKee, author of Mr Benn and the Elmer the elephant books). A bookshelf includes Daniel J Levitin&apos;s This is Your Brain on Music and a study of Bach, but mostly it&apos;s filled with prewar and 1950s children&apos;s books that Mika has spent upwards of $3,000 collecting. &quot;Visual references are very important to me,&quot; he says with glee. &quot;I write a bit of a song, I&apos;ll do a little drawing, we&apos;ll keep the sketch books, it goes from there ... I indulge in the fact that none of it really makes sense to begin with.&quot; Sitting at a table, working on her own illustrations, is Mika&apos;s eldest sister Yasmine, who works closely with him on the visual aspect of his records and stage shows (under the alias DaWack). There&apos;s a box of cakes that their mum, Joannie, who is staying in Los Angeles for a few days, has just delivered. She makes lots of Mika&apos;s stage clothes. In fact, the longer you hang around with Mika, the more it feels as if the entire Penniman family is involved in this project. While he will say to me, months later, &quot;no one knows what I am and really, I wonder if I do, at the end of the day&quot;, his oddness inevitably relates to his upbringing. Life in Cartoon Motion, with its bubblegum songs such as his UK No 1 Grace Kelly or Love Today or Lollipop, &quot;contained a lot of childhood references&quot;, he says. &quot;The new album is evidently, I think, more adolescent. I wanted to take it to the next place. I thought, &apos;Where do I want to go back to? Before all this happened, what made me start writing songs? What did I want to capture the first time round that I didn&apos;t manage?&apos; Well, I liked that feeling of being 17, 18 years old. I wanted to return to that period. A lot of characters from my first album have grown up and I think the new album contains a lot of contradictions. &quot;It has joy, it has fragility, it&apos;s got a little hint of bitterness - all these things that I felt when I was a teenager,&quot; he will add.  With Mika beside me, the impassive studio engineer cues a series of tracks - Blame it on the Girls, which sounds like Prince in his prime; the Pet Shop Boys-redolent Rain; a full-blown ballad, I See You, and a handful more - any of which might frankly be a hit. &quot;It&apos;s a big, huge-sounding pop record that sonically references big records from the 80s or the 90s,&quot; says Mika. &quot;Yes it&apos;s true.&quot; But lest that sound too calculating, the influences that he really hammers on about are more diverse: Kurt Weill, for instance, or the 50s singer Patti Page, or the 70s singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson. &quot;A review of my first record said I had gone through the best hits of different decades and re-written those songs in a very shrewd way,&quot; he says. &quot;But I couldn&apos;t be insulted because at the time, I hadn&apos;t heard a lot of the acts that they mentioned. People would say &apos;You sound like Roxy Music.&apos; I&apos;d be like, &apos;Great&apos; and then: &apos;Who the fuck is that?&apos; I don&apos;t care because now I know every Roxy Music song that there is to know. I&apos;m a lot more educated now than I was a couple of years ago, but I&apos;m still blissfully ignorant.&quot; He grew up listening to a heterogeneous collection of music - Bob Dylan, Serge Gainsbourg and Lebanese singer Fairuz from his parents, then &quot;pop music in the purest sense of the word, because no matter whether it was a rock song, whether it was a piece of Nina Simone, I could hear the song and I could hear the message in the song and it gave me a certain feeling and it instilled in me this kind of total anti-snobbery. &quot;I used to love Shabba Ranks,&quot; he says, perhaps most surprisingly of all. &quot;I know it&apos;s criminal and snobs will look at me and say who the hell does this guy think he is - he&apos;s making pop music.&quot; Later, there&apos;s a surreal hiatus when celebrated 60s rock photographer Henry Diltz arrives. He leads Mika outside to take pictures for the record label. &quot;With rock bands you normally have to tell a dirty joke to break the ice,&quot; Diltz relates with relish. &quot;I told Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young a joke: &apos;How do you stop a dog from humping your leg?&apos;  &quot;&apos;You pick it up and suck its dick.&apos; And one by one, they all collapsed laughing!&quot; &quot;Oh ...&quot; Mika says, and smiles ruefully. Back in the control booth, he plays me what will be the album&apos;s first single, We Are Golden, which is gloriously epic and a certain No 1. It features the Andrae Crouch Gospel Choir who &quot;refused to sing the line &apos;don&apos;t give it up when you&apos;re young and you want some&apos;,&quot; as Mika tells it. &quot;One of them stopped and turned to me and very slowly said: &apos;You want what? A cheeseburger?&apos;&quot; Which wasn&apos;t what he meant. He burrows down into the theme for me: &quot;I&apos;ve been reading Angela Carter&apos;s The Magic Toyshop&quot; - the late novelist&apos;s 1967 masterpiece, which follows its heroine&apos;s burgeoning sexuality as she lives under the roof of her tyrannical uncle, a toy maker, in south London - &quot;and I&apos;ve been fascinated by that period in someone&apos;s life.&quot; Ah, but he&apos;s different. &quot;Once every 15 years, pop brings along someone who&apos;s involved in the totality of what they do,&quot; says Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Records. &quot;Prince or Freddie Mercury or George Michael: they were great writers and singers and performers, and they were interested in the visual aspect, too. Mika is a classic example of that kind of artist. &quot;Of course,&quot; he adds, &quot;they can be slightly odd people. But their genius is that they communicate that oddness on a mass level.&quot; Later, Mika will slightly rephrase that idea when he wonders aloud: &quot;How do you take a freak and make them a beautiful freak?&quot; Six weeks later, I visit Mika on an early spring day in London; he is a dual British and American national, but calls Kensington home and his flat is in the basement of the family&apos;s grand house. Because he&apos;s still out when I arrive, Yasmine lets me in, and her younger sister Paloma, who is Mika&apos;s stylist, also says hello. The flat has recently been refurbished, and is bright and immaculate, filled with pieces of art that he has collected, including an original Charles Schulz Peanuts drawing, some Tintin statuettes and a Jim Woodring cartoon, as well as a lot of flowers. &quot;But I&apos;m still living out of storage, really,&quot; he says, when he breezes in. He got the flat because his sisters were studying in China for a while &quot;so I did a quick swoop in - when you come from a big family, you learn the art of war and it holds you in good stead for the future&quot;. He has a third sister, Zuleika, and a younger brother, Fortune. &quot;When I tell people I still live here they laugh. In the end, maybe I&apos;ll find somewhere in the countryside, because I want to follow that nice English tradition of pop stars making vegetables and cheese...&quot; Then he recants: &quot;To tell you the truth, that fills me with horror.&quot; The theatre designer Es Devlin, who staged his Parc des Princes concert (and helped art direct his OMM photoshoot), later tells me that I should have snuck upstairs - &quot;because then you would have seen it&apos;s a riot of colour, with different kinds of art everywhere, and you can really see the wealth of influences that he&apos;s had.&quot; Born in Beirut to his Lebanese mother and American businessman father, he left the country as a baby with his family as the civil war escalated. &quot;But if there&apos;s an ounce of Lebanon in your family, it will take over,&quot; Mika says, curled up on his white sofa. &quot;Ours is a Lebanese household: there&apos;s incense burning; you&apos;ll get fed within 10 minutes. &quot;There&apos;s a survival trait, too, and I think that&apos;s what&apos;s odd about me. In Lebanon, there&apos;ll be bombs being thrown, but the restaurants will shut down only when they have to. There&apos;s this mentality that if you&apos;re going to cry, you stand on the table, throw your hands in the air and scream as loudly as you can and you deal with it. I think it&apos;s affected the way I make music: these extremes of emotion.&quot; Following a brief stopover in Cyprus, the family moved to Paris, which is why he is bilingual (and which helps explain why he is especially famous in France). But at the age of nine, and with his father&apos;s business temporarily collapsing, their peripatetic journey led them to London. &quot;Because of the moving around, because of the having a lot and then having nothing and then having a little bit and then having nothing... for one thing, I developed this real fear of money. I have a fear of decadence when it comes to creative things, because I think that things that are really good should never cost a lot of money.  &quot;I really didn&apos;t want the office life of my father. I didn&apos;t want to be rich, I just didn&apos;t want to be afraid. It meant that my sisters and I all turned to the arts. We operated as a unit.&quot; In fact, the whole Mika project can be considered a collective act of artistic creation, which, as Devlin says, &quot;is their way of protecting themselves from the outside world&quot;. But even among his siblings, Mika required particular protection. His memory is hazy, but he left the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle after being bullied and falling out with a teacher. That, compounded by his mild dyslexia, led him to stop talking for a few weeks, and his mother schooled him at home for several months, at which point he began to be privately coached by a Russian teacher as a singer and pianist.  &quot;From the age of about 10, my mum made me practise every day. She was extremely tough with me. I think she knew that I would have a hard time in normal situations, maybe more so than my sisters. She realised that my oddness had some sort of purpose. She realised how I was very insular as a child. Socially extremely insular, but creatively, extremely loud. She realised that for me not to end up completely fucked up, she had to help me. &quot;She won&apos;t speak to you and this is the first time I&apos;ve spoken to anyone about this,&quot; he says, betraying his diffidence. &quot;But I have a very funny relationship with my mother. It&apos;s warts and all, embarrassing as it is.&quot; Even when Mika started at Westminster School, he maintained his performing ambitions, appearing in the 1998 Royal Opera House production of Vaughan Williams&apos;s The Pilgrim&apos;s Progress. &quot;I was quite fearless, which is odd because at school I was timid and shy,&quot; he recalls. &quot;No one knew anything about me at school. I felt I didn&apos;t belong there because I&apos;d been bounced around so much. I never took part in the annual band shows. I knew I would get booed off. Isn&apos;t that ironic?&quot; (He says that now he has a tight circle of friends - and is on good terms with a strange assortment of fellow pop stars, including Kanye West, Adele and Pete Townshend. When I run into him at a fundraising auction for the ICA and at a record label party around this same time in London, he is with Yasmine and his manager and doesn&apos;t hang around for long.) Outside school, he continues, he &quot;was desperate to get as much experience as possible&quot;, which with his mother&apos;s encouragement meant taking jobs singing advertising jingles, trading his fees for studio time to craft his own songs. He was accepted at the London School of Economics to read geography, but dropped out on the first day and enrolled for a brief spell at the Royal College of Music. &quot;I know I&apos;m a shit pianist - one of the worst I&apos;ve ever met who does my job - and a mediocre classical singer. I tried to hide it from my peers at college but I knew what I wanted out of it. I have no delusions of grandeur. I know that I write pop songs, and I know that I am meant to be doing what I am doing because I realised it made me tick as a little boy. I&apos;ve always been incredibly driven.&quot; Such ambition was manifest when he signed with Universal. One executive remembers an early meeting at which Mika cockily explained that he and Yasmine would develop a creative concept for his album&apos;s artwork and he mapped out exactly the first phase of his career. Nonetheless, he insists, &quot;I had no concept of who would listen to my music. I didn&apos;t know how I was going to be perceived, so I created a world for the music to live in.&quot;  Despite its thematic concerns, when Life in Cartoon Motion was released, much of the media attention focused on whether Mika was gay. He acknowledges that the bullying he suffered at school was homophobic and that &quot;I was different. I don&apos;t see myself as being particularly camp but maybe in a boys&apos; school I was.&quot; Previously, however, he has refused to pin down what makes him tick in this respect, and the only time I ever see him angry is when I mention that an interviewer once wrote: &quot;My hunch is he is either asexual or bisexual, even if he himself isn&apos;t yet sure which.&quot; &quot;What does asexual mean? Isn&apos;t that a term reserved for a biology class?&quot; he flashes. But given that the new album deals with his teenage years, he realises that the subject won&apos;t go away. &quot;Well, it all goes hand in hand, doesn&apos;t it? The sexuality thing is really important at that point because you realise it&apos;s part of your personality, and it brings on a terrific sense of opportunity, but it also adds to the rollercoaster ... the fragility of those years. &quot;You know what?&quot; he continues. &quot;With my teenage years there was a lot of &apos;anything is possible. I can try anything.&apos;&quot; The song Dr John on the new record kicks off with Mika singing &quot;I look for love in a strange place, in the back of a bar.&quot;  &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;it wasn&apos;t barbershop love, in a let&apos;s go to the dance, boys on one side, girls on the other and &apos;I&apos;ll buy you a couple of warm pints of Stella.&apos; I was quite shy but there was a bit of a secret life going on. I made a lot of mistakes. There was a lot of very harsh rejection as well in relationships. Or make-believe relationships that had developed in my head. I wasn&apos;t a crazy promiscuous fuck-up, but I was doing things I shouldn&apos;t have been doing, yes, just like any teenager.&quot; For what it&apos;s worth, my hunch is that Mika&apos;s oddness is derived from those earlier formative years, and that of course his mother, whom he tells me now &quot;is a real rock&apos;n&apos;roll mum, she&apos;s hard as nails&quot;, twigged about his secret life. But perhaps he didn&apos;t know that, and I wonder, too, whether the family&apos;s religious values had an impact. (He seems the least keen Catholic of them all - whereas his sisters attend the nearby Brompton Oratory.) He sums up the period: &quot;It was: &apos;Who am I? And what sort of grown-up do I want to be, what kind of person do my parents expect me to be? Who should I sleep with and why should I sleep with those people? Should I be clean? Should I be sober?&apos; &quot;I never really lost myself, because I was able to say &apos;even if I&apos;m not what my parents expect me to be and I&apos;m not their ideal, at least I can create a replacement life for myself in the songs that I write.&apos; They&apos;re happy songs but they&apos;re also a little bit twisted.&quot; It&apos;s the first week of June when I see Mika for a final time, this time in sunny Amsterdam, a city not dissimilar to LA in its promise of cheap fantasies. But rather than in the fleshpots, I find him rehearsing for a show in the small hall of the historic Concertgebouw. In fact, in this baroque setting, with the names of composers circling the dome of the hall, he is standing on a grand piano, wearing a pink T-shirt, hammering away on a rubbish bin for a samba-fied version of Lollipop. &quot;The problem with last night,&quot; he explains to the other four members of the group, &quot;is that you need an element of performance when you&apos;re doing this. We need to look more comical.&quot;  Before the release of the album in September, he has decided to put out an EP, The Songs of Sorrow, of four quirky acoustic songs and tour them around six European cities as a sort of palate-cleaning exercise. That said, the EP is lavishly packaged, with the illustrators whose work he was studying in LA providing the artwork for an accompanying book.  One evening, one of them, Tao Nyeu, visited the studio for a meeting. &quot;A woman once asked me to paint a mural in her house,&quot; she said, shyly. &quot;So this is the second strangest request I&apos;ve had.&quot; Mika talked about how she might turn her whimsical pictures of teddy bears and bunnies into a narrative illustration for his song Lonely Alcoholic. The EP and book are only available as a limited edition of a couple of thousand through Mika&apos;s website (and Paul Smith&apos;s shops - the designer is a fan). &quot;It would have been a huge headache for Universal,&quot; he says, &quot;but it does mean I&apos;ve had to pay all its costs.&quot; The EP tracks represent his more sombre and lyrical side - Toy Boy and Lady Jane, in particular, sounding as he describes them: &quot;They&apos;re strange nursery rhymes... odd morality tales. &quot;When I was writing the first record I made so many allusions to fairy tales and nursery rhymes,&quot; he says later that evening, &quot;and the funny thing is that when you&apos;re 16 you read them again and realise they&apos;re the most violent thing ever. The EP allows me to explore that side. It&apos;s a bit Alan Bennett: you know, after Cinderella gets married, her husband has an affair, they get divorced, he keeps custody of the children, she loses all her money and ends up as a maid again.&quot;  In London, we had talked about how the best pop music often contains dark meanings and Mika had mentioned a book of Paul McCartney&apos;s poetry, in which he discusses writing Blackbird. &quot;When he first wrote it there was a line about &apos;black woman living at Little Rock&apos;, and he meant it as a song about the civil rights movement,&quot; he says. &quot;But he realised that might limit his message, and that if you don&apos;t conceal the darkness but turn the darkness into a kind of code, that empowers your message; so it became a song for freedom instead of a political song. I found that really interesting, and I try to do that sort of thing as much as possible.&quot;  He had cited, too, &quot;very melancholy pop dance music from the 80s&quot; and in particular a song by Bronski Beat, which I take to be Smalltown Boy. &quot;That was one of the records from my adolescence,&quot; he had said wistfully. &quot;When that comes on in a nightclub at five in the morning and you&apos;re standing there... it was like, &apos;I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m supposed to cry or smile or both ... but I&apos;ll dance all the way through it.&apos;&quot; That feels like the clearest image I have of him in those teenage years. Some songs that have made it on to the new album get shown off in Amsterdam, too. Closer listening will in time suggest their concealed meaning: Rain, for instance, features lyrics such as &quot;trying to be ordinary, was it me who was the fool? Thought you found the man you wanted until you turned him into something new ... &quot;, and seems to address a specific heartbreak.  That doesn&apos;t register now, however. The 600 ticket holders just get hooked by its irresistible melody, and likewise with the pop sheen of Blue Eyes and Good Gone Girl. And while the shows were meant to be stripped back, Mika is in fully flamboyant mode for reworked versions of his old hits, including Grace Kelly and Big Girl (You Are Beautiful). It&apos;s a lot of fun. At one point, he explains to the audience - lots of ordinary folk - that his old music teacher from the Royal College would be appalled to see him playing in such a hallowed venue.  Waiting outside afterwards is a gaggle of 100 fans, including two who have dressed up as Lollipop girls, after the song. That sort of dedication is apparently typical of his hardcore followers. On his website, Mika recently started a dialogue with the illustrator Sophie Blackall, who posted a drawing of a girl in an ingeniously designed dress. Last night in Berlin, one fan - a man - turned up dressed exactly as the girl in the drawing. &quot;I don&apos;t know if other artists get that sort of attention,&quot; he says, &quot;because they laugh when I speak to them about it.&quot; Back in his hotel, we have a final drink (he tends to be a lager drinker). None of his sisters are here, although I did catch a tantalising glimpse of his mum earlier. &quot;The shirt and trousers I was wearing: she made those,&quot; he says. I have a final pop at working out his love life, asking whether he&apos;s in a relationship right now. &quot;No,&quot; he laughs. When were you last in a relationship? I ask. &quot;Recently.&quot; What&apos;s the longest relationship you&apos;ve had? &quot;Only one... and it lasted a year.&quot; And that&apos;s the one that recently finished? &quot;Well, not recently. Sadly.&quot; It strikes me that as well as being an amalgam of peculiar influences and neuroses and desires, for all his otherwise overwhelming assurance, he can also be quite fragile. But then hasn&apos;t the same been true of all the biggest male pop stars - Bowie, for instance, or Freddie Mercury (who Mika namechecked on Grace Kelly, lampooning the comparison) or even Michael Jackson; and isn&apos;t it possible that it&apos;s in their rank that Mika might find himself one day, whether he wants it or not? &quot;I make pop music,&quot; he told me at one point, &quot;and I fully embrace the fact that I make pop music. I&apos;m totally unashamed about it. And in as much as in certain circles that puts a certain amount of vulgarity on to me, then I totally embrace that vulgarity. Bring it on. There&apos;s no shame in what I do as far as I&apos;m concerned. So I want the new record to do well, but you can&apos;t write or produce an album with that in mind. It&apos;s not, &apos;Oh, we want to make a hit&apos; - it&apos;s nothing like that, because that brings disaster, it&apos;s &apos;I want it to make me feel happy.&apos; &quot;I want to turn on the CD and feel 16 again and pretend that I&apos;ve got a big Farrah Fawcett wig on my head as I dance round to it.&quot; When his new music hits the airwaves, he will be under an even fiercer spotlight; but it feels as if this further fame will only arrive on his terms. &quot;I started writing music in the first place to experience different emotions and from that point of view absolutely nothing has changed,&quot; he tells me finally. &quot;Where I am now... You know, you wake up, you&apos;ve had a lot of success, what do you do to protect yourself? You make your own little bubble. You do things to make you smile. You live in a weird little world of your own.

The cyclist and YouTuber, called kmcyc, whizzed passed miles of gridlocked traffic and bus queues and nipped in and out of badly driven cars and vans. The film made a hum drum commute into work look like an exhilarating video game, and I wanted a go. Not at the cycling - I&apos;ve been doing that for years - but at filming cycling.  I&apos;m not the only one.  It turns out that making films from the saddle is a serious hobby for some. People go into great detail about how to produce film like this from Amsterdam or this from Osaka without the wobbling. Kmcyc has made dozens of these films highlighting some atrocious driving in London. There was even a bike film festival, featuring cycle-mounted footage, last week in New York.  One of those who submitted a film to the festival was Mike Beauchamp. He designed the &quot;bicycle mounted video camera arm system&quot; in his basement, so he could video himself cycling from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic. Beauchamp goes into impressive but mind-numbing detail about how it was built. But more importantly the device helped to him to produce a 60 minute film, the Cross Canada Project. Here&apos;s a charming trailer:      If you really take cycle filming seriously you&apos;ll have to make one of Beauchamp&apos;s cycle cams or buy an Oregon Scientific ATC3K, which is what kmcyc uses.  I couldn&apos;t afford one, so I borrowed a friend&apos;s Flip camera and bodged it onto my bike with a shelf bracket and some gaffer tape.  It sort of worked, so I filmed part of my journey to work on a stretch of the Regent&apos;s Canal. The film is nauseously wobbly, but it does show the perils of tow path cycling - joggers, dog walkers, drunks, low bridges, and pitbulls.

A couple of quotes from junkets promoting the excellent-looking new Michael Mann crime epic Public Enemies suggest he might be heading back that way \u2013 at least, the prospects for future instalments of the two main franchises which Bale heads up, Batman and Terminator, are looking pretty bleak.  Of the latest instalment of the latter, Salvation, which disappointed at the US box office, taking just $120m from a $200m budget so far, Bale said there had been &quot;no discussions&quot; about a sequel. &quot;It all purely depends upon script,&quot; he said. This stands in stark contrast to reports in the runup to the film&apos;s release last month that suggested that both McG and Bale were locked in for a fifth instalment of the man-versus-the-machines saga. The director also stated he had mapped out the next two films. While Bale&apos;s boorish take on human resistance leader John Connor was largely condemned by the critics, his presence was probably the only thing that stopped the movie disappearing completely at the box office. Frankly it&apos;s doubtful whether the franchise could stand the departure of yet another Connor - three actors have already played him in the Terminator movies (five, if you count various brief incarnations in T2). Without Bale, and even if an ageing Schwarzenegger does return to acting following his stint as governor of California, the franchise looks deader than Robert Patrick after a liquid steel bath. In a separate interview Bale told MTV News, he wasn&apos;t holding out much hope for a sequel to the Dark Knight, either. &quot;I truly don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll ever see another Batman movie,&quot; he said. &quot;[Christopher Nolan] would need to find a story that was good enough. And if he can&apos;t find that, then it won&apos;t happen.&quot; With Warner having reportedly put together a list of replacements for Nolan, Bale was asked if he would return for a third Batman movie without the British director. &quot;I don&apos;t even want to think about it. I don&apos;t know if there will be a third,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, and with grisly timing, Johnny Depp has suggested he would actually be quite up for playing the Riddler in a new Nolan movie. Depp, who stars as Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger in Public Enemies, said the role appealed to him because he loved the performance put in by Frank Gorshin in the original 60s TV series. &quot;It seems that it would be alright,&quot; he said. &quot;I always liked Frank Gorshin. Frank Gorshin was brilliant, I always thought he was a great actor. If the opportunity came, I would definitely juggle it.&quot; At least James Cameron&apos;s forthcoming motion-capture sci-fi spectacular, Avatar, is definitely on its way. For those who haven&apos;t been keeping one eye on the project, and not noticed the barrage of hype, the movie is set during the 22nd century on a small moon called Pandora, which orbits a gas giant, and is inhabited by the tribal Na&apos;vi, 10ft-tall blue humanoids who are peaceful unless attacked. Humans cannot breathe Pandoran air, so they genetically engineer human/Na&apos;vi hybrids known as Avatars that can be controlled via a mental link. Cameron screened 20 minutes of footage at an Amsterdam exhibitor conference called Cinema Expo on Tuesday, to enthusiastic responses, though the various bloggers who reported back have struggled somewhat to convey the magic of the film-maker&apos;s new motion-capture system, which is supposed to be, like, really, really amazing and is being used by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg on their forthcoming Tintin project. &quot;The Avatars of Jake, Norm and Grace explore the jungle of Pandora,&quot; wrote one blogger. &quot;They have their first confrontation with some creatures. Some sort of rhino with a flower sticking out of his head looks like he will kill Jake, but he&apos;s not scared and he lets out a scream. The &apos;rhino&apos; runs away.&quot; Here&apos;s some more: &quot;Jake finds himself alone at night in the jungle with only a torch as protection against some evil-looking dogs ... When one of the &apos;dogs&apos; attacks him, he slams the torch in the creature&apos;s face. A fight ensues that Jake can&apos;t win by himself. Lucky for him, there&apos;s Neytiri (an Avatar) who with her trusty bow and arrow helps Jake chase away the creatures.&quot; All of which doesn&apos;t really sound all that spectacular. But we&apos;re guessing you had to be there. For me, only Pixar/Disney have really got to grips with making all-CGI movies featuring characters that have real personality, and they don&apos;t use motion capture at all. The technology is definitely improving, though \u2013 I witnessed some early footage from Robert Zemeckis&apos;s forthcoming Disney animation A Christmas Carol last week, and it looks like it could be a pretty special take on the Dickens classic.  What do you think? Is it a good thing that Terminator might be on its way to meet the great big robot in the sky? Are you disappointed at the slow pace of development on the Batman front? And is motion capture the future of sci-fi?

He claimed \u00a3238 for the first iPod in October 2005, while the second was claimed in September 2007 at a cost of \u00a3217.36. Both claims included a note pointing out that the devices were purchased in order to test BBC services. Highfield, who left the BBC to run the ill-fated broadband TV joint venture Project Kangaroo in mid-2008, before quitting in November to become managing director of Microsoft UK&apos;s online operation, also claimed for his personal Sky subscription at his home for 2004-05 and 2005-06. In 2005-06 his Sky claims totalled \u00a3636 while the year before he claimed \u00a3792.03. Claims for his Sky subscription stopped after this date. In an explanatory note, the BBC said of his claims for Sky subscriptions: &quot;These subscriptions were paid for where the BBC deemed that they would not in normal circumstances been taken for personal use. This was in order for Mr Highfield to be fully informed about emerging digital and interactive technology.&quot; In total Highfield claimed \u00a347,517.76 in expenses between 2004 and 2009, with his highest being for \u00a314,613.68 in 2006-07. His pay in 2007 was \u00a3466,000. His claims include being reimbursed 54p in mileage following a meeting with Richard Curtis about the charity Comic Relief in September last year. He also claimed the same sum for mileage incurred while hosting a box at the BBC Proms in September 2006. Highfield also claimed \u00a32.50 for coffees for himself and the man who became his successor, Erik Huggers, in October last year, and 90p for mileage for a meeting with director general Mark Thompson at BBC Broadcasting House in September 2006. He also claimed \u00a3787.25 for external hospitality on the night he received his Royal Television Society Fellowship in November 2007. Highfield charged the BBC \u00a3120 for a copy of the 2005 Who&apos;s Who, which he claimed for in January 2005, and for the 2004 edition, which he bought for the same price. In October 2004 he charged the BBC \u00a315 for a copy of the book We The Media. An &quot;Internal MIP staff meal&quot; in April last year cost the BBC \u00a31,512.72, while a stay at the L&apos;Ermitage Hotel in Los Angeles in November 2005 was charged at \u00a3951.98. A departmental away day and Christmas dinner the following month for his team left a bill of \u00a31,090.46, which he claimed in February 2006. In his eight years at the BBC, Highfield was one of the key people behind the corporation&apos;s phenomenally successful iPlayer and oversaw an annual budget of around \u00a3400m. Prior to joining the BBC, Highfield was managing director of interactive services at Flextech, where he launched the online reality show The Dolls&apos; House for its lads&apos; channel, Bravo.

It seemed a daft little story, and when asked to comment here, I did so fairly cynically. The story mushroomed online, in print and on television to become a major news item. The weaknesses of the argument were ignored.  So I want to return to the subject to point out that there is no evidence to confirm this new claim; it is simply a perverse and willful reinterpretation of existing sources, an argument ex silentio, from silence. We are supposed to agree that just because there is no letter in which Van Gogh says to Gauguin &quot;You bastard, you cut off my ear&quot;, the story can still be true. But there is one very good reason to believe that the artist cut off his own ear. Just over 18 months after the injury he suffered in Arles, the mentally troubled Van Gogh shot himself dead. I&apos;m sure no one is doubting that his death was suicide. And if this was the case, he was someone \u2013 by definition \u2013 with a propensity for self-harm. Surely any psychologist would agree this makes it all too likely that he did indeed cut off his own ear, after which he entered an asylum, believing he was a danger to himself. His letters reflect worry over his own inner state, not rage at an attacker.  The Gauguin hypothesis totally lacks the psychological plausibility of the original version. It&apos;s just a publicity stunt, a fabulation, an ingenious construct.  In the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam recently, I walked among crowds of people who inspected Van Gogh&apos;s paintings with passionate engagement. Here, the raw power of the man&apos;s art swoops down on you. You realise not just how great an artist he is, but how enigmatic, how impossible to reduce to biographical tittle-tattle. Would his paintings be any less gripping if we knew nothing at all of his life? As news sources and means of communication proliferate, gossip becomes hard fact faster than ever. But the paintings haven&apos;t changed; they are still there telling their truth.", "sentences": ["In the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam recently, I walked among crowds of people who inspected Van Gogh&apos;s paintings with passionate engagement."], "title": "That nonsense about Gauguin and Van Gogh's ear | Jonathan Jones", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/jun/26/gauguin-van-gogh-ear", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Van Gogh"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-06-26T23:01:00Z", "article": "On my last visit to the Hermitage collection, I could see skaters on the frozen Neva as I peered through the windows of St Petersburg&apos;s Winter Palace. This time around, the water outside is warm and green and canal boats chug past laden with partygoers. This is Amsterdam, a place to have fun. But is it also a place to look at art. The city can boast many amazing museums, including the Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum and an excellent modern art gallery. But its latest and very lavish opening is a big, modern branch of Russia&apos;s most famous art collection - the Hermitage Amsterdam (Amstel 51, 0031 20 530 87 55, hermitage.nl), which opened its doors last weekend. Amsterdam, it must be said, has faced some troubles recently as an art destination. The Rijksmuseum, palatial home to the work of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Peter de Hooch, had to close for massive rebuilding after asbestos was found in its 19th century walls. It has yet to announce a reopening, although a highlights show in its modern wing is excellent (Stadhouderskade 42, 0031 20 674 7047, rijksmuseum.nl). Meanwhile the Stedelijk Museum, which until Tate Modern opened was Europe&apos;s most exciting public collection of modern art, also closed for a renovation.  Russia to the rescue! The Hermitage in St Petersburg is unquestionably one of the world&apos;s great art museums, encompassing the Winter Palace, such incomparable works of art as Matisse&apos;s Dance and Picasso&apos;s Brick Factory at Tortosa, and so much art, so many historic clothes and clocks, that it can easily put on exhibitions abroad and still satisfy its own visitors.  The Hermitage Amsterdam is a brilliant way for Russia to share its collection abroad and a genuinely ambitious venture, on the scale of the American Guggenheim&apos;s worldwide branches. On my trip last week I found a modern museum with all the trimmings: chic bar, two huge shops, children&apos;s wing . . . and, oh yes, a vast suite of exhibition spaces. Its opening effort is all frocks and fancies: an exhibition that recreates court life in St Petersburg on the eve of the revolution. A portrait of the doomed Tsar Nicolas by Ilya Repin holds and haunts you. But why here?  Peter the Great founded St Petersburg in homage to his favourite city, Amsterdam. From the British visitor&apos;s point of view, though, the simple attraction is that it&apos;s easier to reach than the original. Getting to St Petersburg is still not particularly cheap and the Russian border isn&apos;t the most relaxing to cross. Amsterdam is easy, and you can take advantage of one of the many hotels offering packages that include tickets to the museum - among them, the luxurious Dylan, where I stayed, which has boutique rooms in a 17th century building for far less than a visit to Russia would set you back. What else is new to justify Amsterdam&apos;s promotion of itself this year as an &quot;Art City&quot;? There&apos;s a cutting-edge photography scene, for starters. Everyone knows Amsterdam is the city of Rembrandt, but what&apos;s less famous is the fact that it is probably the most clued-up city anywhere when it comes to photography. Amsterdam hosts the World Press Photo awards every spring and overflows all year round with new photographs at galleries such as Reflex (Weteringschans 83, 0031 20 627 2832, reflex-art.nl) and the new Netherlands Media Art Institute (Keizersgracht 264, 0031 20 623 7101, nimk.nl). Our visit to Reflex was particularly memorable. Caught in a shower, we found ourselves explaining its current show of photographs of gun-toting Haitians and masked revellers to our four-year-old daughter. Just strolling around the western Canal district, where our hotel was located on the Keisersgracht, we found among the 17th-century houses the amazing Foam (Keisersgracht 609, 0031 20 551 6500, foam.nl), a superb photography venue where you&apos;re liable to find two or three sensitively selected contemporary shows at once. I was provoked and fascinated by the juxtaposition of disturbing images of African poverty by Guy Tillim on one floor, with sunbleached, hedonistic Italian beach scenes by Massimo Vitali on another. You rarely see photography displayed with such energy in Britain. Amsterdam&apos;s modern art museum, the Stedelijk (stedelijkindestad.nl), has a collection any gallery would envy - its treasures such as Ed Kienholz&apos;s Beanery, a walk-in recreation of a sordid diner that has its beholders gawping, grimacing and grinning, and Jeff Koons&apos;s sculpture of cherubs tending a pig entitled Ushering In Banality, will be displayed in pristine rooms to match Tate Modern&apos;s when it reopens next year. Will continental Europe&apos;s most stimulating modern collection win back its crown? That really would confirm Amsterdam&apos;s title as Art City. On a hard-hat tour, I found myself longing for all its great works to fill the rooms that stand so nearly ready. I couldn&apos;t have toured Amsterdam without taking in the Van Gogh Museum (Paulus Potterstraat 7, 0031 20 570 5200, vangoghmuseum.nl), a justly loved favourite that will unveil its most ambitious ever project this autumn - a completely new illustrated edition of Van Gogh&apos;s letters, in print and online, to be launched with an exhibition here that displays the letters with their intense sketches next to the paintings they discuss (opens 9 October). This museum also has a great cafe, which serves good Provencal specialities such as salade nicoise in honour of Van Gogh&apos;s period in Arles.

The campaign, submitted by Obama for America, has been hailed as a masterful combination of new media, door-to-door and community grass roots campaigning with a clever tactical use of traditional TV advertising. The campaign won two grands prix in the Titanium and Integrated Lions categories. To win the Titanium grand prix, a campaign must involve a breakthrough idea that is &quot;provocative, challenges assumptions and points to a new direction&quot;. &quot;Titanium celebrates work that causes the industry to stop in its tracks and reconsider the way forward,&quot; according to the rules set out by the Cannes organisers. The integrated prize is awarded to a campaign using three or more media \u2013 such as TV, press and the internet - that is &quot;high standard and state-of-the-art&quot;. Earlier in the week, Obama&apos;s campaign manager, David Plouffe, gave a seminar about how the different facets of media were used to deliver the campaign. The Great Schlep, the campaign featuring Sarah Silverman designed to increase Obama&apos;s Jewish support, won a Titanium Lion for agency Droga5. The campaign to boost sales of the Zimbabwean, a newspaper that attacked Robert Mugabe&apos;s regime by using the troubled country&apos;s almost worthless bank notes to make billboard adverts, was awarded a Gold Lion in the Titanium and Integrated Lions category. The campaign, created by the South African agency TBWA/Hunt/Lascaris Johannesburg, previously won the grand prix in the outdoor advertising category. The US presidential campaign also featured in the awards in the Film Lion category. Charles Stone III, the creator of Budweiser&apos;s famous &quot;Wassup&quot; TV ads from 2000, was given the unique award of a special jury commendation. Stone produced a 2008 version, through Los Angeles-based Believe Media, to galvanise support for Obama&apos;s presidential bid. The ad features the formerly happy-go-lucky characters in dire circumstances, such as being posted to Iraq and the stock market crash, since we last saw them in 2000. Under the rules of entry the ad is not eligible for consideration for an official award as only work that has been commissioned by a commercial client can be judged. However, the jury felt that the work could not go unheralded at Cannes. &quot;It was an extraordinary piece of work, as a standalone political statement it is perhaps second to none,&quot; said Bil Bungay, judge and co-founder of UK ad agency Beattie McGuinness Bungay. &quot;It completely captures eight years under president Bush. But we have rules that every work has to be commissioned [by a client] but we felt it was so significant it needed special mention&quot;. In a year of significantly less buzz and expectation around the traditionally high profile battle for the film grand prix one of the UK&apos;s big hopes, ad agency MCBD&apos;s epic &quot;history of Britain&quot; TV ad for Hovis could only manage a bronze lion. T-Mobile&apos;s &quot;dance&quot; TV ad, featuring a flash mob dance in Liverpool Street station, netted a Gold Lion for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Mother London also managed a Gold Lion for its series of internet ads for Stella Artois featuring spoof trailers for US films and TV shows, shot in the style of French Nouvelle Vague directors such as Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut. The UK also scored gold with agency Golley Slater&apos;s campaign for the army highlighting road traffic accidents among servicemen. Perhaps the biggest surprise, from a UK point of view, was the jury&apos;s decision not to even shortlist Fallon London&apos;s latest bizarre TV spot for Cadbury, &quot;Eyebrows&quot;. Last year Fallon was the joint Film Lion grand prix winner for &quot;Gorilla&quot;. This year&apos;s grand prix winner in the film category was the electronics firm Philips for an extended clip taken in one shot of a bank robbery frozen in time. The ad, by Tribal DDB in Amsterdam, is interactive, with viewers able to pause the shot at any point and open up sub-films on different parts of the robbery in progress. The ad, called Carousel, promoted the Philips Cinema 21:9 TV. This year&apos;s film lions category saw a 25.4% decrease in entries, from 4,626 to 3,453 year on year, with UK agencies submitting 32.5% fewer entries \u2013 down from 381 in 2008 to 257 this year. But Dave Lubars, the president of the film Lions jury, said there were no issues with the overall quality of film work submitted. &quot;Entries are down this year but there is the same amount of brilliant work as any other year,&quot; he said. &quot;[Although] this year weaker work was not taken a shot on [by agencies]. There was the same brilliant few hundred things [submitted] this year.&quot; However, his fellow juror Steve Back, executive creative director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in Australia, said that he had seen a lot of &quot;crap&quot; in the run up to finalising the winners. &quot;In the initial stages I was a little scared [that] under the current economic crisis there was still a lot of crap coming in,&quot; he said. &quot;However, by Wednesday a number of options emerged for the grand prix.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The characters played by this portly and mock-severe actress were almost always plebianised versions of Oscar Wilde&apos;s grand dame Lady Bracknell, with dodgily &quot;refined&quot; accent and implausibly overdone patrician gesticulations. She is most likely to be remembered for the character of Mrs Slocombe from the television comedy series Are You Being Served? and its successor Grace and Favour, the saga of a department store kept by the feudal Grace family, to whom all loyal employees are expected to bow and scrape even lower than they are expected to bow and scrape to the customers. Arch, unconvincingly haughty, protected by a cocoon of unworldliness, and apt to launch into ambiguous remarks about the current plight of her pussy, the overseer of the lingerie department Mrs Slocombe was part of a very funny series which dominated 1970s television comedy after a rocky start, in which many BBC executives doubted the wisdom of introducing such a bawdy mock-genteel band of seaside-postcard types to the nation&apos;s screens. Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, who wrote the series, had to fight hard to retain the character of the camp shop assistant Mr Humphries, always keen to measure clients&apos; inside legs and played by John Inman. Once they threatened to walk away from the series unless he were retained. &quot;Get rid of the poof!&quot; one BBC executive told Croft, to receive the reply, &quot;If the poof goes, I go.&quot; It is distinctly possible that the Inman character was the lightning conductor that saved Mrs Slocombe from humourless attack on the grounds that she made a certain sort of woman look ridiculous. As it was, the nation took both Mr Humphries and Mrs Slocombe to its heart, and the BBC successfully exported the series to many other countries. Mollie Sugden, as a result, became an unlikely cult figure in the US when, in the 1990s, the 60 episodes of the series were run and re-run there. In Boston, Philadelphia and San Francisco, Are You Being Served? was on screen five nights a week, and Mollie Sugden, according to American newspapers, was a better-known figure than the then British prime minister John Major. When Sugden and Inman went to Tennessee to popularise the series there, the queues of admirers and autograph hunters stretched twice around the studio building. For Sugden, Are You Being Served? was part of a hat-trick. Her other memorable television roles were Nellie Harvey, the rival landlord to Annie Walker in Coronation Street, and Mrs Hutchinson, the irritably snobbish mother of Sandra in The Liver Birds who is a sore embarrassment to both Sandra and her flat-mate in Liverpool. Her husband in the latter series was played by her real husband, the actor William Moore, a former professor of drama at the Old Vic School of Drama, Bristol. They met at Swansea rep, one of the many repertory companies she joined in the first eight years of her professional life, where they earned \u00a312 a week. They announced their engagement when she was appearing in Saturday Night at the Crown at the Garrick Theatre, London. They had twin sons. The Coronation Street and Liverpool roles were more in line with her own geographical background. After she was the subject of a This Is Your Life television programme, she mildly complained that her story had been portrayed as one of rags to riches, whereas in fact she had few rags in her past and little riches in her present. But her background was certainly rough-hewn. She was born Mary Isobel Sugden in Keighley in West Yorkshire. She discovered her flair for self-projection early. At four she heard a woman getting applause for reciting a funny poem at a village concert, and the following year stood on a chair and did a recitation; the audience collapsed with laughter and she decided that comedy was her forte. She was educated at Keighley girls&apos; grammar school, and when she went to Holland in a party of 800 British schoolgirls, she was chosen to represent them in a concert in Amsterdam. At 23 and after two years of study and three awards, she graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, maintaining that the school had smoothed out her northern accent and made her talk like a duchess. She went straight to a repertory company in Accrington in Lancashire, where she performed a twice-nightly play with Eric Sykes. Three months later, for \u00a33 a week, she moved to Oldham rep. There she learned one of the maxims she followed: that situation comedy has to be taken seriously if you are to please the audience rather than yourself. It was a rule she brought to all her television roles, in shows which included Hugh and I, Please Sir!, Doctor in the House, For the Love of Ada, That&apos;s My Boy, My Husband and I, and the programme written especially for her by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, Come Back Mrs Noah, a surreal series in which a housewife in 2050 accidentally launches herself into space without a pilot and can&apos;t get back, which required her to be not much like Mrs Slocombe and was not nearly as big a success. She knew that, despite the enormous following of the battleaxes she created, she was an unassuming supporting player rather than an &quot;important&quot; star. When her husband was once asked what item she would not be able to do without on a desert island, he said the complete works of Shakespeare. She herself said: &quot;My knitting bag, stuffed with lots of wool \u2013 I&apos;d never get bored.&quot; Her husband died in 2000; her sons survive her.

No cash for stories, no leverage for chummy coverage.  But look a little more closely now because, all round Europe and America, things are changing. A press in profound crisis has one hand outstretched - and the other tied behind its back.  Such contortions, naturally, are most obvious in France, where the president of the republic traditionally keeps his chequebook handy. Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s eye-catching scheme this year involves helping young people between the ages of 18 and 24 to receive one free copy of the paper of their choice every week for a year - and so, theoretically, catch the newspaper-reading habit for life. But wheezes like this are not really at the heart of a relationship that brings France&apos;s press well over \u20ac400m (\u00a3340m) in obvious subsidies and half a billion more in disguised tax breaks. The submerged issues here unite the Elys\u00e9e and newspaper boardrooms in a concerted effort to break the grip of the unions, which makes French papers almost twice as expensive to produce as others in Europe - and damnably difficult to distribute efficiently once they leave the print works. Top-up pensions to winkle out hardline press men and glum-faced lorry drivers? Certainly, Mr President ... There&apos;s similar thinking (as collected by the World Association of Newspapers) every time you turn on to an autoroute. Head south to Spain, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero&apos;s administration recently came up with a package of press beneficences: credit worth \u20ac360m, a year&apos;s holiday on social security payments for newspaper employers, the establishment of a bankrolled centre of journalism excellence - plus a drive to boost subscriptions within government. Not good enough, cried the Spanish press - but a dialogue continues. Head into Germany and, again, newspapers have an urgent aid agenda, this time centred on demands for copyright laws to make Google and the rest of the international internet giants pay royally for the news they lift from print sources. &quot;We don&apos;t want state subsidies, but we need support to protect our intellectual property,&quot; says the boss of Axel Springer, who has clearly noticed how Spain&apos;s publishers won a protection case against newspaper cuttings agencies this year and have already begun to extend that victory on to the internet. But perhaps the most interesting new set of initiatives appears in the Netherlands, where the media minister set up a Temporary Commission on the Future of the Press and saw it move quickly to boost journalists&apos; training, pour \u20ac8m into a &quot;press innovation fund&quot; and scrap merger rules that limit consolidations beyond 35% in any defined market. So far, so standard, perhaps. But then came a proposed tax on broadband providers to help the printed press adjust to a changing era: in short, to force the big boys of the internet to repair some of the damage their array of &quot;free&quot; news services has caused. You might call it the Amsterdam version of an idea launched in this column a few months ago, extending standard licence fee responsibility to all broadband connections and using the money raised to keep press reporters on the ground. That idea hasn&apos;t enthused the Dutch government yet, but its time will come.  Meanwhile, in the US, all manner of ideas rise and fall in extreme anxiety. This week&apos;s balloon of hope belongs to a US justice of appeals who wants to throw a cordon of copyright around newspaper reporting. And Britain? Here a scattergun fires rather too regularly. Can the press be saved by keeping BBC local TV off its patch? Done. Or by drastically easing merger policy? Not done. Or by closing down local council free propaganda sheets? Or by dropping no-win, no-fee libel lawyers in the nearest lake? If you want to place bets on where the rescue stakes go next, make the BBC&apos;s \u00a3153m free internet service the real target for tomorrow - and reckon that its extended iPlayer provision, neatly nullifying too much newspaper video effort, will make it a bitter free-for-all in pictures as well as words. But watch, too, for sharp elbows and tacit deals as the bargaining grows harder. &quot;We would never take money from the government,&quot; Mr M? Quite so. Remember, though, that there are more boons in this complex world than mere bundles of boodle passing over counters. Media&apos;s Jacko song and dance had no real legs What is a &quot;national moment&quot;? It&apos;s a time when a news event, whether unexpected or preordained, suddenly catches media fire, spreads through thousands of pages and broadcast hours, attracts millions of extra punters and generally wipes all other stories from the agenda. Think the death of Diana in category A (unexpected) or Obama&apos;s inauguration in category B. But don&apos;t fit Michael Jackson&apos;s premature demise into either of these big leagues. Cue 5,000 tweets a minute through the hours of maximum shock. Watch the LA Times website wilt from 2.3 million visitors an hour. Witness cable news stations double their ratings, with 20 million more US viewers piling in. See 2.5 million mobile phone users flooding on to the BBC website. Newspaper circulations in the quality market, though, mostly went up by only 4% or 5% last Friday night (late on) and on Saturday, as against 25% for Obama&apos;s moment. The Sun did well, but the Mail and the rest of the competition found Jackson wasn&apos;t too much of a hero to many of its readers (and 700 dissidents also called in to complain to the BBC about excesses of grief and adulation). By Sunday, any real sales impact had gone. By Monday, it had all become just more routine speculation about plots, wills and family feuds. Jackson had lived and died in a digital haze, gone in an electronic moment. It&apos;s nice when readers buy a paper to cherish as an artefact. It&apos;s less appealing when the best you can say about newspaper specials is that they line a mean bottom drawer. What the PCC washed out with baby Let us now praise restrictive judges and curmudgeonly courts imposing draconian gagging orders. You remember Chantelle, Alfie, teenage parents, and Maisie their bouncing baby? You read about them in the Sun last February - and may also recall that the Press Complaints Committee launched an inquiry to see if 13-year-old Alfie&apos;s mum and dad had taken Bun boodle to serve their son and supposed grandson up on a plate. The PCC reported last week, but gagging orders meant it couldn&apos;t go into detail over who paid what to whom. So there is only &quot;general&quot; guidance about kids and parents who want to be paid. But linger over what the commission, nudging and winking, clearly feels it should have said. On the one hand, Alfie, Chantelle and Maisie raised &quot;the importance of the prevalence, and impact, of teenage pregnancy within British society&quot;. Score one for &quot;exceptional public interest&quot;. On the other hand, maybe &quot;this example of such pregnancy was not so extraordinary as to... justify the probable impact on the children. Furthermore, the public interest has been significantly affected - in the case of the Sun - by the fact that the original identification of Alfie Patten as father turned out to be wrong&quot;. So duff tale, duff facts, exceptionally duff public interest defence. But just as they prepared to name and shame the editor concerned (Rebekah Brooks n\u00e9e Wade) she got promoted and a dark cloud of legal rectitude stopped play. So we&apos;ll never know what the commission would actually have said - unless we can read between lines.

They will go on show beside paintings that became some of the most expensive sold in the 20th century. The RA show, opening in January next year, will be the first major exhibition of Van Gogh&apos;s work in Britain in more than 40 years, and the first anywhere to bring together familiar works with letters by the artist that give vivid accounts of his life and opinions. One of many poignant moments in the correspondence \u2013 described by the curator Ann Dumas as &quot;without equal&quot; among artists&apos; letters \u2013 comes in June 1888, when Van Gogh remembers that even though he&apos;s down to his last 50 franc note, making money is simple. &quot;Fortunately, it&apos;s extremely easy to sell the right sort of paintings in the right sort of place to the right sort of gentleman,&quot; he writes. &quot;You only have to go down the Rue de la Paix \u2013 there strolls, just for that reason, the good art lover.&quot; The tragedy was that, in Van Gogh&apos;s 10 years as a professional artist, art lovers wouldn&apos;t touch his paintings with a barge pole. He sold just one picture, to the artist sister of a friend. And although he dreamed of subsidising other painters to follow him from the grime of Paris to the blazing light of Provence, only one painter, Paul Gaugin, ever responded - with disastrous consequences. After an explosive row between the two, either Van Gogh cut off part of his own ear, or (according to a recent theory) the panic-stricken Gauguin did, and then fled Arles forever. The letters shed fascinating light on his work. One is a mournful description to his sister of his &quot;very red beard, quite unkempt and sad&quot; with a self-portrait showing exactly that; another is a cypress sketched in a letter to his long-suffering brother Theo explaining how he&apos;s struggling to paint with the sombre foliage. One pairing of letter and painting may be his very last work, done days before his death: a comparatively cheerful missive to Theo, with a sketch of wheat fields under swollen clouds, and a painting, Wheatfield with Crows, in which some light breaks through. Whether Van Gogh was happy or despairing, flat broke or briefly able to pay the rent and his absinthe bill, letters poured from him: over 800 survive, and caches of previously unknown correspondence still surface regularly. They were written on small pieces of cheap paper, and are rarely displayed as they are now extremely fragile. The Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam is lending 35, along with a dozen paintings. &quot;These letters are the closest we can come to Van Gogh as a person,&quot; museum director Axel R\u00fcger said.

Lawyers for the international oil trader Trafigura failed in its initial attempts to exclude many witnesses from the trial over alleged toxic-waste dumping by the company. The witnesses include doctors and emergency staff present when thousands of inhabitants of the Ivory Coast flooded local hospitals in 2006 saying they were being poisoned by fumes from 400 tonnes of chemical waste that had allegedly been tipped on to local dumps. Mr Justice Macduff ruled that witnesses could testify from Amsterdam, where Trafigura faces prosecution over earlier attempts to dump the same waste, and from Tunisia and Norway, where efforts to treat Trafigura&apos;s foul-smelling waste led to other accidents and protests. Trafigura&apos;s counsel, Edwin Glasgow QC, used today&apos;s public hearing in Manchester to attack some of the 30,000 claimants&apos; motives. He said legal agents in Abidjan, capital of the Ivory Coast, stood to gain 3% of the damages for rounding up allegedly injured people. He said some of their symptoms had been exaggerated and local medical records were unreliable. The approach to the case had been, he suggested, one of &quot;never mind the quality, feel the width&quot;. Denying that Trafigura had been unfairly trying to exclude witnesses or to use its 1,000 pages of scientific evidence to &quot;blind with science&quot;, he said: &quot;There has been a huge amount of orchestrated publicity and huge criticism of my clients.&quot; He told the court: &quot;This is the largest and most difficult case of its kind.&quot; The Africans are able to bring the lawsuit in Britain as a group action, with 22 sample &quot;lead claimants&quot; flying over from west Africa, because Trafigura, the world&apos;s third-biggest independent oil trader has its operations base in London. The judge said the case would be a battle of scientific experts about the cause of the alleged poisoning. Both sides have assembled rival teams of toxicologists, chemists, tropical medicine experts and even psychiatrists, while teams of lawyers and barristers have shuttled back and forth to the Ivory Coast. The trial is due to last at least three months from the start of the full trial in London in October.", "sentences": ["Mr Justice Macduff ruled that witnesses could testify from Amsterdam, where Trafigura faces prosecution over earlier attempts to dump the same waste, and from Tunisia and Norway, where efforts to treat Trafigura&apos;s foul-smelling waste led to other accidents and protests."], "title": "Ivory Coast poison claimants win first skirmish in Trafigura lawsuit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/10/ivory-coast-trafigura-oil-lawsuit", "tags": ["Trafigura", "Pollution", "Environment", "Ivory Coast", "Law", "UK news", "World news", "Oil", "Oil", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-07-13T11:55:08Z", "article": "     Just when you thought every seven-inch of the post-punk 80s had been plundered, affect a suitably melancholic pose for the revival of a new old sound from the vaults \u2013 cold wave. Not so much forgotten as little heard in the first place, cold wave \u2013 and its dancier, synth-powered cousin, minimal wave \u2013 finds its roots in early 80s France. There, bands like Montpellier&apos;s Les Provisoires and Courbevoie&apos;s Asylum Party started playing gloomy post-punk in their native tongue, inspired by the icy guitars and studio-produced drum sounds pioneered by Factory Records producer Martin Hannett. The French press called it la vague froide, and the sound spread across Europe, but it never went overground, and vast amounts of records slipped under the radar, lost to history. &quot;The original waves of both the cold wave and the minimal electronic bands were a phenomenon that occurred entirely outside of metropolitan areas like Paris, Berlin, or Amsterdam,&quot; says Pieter Schoolwerth, a New York promoter whose club, Wierd, has done much to rescue the lost sounds from obscurity. &quot;Many of the most important bands were from the suburbs and small towns, and I think this sense of &apos;isolation&apos; from commercial, metropolitan media informed the music&apos;s expressive sense of longing for community or connection.&quot; Schoolwerth began throwing Wierd parties at the Southside Lounge in Brooklyn back in 2003, events that first of all attracted what he describes as &quot;a mix of visual artists, musicians and true outcasts \u2013 transvestites, truckers and Hasidic Jews were all in attendance on a weekly basis, and we went out of our way to embrace the real lost, lonely souls&quot;. In 2006, Wierd became a record label to capture the new bands congregating around the club, like anthemic cold-wavers Blacklist \u2013 think: the Mission, the Chameleons, big overcoats \u2013 or the more severe minimal electronic bands like Sean McBride&apos;s projects Martial Canterel and Xeno and Oaklander, all clanking synthesisers and mordant, gothic vocals. Now, cold wave and minimal synth seems to be at the point electroclash found itself at in 2001: New York clubland&apos;s best-kept secret, poised for crossover success. Perhaps, like electroclash, the music will remain a little too arch, a little to arty for mainstream consumption. But the Wierd parties have now found a permanent Wednesday night home at Home Sweet Home, an old factory in Manhattan&apos;s Chinatown, and Schoolwerth is busy compiling a compilation, WIERD Records Presents: Cold Waves and Minimal Electronics - Part I, for release in the UK on Angular Records later this year. &quot;We&apos;ve had parties everywhere, from people&apos;s painting studios to proper rock clubs all over the city. We even had one party where Echo West from west Germany performed with Xeno and Oaklander on an old second world war ship anchored in the Hudson river,&quot; says Schoolwerth. &quot;And we now have a new, younger generation of club kids, students and music fans who are feeling the melancholy pleasures of the cold wave.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;The original waves of both the cold wave and the minimal electronic bands were a phenomenon that occurred entirely outside of metropolitan areas like Paris, Berlin, or Amsterdam,&quot; says Pieter Schoolwerth, a New York promoter whose club, Wierd, has done much to rescue the lost sounds from obscurity."], "title": "Scene and heard: Cold wave | Louis Pattison", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jul/13/cold-wave-wierd-records", "tags": ["Electronic music", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Indie"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-07-13T16:00:00Z", "article": "AMSTERDAMNED It&apos;s not usually until a few months into the season that we start complaining about fixture congestion. But for the people of the north-east at least the issue looks all set to bubble over on 26 July when Newcastle and Sunderland play at almost the same time in almost the same place, while St James&apos; Park is simultaneously in action for a massive fundraising fixture organised by Sir Bobby Robson. One afternoon, two clubs, three matches - it&apos;s an equation for idiots, hence why the Fiver&apos;s interest is piqued. It goes a little like this: Sunderland are due to line up in the Amsterdam Tournament while, less than 30 miles away, Newcastle play in Utrecht and, back home, their ground hosts a charity game between the English and West German 1990 World Cup squads. But it doesn&apos;t end there: some 4,000 Mackems have already bought tickets for their game, one of two in the city in three days, while Utrecht haven&apos;t sold any to the Geordies, for whom this is their only Dutch fixture and one which was confirmed after Sunderland&apos;s trip. Nevertheless, officials in the &apos;Dam are demanding that the ideal solution would be for Sunderland to be dumped from their event. &quot;Consultations with Utrecht, the town and the club, have proved fruitless and I want no risk,&quot; sniffed Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen. &quot;We are alarmed about the situation. I understand that such a measure - to withdraw Sunderland - has far-reaching consequences, but the security in the city is above all.&quot; Job would have been encouraged then by news from Newcastle keeper Steve Harper that the club is &quot;dying a slow, painful death&quot;, its collapse being the perfect, if slightly over-the-top solution to the whole problem. &quot;All we keep hearing is &apos;next few days, next few days, next few days,&apos;&quot; he reported about a possible takeover of the Magpies. &quot;We want it done and dusted so we know where we are and where we are going.&quot; A feeling shared by Sunderland fans, we&apos;re sure you&apos;ll agree. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;I slipped, went to control the ball, turned and my arm hit Renan in the face.

A source close to the efforts to find a buyer for the Championship club has revealed that Mike Ashley may still be in control at St James&apos; Park this autumn. Although two consortiums remain interested in buying Newcastle for a figure close to the \u00a3100m asking price and others hover in the background, the due diligence process is understood to have exposed troubling facts about the club&apos;s financial liabilities. &quot;The process is moving extremely slowly, there is still genuine hope of a sale but it&apos;s not looking imminent,&quot; said the source. &quot;Newcastle comes with a lot of baggage.&quot; Ashley&apos;s problem is that once the transfer window closes at the end of August interested parties are likely to postpone any purchase until shortly before it opens again in January or even next summer. Football clubs are rarely sold outside transfer windows and Newcastle&apos;s would-be buyers are believed to be concerned about the club&apos;s wage bill. That stands at around \u00a365m per annum and is proving a stumbling block. While paying \u00a3100m for Newcastle could prove a sound investment if the club bounces straight back to the Premier League, a second season in the Championship would be a huge drain on resources. Though Newcastle could offload some high earners such as Obafemi Martins, Joey Barton and Fabricio Coloccini this close season, realistically any moves are likely to be completed only if the club continue paying a portion of their former players&apos; wages. When Leeds United sold Robbie Fowler to Manchester City Elland Road kept on meeting a sizeable percentage of his salary and a source close to Newcastle admitted: &quot;The fear is we could end up in a worse financial mess than Leeds did.&quot; Ashley, who has retreated from the public eye in recent weeks, is consequently faced with the unpalatable prospect of continuing as owner or taking a huge financial loss by offering Newcastle at a rock bottom price for a quick sale. While he attempts to find a buyer, Ashley has resolutely refused to appoint a manager, leaving Newcastle under the caretaker charge of Chris Hughton. Alan Shearer is waiting in the wings and hopes to return to the manager&apos;s office but he would almost certainly demand that Ashley invest in players suited to the rigours of a Championship campaign. Newcastle, meanwhile, have been dealt a blow by the Football Association, which has ordered the club to scrap their pre-season friendly at Utrecht. With their north-east rivals Sunderland due to play in the Amsterdam tournament 30 miles away on Sunday 26 July police in the Netherlands and Britain had feared there would be clashes between travelling supporters. Since Sunderland had already sold tickets for the event the Wearsiders have been cleared to play by the FA. There remains unrest among Newcastle&apos;s players, several of whom are threatening to submit transfer requests next week. &quot;We want a manager and a bit of stability,&quot; said the centre-half Steven Taylor. &quot;We need that, at the moment we don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on.&quot; Such sentiments were echoed by Kevin Nolan. &quot;We would prefer to know whether Mike Ashley is going to keep [Newcastle] or someone else is coming in,&quot; said the midfielder. &quot;In the next week we certainly want to know what is going to happen.

Such fears had earlier prompted the mayor of Amsterdam to demand Sunderland&apos;s withdrawal from the four-team tournament that also involves Ajax, Atletico Madrid and Benfica at the Amsterdam Arena but the Football Association intervened on the Wearside club&apos;s behalf. FA officials said Sunderland should be allowed to participate and have told Newcastle they cannot play in Utrecht.

It immediately caught my eye, not just for its dreamlike, bleached-out vision of bathers in the sea at an Italian resort, but for more personal reasons. Vitali photographs Italian beaches from a raised podium that gives his shots an epic sweep and enables him to capture the essence of holiday crowds. His art is about pleasure, hedonism and conformism. It&apos;s an art in which I recognised myself \u2013 almost literally. As it happens, I was actually part of the crowd on the beach at Cefal\u00f9 in Sicily in the summer of 2008. We didn&apos;t see a man on a raised platform with a camera, and I don&apos;t seem to be in the picture. Even if I were, I&apos;d be indistinguishable from all the other people in the pale blue sea. But it must have been taken within weeks of our being there.  Now, if it wasn&apos;t for this extreme proximity to my own experience, I&apos;d probably find it easier to see Vitali&apos;s photographs as what his website claims they are: critiques of consumer society, studies of conformism. There is undoubtedly a cynicism to his vision of people enjoying long, hot summer days. The light is so bright it is empty and pallid. The crowds are photographed at such a distance that no one is in focus as an individual. You can see in this a bleak riposte to one of the greatest photographs of all time, Weegee&apos;s Crowd at Coney Island, 1940. Weegee&apos;s picture is a celebration of the people, a democratic image. Vitali&apos;s photographs depict similar scenes but without the eye contact and the individual details that make the Weegee picture so humane. Vitali&apos;s crowd is not a democracy so much as a banalocracy. Perhaps it is very specifically Berlusconi&apos;s Italy we&apos;re seeing. But, as I say, I was part of that crowd. I was lost in that hedonist moment. And it was fun. A lot of the time, the things we say about art are leaden attempts to deny its pleasure. I&apos;m sure that Vitali&apos;s collectors would like to be reassured that there&apos;s a serious point to his images, but I&apos;m happy to enjoy them as panoramas of the good life.

Can you verify if this was true? And if it is, are there any other strange second jobs footballers have had?&quot; Sorry Robert, despite trawling through the archives neither we nor our sources in the north-west can find any mention of David White moonlighting at a rubbish tip, nor find a Manchester City fan who can recall the episode. However, Phil Brown (not that one, presumably) has a similar memory. &quot;I recall a Football Focus or Saint &amp; Greavsie in, I think, 1989 (if memory serves it was the day when City beat United 5\u20131) when they did a piece on David White,&quot; writes Phil. &quot;I&apos;m fairly sure he was filmed doing the monthly management accounts for his dad&apos;s company.&quot; Though that mystery remains unsolved, we have had some other suggestions of footballers&apos; second jobs. Brendan Mackinney reminds us that Stuart Pearce was a trained electrician and when he joined Nottingham Forest he advertised his services in the matchday programme. Second jobs were a more common occurrence in those sepia-tinged pre-Premier League days \u2014 Neil Warnock, for example, as well as being a trained chiropodist, also ran a fruit and veg stall. And Gica Popescu sort of counts, too. Jarle Steira writes to say: &quot;During the infamous days when Rosenborg dominated the Norwegian Tippeliga, the gaffer, Nils Arne Eggen, demanded that all players had a second job or studied something. Most notable of these second jobs befell Roar Strand, the player in Europe with the most titles [one question at a time please Jarle], who worked as a chimney sweep.&quot; Across the pond, there&apos;s Troy Perkins, who in 2006 was not just first-choice goalkeeper for DC United and a pick for the MLS all-star team, but a mortgage loan processor, leading United fans to greet him with the banner &quot;Troy saves \u2013 and loans&quot;. Mat Mitchell-King has, for now at least, given up his career in modelling \u2014 including working as Rio Ferdinand&apos;s body double \u2014 after signing for Crewe Alexandra. &quot;My first job was for Armani,&quot; said the former Histon player. &quot;I thought I was going to be a millionaire in my first year, but it didn&apos;t work out like that. I am Rio Ferdinand&apos;s official body double. I think my rates are a bit cheaper than his.&quot; And one player who definitely did combine life on the pitch and refuse collection is, as several readers have pointed out, the France striker Steve Savidan. During his part-time playing days with Angoul\u00eame Savidan worked, among other things, as a binman to supplement his income. CLUBS SPONSORED BY BANDS (2) A fortnight ago we did our best to provide a comprehensive list of football teams who have been sponsored by bands. Sadly, our best wasn&apos;t good enough. Thankfully our readers have been in touch to put us straight \u2026 &quot;Your list of bands sponsoring football teams failed to mention what is probably the long-lasting sponsorship of this kind: German punk rockers Die Toten Hosen&apos;s support of their local team Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf,&quot; says Claus Moser. &quot;The Hosen first became actively involved in 1989 when they sponsored the transfer of the Ghanaian international Anthony Baffoe, after Fortuna had just been repromoted to the Bundesliga. &quot;Then, in 2001, after the club had dropped down to amateur level and run into serious financial trouble, the Hosen became main sponsors, paying about \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3429,000) over two seasons for the privilege and thus probably saving the club from bankruptcy. Consequently, the band&apos;s notorious skull &amp; crossbones logo was displayed on the club shirt and merchandise (which in turn boosted the club&apos;s revenue and lent them a certain coolness). &quot;Since then the team has returned to professional football and the band is no longer listed as an official sponsor but they still have a close relationship: there is an official Die-Toten-Hosen-F95-Kollektion on sale in the club store, and the youth teams still turn out with the band&apos;s logo on their shirt. We&apos;ve had plenty of correspondence regarding bands who bankrolled amateur sides \u2013 from Stereolab&apos;s support of Barking &amp; East Ham Utd to Shed Seven&apos;s sponsorship of Barmby Moor and Teenage Fanclub&apos;s backing of a Sunday league side in Glasgow. Former Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown also sponsored Chiswick Homefields FC in 2005-06, while Bush drummer Robin Goodrige provided funds for a team in Rudgwick, West Sussex, that he used to play in goal for before he went off to tour America. More exciting still, however, is the news that Boyzone sponsored the Under-14 Sunday League side Park Hall Rangers FC in 1997-98. &quot;Our manager, Dave Mannion, had contacts within the rally driving industry who happened to know band member Shane Lynch,&quot; explains Liam Bradley, who played for Park Hall at the time. &quot;He and the other band members agreed to provide us with our football strips, much to the amusement of our opponents who would often &apos;take the proverbial&apos; before kick-off, by singing a medley of Boyzone songs to us. &quot;On one occasion, after we had recovered from 4\u20130 down to win a game 5\u20134, I had the surreal experience of a post-game congratulatory chat from Shane Lynch himself, who proceeded to invite me backstage, along with two team-mates, to meet Boyzone after one of their gigs. On another occasion the entire first team received a pep talk from a couple of Boyzone members during the half-time interval of a Sunday league match.&quot; But where the aforementioned teams have each been sponsored by one band or artist, the Dutch side FC Volendam have the support of several. &quot;FC Volendam are now sponsored by the Votown Allstars, a group which inlcudes Volendam solo act Jan Smit, pop duo Nick &amp; Simon and threesome The 3J&apos;s,&quot; says Johan van Slooten. &quot;They&apos;re all from Volendam, a small village north of Amsterdam which is one of the most musically prolific cities in the Netherlands, with more No1s than any other Dutch city, even Amsterdam.&quot; LUTON TOWN \u2013 RECORD BREAKERS? &quot;Due to football and injustice being intertwined these days, Luton Town travel to AFC Wimbledon for their opening fixture of the Blue Square Premier next season,&quot; writes Mark Buttery. &quot;This will mean that they will have played Wimbledon in all three of their &apos;guises&apos; (stay calm true Dons&apos; fans) \u2013 Wimbledon, MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon. Does this make Luton the first/only team to do so? Are there examples \u2013 in living memory \u2013 of three being bettered?&quot; For question one we say no, for question two we say yes. And for the answers to both we head to the rural delights of Adams Park, Wycombe. &quot;Much as I&apos;d love to let Luton claim this &apos;prize scalp&apos;, it&apos;s been achieved by Wycombe Wanderers already,&quot; writes David Chapman. &quot;During Wycombe&apos;s epic FA Cup run of 2000-01, they played Wimbledon twice in the fifth round (Wimbledon were then in what is the Championship now) \u2013 this being the last fixture between the two clubs in Wimbledon&apos;s original guise. However, Wycombe also played them in the Wombles&apos; earlier non-league days. They have also played MK Dons in a number of league matches since, most recently in 07-08 season, and then last season they were drawn away to AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup first round, coming out 4\u20131 victors. &quot;Wycombe can also claim to have played, from what I can gather, against all the various incarnations of what is now Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. As well as the current version, Wycombe have also played over the years the previous amalgams of numerous clubs that are now encompassed by The Daggers \u2013 these being Redbridge Forest, Dagenham, Leytonstone &amp; Ilford (both separately and together), and Walthamstow Avenue. I make that seven in total.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Why, if their nickname is the Hornets, do Watford have a moose on their club badge?&quot; asked Martyn Amos, way back in 2001. &quot;The moose is actually a hart \u2013 a male deer \u2013 which represents the hart part of Hertfordshire,&quot; says Tim Beesley, from Berkhamsted, Herts. &quot;I&apos;ve no idea why the spelling is different, lost in the mists of time no doubt,&quot; he continues. &quot;But I do know it is on the badge to represent the fact that for a very long time Watford were the only league club in Hertfordshire. Of course, this is no longer the case as Watford have been joined by Barnet. &quot;This is a relatively recent badge, as I think I&apos;m right in saying the Watford badges of the 60s and 70s had a hornet on them.&quot; And the reason why Watford are called the Hornets? As Alan Brydon points out, that&apos;s because of their distinctive yellow and black kit.

The two men are the same age, but long before Obama came to prominence, Marsalis had been a national figure and so while he says &quot;as a liberal and a Democrat I, of course, feel that things are better in America&quot;, he is experienced enough to know that change, particularly in the areas he cares about most, might not come as quickly as he would like.  As well as being the best known figure in contemporary jazz, Marsalis has also long been a doggedly effective advocate for the arts in education in general and for jazz&apos;s centrality to American history and experience in particular. He says: &quot;Cultural education is just as bad as it&apos;s ever been. The level of knowledge is the same as when I started out 25 years ago. It&apos;s difficult in this country to do things that have meaning. Things aren&apos;t set up that way. Will there be a dramatic difference in the arts under the new administration? We&apos;ll have to see. We still tend to think of science and math as the meal, athletics as the dessert, and the arts aren&apos;t even really on the table. There is an idea that a mind is wasted on the arts unless it makes you good in math or science. There is some evidence that the arts might help you in math and science. But, more importantly, the arts tell you who you are. And they make your life better. They are fun.&quot;  Marsalis&apos;s version of jazz history asserts a classical line that goes back to his native New Orleans: Bolden, Bechet, Armstrong, Ellington, Basie, Parker, Coltrane. But while few question the credentials of his pantheon, many have complained that he too easily dismisses post-1960s developments in jazz and that his wariness of the avant garde leaves jazz as a backward-looking form. And his views do carry a unique weight. He was the special advisor to Ken Burns&apos;s comprehensive television history of jazz that assumed Marsalis&apos;s canonical stance. And his position as artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Centre (JALC) provides him with a powerbase at the most influential jazz institution in the world. In 1987, Marsalis was involved in setting up a few summer concerts under the Lincoln Centre banner. By 1996, he was the artistic director of the newly formed JALC, which, although it had no permanent home, was granted equal status to other Lincoln Centre companies such as the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet and the New York Philharmonic. By 2004, JALC had moved into its spectacular new premises on Columbus Circle in New York. There are not only three venues, two of which feature jaw-dropping backdrops through fifth-floor glass walls of Central Park and the Upper East Side, but the institution also houses large education and archival resources. Here is where the official version of jazz is being made. One observer characterised the ambitious project, which suffered significant teething problems and turnover of senior staff in its early years, as like giving a new driver a Lamborghini, putting a camera on him and broadcasting his efforts on nationwide TV. &quot;As an organisation we did have to grow up fast,&quot; says Marsalis. &quot;But our aim was very simple. We wanted to invite an audience to celebrate all parts of the tradition of our music. And how can you be too ambitious for what is the primary art form of this country?&quot; Next week, Marsalis will bring his Jazz at Lincoln Centre Orchestra to the Barbican in London for a concert performance and to launch a biennial residency. From the summer of 2010, Marsalis and the JALC organisation will both perform and engage in education projects, masterclasses and jam sessions at the Barbican and elsewhere in east London. As interesting as the work they will do is the company they are keeping. The other orchestras in the scheme are the New York Philharmonic, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Gustavo Dudamel and the Leipzig Gewandhaus. Barbican director Nicholas Kenyon brought Marsalis and his orchestra to the Proms in 2004. &quot;Over the last 20 years, classical music has come out of its box,&quot; Kenyon says. &quot;We no longer say there are these great orchestras and there are the rest. Jazz at Lincoln Centre, in its field, is as great an ensemble as the New York Philharmonic. Marsalis has played the Haydn Trumpet Concerto as well as anyone has ever played it, but, as with someone like Yo...#8209;Yo Ma, the question of fencing off areas of music doesn&apos;t really exist any more. There is no question that the music the JALC orchestra do is key to the music of the last century. It&apos;s not about replacing the centrality of the western canon, but just expanding it a little and acknowledging that other things rightly belong in it. There is a category of musicians that, as well as having superhuman musical skills, have this very clear sense of what use their musical talents ought to be put to. We see people like Gergiev and Simon Rattle coming through the Barbican. I would put Wynton in the same category.&quot; Marsalis was born in 1961 and brought up in and around New Orleans, where his father, Ellis Marsalis, was a well-known jazz musician and teacher. The second of six brothers - four of whom became professional musicians - Wynton was playing traditional New Orleans music in a church band by the age of eight, and by 12 was studying the trumpet seriously and playing jazz, classical and funk music. The classical strand saw him performing the Haydn Trumpet Concerto with the New Orleans Philharmonic at only 14, but he says he was always aware of the primacy of jazz. &quot;I&apos;d been around jazz musicians forever, so I was aware that they were talking and playing at a very high level and that jazz had an engagement with the culture and a depth of feeling. I knew the historical knowledge jazz musicians had was very different from the general knowledge.&quot; But funk music was the most lucrative. &quot;We played to literally thousands of people. When me and my brother would go to see our daddy playing, there&apos;d be 30 people in the audience. I was only 14 or 15, but I realised something was wrong. He sat in with our band once at some school dance and was asked if he knew the music. He said: &apos;It doesn&apos;t make no damn difference, it&apos;s not going to be that hard. Just play it.&apos; So we started to play, and he just fell in and started killing on it. But at least I knew this music wasn&apos;t A Love Supreme. A lot of my friends didn&apos;t know A Love Supreme even existed.&quot; While at high school, Marsalis began to play small jazz gigs with some musicians from the local college. &quot;I got paid $40, not the $100 I was used to from the funk gigs. But I wasn&apos;t going to turn it down, I wanted to play jazz.&quot; But he also played traditional jazz in parades, more funk gigs, lounge sets at the Sheraton hotel, the Messiah on his piccolo trumpet in church, and classical work such as Cheetham&apos;s Scherzo and Malcolm Arnold&apos;s Brass Quintet with the symphony orchestra brass section. It was classical music that won him a place to study trumpet at the Juilliard School in New York in 1979, but by the time he arrived he already knew he didn&apos;t want a classical career. &quot;I had to figure out how to survive in New York, and most of my time was occupied in getting an apartment and getting money. A lot of older jazz guys looked out for me and found me gigs and places to stay.&quot; Marsalis played in the Broadway production of Sweeney Todd, in Latin clubs, and also with the Brooklyn Philharmonic.  &quot;I learned a lot. And part of what I learned was the prevailing ignorance in the critical community about jazz. Older musicians had resigned themselves to this culture that was so commercial and lacking in appreciation. Consequently, I knew things needed to be changed, but I had no idea whether I could change them.&quot; In New York, Marsalis had met the jazz writers and historians Stanley Crouch and Albert Murray, and says that this was when he began his real education into the history of the music. Crouch and Murray&apos;s view, that through jazz the whole of American culture could be understood and that the black American experience was at the heart of that culture, made Marsalis aware that, through jazz, he could deal with race, history, culture, economics and art. Armed with these ideas he was launched on to the most spectacular jazz career of the past 40 years.  He was already sitting in with legendary jazz drummer Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers band while at Juilliard. The following year, he left Juilliard to join the band full-time. In 1982, Marsalis - backed by what was, for a jazz musician, an unprecedented publicity blitz by Columbia records - released his eponymous debut album, which quickly sold more than 100,000 copies. In 1983, he picked up Grammys for both the Haydn Trumpet Concerto and his jazz album Think of One. In all, he has won nine Grammys, as well as a Pulitzer prize for his 1997 oratorio Blood on the Fields This meteoric success brought an equally swift backlash. &quot;At a certain point in my early 20s, I started to get pressures that didn&apos;t come from playing. Older guys were angry about all the publicity and the money and the girls. It wasn&apos;t that there wasn&apos;t publicity and money and girls. But I knew, and they knew, that my playing didn&apos;t merit this attention if compared to their playing. But in relation to my generation, my playing did deserve attention.&quot; By the late 80s, Marsalis&apos;s music was self-consciously exploring what he called &quot;the rudiments&quot; of jazz. And his increasingly outspoken pronouncements were ruffling feathers. He had a rumbling feud with Miles Davis, who Marsalis felt had made poor artistic and career decisions. &quot;Without me, you&apos;d be all &apos;Flight of the Bumblebee&apos;,&quot; countered Davis. And Marsalis&apos;s engagement with the question of race in jazz saw him criticised for marginalising white jazz artists - despite his championing of, say, Bix Beiderbecke - and also for dismissing elements of contemporary black music. It is a theme he has often returned to, most recently in his 2008 book, Moving to Higher Ground, in which he claimed that &quot;the average black person has no idea and no understanding of the rich legacy of African-American arts and doesn&apos;t know that there is something to know. Common knowledge has led us right back to the minstrel show by way of rap music and corrupted church music of people hip-humping while singing about Jesus.&quot; &quot;I never minded giving my opinions,&quot; he says. &quot;They are just opinions, and I had studied music and I had strong feelings. I was happy for my opinions to join all the other opinions. But you have to be prepared for what comes back, especially if you don&apos;t agree with the dominant mythology.&quot;  When Marsalis began to construct what would become JALC, he gathered around him people who shared his views, such as Crouch and Murray, and they endured their share of criticism both for their programming policy and administrative failings. Adrian Ellis, a Welshman, is the executive director of JALC. He said when he arrived in post in 2007 he anticipated &quot;a struggle, to put it crudely, between neocons and avant gardists. But, in fact, while the culture wars hadn&apos;t gone away entirely, it was more smouldering about historical issues rather than intense fires. We are so much larger than any other jazz organisation, we have an obligation to the totality of the music, and our output is much broader than our critics might believe. Wynton has long been an advocate for a view that could be summarised as &apos;all jazz is modern&apos;. We attempt to embrace both the legacy and the future of jazz so the history of jazz is present in what is currently being played. But while we carry a weight of responsibility for the music, we don&apos;t carry all of that weight, and most of our musicians play in innumerable other contexts. In fact the musicians move much more fluidly along the spectrum of avant gardism than the critics seem to manage.&quot; Marsalis says within JALC &quot;the music is the real thing, not the talking about the music. It&apos;s important to debate these things and it&apos;s more than barbershop banter. But here the music is above all that.&quot; He cites the work of the JALC library and its ongoing project to chart historical jazz arrangements, the organisation&apos;s shaping of the national educational curriculum, and its sponsorship of school band competitions as areas he is keen to draw on during the London residencies. &quot;I&apos;ve been to Brixton. I&apos;ve been to Peckham. I&apos;ve played ball down there and hung out. The people are a little different to here because it&apos;s a different culture, but playing and jamming is not different. And we&apos;ve taught a lot of classes over the years in the worst social areas. We have experience. But anyone is disadvantaged if they don&apos;t have access to information.&quot;  He says his schedule of composing, recording, performing and his JALC duties mean he is overworked. &quot;But it&apos;s not work I don&apos;t want to do. I don&apos;t find it hard. I practise, I work on stuff. That&apos;s what I do. I&apos;ve always had fun. That&apos;s an important part of it. Colleagues says that Marsalis is &quot;essentially a happy guy. He&apos;s not a tortured soul. There&apos;s a basic optimism and spring in his step.&quot; &quot;It all comes back to the music,&quot; he says. &quot;If you lose the music you have lost everything. There is no amount of money that would make up for losing something so important. I am having a wonderful time; the places I&apos;ve been, the people I&apos;ve worked with, the chance to play and maintain and celebrate all the great music. Why give up something that rare? That&apos;s the mistake earlier jazz musicians made. Papa Jo Jones, who played in Basie&apos;s orchestra, used to carry around a baby&apos;s pacifier in his pocket. When he was in a bar after a show people would sometimes come up to complain about the money or the audience or other players or whatever. And he&apos;d take this pacifier out of his pocket and say, &apos;You want this? Because you&apos;re messing up my good time.&apos; If you are having a good time, don&apos;t mess it up. I&apos;m having a good time.&quot; Marsalis on Marsalis When I was 19 or so, Wayne Shorter told me &quot;Notes are like people. You have to go up and greet each one.&quot; Well, I thought he was crazy. But now I understand what he was saying. You have a relationship to notes, scales and chords, and the more intimate that relationship is, the richer the music you make. There are as many approaches to harmony as there are people. Furthermore, two people will relate to each other in one way, which changes when you introduce a third. Adding a fourth may ruin the vibe, and so on. Harmonies are like that. You may be great with the first six or so, but that seventh chord kills your solo. You can be very technical and scale-oriented about harmony or you can find pungent blues melodies that cut through harmonic barriers and still sound good. It&apos;s like playing tennis: you might be great on grass but terrible on clay and mediocre on asphalt. Now, imagine 80 other surfaces and you will understand why the so-called avant-garde movement that started in the early 1950s and still sees itself as the cutting edge was so eager to consider playing through harmonies old-fashioned and obsolete. Some time ago, the tenor saxophonist Frank Foster was playing a street concert from the Jazzmobile in Harlem. He called for a blues in B-flat. A young tenor player began to play &quot;out&quot; from the first chorus, playing sounds that had no relationship to the harmonic progression or rhythmic setting. Foster stopped him. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;Just playing what I feel.&quot; &quot;Well, feel something in B-flat, motherfucker.&quot;", "sentences": ["The other orchestras in the scheme are the New York Philharmonic, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Gustavo Dudamel and the Leipzig Gewandhaus."], "title": "A life in music: Wynton Marsalis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/18/wynton-marsalis-interview", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Wynton Marsalis"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-07-18T09:50:56Z", "article": " More to come....  Preamble: Welcome putt-lovers to what should hopefully be yet another exhilarating day of play at Turnberry. Round Two was certainly the stuff of legends, containing as it did the continuing and astonishing brilliance of Tom Watson (he&apos;s 59 you know) and the exit of Tiger Woods, only the second time the great man has ever missed a cut at a major. The other big story of the day was American Steve Marino&apos;s surprise rise to the top of the leaderboard, ending the day, with Watson, on five-under. On the BBC news this morning, they had abbreviated the 29-year-old American&apos;s name to &apos;S Marino&apos; giving the brief impression that San Marino had for once done quite for themselves. They hadn&apos;t and remain a rather poor football team. Right then, lets see what&apos;s been happening this morning. Sweden&apos;s Johan Edfors, who began the day on four over, got things going. It wasn&apos;t a great start for Edfors who bogeyed five at the second to fall back to five over. There was more encouragement for the American pair Mark O&apos;Meara and Australian Robert Allenby who got their rounds going with pars at the first. Graeme Storm did even better taking a four at the first but there was less joy for his compatriot Paul Casey who dropped a shot at the first. It got worse for the Englishman as he then completed a hat-trick of bogeys at the third. Thankfully, the world No3 picked up with a par on four.  Moments later, pudgy face Rory McIlroy came out to play. The Northern Irishman has had a wayward Open up to now, finishing round two on three over, and so would have wanted a decent start today - he found a bunker off tee. Oh deary dear. Better news for Padraig Harrington who came out at the same time as McIlroy and made birdie to get to two over.  Meanwhile, Luke Donald is enjoying a really decent morning. The Englishman scored a birdie at the first and then followed that up with four pars. Are you watching Tiger, are you?! Darren Clarke also made a decent start with par at the first.  Here&apos; how the leaderboard is looking then.

Post your predicitons for today&apos;s best round in the comments section below before 1pm to be in with a chance  11.42am: All smiles for Paul McGinley as he putts for a birdie on the second to go to one over. &apos;Good boy!&apos; shouts Sam Torrence from the BBC commentary box. Good boy indeed.  11.45am: The defending champions is starting to stuggle out there. Looking snug in brown, Harrington has had to fight himself out of the wind and rough to keep himself going on this par-5 seventh hold. He missed birdie by a whisker and instead bogeyed to go over one for the day. A rueful smile from the normally bubbly Irishman.  11.50am: Luke Donald, one over for the day and seven over for the championship, gets going on the 12th with a decent drive. With Ian Poulter now out of the competition, Donald appears to have taken it upon himself to be the man in wacky clothes. He&apos;s got a tartan tank-top on. The words &apos;turning&apos; and &apos;stomach&apos; come to mind  11.52am: Oh dear, Harrington has sent his drive from the eight into the rough. Not the worst rough I have ever seen, but rough nevertheless.  11.53am: Edfors has ended his round with two birdies to complete a score of +6. He waves his cap to the gallery and allows a smile to spread across his rugged features. Is it just me or are all Swedish men (bar Sven) good-looking? Damn them!  11.55am: Better stuff from McIllroy who eagles the seventh.  11.59am: Good stuff from Oliver Wilson too who birdie two at the sixth to move to level par for the Championship.  11.59am: Oh dear, Gary Lineker has just appeared on the telly. I remain baffled by the BBC&apos;s decision to allow the one-time England striker to present top-level golf. What next, Daley Thompson on Test Match Special? Michael Schumacher hosting the World Snooker Championships ? This madness has to stop.

Apologies Alan. Here is a link to The Open&apos;s official, updating scoreboard. It&apos;s grrreat. Click here  12.18pm: Ooh, McGinley is just shy of par-putt on the fifth. He&apos;s move onto +2. Not such a good boy now is he?  12.20pm: The impressive young Italian Francesco Molinari is out for the day, beginning on +1. Sadly for him, his drive from tee finds the bunker.  12.22pm: Did Peter Alliss just say white men can&apos;t jump?  12.23pm: He did you know. Crazy stuff from the smoothed-voiced commentator  12.28pm: As yet no takers for the book. You have half an hour left. Come on!!  12.29pm: Paul Broadhurst is the first man to tee-off from the ninth. He hits a clean drive onto the fairway.  12.30pm: Wilson is next and he too finds the fairway.  12.31pm: Applause fills the Ayrshire air as Ernie Els comes out to play. He&apos;s joined by Justin Rose. A quick shake of hands by the players and they should soon be off.  12.33pm: More frustration for the champ as he misses birdie putt on the 11th. Harrington remains on +6, +3 for the day. A qucik wave to the gallery, will he ultimately be waving goodbye to the Claret Jug?  12.35pm: Rose to tee-off at the first....  He&apos;s using an iron  12.35pm: It&apos;s a decent start, missing the bunker by a fair distance. Unbelievable to think Rose, who starts the day on +1, played his first Open, at Birkdale, 11 years ago. He looks exactly the same!  12.37pm: Els is also off to a good start. He too begins the day on +1.  12.38pm: Our first comment! Good on ya OzzyMandias. Ozzy has again gone for Garcia to have the best round of the day. Decent punt. The Spaniard tees-off at 1.35pm.  12.40pm: Rose is unhappy with his second shot of the day. The wind has pulled his drive just short of the green. Arms are being waved and there may even have been the slightest uttering of a swear word. Tut tut Justin.  12.43pm: Donald, on +4 and still wearing that bloody jumper, irons off the 16th tee. Its good, but not great.  12.44pm: Rose is on the green with his third shot. Thw ind really seems to be picking up at Turnberry. That could cause havoc for the leaders, the majority of whom will be out in a couple of hours  12.46pm: Great right-to-left putt from Els who has just birdied the first. Rose, on the other hand, has got going with a bogey.  12.52pm: That wind is causing havoc now. Els, with a relatively straight-forward shot onto the second green has instead found the rough. The South African grimaces and suddenly that beaming smile from the first feels like a lifetime ago. Sort of.  12.55pm: Better stuff from Rose who finds the centre of the green with his second shot at the second.  12.57pm: Excellent long putt from Rose who birdies the second to par for the day. The Englishman remains on +1 overall  12.58pm: It&apos;s becoming a case of roles-reverse as Els bogeys the second.  1.00pm: The American Zach Johnson has been impressive so far today but even he is now beginning to struggle with this wind. A simple birdie putt on the 10th is driven well wide of the hole.  1.02pm: Casey&apos;s day remains one of frustration. He misses an eagle putt at the 17th to go to +4 for the day and +8 overall. We can now safely rule the world No3 out of Championship contention.  1.05pm: Here comes Daly!  1.06pm: The boozy, bleached American is wearing lion-skin coloured trousers and a bright orange top. He looks er....good but starts the day with a stinker, hitting his first tee-shot into the rough. Come on man!  No change at the top of the leaderboard with most of the top guys coming out later this afteroon. Anyone, though, who wants a peek at the current standings can do so here. Click here  1.10pm: Jamie Doozer has just made the cut (geddit) for the book. He&apos;s predicted Boo Weekly will have the best score today. We&apos;ll see mate.  1.11pm: The Bryce Molder is have a quietly effective day. The American has just birdied the 17th to go -3 for the day and is now even overall  More woe for Els as he bogeys the third, his second in succession. He is now +2 for the day and +1 overall.  Rose pars the third to remain on +1 overall.  1.15pm: The wind drags Daly&apos;s iron-putt just shy of birdie. He marches to the second on +1 for the day. What a guy.  1.18pm: Oh no, Daly has found the rough again from tee. He may look like an acid trip on legs, but this is dark, dreary stuff so far.  1.21pm: Rose just can&apos;t get off par today. The slightest of downhill slopes has just wrecked his chances of a birdie on the fourth. He remains on +1 overall.  1.27pm: Els also pars the fourth.  1.27pm: Donald ends his round just how he started it - with a birdie. The Englishman has scored 70 to be on +3 overall. The best score of the day, however, is Molder&apos;s 67, six better than yesterday. He is on par overall, a decent showing.  1.34pm: Sergio Garcia is preparing to tee-off. He begins the day on one under......  1.35pm: A six-iron sees the Spaniard reach the fairway with little trouble. His playing partner, the American Jeff Overton, is next to tee-off  1.36pm: Overton does even better, reaching the middle of the fairway.  1.37pm: On dear, Harrington has missed par on the 18th by the slightest of margins. A terrible day has seen the two-time Open champion finish on six-over for the day and sit on +9 overall.  1.39pm: What a shot from Daly! He sinks a long-putt to par the fourth and stand on par overall. That&apos;s more like it!  1.41pm: An error on my part; Harrington has not finished for the day. He&apos;s just completed his 16th hole. Sorry readers.  1.43pm: Patrick Gamble has just sent a rather harsh and abusive email regarding the Guardian&apos;s golf correspondent Lawrence Donegan. Safe to say I don&apos;t agree with its sentiments. You can read Lawrence&apos;s report of round two at Turnberry here  1.49pm: Jim Furyk, who teed-off moments ago has safely found himself onto the green. He begins the day on -1.  1.53pm: Furyk is going to have to adapt to this wind. A slow putt falls short of the hole preventing the American from beginning the day with a birdie. He nails par, though.  1.55pm: It&apos;s Sir Nick Faldo&apos;s birthday today. The former Ryder Cup captain is 52. My birthday is on 14 March for anyone who cares, which I&apos;m guessing is no one.  1.57pm: Angel Cabrera, who teed-off with Furyk, also misses birdie at the first.  1.58pm: An update on the big story from Turnberry; Ross Fisher&apos;s wife is unlikely to give birth this weekend. That will allow the talented 28-year-old, who will begin round three in just under an hour on three under, to play through to the final hole on Sunday, should he keep his nerve.  2.01pm: No OzzyMandias, Gregg has not punctured his bike. The loveable Scouser is enjoying a deserved day-off, which means you lot are stuck with me. Sorry.  Here&apos;s another chance to see the leaderboard, As mentioned, there&apos;s been little change at the top so far today with most of the leaders coming out later.  2.06pm: What a shame. Harrington has missed birdie on the 18th. He finishes with a round of 76, +9 overall. Ladies and gentleman, get ready to welcome a new champion on Sunday.  2.08pm: Furyk has also missed birdie. He goes to the third hole on par for the day and -1 overall.  2.09pm: Oh what Cabrera would have done for a par. He bogeys the second and is now even overall.  2.10pm: Lee Westwood prepares to tee-off for the day. Unusually, an Englishman is met with a loud roar of approval in Scotland.  2.11pm: It&apos;s a decent start from Westwood, and his playing-partner Stewart Cink.  2.13pm: A great shot from Garcia to get himself onto the third green. Looks like OzzyMandias&apos; prediction may come off afterall  2.14pm: Scrap that. Garcia&apos;s just missed an easy putt. He&apos;s on par for the day.  2.16pm: JB Holmes has just been accused by the BBC commentary team of looking like a farmer. That reminds me of a classic line my journalism tutor once told our class: &quot;I hate bookies. Almost as much as I hate farmers.&quot; He then walked off without an explanation. Brilliant.  2.18pm: For those of you who are keeling over in anticipation; leaders Tom Watson and San Marino, err..Steve Marino, will be out in about 40 minutes.  2.20pm: Westwood&apos;s attempt at an opening birdie is also affected by this brisk Ayrshire wind. His shot pulls back and finishes on the lip of the whole. Oh the agony.  2.22pm: So Rory McIllroy&apos;s strange day is over. Having started with three bogeys, the 20-year-old then nailed an eagle (not literally of course) before finishing with three birdies to complete a round of 74. He is on +7 overall.  2.27pm: Rose is at the halfway stage still one-over. His putt from the ninth is good but not as good as his skip to a nearby hut where the Englishman is no doubt taking a well deserved pit-stop.  2.30pm: Vijay Singh, who ended yesterday on three under, has just his first tee of round three into the rough. A far better start is enjoyed by his playing partner Kenichi Kuboya who finds the middle of the fairway. Nice top too; an eye-catching pink and white number. Good work my man  2.34pm: Westwood pars the second. Singh meanwhile is out the rough and Retif Goosen, who starts on three under, is making his way to the first-tee.  2.36pm: Here comes Miguel Angel Jimenez. Normally I don&apos;t care much for tubby middle-aged men with absurd long, hair, but there&apos;s something about this guy. Don&apos;t know what it is.....  2.39pm: Oliver Wilson has also finished for the day. A round that included four birdies and five bogeys gave him a final score of 71, three over.  2.41pm: Bugger, Jimenez has teed into the rough.  2.42pm: A curious email from Philippe from Amsterdam who is asking &apos;why have all the English boys blonded their hair?&apos;. Unless the picture is playing up on my tv, I don&apos;t think they have Philippe, I don&apos;t think they have.  2.45pm: Jimenez is out of the rough but still a fair distance from the first green. Singh, meanwhile, has begun with a bogey. Not a great start then for some of yesterday&apos;s top performers.  2.47pm: For those who care, England have made 105-2 in their second innings against Australia at Lord&apos;s having bowled the tourists out for 215 this morning. For more, why not read Rob Smyth&apos;s over-by-over report  2.52pm: Fisher and Mark Calcavecchia are underway. Calcavecchia&apos;s wife is his caddy for The Open. Fisher&apos;s wife, meanwhile, is carrying something rather more important right now than a bag of clubs.  2.54pm: Watson and Marino are on their way. Before they tee-off, lets have a quick check on the standings:   Leaderboard top 10 T Watson US -5 (3pm)S Marino US -5 (3pm)M Calcavecchia US -4K Kuboya Jpn -3M Angel Jimenez Spa -3R Goosen SA -3R Fisher Eng -3M Goggin SA -2S Cink US -2J Kingston SA -2  2.58pm: Westwood misses birdie on the third.  3.00pm: Watson is ready to go.....  3.00pm: It&apos;s a good start as the veteran Open winner five-irons his drive down the middle of the fairway.  3.01pm: Decent start, too, from Marino as the man from Palm Beach, Florida, also smacks the fairway.  3.05pm: Watson is safely on the green thanks to his trusty iron. He&apos;s wearing a nice black and purple jumper today, a cap too. Personally I was hoping he came out in a &apos;Who the f*ck is Tiger Woods?&apos; t-shirt. Nevermind.  3.09pm: Further up the course, Jimenez has got par on the second to bring his score back to -2.  3.10pm: Watson has started with a par. Smooth stuff from the overnight leader.  3.13pm:Having worked his way out of the rough, Calcavecchia bogeys the second. The big man (and I mean big) looks perturbed. He is now back to -4.  3.18pm: As Watson continues to stride happily across the course, his fellow five-under, Marino, has just found the rough on his way to the second hole. Is the other great story of this Open moving towards an anti-climactic end?  3.20pm: McGinley is done for the day. The Scot finished with a round of 70, two over overall.  3.24pm: Westwood is going about his business with quiet effectiveness. He&apos;s just reached par at the third to stay one under. Watson, too, has just reached par, at the second.  3.25pm: Marino bogeys the same hole. It appears to be getting rather murky and even more gusty at Turnberry. That should rattle the leaderboard.  3.28pm: A decent putt-attempt from Calcavecchia at the third but his curling shot doesn&apos;t quite sink. He misses par.  3.29pm: Great putt from Fisher. Like his playing partner, Calvavecchia, he was a fair way from the hole, but sunk his curling shot to birdie and go four under.  3.31pm: Goosen and Jimenez have both just made par at the fourth to stay four and two under respectively.  3.33pm: Had the BBC&apos;s slightly pointless piece about golf-course hazards gone on any longer we would have missed Watson and Marino both getting out of one. The overnight leaders teed from the third into bunkers.  3.34pm: Great recovery from Watson who is on the green and ready to par. That would keep him at least a shot ahead at the top of the leaderboard.   Top 10 T Watson US -5R Goosen SA -4R Fisher Eng -4S Marino US -4K Kuboya Jpn -3M Calcavecchia US -3M Angel Jimenez Sp -2M Goggin Aus -1S Cink US -1L Westwood Eng -1  3.38pm: Watson gets par at the third. The dream lives on....  3.39pm: You&apos;re right Hibernica, he is of course Irish. After four hours of this, my memory is starting to play tricks with me. Apologies.  3.41pm: Marino is creaking even more. His tee from the fourth has just dipped into the grass. Not a disaster but you get the sense that he is fading fast. A shame. Great story.  3.42pm: Contender for shot of the day from Jimenez as he curls a drive to make par at the fifth. My favourite Spaniard/Mick Hucknell lookalike remains +1 for the day and -2 overall.  3.46pm: If Jimenez is sparkling than what about Goosen who pars the fifth hole to remain one-under for the day and four-under overall. The South African is the only guy out there who is under par for the day.  3.48pm: More bother for Marino who bogeys the third to go to three under overall.  3.51pm: Graeme McDowell has just completed his round. The man from Northern Ireland nailed six birdies to finish on 71, two-over overall. He was one over at the start of play so the former Scottish Open won&apos;t be too pleased. He certainly didn&apos;t appear if as he departed from the course.  3.56pm: Goosen misses birdie at the sixth by some distance. Making the shot would have given him a share of the lead. A chance missed perhaps.  3.57pm: Jason Waddleton has emailed in to say he took offence at my earlier description of Rory McIllroy&apos;s face, which I said was &apos;pudgy&apos;. &apos;I would have thought someone with a name like yours would be sensitive to most kinds of prejudice&apos; says Jason. Of course you&apos;re right, the threat of racist abuse is exactly the same as being told you have an ever-so-slightly fat face. My bad.  4.01pm: Bang! Watson pars the fifth with a sweet, long putt to remain five under. Marino, meanwhile, misses his chance to reach even score at the same hole.  4.05pm: It&apos;s a double bogey for Marino at the fifth, he&apos;s now one under. Fisher, meanwhile is out of the bunker at the sixth.  4.09pm: The Englishman&apos;s drive from tee at the seventh has found the spectators, some of whom are also helping Goosen find his ball just ahead of the eight tee. It&apos;s starting to go Pete Tong for some of the guys at Turnberry.  4.10pm: Less so for Watson who having hit his tee-shot into the bunker, is now out and into the green. Goosen, meanwhile, has found his ball.  4.11pm: Click here to glance at the official Open leaderboard  4.14pm: Watson misses par at the sixth to drop his first shot of the day. He is now tied at the top of the leaderboard with Goosen.  4.16pm: Not for long as Goosen double bogeys the seventh. The South African&apos;s had a bit of a nightmare hole, having had to take a drop after losing his ball.  4.17pm: A bit of good news for the romantics as Marino birdies the sixth to go back to level par.  4.18pm: Westwood has the chance to get his first birdie of the day but misses to instead make par at the ninth. He remains on -1.  4.20pm: The sun appears to have come out at Turnberry, although there&apos;s still a noticeable wind blowing across the course. At Lord&apos;s meanwhile, England are now on 144-2. Kevin Pietersen, remarkably, is not out on 31.  4.23pm: After a bogey at the second, Calcavecchia has been moving through the course with promising effectiveness and could have made a real assault on the top of the leaderboard had he made birdie at the ninth. The American&apos;s putt drifts just short of the hole, though, and he remains on -3.  4.25pm: The man who is at the top appears ready to stay there. Watson has just blasted his tee shot straight down the middle towards the seventh. He&apos;s on for an eagle.  4.29pm: Watson misses eagle on the seventh but is only four feet off a birdie. This is truly exciting stuff. I&apos;m not going to lie to you, I was sure the old fella would have blown it by now. Birdie! He&apos;s birdied to go two shots clear. Get in!!!  4.31pm: Hang on a sec, Marino&apos;s just gone and eagled the seventh. That man refuses to let Watson hog the limelight.  4.36pm: Cink&apos;s just birdied the 11th to go one-under.  4.37pm: The BBC do love their scenic shots don&apos;t they? Whenever a golf tournament is on, all we seem to get is rolling hills and lapping waves. Can this policy not stretch to other sports, such as football. Whenever a match is taking place at White Hart Lane, for instance, there could be random cut-aways to Tottenham&apos;s many kebab shops. Or for a European night at Anfield, we could be reminded of the splendor that is the Total petrol station that sits a few metres away from the Kop. Just an idea.  4.42pm: Rose has finished for the day. A round that included an eagle ends with a birdie and a total score of 71, two-over overall. He looks reasonably pleased. Time will tell how decent a score that is.  4.43pm: Goosen just misses birdie at the ninth. This seems a good moment to catch up with the leaderboard:  Top 10 T Watson US -5 R Fisher Eng -3M Calcavecchia US -3 M Goggin Aus -2M Angel Jimenez Sp -2R Goosen SA -2S Marino US -2J Furyk US -1S Cink US -1L Westwood Eng -1  4.48pm: First birdie of the day for Westwood at the 12th. He moves to -2, level with the Australian Matthew Goggin.  4.52pm: &quot;What price a Tom Watson / Lance Armstrong double on consecutive Sundays?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. &quot;Okay, 1000/1, but it&apos;s a thought us 46 year-olds want to hold on to.&quot; Nothing wrong with that Gary, although the way Westwood is playing I still fancy him to sneak the Claret Jug.  4.55pm: Ooh, Fisher is so close to a birdie at the ninth. His putt licks the lips of the hole but stays out. The dad-to-be remains three under and still on Watson&apos;s heels.  5.03pm: Fisher is now on his own in second after Mark Calcavecchia slips back to -2 as he three putts at the ninth. And the gap to the top is even smaller after Watson bogeys the same hole to drop to four under.  5.09pm: Jimenez has remained there and thereabout all day and has just missed the green with his tee from the 11th. Don&apos;t rule out the red wine drinking, hair growing, man from Malaga just yet.  5.11pm: Fisher gets par at the 10th to stay on par for the day and -3 overall. Amazing round considering his thoughts are somewhat distracted.  5.13pm: &quot;Do you think that the young Aussie has played in Cambridge at Goggin Magoggin ?&quot; asks Dan Hare. Not much I can add to that really.  5.14pm: Westwood pars the 14th to get within two shots of the lead. The Englishman has played superbly since Thursday and deserves this push to the top. Watson, though, doesn&apos;t appear ready just yet to give up on the lead. Fascinating stuff.  5.17pm: Oh! Watson was so close to a birdie on the 10th. His long, downhill putt skips across the hole but sadly for the leader, drifts. Marino pars the 10th as he continues to make up for his poor start to the day.He is now two-under.  5.21pm: Right, this shot of Watson looking longingly towards the Ayshire coastline has to have been staged. He&apos;s got his hands clasped behind his back for God&apos;s sake!  5.22pm: Meanwhile, Furyk has bogeyed the 15th to slip to level par.  Lets check the leaderboard:  Top 10 T Watson US -4 R Fisher Eng -3M Goggin Aus -2L Westwood Eng -2M Angel Jimenez Sp -2R Goosen SA -2M Calcavecchia US -2S Marino US -2S Cink US -1B Molder US Par Molder&apos;s 67 remains the best round of the day  5.26pm: Great long-putt from Marino as he bogeys the 11th to go to three-under. Could he?....na.  5.29pm: Close again from Watson as he misses a bogey at the 11th by the length of a fun-size Mars bar. Still on top though.  5.31pm: Who&apos;s your favourite Tom? Apart from Watson of course. Mine are Waits and Hanks.  5.33pm: Great recovery from Fisher at the 12th. He chipped out of the rough and straight onto the green with his third shot, should easily make par. Goggin is also sticking around, the Aussie has just made par at the 16th to remain two under.  5.37pm: Calcavecchia holds his putt at the 12th to remain two under. Meanwhile, Jimenez is having a bit of a struggle at the 13th. Once again he goes for a long putt and it pays off as he reaches the hole with a shot to spare for par.  5.40pm: Jimenez pars the 13th to remain two under. What a guy.  5.41pm: Apologies OzzyMandias, so much is going on that I&apos;m occasionally losing my way. I&apos;ll try and calm down. And yeah, Tom Thumb was pretty cool.  5.44pm: Cabrera has finished for the day, ending his round of 72 with two birdies. The Masters champion will resume on +1.  5.48pm: An eagle putt from Goggin at the 17th means he now shares the lead with Watson. Both men are on three under.  5.50pm: Furyk ends on 70, one under. A decent showing but perhaps not the form of a man many backed to triumph at Turnberry.  5.52pm: Fisher misses birdie at the 13th. He has got to start taking some of these if he wants to be the overnight leader. Although saying that, it would all be for nothing if his wife goes into labour anytime soon. Hold on Joanne!  5.54pm: Everything seems perfect to the BBC boys Ozzy. I&apos;ve never come across such a dreamy-voiced set of men in my life. Goosen could turn around and thump Steve Marino with his five-iron and no doubt Peter Alliss would say; &quot;Ah, what a perfect shot that is from the canny South African. Great stuff.&apos;&quot;  5.57pm: Goggin ends his round on 69, three under overall, joint-top with Watson and now, Westwood. The Australian made two bogeys and three birdies on his way &apos;round the course. A fantastic showing from the pink-shirted man from Tazmania.  6.00pm: Watson remain in contention with a par at the 13th. Marino does the same to stay two under.  Click here to check the official Open leaderboard  6.02pm: Just to say, Westwood has gone to three under thanks to a birdie at the 17th. He really is playing well.  6.04pm: Scrap that; Westwood&apos;s just found the grass on his way to the 18th. Come on Lee!!  6.06pm: Martin has got involved in the &apos;which is the best Tom&apos; debate and come up with a classic: The cat from the Tom and Jerry cartoon. That&apos;s gonna be hard to beat.  6.07pm: Westwood needed two shots to get out of the grass but eventually does with a great chip onto the green. He&apos;s likely to end his round with a dropped shot.  6.08pm: First Westwood and now Fisher who followed his dropped shot at the 12th with another at the 14. He is one under.  6.10pm: The anticipated bogey from Westwood who ends with a round of 70. He&apos;ll go into the final day on two under. A decent place to be for a man playing some fine, fine golf.  6.12pm: Ah Hazel Irvine has just mentioned Greg Norman and the Ashes in an interview with Mathew Goggin. Why not chuck in a reference to Harold Bishop and koala bears while you&apos;re there Hazel. Give me strength....  6.15pm: Watson achieves par at the 14th, as does Marino who really has come back with a bang. &apos;Awesome&apos; as he may say. Fisher also hits an even score one hole up while Jimenez hits his second double bogey in three holes at the 16th. The great one is not looking so great now sadly.  6.24pm: A bit of drama at the 15th as spectators, and Tom Watson, help Marino find his ball, which has gone missing in the thick rough. It&apos;s like a search party over there! Next the police will be making a televised appeal. &apos;Have you seen his ball? If so, call Crimestoppers immediately&apos;.  6.27pm: More good play from Fisher who uses a wedge to get within range of birdie at the 16th. Meanwhile the search is over, Marino&apos;s ball has been found. Thank goodness for that.  6.29pm: Marino is considering a drop shot such is the thickness of that rough.  6.30pm: The fetchingly-dressed Kuboya finishes with a round of 75. He&apos;ll resume on +2.  6.32pm: Birdie from Fisher! He moves onto two under, one off the top.  6.34pm: Marino is taking a drop  6.38pm: Eagle for Goosen at the 17th as he climbs to two under. Remarkable considering he double-bogeyed a couple of holes ago.  6.41pm: Oh dear. Watson&apos;s has struggled at the 15th and ultimately dropped a shot. That means Goggen is out on his own at the top of the leaderboard.  6.44pm: It&apos;s going t*ts-up for Marino again. A double by at the 15th has eventually led to a triple bogey. He slides to +6 for the day and +1 overall. He isn&apos;t even in the top 10 anymore.  6.45pm:  Leaderboard top 10 M Goggin Aus -3 L Westwood Eng -2R Goosen SA -2R Fisher Eng -2T Watson US -2J Furyk US -1S Cink US -1B Molder US ParT Jaidee Tha ParR Johnson Swe +1  6.50pm: Birdie at the 17th from Fisher gives him a share of the lead.  6.52pm: You&apos;re right Martin Wakelin, Marino is still in the top 10, just not the top 10 players...if that makes sense  6.53pm: Jimenez ends on 76, three over. It&apos;s a pretty horrid day for the Spaniard, who began round three three-under. I presume a fair few glasses of the expensive stuff will be downed tonight.  6.54pm: A more pleasant end for Goosen who finishes with a round of 71. He&apos;ll be back on -2, one shot of the lead.  6.56pm: A fantastic long-putt from Watson at the 16th sees him rejoin Fisher and Goggin at the top of the leaderboard on three under. The Turnberry crowd are loving it, just listen to that roar. Go on Tom! Go on!!! Sorry, I&apos;m getting carried away again  7.01pm: Right that&apos;s it from me then. Thanks to those of you who took part today. Sadly no one predicted Bryce Molder would have the best round of the day so the book stays with us.  There&apos;ll be updates on this site and then final reports from our team at Turnberry, including Lawrence Donegan and Kevin Mitchell, so don&apos;t go logging-off. bye!", "sentences": ["2.42pm: A curious email from Philippe from Amsterdam who is asking &apos;why have all the English boys blonded their hair?&apos;."], "title": "The Open 2009: round three - as it happened | Sachin Nakrani", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/18/the-open-round-three-live", "tags": ["The Open", "Golf", "Sport", "The Open 2009"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-07-21T13:26:42Z", "article": "     The biopic is a curious beast. If it treats its subject too kindly, there&apos;s very little to keep the audience engaged for 90 minutes. Tear him or her to shreds and you risk destroying the enigma which caused people to come and see the film in the first place. Mr Nice, the story of celebrated cannabis smuggler Howard Marks, which is based on the autobiography of the same name, comes along at an interesting time for the campaign to legalise the drug. In 1996, when the book itself was published, the nation was moving towards a less stringent attitude towards dope. As a student, I remember getting excited when The Independent began its legalisation campaign in 1997. And when the government downgraded the substance to Grade C in 2002, it seemed only a matter of time before we saw Amsterdam-style coffee shops on the streets of London, Birmingham and Manchester. But as the first trailer for Mr Nice hits the web, I can&apos;t help thinking that the timing is somewhat unfortunate. Two years ago the Independent said it was wrong to push for the drug to be legalised, and even in liberal circles we seem to have moved back towards the attitude that cannabis, particularly high-strength skunk, does cause enough harm that it ought to remain illegal. The trailer, which shows Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as his wife, Judy, seems to depict Marks as a charismatic, freewheeling chancer, the decent sort of drug dealer; one who never dealt with guns, violence or more damaging substances. It&apos;s very much in line with the book.  But if the eventual movie is to transcend whimsical Brit-com territory - at least one commentator has remarked on the trailer&apos;s resemblance to the recent Richard Curtis&apos;s The Boat that Rocked - it will need to show us the dark side of Marks&apos;s sense of invincibility: the egocentric personality that allowed him to believe he could outsmart the authorities time after time despite being out of his brain on weed whenever he wasn&apos;t actually asleep. Marks and his wife both, eventually, ended up behind bars on the opposite side of the world from their children - he for seven years, she for two. I&apos;m not suggesting for a second that the film ought to peer down upon him from upon high as he gets his comeuppance, but whether cannabis should be illegal or not, Marks continued with his heroic attempts to enrich himself long beyond the point when the odds were in his favour. And ultimately, his family suffered for it. It&apos;s also worth remembering that Howard Marks is a drug dealer, not a musician, an actor or a painter. While Johnny Cash and Ray Charles, both recipients of recent biopics which portrayed them as flawed geniuses, leave behind songs that crystallise their brilliance while forgiving various personality traits, Marks&apos;s main legacy is likely to be a greater tendency towards short-term memory loss in the general UK population. But perhaps I&apos;m being a kill-joy. Are you looking forward to Mr Nice? And is Marks a suitable subject for hagiography? Do you expect the film to tell it straight, or stick to the positive line pushed in the book?", "sentences": ["And when the government downgraded the substance to Grade C in 2002, it seemed only a matter of time before we saw Amsterdam-style coffee shops on the streets of London, Birmingham and Manchester."], "title": "Naughty but Mr Nice?

Sunderland are in the Netherlands this weekend to play in the Amsterdam Tournament but Bruce has suggested this will not hinder his attempts to add to the squad. Bruce was extremely disappointed to see his ambitious \u00a312m bid to land the England striker Peter Crouch from Portsmouth collapse earlier this week but he is rather more hopeful on Chamakh. His interest in Bent is long-standing. The club&apos;s chairman, Niall Quinn, is expected to hold talks with Bordeaux and Tottenham over the weekend and at least one of the players could be introduced as early as next week. &quot;Chamakh is a player I&apos;ve liked for a long, long time,&quot; the Sunderland manager said. &quot;We have shown an interest and we&apos;ll see what develops with that. He is one of a few we are looking at and we will decide soon. Niall got back on Thursday and there will be high-level talks going on over the weekend, not just about him, but regarding other targets as well. &quot;We&apos;ve still got one or two irons in the fire like we&apos;ve had for weeks. We&apos;re still trying and we&apos;re close, in particular, to one deal being done over the next couple of days. But, after what has happened this week with Peter Crouch, I don&apos;t want to say too much. That was a massive disappointment and you can never say &apos;yes&apos;, the deal is done, until everything has actually been done.&quot; Despite his joy at getting the Sunderland job, Bruce has found it rather more difficult to sign players this summer than he envisaged before moving from Wigan Athletic. Crouch would not sign because he did not want to live in the North-east and Bruce claims the lavish spending of clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester City has made it an extremely difficult market place. Bruce has signed the Paraguay captain, Paulo Da Silva, on a Bosman transfer this summer as well as Fraizer Campbell from Manchester United but he is still looking to strengthen in every department before the transfer window shuts. He said: &quot;Prices have been inflated. It&apos;s not just the \u00a380m Real Madrid paid for Ronaldo, it&apos;s the emergence of Manchester City. They are one of the elite now and they are spending a lot of money. &quot;That has made it very hard for the rest of us because everyone has got that little bit more expensive.

If each rumour takes about 20 seconds to monger then that makes 360 minutes, or exactly six hours spent pedalling aimless, often entirely fabricated rumour - in this window alone. The Mill might as well have just taken a really deep breath and got it all over in one go, like Lenny Henry on Tiswas saying &quot;Ooooooooooooooooooo-kaaaaaaaaaaaay&quot; for ages.

So this morning in The Sun we&apos;ve got &quot;Klaas war&quot;. Yes, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has smudged his face with boot blacking, placed an inflammatory red beret on top of his greying bouffant and gone out to liberate some Betamax VCRs from Dixons. Plus he&apos;s also &quot;ready to challenge Spurs in the race for Real Madrid striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar&quot;, who really doesn&apos;t want to have to live in Stuttgart. He&apos;ll cost \u00a316.5m, or \u2154 of an Adebayor. Adebayor, by the way, is claiming &quot;Arsenal fans drove me out&quot;, although from the picture next to the headline it looks as though he&apos;s been specifically telling Nelson Mandela this. No doubt what Nelson said in reply was: if they&apos;d spotted you hitching your way north along the Holloway Road, most of them would have been delighted to get the chance. Now, can I drive you out of here too? I&apos;ve got the Focus out the front. Also in the Sun, Rob Lee has warned Newcastle fans that Alan Shearer will soon &quot;disappear&quot;, which is a neat trick. Liverpool could be about to be bought out: but not, sadly, by the world&apos;s third richest man, ambitious chewing gum trillionaire Sheikh Al-Nutcase. Instead, by some Scousers.

Anderlecht&apos;s Argentinean midfielder Luca Biglia, who sounds like a minor mob captain in a long-running mafia-based premium TV series, who ends up being blackmailed by the feds into wearing wire and is eventually murdered in an imaginative and mildly amusing manner, wants to play for Liverpool. This, according to his agent, is so that he can &quot;play with his childhood friend Javier Mascherano&quot;, and not anything to do with 5% of \u00a340,000-a-week.

But, oh dear, poor tired Steve Finnan has gone straight to bed. The Daily Star is pretending Liverpool seriously want to re-sign ultimately disappointing if likeable powder-puff targetman Peter Crouch for \u00a312m, a story constructed using the Damien Hirst-inspired random spattering spin-rumour technique. In the Daily Mail, Arsenal and Wolfsburg are in a funk over 46-year-old Obafemi Martins, who can remember when you had proper shops in the high street, not all these chains. Fulham, West Ham, Tottenham and Portsmouth are all &quot;in talks over a possible deal&quot; with Juventus midfielder Christian Poulsen, which must be quite loud and also confusing. Hull want to sign Ross McCormack, who&apos;s quite good but slightly too chunky. And Roy Keane is brooding in a dark room somewhere over banjo-playing, fried chicken foot-eating Charlton wonderkid Jonjo Shelvey. In the Daily Mirror, Martin Jol&apos;s enormous head wants to introduce Gareth Bale to a more liberated and civilised life among the trams, canals, flea markets and dribblingly incomprehensible stag parties of Amsterdam. Roma are also sniffing about. In the Times, Fenerbahce have been leafing obsessively through their Euro 2000 Panini sticker album and have become uncontrollably excited about promising centre-forward Andriy Shevchenko.

Ibrahimovic will probably show up at Camp Nou some time in November, do an amazing mid-air back flick and then go to sleep for a bit. And Father Jack&apos;s favourite team, Aris Salonika of Greece want to sign Fulham&apos;s Hameur Bouazza. Sweaty-palmed show-off Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido says Milan can&apos;t afford Luis Fabiano&apos;s \u00a315m barcode (the Mill no longer uses price tags) on Goal.com.

Lokomotiv Moscow didn&apos;t exactly do it in a blaze of glory, losing 2-0 to Arsenal, but Internazionale&apos;s inability to win away to Dynamo Kyiv secured Loko second spot in the group on a better head-to-head record. In the last 16, they lost on away goals to Monaco, who went on to reach the final. That season, when Jose Mourinho&apos;s Porto were champions, seemed to offer hope to the lesser lights (that is, everybody who wasn&apos;t already established as a top-three or four club in Spain, Italy or England). Given the money that was sloshing into Russian football, it was possible to see a future in which their sides would come, if not to dominate Europe, then at least to compete regularly in the latter stages. And to an extent, that has come to pass, although only in the Uefa Cup. As Dynamo Moscow face up to tonight&apos;s third-round qualifier against Celtic, and Rubin Kazan and CSKA Moscow prepare for the group stage, though, their primary objective is simply to make it to the last 16, and end one of the more baffling runs of failure in European football. After all, diminished as the Uefa Cup/Europa League is, CSKA and Zenit still had to beat a string of decent sides to win it. The issue is partly climatic: put briefly, by September, when the Champions League group stages get under way, Russian sides are jaded as they near the end of a season that begins as early as March. Come the spring, if they are still in the Uefa Cup, they are refreshed from the lengthy break between seasons, and take advantage against tiring sides from western Europe whose domestic season continues through the winter. There may also still be a mental factor at work. Yegor Titov once said he so disliked leaving Russia that he felt sick as soon as the wheels of the plane he was on left the runway at Moscow airport and, while Russia is far more integrated with western Europe than it was a decade ago, there remains a sense of the Slavic soul as something apart. One of the key achievements of Guus Hiddink, a number of players have noted, has been to dispel the inferiority complex Russian players habitually suffered, something that was magnified by a conviction that western referees were under orders to disrupt communist or post-communist clubs. That was probably Cold War paranoia, but it is valid to ask why, having made such a mess of the USSR&apos;s 4-3 extra-time defeat to Belgium in the 1986 World Cup, the Swedish referee Erik Frederiksson was allowed to take charge of their group game against Argentina in 1990, in which he failed to punish Diego Maradona for clearing an Oleg Kuznetsov header off the line with his hand. A shadow of that insecurity perhaps lingers at club level. But, as Why England Lose, a new book by Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski, explains, there are other factors at work. The book, it should be said, is quite magnificent, a sort of Freakonomics for football, using economic theory and methods to dispel myths and explain odd trends in the game. One of the oddest is the fact that no team from the capital of a democratic country has won the European Cup (or Champions League), with the exception of Real Madrid, whose brand was forged when Spain was still a dictatorship (and Ajax, of course, although given that the seat of the Dutch government has been the Hague since 1588, Amsterdam&apos;s position as capital of the Netherlands is highly unusual, and was only ratified in the constitution in 1983). Allied to that \u2013 and more relevant in this context \u2013 is the even odder fact that no side from any of the seven largest metropolitan areas of Europe \u2013 Istanbul, Paris, Moscow, London, St Petersburg, Berlin and Athens \u2013 has ever won the European Cup. Clubs from totalitarian capitals thrive because dictators centralise \u2013 hence the successes of Real Madrid under General Francisco Franco, Benfica under Antonio Salazar and Steaua Bucharest under Nicolae Ceausescu. Yet there is also a focus of resources on democratic capitals \u2013 particularly in the cases of London and Paris. So why should they not similarly prosper? Kuper and Szysmanki put forward two theories. Firstly, they suggest that it may be that fewer good players come from capitals simply because there is less room for them to play. That may be true of Paris, but Greater London has produced 179 England internationals \u2013 more than any other region. Admittedly, per head of population, it lags far behind County Durham and Tyne and Wear, which suggests pit villages (urban enough for there to be other players to play against; rural enough to give them space to do so) may once have been the perfect breeding grounds, but one industrial backstreet would seem much the same as another. More convincing is their point about psychology. London is a great city; it doesn&apos;t need the validation success in football can bring. Football&apos;s boom was a product of the industrial revolution. Workers pouring into the great new cities found football provided both a leisure activity and a sense of community, and when the Factories Act gave them Saturday afternoons off, they had opportunity. For years the classic club chairman was the local businessman made good, either putting something back into his local community, or seeking to enhance his status through football (it wasn&apos;t until 1981 that the FA permitted directors to make a profit from their clubs). Football success went to the industrial heartlands: in England, the shipbuilding and mining cities of the north-east, the textile centres of the north-west. Juventus became powerful with an influx of workers to work at the Fiat plant, and with the investment of the Agnelli family. But in that era, even quite small cities could be successful: the likes of Bruges, Malmo, St Etienne and Monchengladbach produced sides that reached the final, while Nottingham Forest won it twice. But then the game changed. Big city clubs, even then, had more resources, but their pursuit of success was not sufficiently ruthless to use them as they do now. The 80s saw a radical shift in the ethos of the game \u2013 money became all. Since 1982, PSV Eindhoven have been the only winners of the European Cup from a metropolitan area with a population of under 1.2 million. The big cities came to dominate. In England, 1983 saw the end of the practice of sharing gate receipts between home and away sides, increasing the advantage for the big clubs with big crowds. Growing television revenues made the glamorous more glamorous. And at the same time, at least in western Europe, industry was in retreat. The Champions League has only exacerbated the process: the rich have got richer and success has gone only to the largest cities. Having a pre-existing brand helps (nobody has won the Champions League for the first time since Borussia Dortmund in 1997) \u2013 which explains Liverpool&apos;s over-performance in terms of population \u2013 but really, it&apos;s all about money. The dominant sides in Europe today come from metropolitan areas with populations of 2-4 million \u2013 Manchester, Milan, Barcelona and Munich \u2013 which are, as Kuper and Syszmanski put it, &quot;big enough to produce the required fan base, yet provincial enough to generate a yearning for global recognition&quot;. Only Real Madrid, whose stadium was build and brand established under Franco, buck the trend. So what does that mean for Russian clubs? Well, it may take a few years, but the outlook is broadly positive \u2013 at least for Zenit. True, no Russian side has ever won the Champions League, but Chelsea and Arsenal have come close enough in recent seasons to suggest that the might of a vast city might now be enough to override the lack of history \u2013 their brands are secure. In Russia, however you choose to define its system of government, the wealth has tended to be concentrated at the centre. That should be a positive sign for the Moscow clubs, but Russia&apos;s football development is not like that of other countries. The last two seasons have seen only the second and third provincial winners of the Russian title, as the championship has gone to Zenit and Rubin Kazan. The grip of Moscow is slipping, while the most cursory comparison of attendances in Moscow to the provincial cities suggests that Muscovites feel little need for validation through football. St Petersburg, though, is a one-club city with a huge population. A 2008 survey by the market research company Sport+Markt suggested Zenit was the fifth-best supported side in Europe (behind Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea, but ahead of Liverpool, Arsenal, Milan, Bayern Munich and Juventus; CSKA Moscow were 11th). That might not equate to huge attendances at the stadium \u2013 although they will grow once the decrepit Petrovsky Stadium is replaced with the 60,000 Gazprom Arena in 2011 \u2013 but it does provide an enormous television market, something that will become ever more important as and when clubs begin to negotiate their own television deals, particularly if pay-per-view takes off. And St Petersburg has both the backing of Gazprom, an energy giant, and a clear and present desire to assert itself in the face of years of Moscow dominance. All the components are in place, and while that might not guarantee success, it should help. None of which, of course, will matter much to Celtic. All they need to know is that, after a great start to the season, Dynamo&apos;s form is patchy , that they play neat attacking football under Andrey Kobelev, that the centre-forward Alexander Kerzhakov is back in form after his ill-fated two years with Sevilla, and that as Russian twins go, Kirill and Dmitry Kombarov, who operate in midfield for Dynamo, are much, much better than the lumbering Berezutskys at CSKA.", "sentences": ["One of the oddest is the fact that no team from the capital of a democratic country has won the European Cup (or Champions League), with the exception of Real Madrid, whose brand was forged when Spain was still a dictatorship (and Ajax, of course, although given that the seat of the Dutch government has been the Hague since 1588, Amsterdam&apos;s position as capital of the Netherlands is highly unusual, and was only ratified in the constitution in 1983)."], "title": "Celtic stand in the way as Dynamo search for an answer to Russia's European conundrum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/29/celtic-dynamo-moscow-champions-league", "tags": ["Champions League", "Dynamo Moscow", "Zenit St Petersburg", "Football", "Sport", "Russia", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-07-30T10:25:22Z", "article": "Shares in business-to-business publishing and information group Reed Elsevier plunged by 14% today after the Anglo-Dutch company said today it would sell new shares to cut its debt pile.

Ryanair, for example, is wondering whether it can abolish seats altogether in its aircraft. Now, according to Niamh Simms, its rival easyJet is penalising those reckless enough to spawn children. Investigating flights from Edinburgh to Amsterdam she tested prices with a quote for one adult. The outward bound leg came in at \u00a345.99 and the return was \u00a310 cheaper. Satisfied she had a bargain she set about booking tickets for two adults and two children whereupon the cost of each seat shot up by a fiver. She then tried one adult and two children and found she would have to pay \u00a33.33 a head more than the original quote. &quot;It appears obvious to me that easyJet is deliberately inflating the cost of travelling with children, and I wonder if this is illegal,&quot; she says. &quot;Children take up only the same seat as an adult. Surely it is unethical at the very least and deserves to be highlighted to other cash-strapped families.&quot; Simms happens to have stumbled upon the logic of supply and demand that governs airlines. Shops start prices high then cut them as the seasons wear on. Airlines start them cheap then hike them as departure day looms. EasyJet explains: &quot;The fare increases when booking more than one person because each flight is broken down into different price brackets. Once the passenger limit has been reached for each bracket then the price will be increased. It doesn&apos;t matter that it is a family travelling with children or six adults.&quot; So Simms&apos;s children tipped her party into the next price bracket. The airline says the exact number of seats in each price bracket and the price difference between them varies according to the popularity of the flight.

Another 2,160 miles are under construction. Yet another 5,280 miles are planned. More than 10,000 miles in all. Britain has just 68 miles and the planning for more began a mere six months ago. It&apos;s humiliating. In this key 21st-century capability, Britain is a banana republic. Take a look at the map of Europe. It is obvious that within just a few years, London, Paris, Madrid, Frankfurt, Barcelona, Brussels, Amsterdam and Berlin are going to be hooked up by trains hurtling regularly between each city, London using the country&apos;s sole 68 high-speed miles to the Channel Tunnel to connect to the wider network. The experience of the Japanese Shinkansen high-speed network foretells what will happen \u2013 those cities that are part of the system will blossom industrially and commercially. Those outside it will wilt. Which is why anyone reading this column outside London should take a close and passionate interest in transport secretary Lord Andrew Adonis&apos;s plans to create a high-speed railway between London and Glasgow, via Edinburgh, Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham. This is &quot;High Speed 2&quot;, in contrast to &quot;High Speed 1&quot; which links the Channel Tunnel and St Pancras. It is a belated attempt to catch up, bringing the rest of the country into a key, low-carbon transport technology from which, outrageously, it has been excluded. Some readers will think: &quot;So what?&quot; They will argue that it does not really matter whether it takes 90 or 45 minutes to make the journey from London to Birmingham \u2013 or five hours or three hours from Edinburgh to London. A tunnel under the Pennines to link Leeds and Manchester \u2013 the current trans-Pennine &quot;express&quot; takes an amazingly long 55 minutes to travel 45 short miles \u2013 is a white elephant, despite shortening the journey time to 15 minutes. The overall price tag \u2013 some \u00a320bn \u2013 is ludicrously high for a country with budget deficits of \u00a3 175bn a year. We cannot afford and do not need this line. Wrong. Economic growth and development are driven by what innovation theorists call general purpose technologies. A general purpose technology is one that transforms economies and societies. The wheel was a general purpose technology. So was the Portuguese invention of the three-masted caravel in the 15th century that allowed ships to become ocean- going, leading to European long-distance trade, colonisation and the emergence of a rich European merchant class. So was the printing press. And so was the railway in the 19th century. Railways did not just get passengers from A to B faster than horses. The railway consolidated nations and national markets. It created new cities and city suburbs. It allowed the European powers to open up their colonies. Rail transformed the military geography of the world. For the first time, people en masse began to move away from their home towns and villages, massively enlarging the gene pool. Railways, like the internet and biotechnology today, were a genuine general purpose technology. The intriguing question is whether high-speed rail will be as transformative. My hunch is that it will. One of the advantages of London over other parts of the country is that there is a critical mass of 8 million rich consumers crowded into one urban space. It makes the economics of everything from theatre to horticulture, medicine to hi-tech manufacturing radically different. Why is it so ludicrous to think that Manchester and Leeds could be linked by a tunnel with a dozen trains an hour pumping through it on a 15-minute journey, so creating an urban space equal to London? The Italians have built a much longer tunnel between Bologna and Florence for their high-speed network. It has been obvious for the last 20 years that cities and city regions are emerging as the new drivers of economic growth, especially if their hinterland has a high proportion of industries requiring a lot of brainpower. These fast-growing &quot;ideopolises&quot; tend, as research at the Work Foundation underlines, to trade with each other rather than poorer, less creative cities. What the European high-speed network will do is to create a network of fast-growing ideopolises, breaking down borders and exponentially opening up traffic. You need to be on the line. The last minister with the imagination and energy to get anything done in transport was Michael Heseltine, who forced through the Jubilee Line, the Docklands Light Railway and High Speed 1. Financing is comparatively easy if you have sufficient chutzpah, which Adonis certainly has, even if he&apos;s unsettlingly hazy about the detail. High-speed rail commands a 30% premium on fare prices. Top that up with a supplementary business rate and a national infrastructure bank could easily earmark the revenue to raise \u00a320bn to pay for construction, with repayments spread over, say, 40 years. If the private sector owned a majority of a national infrastructure bank, the lending would be categorised as private. Even if it counted as public debt, we should learn to welcome debt that generates assets of the quality of a high-speed rail network. Britain had national debt in excess of GDP between 1750 and 1850. Greatness requires debt on this scale. Only countries with no ambition allow debt to trump their aims. What is needed is political leadership, some dynamism and willingness to take risks. Even close friends of Adonis&apos;s predecessor, Geoff Hoon, would hardly argue he was dynamic \u2013 a do-as-little-as-possible politician in the mould of Boris Johnson. Few ministers do take the initiative. They are overwhelmed by the round of endless meetings, officials who are more keenly aware of the risks than the rewards of any action and who want to keep their secretary of state out of trouble.  Thus chancellor Alistair Darling, for all his virtues as a good man in a crisis, has not used the once-in-a-century opportunity to reshape the British financial system. Too risky. Requires too much daring. There is no plan for a British national infrastructure bank \u2013 despite the progress being made on the idea in the US \u2013 and already Treasury officials are looking to kill High Speed 2 as part of the crazed assault on the budget deficit. Adonis hopes to outflank them by taking High Speed 2 out of politics. The idea is to get all three parties to commit to the line in their manifestos and so make cancellation impossible. If so, Britain might have built 400 miles of high-speed rail by 2025. France is building 400 miles alone this year. If it were not for Andrew Adonis, Britain would not even be planning that. A few more like him (and Heseltine) and we may be able to move around our country faster.", "sentences": ["It is obvious that within just a few years, London, Paris, Madrid, Frankfurt, Barcelona, Brussels, Amsterdam and Berlin are going to be hooked up by trains hurtling regularly between each city, London using the country&apos;s sole 68 high-speed miles to the Channel Tunnel to connect to the wider network."], "title": "Don't let the defeatists and cynics talk down Britain's need for speed | Will Hutton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/02/will-hutton-railways-transport", "tags": ["Transport policy", "Transport", "UK news", "World news", "Politics", "Rail transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-03T06:27:40Z", "article": "ESPN is to launch its biggest marketing push in three years with a multimillion-pound ad campaign announcing the launch of its new British sports channel today using the strapline &quot;It&apos;s great to be here&quot;.

Hoping to keep our nine-year-old engaged, she whispered occasional observations in his ear \u2013 a theme here, an instrument there, things that he could listen out for. At the concert&apos;s end, two members of the almost entirely silver-haired audience, bristling with rage, accused them of having &quot;ruined&quot; their concert experience. My wife was mortified, and it will be hard to persuade her to take the boys to a concert again. I&apos;d like to explode a few myths about what we call classical music. It&apos;s not high art for the titillation of a chosen few. What composers express, and what I (and most other musicians) tune in to, is the raw material of life as captured in a score: the passion, the grief, the highs, the sheer brain food. These are the things that make me and so many others engage with music; this is what makes listening and playing so deeply satisfying. It&apos;s also why I&apos;m determined to bust classical music out of the ivory tower and into spaces where anyone and everyone can go. Time Out&apos;s classical music editor, Jonathan Lennie, recently caused a small storm when he complained about &quot;overenthusiastic clapping&quot; at concerts, sometimes between movements. He was invited on to Radio\u00a04&apos;s Today programme to talk about it, where he sounded a somewhat more conciliatory note: he didn&apos;t want to issue diktats on appropriate behaviour, &quot;but [to] start a debate about when an audience should clap&quot;. Oh, please. In Somerset, where I live, clapping prefects are woefully underemployed, there being no concert halls to speak of. Later this month, I&apos;m launching Play the Field, a new breed of orchestral festival there, conducting two high-octane nights of Holst and Haydn, with some of the very best orchestral players around. Not in a cathedral or any august temple\u00a0of the arts, but in a field on the\u00a0Somerset Levels. There have, of course, been orchestral concerts performed in the open air before. But those I have seen have tended to be indifferent performances by under-rehearsed orchestras and third-rate conductors, playing bleeding chunks of sugary music. Has anyone heard the Amsterdam Concertgebouw orchestra perform in a field? Or Simon Rattle conduct under the stars? I thought not \u2013 but why should the very best orchestral music be served only at the Barbicans or the Carnegie Halls of this world? I want people to hear really exciting music played by the best, but in a context where they can clap when they want to, chase their toddlers, drink beer, take photos, get lost in the music and generally be themselves. And because a field has no rules, it&apos;s the perfect place to create unlikely combinations of musical genres. Musical &quot;fusion&quot; projects have earned themselves a bad name, but that&apos;s mainly because they often involve pop artists conscripting orchestras to play unimaginative backdrops to their acts.\u00a0What&apos;s really exciting is when you\u00a0spark off a dialogue between very different musical forces. For this year&apos;s festival, I have invited six contemporary musicians to respond to Holst&apos;s Planets. In between performances of the orchestral sections, my band, the All Stars (which includes Goldfrapp&apos;s Will Gregory and Portishead&apos;s Adrian Utley), will play spontaneous electronic responses to Holst&apos;s music from across the parkland, incorporating material sampled from the orchestra&apos;s performance. The effect should be that of Holst&apos;s score set in a kind of ambient relief. It still amazes me how many musicians aren&apos;t really interested in engaging with their audience at all. Alfred Brendel, a pianist for whom I have the greatest respect, has described performance as a sacred communion between the artist and the\u00a0composer. But what about the audience? Music is communication, a\u00a0two-way street. If I&apos;m conducting several nights of an opera, the pace, colour and mood of each show will be directly affected by each evening&apos;s audience. At every live event, there is a tangible relationship between the spectators and the artists, and so there should be. Concerts used to be much more of a free-for-all, with the world and his wife (and children) enjoying the music in joyful disarray, at some remove from today&apos;s formality. Somewhere along the line, we have forgotten that great music can be rude and visceral; we have put conductors on pedestals, and turned our audiences into passive subjects. I&apos;d like to get back to something more \u2013 well, fun. The symphony orchestra has its place in the great concert halls, but it also needs an outing from time to time \u2013 an opportunity to be amplified to the hilt and to blaze across the countryside.", "sentences": ["Has anyone heard the Amsterdam Concertgebouw orchestra perform in a field?"], "title": "Why classical concerts need a breath of fresh air", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/03/classical-concerts-fresh-air", "tags": ["Classical music", "Festivals", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-04T08:33:30Z", "article": "Happy birthday to you!

With no shortage of famous folk set to blow out candles on cakes all over the world today, the Rumour Mill spent the last few days deep underground in the Guardian archives department peering at little tubes of microfiche before deciding not to bother opening them, so we look to the internet instead in our bid to find out what else of interest happened on this day in history. Did you know, for example, that George Washington became a master mason on this day in 1753, while 4 August is also the aniversary of Anne Frank complaining so loudly about breaking the nib of the pencil she was using to write her diary, that Nazi soldiers heard her grumbling, went to investigate and found her family in that Amsterdam attic. Racing driver Juan Fangio won his final race, capturing the world driving championship for the fifth consecutive year on this day in 1957, while today is also the 26th anniversary of New York Yankee star Dave Winfield being arrested for &quot;causing unnecessary suffering to an animal&quot; after accidentally killing a seagull during a warm-up. Luckily, tomorrow is the 26th anniversary of the charges being dropped, which means the outfielder, once the highest-paid player in baseball history, didn&apos;t end up doing bird. The Rumour Mill can only hope that future generations of football speculation peddlars struggling badly for a hook on which to hang their daily column end up commemorating this as the date in history that Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso finally signed for Real Madrid. Although the clubs are believed to have reached an \u00a38m impasse over their valuation of the player, the transfer is almost certain to go through and different reports have the Merseysiders agreeing a deal in principle with Roma to take \u00a325m-rated Alberto Aquilani as a replacement for the Spaniard. Elsewhere, the agent of the Standard Li\u00e8ge midfielder Steven Defour claims his client is in the frame to go to whichever of the two clubs ends up Alonso-less. It would be predictable, uninspired and downright lazy to introduce a snippet of transfer speculation linking the Porto striker Hulk with a lame gag about Chelsea&apos;s Premier League rivals turning green with envy now that it&apos;s emerged that Roman Abramovich is considering paying the \u00a340m buy-out clause on the contract of the Brazilian, so that&apos;s exactly what we&apos;ve done. Now it&apos;s time to move swiftly along to the snippet in the Sun linking Chelsea&apos;s occasionally inspired Ivorian international Salomon Kalou with an \u00a38m move to Arsenal. The news that the Arsenal boss Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is also interested in buying Toulouse striker and last season&apos;s Ligue 1 top-scorer Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac will come as a relief to Gooners everywhere, many of whom were beginning to despair of their manager being linked with the purchase of anything more interesting than a newspaper, a pint of milk or a loaf of bread this summer. Meanwhile in Spain ... or Italy ... or the Netherlands ... or wherever he happens to be at the moment, Wesley Sneijder&apos;s agent has been accosting bewildered passers-by on the street, telling them that the Real Madrid midfielder is not \u2013 repeat not \u2013 going to Internazionale. With Aston Villa also chasing the Dutchman, this will come as good news for Martin O&apos;Neill ... at least until he realises that a footballer who isn&apos;t interested in upping sticks and moving to Milan, is unlikely to fancy living in Birmingham. Having been told that he doesn&apos;t feature in the plans of the Benfica manager Jorge Jesus, American wunderkind Freddy Adu, 38, has been hawking himself around the Eredivisie ... not that he&apos;s prepared to play for just anyone, mind. &quot;I do not say that I want to [go to] Ajax and Feyenoord,&quot; he said. &quot;In that respect I am not picky. I would find it wonderful if I could get a chance at NAC Breda and FC Groningen. Anywhere.&quot; If your five-a-side team&apos;s a man down and no one else can help ... and you can find him, why not call the Adu-team? According to the Daily Mail, Hull City are &quot;eyeing&quot; the Celta Vigo striker Kamel Ghilas, a disturbing turn of phrase that for some reason conjures up images of Phil Brown wearing a very short silk kimono, that we don&apos;t really need infiltrating our head at the best of times, let alone this early in the morning. And finally, today&apos;s Sun reveals that Emmanuel Adebayor has bought Ronaldo&apos;s old love-shack in Alderly Edge, Cheshire, for \u00a35.5m after outbidding his new team-mates Kolo Tour\u00e9, Gareth Barry, and Carlos Tevez, not to mention the Manchester United winger Antonio Valencia.

Does this mean that the parts of our brains that govern music develop at an earlier stage than our visual mind? Although most children make art, it doesn&apos;t usually look like great adult art. In fact, the influence of children on modern art was precisely to unleash the power of art brut, &quot;raw art&quot;. But Mozart was composing and playing to the highest conventional standards as a child, as the performance of two pieces composed when he was eight has just demonstrated. A painting that Michelangelo did as a teenager is currently on view at the Metropolitan Museum, New York. A news story surfaced at the end of last week about a five-year-old watercolourist. But there are far more examples of great artists who started late than ones who started early. We speak of late Titian and late Matisse \u2013 in fact, Matisse became interested in art as an adult.  But child prodigy painters do, in fact, exist. Just look at Jan Lievens. I recently saw an eye-opening exhibition of this 17th-century Dutch artist&apos;s work in Amsterdam, where it had toured from the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. Here was an artist who really did paint grown-up masterpieces when he was very young.  When Lievens was 14 he was already amazing the town of Leiden with ambitious historical paintings and low-life scenes. There was a deep originality to these youthful works \u2013 their golden light, soft heroic grandeur and baroque, rollicking freedom made them stand out. His youthful art is serious and profound; it&apos;s not just technically, but emotionally advanced. Lievens had a gifted contemporary in Leiden: the young Rembrandt. They were friends, and shared a studio. You can genuinely see how Rembrandt was influenced by the prodigious works of his friend \u2013 and went on being influenced by him. He took their shared heroic style to heights that Lievens never achieved.

Adonis rejected claims by O&apos;Leary that investing billions in high-speed rail in the UK to replace short-haul flights would be &quot;insane&quot;. O&apos;Leary told the Guardian there would still be heavy demand to travel by air between the UK and Europe because the Channel tunnel is the only rail link between Britain and the continent. Airlines including British Airways echoed O&apos;Leary&apos;s comments yesterday, though in more diplomatic terms. The industry backlash came after Adonis said the government hoped to progressively replace short-haul flights with a 250mph train network in the UK. Responding to the criticism today, the transport secretary said high-speed rail already controlled 80% of the London to Paris and Brussels market, with a new Dutch high-speed line set to add Amsterdam to the list of rail destinations from the capital. &quot;Those who think that the airlines will continue to monopolise short-haul European destinations from London have got their heads in the sand,&quot; he said. &quot;It is nonsense to suggest that high-speed rail will be competitive with airlines only for internal British journeys. High-speed rail already has the lion&apos;s share of the London to Paris and Brussels market. Once the Dutch high-speed line from Brussels to Amsterdam is open later this year, rail will be competitive from London to Amsterdam and Rotterdam; and it won&apos;t be long before the same is true of Cologne and Frankfurt.&quot; Earlier, O&apos;Leary, the chief executive of Europe&apos;s largest short-haul airline, warned against making cross-Channel rail services the main conduit between the UK and Europe. &quot;It is insane. The only link you have is one highly priced tunnel. People are not going to travel to the UK regions, including the Lake District and Cornwall, on a [Eurostar] train that only stops at Kent and London St Pancras,&quot; he said. O&apos;Leary was slightly less scathing about switching domestic air passengers to rail, describing it is as a &quot;valid alternative if you don&apos;t mind the inefficiency and high cost of rail services&quot;. Profitable airlines were already being hit hard by air passenger duty while the rail network received billions of pounds in subsidies, O&apos;Leary said. &quot;On [return] domestic flights from Glasgow to London, passengers are paying \u00a320 in taxes while they continue to subsidise the shit out of the railways. Substituting one form of transport that is heavily taxed for a form of transport that is heavily subsidised is not the answer.&quot; British Airways expressed scepticism at Lord Adonis&apos;s comments. The airline backs Department for Transport plans to run a new high-speed line via Heathrow airport and on to the rest of the UK, but a spokesperson said it would be impractical to target flights to more distant short-haul destinations such as Madrid, Rome and Prague. &quot;High-speed rail cannot be a complete substitute for flying,&quot; the company said. &quot;There are relatively few destinations in continental Europe to which it would be practical to travel and return by rail in a day. Therefore flying will always remain the preferred form of transport for millions of travellers.&quot; The pro-aviation lobby group Flying Matters warned that certain domestic routes, including airports such as Exeter and Aberdeen, would still have to operate internal flights to a hub airport such as Heathrow because a high-speed link was unlikely to reach those cities. &quot;Some journeys would present real practical problems,&quot; said Michelle Di Leo, the director of Flying Matters. &quot;For example, how would you get from Edinburgh to Belfast by train in a reasonable amount of time? You can&apos;t force people to use options which don&apos;t currently exist.&quot; The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents more than 200 major airlines worldwide, including BA and Virgin Atlantic, said a country that had taken decades to plan a third runway at Heathrow airport could take even longer to plan a high-speed rail network. It said a recent report published by experts at the University of Berkeley, California, calculated that the greenhouse gas emissions of train travel could be more than double current estimates. Fuel use is normally the main factor in calculating a transport mode&apos;s emissions, but the Berkeley report included emissions from building and maintaining vehicles, as well as building the infrastructure that carries them. Once those factors were added in, the report said, the carbon dioxide emitted by trains was far higher than expected. &quot;When building 3km of runway takes decades, the challenges of criss-crossing the country corridors of high-speed rail infrastructure will be enormous,&quot; an IATA spokesperson said. &quot;And for what gain? Putting aside the astronomical costs and timescales of such a project, has the secretary thought about the\u00a0total carbon lifecycle\u00a0impact of building\u00a0so much rail infrastructure?

The future of the 25-year-old at Real Madrid has been the subject of speculation this week. Following Real&apos;s splurge in the transfer market this summer it was believed he would be surplus to requirements at the Bernab\u00e9u. The player&apos;s agent, Soren Lerby, then claimed that the La Liga club wanted to keep Sneijder, but it had also been reported that Internazionale might take him on loan for \u20ac4m (\u00a33.4m), with an option to but him outright for \u20ac18m (\u00a315.4m). That interest, however, seems to have cooled and the ensuing uncertainty about Sneijder&apos;s next move seems to have caught O&apos;Neill&apos;s eye. &quot;I think that the more creativity you have in your side the better chance you will have,&quot; the Villa manager said. &quot;These are particularly special players who are not [generally] available. If there were players like Sneijder, who have great talent and might be surplus to requirements at a club that is buying [new players], then I think you should be interested, even if that interest is not reciprocated. Because how else are you going to try and improve your team?&quot; O&apos;Neill has more pressing and pragmatic objectives. He believes that the loss of Martin Laursen was the principal reason for Villa&apos;s decline last season, following a strong start. The centre-back has since been forced to retire and following the sale of Zat Knight to Bolton Wanderers, O&apos;Neill&apos;s only experienced candidates for the heart of his defence are Curtis Davies and Carlos Cu\u00e9llar. O&apos;Neill is hopeful of making signings soon and is rumoured to be interested in the Newcastle United full-back Habib Beye. The purchase of Portsmouth&apos;s Sylvain Distin also seems possible. It is not only the defence that concerns the manager, however. Although he took the opportunity to buy Stewart Downing from Middlesbrough as soon as he could, the midfielder&apos;s ankle injury will prevent him from playing until the end of the year. At the same time, Villa will have to rejig their midfield following the sale of Gareth Barry to Manchester City. Fabian Delph, the 19-year-old whom Villa signed from Leeds United for an initial \u00a36m this week, spoke of settling down and becoming stronger, but O&apos;Neill hopes that he will establish himself quickly. The manager confirmed that Delph will play in Saturday&apos;sfriendly against Fiorentina. He is, however, concerned by the more disruptive sort of friendlies and regards England&apos;s match in Amsterdam next Wednesday as &quot;pointless&quot;. He is also peeved by a World Cup schedule that has placed qualifiers on that night, close to the opening of the Premier League. &quot;In a week where we will be trying to prepare for the start of the season, we will not see a lot of our players until Friday morning before the Wigan game,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["He is, however, concerned by the more disruptive sort of friendlies and regards England&apos;s match in Amsterdam next Wednesday as &quot;pointless&quot;."], "title": "Martin O'Neill signals Aston Villa interest in Wesley Sneijder", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/06/aston-villa-martin-oneill-wesley-sneijder", "tags": ["Aston Villa", "Martin O'Neill", "Premier League", "Real Madrid", "La Liga", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-07T13:00:00Z", "article": "What&apos;s your favourite piece of technology, and how has it improved your life?I wasn&apos;t sure about my iPhone until I got a little lost one day and used the maps function. Oh. My. God. Now I have managed to replace all my map-reading skills and orientation training with the ability to touch a screen and follow a blue dot. Sad, but brilliant. When was the last time you used it, and what for?Last night, just before I went on stage, I played Paper Toss on my iPhone for about 20 minutes. That&apos;s right, I sat next to an actual bin with an actual pad of paper in front of me, and played a virtual game of tossing virtual paper into a virtual bin. I like to think I was helping the environment. What additional features would you add if you could?I would add a &quot;Life&quot; button, that would enable you to experience actual life every once in a while. You hit the button, and the phone switches itself off for half an hour, thus allowing you to look around and have a life. But only for half an hour \u2013 you don&apos;t want to get addicted to it. Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years&apos; time?Either humans will develop the ability to communicate telepathically, thus rendering all mobile phones obsolete, or we will completely lose the ability to interact with the real world unless it is filtered through a phone/computer/television, thus rendering reality obsolete. In my mind, right now it could go either way. What always frustrates you about technology in general?I realise the idea of technology is to constantly be improved, but can&apos;t we just have one piece of technology that doesn&apos;t need to be updated within six months of purchasing it? My grandfather just bought a new fridge after 30 years. He had to throw the old one off a balcony because it was too big to manouevre down the stairs. When it hit the ground, it took a divot out of the lawn but remained unharmed. They just don&apos;t make &apos;em like that any more. (Having said all that, I just used my iPhone to check how to spell &quot;manouevre&quot;. D&apos;oh!) Is there any particular piece of technology that you have owned and hated?Like many people I like the idea of texting, but abhor what it does to the English language. I try to use correct grammar, and avoid abbreviations at all costs. Sadly though, little bits of text speak are creeping in. I am yet to write &quot;lol&quot;, but I do admit to using the occasional emoticon. Sometimes though, the appropriate emoticon doesn&apos;t seem to exist, so I have found myself writing the phrase &quot;wry smile&quot; in order to convey my feelings. (Smug face) If you had one tip about getting the best out of new technology, what would it be?Don&apos;t worry too much about making mistakes. Whenever I show a new piece of technology to my parents, especially my dad, I have to remind him not to panic. If you hit the wrong button, you&apos;re not gonna bring down a plane. Just relax, have a play with it all, and keep the instruction book handy. Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd?Oh I am most definitely a luddite, while also being a hypocrite. I pine for the days of researching from an encyclopedia, or trotting down to the local library to find whatever piece of information you need. I like the idea of not knowing something, and taking a few days to find it out. At the same time however, I was quite chuffed when a friend of mine used her iPhone to find out instantly what other TV shows the guy that plays Liz Lemon&apos;s boyfriend in 30 Rock had been in. What&apos;s the most expensive piece of technology you&apos;ve ever owned?I own an Audi A3 that has useful, and at the same time useless, bits of technology. It has a heater in the wing mirrors so they don&apos;t fog up on a cold morning. It has a business card holder. It has a tiny fold-down visor above the rear vision mirror in case the sun is peeping through the gap between the mirror and the top of the windscreen. On the other hand, it can get up to 800km on one tank of petrol. Can you imagine how many business cards you can collect in 800km? Mac or PC, and why?I was only recently converted to a Mac, and while I do love it, I try to avoid banging on about it. The main reason I stalled in buying a Mac was that Mac users are so freakin&apos; evangelical about it, I was actually turned off. Seriously, I&apos;ve seen Scientologists look at Mac users and say: &quot;Dude, you&apos;re a bit over the top.&quot; Do you still buy physical media such as CDs and DVDs, or do you download?I love buying DVDs and CDs. I love owning stuff. I love having a library of my favourite movies and music. A library I can flick though and choose from. A library I can look at across the room and think, &quot;I own that&quot;. Recently I have started downloading, but it feels kinda empty. I like having a CD cover to look at. I like record covers more \u2013 you know, the ones with a picture in the fold-out. What was your last purchase?I downloaded an album by an Australian artist called Sarah Blasko. I was in Amsterdam when the album was released, and couldn&apos;t wait to get back to Australia to buy a CD, so I downloaded it. I will probably buy the CD when I get home anyway. I have all her albums, and it would seem weird not to have this one on the shelf as well. Is that obsessive/compulsive? I recently burnt the CD of Elbow Live At Abbey Road from a friend and feel so guilty about it I am going to rush out and buy the album as soon as I can. As a performer, I am a big believer in paying for people&apos;s performances. Robot butlers \u2013 a good idea or not?Great idea. Brilliant idea. Especially if you can choose from a variety of famous voices for the butler to use. Personally, I would have three butlers, each of them with the voice of a different Marx brother. They would chase each other around the house, start food fights, constantly crack wise, and every now and again one of them would play the harp. I&apos;d even start with four but later whittle it down to three just to maintain the accuracy.

They have to console themselves with the knowledge that the person responsible for the national team has suffered a little exasperation of his own. Fabio Capello has had to submit himself to attending a series of friendly matches that cannot have been hugely informative, as clubs conducted experiments and shuffled line-ups. The fixture with Holland is of little account, even though the Dutch have already qualified for next year&apos;s World Cup finals having, like England, won all their group games. Capello has to ensure his squad is in shape to maintain momentum in Group Six. There are uncertainties. Some concern fitness \u2013 the veteran goalkeeper David James, for instance, has only now made his comeback after shoulder surgery towards the end of last season. Beyond the practicalities, however, the manager does have a penchant for surprises. Michael Mancienne was named in the party for the friendly with Germany in November 2008, despite the fact that he was on loan to Wolves and, at that stage, had still to make his debut for Chelsea. Mancienne may even be in the party for the Holland game, since right-backs are scarce at the moment. Perhaps there could be further boldness. Capello must have been as intrigued as anyone else by the virtuosity and relative strength of the Arsenal 17-year-old Jack Wilshere at the Emirates Cup last weekend. The midfielder&apos;s club manager made a tentative comparison with the young Wayne Rooney. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, however, then reined himself in by adding: &quot;You do not want him to be a star before he has delivered.&quot; Wilshere has so far appeared for a mere six minutes in the Premier League. Capello may be thinking more deeply about senior footballers. He was highly resistant last season to the suggestion that Michael Owen be reinstated in England&apos;s plans as soon he came back from injury at Newcastle United. Capello&apos;s circumspection was vindicated when the striker made scant impact. Owen could not score in any of Newcastle&apos;s last nine Premier League games and the club were relegated. The attacker&apos;s circumstances have now been radically altered. He is at Manchester United and he has made a reasonably good impression in pre-season games. It is Capello&apos;s task to judge whether Owen&apos;s several misses against Valencia this week were in fact good news, since he was at least finding opportunities that were elusive at Newcastle. The England manager may also feel obliged to demonstrate that it is no simple matter to recover a berth in the squad. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, has urged Capello to call his man up. Owen&apos;s single cap under the Italian came in a friendly with France in March 2008, when he appeared for the second half of a 1-0 defeat. Another United player, however, could feature in Capello&apos;s plans. Ben Foster has two caps already and his credentials have been enhanced now that Edwin van der Sar&apos;s hand surgery has ruled him out until the end of next month. It will be Foster&apos;s first ambition to ensure that the 38-year-old Dutchman does not regain his place at Old Trafford, but he must also hope to establish himself as England&apos;s goalkeeper.

A fall in flight bookings and a rise in Air Passenger Duty have caused Ryanair to cut 670 flights a week this winter (as yet, it has refused to specify routes) and move the base of some of its routes to Spain from Stansted. BA has followed suit, dropping Gatwick flights such as those to Madrid, Barcelona and Krakow. Meanwhile, train operators and tour companies announced moves to make rail a far more popular option, even for journeys that start in the north of England or Scotland and end far beyond Paris. Eurostar (08705 186186; eurostar.com) has formed new links with regional train companies which now enable travellers to book connecting tickets from more than 200 cities and towns in the UK to any station on the Eurostar network. Previously the tickets had to be brought separately. Tour operators are also turning to the train. Cosmos Tourama (cosmostourama.co.uk) has announced that many of its European tours in 2010 would be by rail instead of air, while Inntravel and Headwater are already offering rail options. &quot;High-speed rail is capturing the imagination as the new alternative to short-haul flights,&quot; says Nick Mercer of Eurostar. &quot;And the launch next year of high-speed rail services between Brussels and Amsterdam will put a range of Dutch cities within three to four hours of London.&quot; Eurostar has already seen an increase of 22% in the number of travellers visiting Amsterdam by rail this year.", "sentences": ["&quot;And the launch next year of high-speed rail services between Brussels and Amsterdam will put a range of Dutch cities within three to four hours of London.&quot; Eurostar has already seen an increase of 22% in the number of travellers visiting Amsterdam by rail this year."], "title": "Eurostar takes off as passengers switch from flight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/09/eurostar-airlines-ryanair-ba-flights", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Travel", "Rail transport", "Flights", "World news", "Eurostar"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-08T23:01:00Z", "article": "Born Shirley Schrift in St Louis, Missouri, and raised in Brooklyn, she was the daughter of a clothes designer and a singer (nee Winter), a liberal Jewish couple. After working her way through drama school and getting some Broadway roles, she was signed by Hollywood, appearing in 18 films before playing the sympathetic waitress strangled by mad Shakespearean actor Ronald Colman in A Double Life (1947), which brought him an Oscar and attracted attention to her that she retained until her death nearly 50 years later by her acting and calculated self-publicising.  For years, she was the screen&apos;s abused fall-girl, playing vulnerable women from the wrong side of the tracks, gangster&apos;s molls, betrayed wives, seduced and abandoned. She was Myrtle Wilson, run over by a car in The Great Gatsby (1949), the pioneer woman deserted by a cowardly husband in Winchester &apos;73 (1950), the working-class girl exploited by fugitive criminal John Garfield in He Ran All the Way (1951). Notably, she played the blue-collar innocents sent to watery graves by Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun (1951), her first Oscar nomination, and by Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter (1955). She achieved more than 100 film roles and countless TV performances, while having a continuing involvement in the legitimate theatre, appearing with touring and regional companies in A Streetcar Named Desire, Born Yesterday, and Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. Her most celebrated stage role was as the Marx Brothers&apos; mother in the Broadway musical, Minnie&apos;s Boys. She advised young actresses to extend their careers by preparing to play mothers and other ageing women.  She was an hourglass 37-26-36 pin-up in the early 1950s (the fan magazines of the time took vital statistics seriously) before taking on aggressive maternal roles that suited her expanding shape, to the point where the reviewer of a wild off-Broadway revue she was in described her as &quot;a whale of a talent looking for a sea of applause big enough to rest her massive girth&quot;. Most famously, she was the vulgar mother in Kubrick&apos;s Lolita (1962), victim of James Mason&apos;s Humbert Humbert.  Endless roles as grotesques (the gangster Ma Barker in Corman&apos;s 1970 Bloody Mama) and oppressive Jewish mothers followed, most strikingly in Paul Mazursky&apos;s Next Stop, Greenwich Village (1976) and the swimming champion who gives her life en voyage to Israel to save fellow passengers in The Poseidon Adventure (1972). This last role brought her another Oscar nomination and imitations by stand-up comics.  In the 90s, she had a final flourish, emerging from the dross of Hollywood and Italy to play the heroine&apos;s grandmother in Roseanne on TV in the Nineties and John Gielgud&apos;s neurasthenic wife in Jane Campion&apos;s The Portrait of a Lady (1996).  She never became respectable. In her autobiographies, she developed kiss and tell to a fine art. Every press interview resulted in raunchy quotes. Unorthodox to the end, she died after a deathbed marriage to her partner of the past 20 years, the ceremony solemnised by her goddaughter, actress Sally Kirkland, a minister of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness.

Admittedly the latter only felt as if it had lasted for ever, such a part of the cultural warp, weft and TV schedules had the happy couple become (and verily there was sweet and smiley Peter, on The One Show sofa last Thursday, with his own camera crew filming The One Show crew filming his appearance). But as we live in such a terrifyingly speedy, fluffy, lightweight, disposable world, I think three years of marriage (or whatever blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it-timeframe it actually was) is probably the new 10 years of marriage. Because we all know that marriages between couples who seem quite similar and well-matched on the surface but who have numerous significant personality differences beneath can be incredibly tricky things to make work, can&apos;t they? But (only very mildly satirically) I digress.  Anyway, the important point I was intending to make was that last week saw the end of another good thing which enhances all our lives, when the 13th (unlucky-for-some-but-apparently-not-them) series of Top Gear breathed its last, and Clarkson, J gave a frankly moving elegy to the era of the supercar, while sitting in an Aston Martin Vantage that was also moving. And I think you probably did see what I did there.  I felt a little bit sniffly, frankly - possibly even snivelly. Obviously I would have preferred this to have been the onset of swine flu instead of emotional eye-related moistness about a car, but personally it&apos;s been a very emotional week, what with celebrating 10 years as TV critic of the Observer (yes, August 1999. I&apos;m still on a six-month trial) by cracking open a bottle of Tesco own-brand beer alone in front of the Proms, and turning the violins up to 11.  Anyway, it was a grand final episode of TG, what with the hilarious how-to-make-a-VW-ad segment, and the one in which they revealed that the Stig is in fact a bipolar speed-freak former editor of a national daily newspaper (Didn&apos;t you see that bit? Check it out on iPlayer ... Nope, it won&apos;t be there either!). And the piece where Jay Leno revealed he has, like, a zillionbillion cars, so it&apos;ll be all round to Jay&apos;s for a go in the Vantage then.  And then there was that hilariously funny news story about soppy little electric cars being chucked into the waterways of Amsterdam by drunken revellers. Yes, according to Clarkson, J, it only takes four people to pick up a G-Wiz and throw it into a canal, but (he reminded us, as if we needed reminding) this is something one really ought not to do under any circumstances, however tempting it may be.  Anyway, yes, Top Gear was, without the proverbial shadow, my favourite programme of last week, and conceivably of my entire TV critiquing lifetime. It made me giggle and smile and cry a bit, and frankly what more do you expect from an hour spent in front of a telly in August?  Needless to say, I was tremendously buoyed, and carried on searching for potential fixes of feelgood TV, which clearly ruled out the usual police procedurals, sci-fi trash, reality shows or anything featuring blood, soap or size zero teens, never mind tearful miserydocs. After establishing that, in a week when the kids were actually away, this would effectively leave me in front of CBeebies when I should theoretically be running riot with my PIN on Sky, I decided to watch The Trouble With Girls (BBC2), which I knew would be both worthy and depressing because - pass the bottle of WKD and hit me with those stats - since 2003 there has been a dementedly vast 40 per cent rise in crimes committed by young women. Yes, I know, that doesn&apos;t even include the stats for fortysomethings randomly hurling electric cars into canals.  It was depressing but it could have been worse. Though of the old fly-on-the-wall non-interventionist school of documentary-making - rather than, say, a BBC3 series called &quot;Rehab!&quot; in which young female binge-drinkers go on a crash-recovery (I&apos;d say it&apos;s got legs, albeit very very skinny, wobbly ones) - the whole miserable business of watching 17-year-old Abbie from York and 20-year-old Shona from Doncaster systematically destroy their lives with what would, in a different context, have been admirably focused determination was leavened by the sweetness and (infuriatingly) smartness these two girls did their level best to hide, but failed. However, viewers willing them to sort their lives out doesn&apos;t mean they will. The odds are stacked against them. This week&apos;s second and final part won&apos;t, I&apos;ll hazard, feature a guest appearance from Amy Winehouse empathising with Abbie and Shona about court appearances.  But any lurking miserablism was entirely banished by my second-favourite programme of the week, BBC2&apos;s Economy Gastronomy, which could have been unwatchably awful and patronising and sent prickles of embarrassment creeping down my spine as cheery chefs Allegra McEvedy and Paul Merrett coached hard-working parents-of-three young boys, Mr and Mrs England from Derbyshire, who lived on ready meals and takeaways, how to shop for food and what to do with it next, while also saving them 90 quid a week.  But in fact it was delightful, not least because the Englands weren&apos;t scummy chavtrash, merely a couple who, somehow, had failed to learn how to cook. Thus, the feelgood moral of the story - alongside McEvedy&apos;s delicious recipes for artichoke and lardon-loaded macaroni cheese (bye-bye arteries) - is probably for the nation to stop panicking about whether 25 per cent of 11-year-olds (and indeed 45-year-olds) aren&apos;t able to spell velociraptor and bring back old-fashioned Home Ec, if only so that the little Billy Englands of the future won&apos;t have to wait until they are nine before they get to taste mum&apos;s (and dad&apos;s) home-cooking for the very first time.  So it&apos;s been an emotional week: fast cars, fast girls and faster food; a week of long, slow goodbyes, of elegies for the Good Old Days and poignant remembrances of petrol engines past.And don&apos;t blame me if your G-Wiz gets wet - blame Clarkson.  Meanwhile in the face of our impending energy crisis, I&apos;ll definitely be doing my bit. I promise to stop leaving the telly on standby.

But beneath the 164ft-high claw, questions hang over the future of this breed of stadium rock and its practitioners. It&apos;s not just from their legions of detractors; even the band seem to be reconsidering their position. U2 have always polarised opinion, but their position at the top of rock&apos;n&apos;roll has been pretty unassailable. They have been together for 33 years and the biggest band in the world for nearly quarter of a century. It was at Wembley, 24 years ago, that they cemented their pre-eminence as true stadium superstars with a scene-stealing performance at Live Aid. Since then, they have seen off contenders. Throughout, they have strived to remain relevant, desperate not to become a heritage act. There has also always been contradiction at the heart of U2. Rock&apos;n&apos;roll, convention has it, should be nonconformist. U2&apos;s rebellion was not to conform to that convention, eschewing angst for joy; unashamedly god fearing rather than expressing sympathy for the devil. But other contradictions have increasingly weighed heavier. &quot;There are probably more annoying things than being hectored about African development by a wealthy Irish rock star in a cowboy hat,&quot; said Paul Theroux, &quot;but I can&apos;t think of one at the moment.&quot; Those contradictions weren&apos;t helped by U2 moving part of their business to the Netherlands to reduce their tax burden. In recent interviews, Bono has openly admitted how annoying he can be; it seems even he may have got a little tired of Bono. On their latest album, he has stepped away from the first person, shifting to writing in character. He still sings: &quot;The right to be ridiculous is a right I hold dear&quot;, but acknowledges: &quot;Beware of small men with big ideas.&quot; The repositioning has sometimes been brazen. On Jonathan Ross, Bono explained how he &quot;dodged&quot; a hug from President Bush on stage at the National Prayer Breakfast, then sat down next to Barack Obama. &quot;I was sitting beside Senator Obama, soon to be president, and he just said, &apos;Nice work with the hug dodge&apos;.&quot; A U2 gig is hard to surpass. But watching the show in Amsterdam last month, complete with a live link to the International Space Station, video message from Desmond Tutu and dedication to Aung San Suu Kyi, it felt like the most ambitious rock show ever and the last of a dying breed. It takes 120 trucks to transport the 390 ton stage and Carbonfootprint.com calculates the footprint of the tour would be equivalent to flying them to Mars and back. U2 are now planning to ask each American fan for an extra 50 cents , to help offset pollution, but it&apos;s clear such stadium tours are unsustainable or will become increasingly unacceptable. Beneath it all, there seems to be a band still in thrall to the idea of rock&apos;n&apos;roll, still working out for themselves what it is, or can be, and how they may continue to exist within it. No Line on the Horizon entered the charts at No 1 in 30 countries but has sold less than any U2 album since 1997&apos;s disappointing Pop, the last time they were so publicly searching for their place in the ever-changing musical landscape. For some, they are the last great band to insist rock music has some greater meaning. But how many people believe rock stars have all the answers any more?", "sentences": ["But watching the show in Amsterdam last month, complete with a live link to the International Space Station, video message from Desmond Tutu and dedication to Aung San Suu Kyi, it felt like the most ambitious rock show ever and the last of a dying breed."], "title": "Are U2 the last great rock'n'roll idealists? | Luke Bainbridge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/09/u2-bono-luke-bainbridge", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "U2", "The Rolling Stones", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-09T22:00:01Z", "article": "David James and Peter Crouch have been left to ponder their chances of playing at next summer&apos;s World Cup finals, should England qualify, after being omitted from Fabio Capello&apos;s squad for Wednesday&apos;s friendly against Holland in Amsterdam. The national coach has opted against including James on the understanding that the veteran Portsmouth goalkeeper is not fully fit after suffering from a knee complaint. However, James&apos;s problems are ill-timed. Robert Green of West Ham did all that was required of him in the qualifying wins over Kazakhstan and Andorra at the end of last season and Ben Foster, who is hugely admired within the England set-up, is likely to be first-choice at Manchester United for the next few months, after Edwin van der Sar broke a finger. James, who has 48 caps, had ruled himself out of the games in Almaty and against the Andorrans at Wembley in June to undergo surgery on a shoulder problem. That decision was taken in the hope that he would be fit to regain his place once the new season began this month. A niggling knee problem has since affected him, though he was fit enough to play 57 minutes of Portsmouth&apos;s 2-0 win over Rangers at Fratton Park on Saturday. Portsmouth&apos;s manager, Paul Hart, is confident James will feature in the club&apos;s opening league fixture, against Fulham on Saturday, yet Capello has opted against using him. That has left the only player to start the Italian&apos;s first 13 games in charge facing the prospect of missing three in a row. Having turned 39 this month, James has seen himself as being susceptible to losing his position to a younger goalkeeper with the finals in sight. Crouch&apos;s omission is surprising, given that the Tottenham striker started, and scored in, the 6-0 win over Andorra. West Ham&apos;s Carlton Cole will compete with Emile Heskey, Wayne Rooney and Jermain Defoe for a place up front in the Amsterdam ArenA.

The youngster, who appears to be above Tomas Kuszczak in the pecking order at Old Trafford, was at fault for the Londoners&apos; opener and appeared unnerved by Didier Drogba&apos;s muscular presence. &quot;He should have done better for the second goal, knowing the ability he has,&quot; said Ferguson. &quot;I spread the load between Van der Sar, Ben and Tomas in pre-season and, maybe, he hasn&apos;t had enough minutes.

A potentially pivotal season lies ahead for club and country, the tantalising prospect of next summer&apos;s World Cup finals looming ever larger on the horizon. &quot;But this year is going to be the one for us to try and make an imprint, as individuals and as a team, that goes down in history, rather than as players or a group who never got near to winning the World Cup,&quot; said the midfielder. A last opportunity to shed one reputation and forge another is almost at hand. An international campaign England hope will culminate in Johannesburg next July begins in Amsterdam on Wednesday with a friendly that has almost been slipped in under the radar with the Premier League season yet to begin. Holland have already qualified for next summer&apos;s tournament, perched on top of Group Nine, with England having matched their 21-point haul from seven games to ensure that victory against Croatia at Wembley next month will be enough to propel Fabio Capello&apos;s side to South Africa. An early-season experiment this may be but given their recent form it could already be billed as a clash of contenders. This England squad is too savvy to slip into complacency at their prospects at the finals, scarred as they are by previous failures. But even so there is a recognition that they must deliver, with time running out for a group of senior players who have formed the backbone of the national side over the past seven years. Whether Lampard and Steven Gerrard, David James and Rio Ferdinand, or David Beckham and Emile Heskey \u2013 who will all be the wrong side of 30 if they travel to South Africa \u2013 will still be in contention for Brazil 2014 seems unlikely. A collective that flattered to deceive between 2002 and 2006, then failed to qualify for the European Championship in 2008, must seize its last chance. &quot;If I felt my legs were going to the point where there were other players who could do better for England than me, then I would consider my position,&quot; admitted Lampard who will earn his 72nd cap in the Amsterdam Arena. &quot;I don&apos;t see it at the minute. We are a long time retired in football and I&apos;ll keep trying to play for my country for as long as I can, but I suppose 2014 does seem a long way away. I&apos;m very proud of every cap I&apos;ve got. But we want a team achievement and winning something will take us to the next level. &quot;We know how much failure hurts. It&apos;s the worst feeling in football, having the momentum that might win a tournament then, in a split second, you&apos;re out and going home. No one forgets that feeling and we don&apos;t want it to happen again. We want to go and win [in South Africa], but there has been many a great player England have produced who hasn&apos;t won the World Cup. I grew up watching them. It would be a fantastic, history-making achievement, but it is hardly going to be easy to achieve.&quot; This set-up has needed something extra to transform underachieving players into potential contenders, and banish the painful memories of previous false dawns. The hope is that Capello will provide that edge, his tactics gleaning more from the current crop than previous incumbents have managed. He is employing Lampard in a midfield role far removed from the roaming, creative brief he currently enjoys under Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea but the 31-year-old appears to be thriving under each Italian. &quot;At Chelsea, I don&apos;t think I play the tip of the diamond behind the front man like anyone else would,&quot; said Lampard. &quot;That&apos;s not to say I am a one-off, but there are players who can get behind the front man and do stepovers and different skills. I can give more of a defensive team ethic part to the role, working hard, putting people in and trying to arrive [in the box] as I have done in the last few years at Chelsea. I like that freedom. But with England, it&apos;s a different role. My instinct may be to get forward, but others do that and I sit more with the national team, though I wouldn&apos;t call it a sacrifice. &quot;One of the beauties of this manager, and what he has given us in the last 18 months, is the fact that we are a group and the individual thing has been taken away from it, which it needed to be. It&apos;s about everyone performing together. That has been our strength in this qualifying campaign.

Capello watched Foster endure a difficult afternoon at Wembley, with the 26-year-old unsettled by Didier Drogba&apos;s muscular presence throughout and his weak punch presenting Ricardo Carvalho with Chelsea&apos;s opening goal.

It brings appreciative reviews from supporters who, after 43-years-and-counting of hurt, are in the mood to see the footballers do some suffering. The manager speaks as if he has never given a thought for the finer feelings of players. He had barely settled into the post when he explained that Micah Richards had been omitted because he required full-backs who could defend. Capello&apos;s restricted English may have made him sound more severe than he intended, but it is also true that he has no hesitation over sidelining footballers. In the spring Aaron Lennon started consecutive matches, against Slovakia and Ukraine, but has not even made the squad for tomorrow&apos;s friendly in Amsterdam. Peter Crouch, the winger&apos;s new team-mate at Tottenham, must be more bemused still by his omission. Where could he have gone wrong after starting and scoring in England&apos;s last match, the drubbing of Andorra? Complacency is never going to be a worry while Capello is in charge. The manager, all the same, probably does not feel as if he is master of all he surveys. Candidates surely rise and fall under his regime precisely because he has reservations over many of the players at his disposal. It has been quite a feat for David James, now 39, to make himself Capello&apos;s first-choice goalkeeper. His last start for England had come in the May 2005 friendly with Colombia in New Jersey. A knee problem that keeps James out of the match with the Dutch would ordinarily have been perceived as an opportunity to prepare someone to replace him at the World Cup next summer. Sunday&apos;s Community Shield game wrecked any notion of there being so smooth a transition. Ben Foster has withdrawn from the England party with a minor injury, but if he had been between the posts in Amsterdam it would been a therapeutic measure more than an endorsement. Everything went wrong at Wembley, where the 26-year-old was at fault for both Chelsea goals. Capello can still pick Robert Green, but the goalkeeping situation reflects a larger truth. The manager&apos;s options are restricted. The squad announcement had a despairing note when he judged that he might as well confine himself to one right-back, Glen Johnson. It looks as if James Milner, a winger for Aston Villa, is his understudy. Johnson has made the most of his opportunities and six starts in a row for England will have aided him in getting a move from Portsmouth to Liverpool. Circumstances did have a bearing on this. Wes Brown, who now has a thigh strain, was not around to vie with Johnson. However, the defender will not only have to recover fitness and maintain it but also, in theory, get himself picked at right-back for Manchester United ahead of, say, John O&apos;Shea. The alternative is that Capello will have to compromise on the criteria he sets for entrance to his squad. Gary Neville has been an outstanding and enduring figure at United, yet it was somewhat disconcerting to discover that, at 34, he had made the bench for that England game with Andorra in June. Injury and other factors meant that he had been confined to three starts for his club in over four months before that. England, in principle, can pick a convincing first XI when there is an outbreak of good health. It is also the case, though, that the side&apos;s one blistering performance under Capello came with the rout of Croatia in the autumn, long before the Premier League and Champions League took its toll. By and large, the manager muddles through as best he can. David Beckham has to be retained, even if it is not ideal that he should, in part, be pursuing his career in the MLS. Unyielding as he may look, Capello has to compromise. He is not in need of our sympathy. His acumen is unquestionable and, with a perfect record in World Cup qualifiers, he has excelled. Circumstances will be less favourable at the finals, when the fixtures have to be faced in quick succession. The side can seem potent when the contributions of Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and John Terry are borne in mind, but it is not obvious how England will cope if they are jaded or carrying knocks next summer. Capello&apos;s opportunity to prove that he is really worth his lavish salary will arise when his resources are meagre and the challenge is great.", "sentences": ["In the spring Aaron Lennon started consecutive matches, against Slovakia and Ukraine, but has not even made the squad for tomorrow&apos;s friendly in Amsterdam.", "Ben Foster has withdrawn from the England party with a minor injury, but if he had been between the posts in Amsterdam it would been a therapeutic measure more than an endorsement."], "title": "Fabio Capello is happy as a despot, but limited by a lack of options | Kevin McCarra", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/aug/11/england-fabio-capello-holland-friendly", "tags": ["Fabio Capello", "England", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-11T16:00:00Z", "article": "FIERCE PATRIOT MISSES ENGLAND GAME SHOCK If $tevie Mbe and Ben Foster don&apos;t play for their clubs on Sunday, the Fiver will donate its genitalia to charity.

But if even the players think these games don&apos;t matter then, well, there&apos;s a pretty obvious conclusion to be drawn, isn&apos;t there? Yesterday, Foster pulled out with a punctured reputation, while today Mbe did the same, citing a tight groin (not to be confused with a broken tooth sustained in a bar brawl, which really does hurt). &quot;I couldn&apos;t give a flying one about a pointless friendly like this.

In fact, it was an undercover cop car that he&apos;d already overtaken. &quot;My heart was beating fast, I was scared and I wanted to get home as quickly as possible,&quot; was the scaredy (Black) Cat&apos;s excuse for putting his wand of a right foot to the floor of his no doubt tastefully modified BMW M6 and accelerating away from the fuzz at 112mph. While district judge Roger Elsey recognised that Leadbitter was upset, he also recognised that the police car he overtook after he had crossed the Tyne Bridge could not have been following him from the city centre.

Maybe in the past England played more opportune football and now you are trying to play more football. This is also to do with the coach. I saw a lot of videos of English teams and I like the way they play .&quot; In June, Van Marwijk&apos;s Holland side became the first European nation to qualify for next summer&apos;s World Cup finals, following a 2-1 win away to Finland. England also have a 100% record and 21 points from seven qualifying games and are likely to secure their qualification before the end of October. Upon doing so, Van Marwijk expects Capello&apos;s side to be installed as one of the favourites for the tournament. &quot;Every time England qualify for the World Cup they are one of the favourites. They have a lot of potential and at the moment they have a very good team,&quot; he said. The goals of Wayne Rooney have been central to England&apos;s progress but while he recognised the threat posed by the striker, Van Marwijk revealed nothing of how he proposed to deal with the Manchester United player. &quot;I cannot say how we will play against England, but we are aware Rooney is one of the best players for them,&quot; he said. Securing qualification from Group Seven with two games to spare represents a fantastic start to international football for the former Feyenoord and Borussia Dortmund manager, who was announced as Marco van Basten&apos;s successor before Euro 2008. Prior to leaving for an unsuccessful stint as manager of Ajax, Van Basten led a young and exciting Dutch team through the group stages in Austria-Switzerland without defeat, before losing to an Andrei Arshavin-inspired Russia in the quarter-finals. Van Marwijk said he was very satisfied with the players he inherited from Van Basten, who now lead Scotland by 14 points: &quot;From the first moment I started as a coach, you saw that we were a team,&quot; he said. &quot;That feeling is becoming stronger and stronger.&quot; For three of Holland&apos;s stars, this match may hold more importance than a pre-season friendly. The forward Arjen Robben and midfielders Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart have all had limited playing time at Real Madrid, amid mounting transfer speculation. Tonight&apos;s match at the Amsterdam Arena may be a chance to impress potential suitors or remind the Madrid president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, and manager, Manuel Pellegrini, of their existence. Though he admitted their lack of playing opportunities was unfortunate, Van Marwijk said he had no intention of dropping the three men. &quot;There is very little they can do to help the situation,&quot; he said. &quot;We have come this far together so I don&apos;t see any reason why I should drop them now.&quot; The Manchester City midfielder Nigel de Jong is expected to feature on his return from suspension but injury rules out Holland&apos;s captain, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, and Bayern Munich&apos;s Mark van Bommel. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 12 August 2009.

England had been humiliated by Croatia in their last competitive fixture, leaving their qualification for Euro 2008 in serious doubt and faith in the regime was waning. Fast forward and, at the same venue last night, Fabio Capello addressed a more promising future from a position of complete and utter strength. The contrast between England managers past and present could not have been more stark. Capello&apos;s English may remain rusty but there is clarity of thinking where, not long ago, all seem muddled. The national side top their qualification group with a perfect points tally and confront Holland, already qualified for South Africa 2010 with an equally faultless record, with the head coach unwilling to accept that his team has fulfilled its potential. The last time England began a season that culminated in a World Cup finals, they were humbled 4-1 in their opening friendly fixture in Denmark. Capello will not tolerate a repeat. The Italian did not betray any satisfaction at his achievements to date yesterday but, instead, spoke of maintaining this team&apos;s development. &quot;I have to improve different situations because, while sometimes we play for 20 minutes very well, sometimes we sleep a little bit,&quot; he offered. &quot;Similarly, we don&apos;t always play with the same aggression we are capable of all the time. We have to make sure we play 90 minutes at that level. That is a really important step. It&apos;s about consistency in performance. We can do this but we need to play with intelligence. We are a really good team who must play with our own style, but we will be playing very important sides. We need to adapt and learn.&quot; England&apos;s two set-backs under this regime have come against A-list opposition in France and Spain. The visit to Amsterdam could prove just as awkward as those evenings in Paris and Seville though, already, the Capello effect appears to be bolstering confidence within the ranks. John Terry&apos;s assertion that England can be contenders next summer was based on the impression made by the management on a group that had previously under-performed. &quot;That bit of quality separates the good from the great managers, and this manager is a great manager,&quot; said the captain. &quot;Jose Mourinho had that, and Fabio does too. &quot;It&apos;s about transmitting that confidence to each other. That&apos;s what a great coach gives you. You come in at half-time and [Capello] hates it if the lads are talking or shouting at each other. Arguing. You can come in all hot-headed wanting better from your team-mates but he shuts us up, wants us sitting there quietly to absorb what has just happened and take it in, then approach things in a calmer way. He wants two or three minutes of silence. Then he can go mad himself. He&apos;s more than capable of getting the hair-dryer out, giving us a kick up the backside, but he recognises the importance of staying relaxed and focused. &quot;We know there&apos;ll be times in games where we won&apos;t have the ball and our opponents dominate possession but it&apos;s about staying compact and patient. He stresses that. It&apos;s an Italian thing. Carlo Ancelotti has the same mentality: don&apos;t be frightened when you lose the ball. Keep your shape, stay together and then, when you get the ball back, make it count. But we&apos;re still learning. We&apos;re not where we want to be yet. We&apos;ve got another 10 or 15% to go. When we do, we&apos;ll be at the top of our game. We can improve here. Before the game in Spain we probably thought we were one of the best teams in the world. Actually, that showed us where we want to be.&quot; Capello is edging them towards that ideal in the hope that, with qualification secured as soon as possible and no major injuries sustained over the course of a gruelling season, this team can carry momentum to South Africa. Frank Lampard spoke of this campaign offering England&apos;s players an opportunity to make an &quot;imprint in history&quot; this week. That is a sentiment with which the Italian in charge agrees. &quot;Those were very important words from one of the leaders of this team,&quot; he added. &quot;I think the other players think the same. This is a really important season for them, just as it is for me in my first international job. It will be really important but, first, we have to get to the finals.

Against all modern practice, these have become key games for the national team. Gone are the days when it felt almost gauche to pay attention to such exercises. With the exception of the extraordinary rout of the World Cup qualifier with Croatia in Zagreb, these have been the truly instructive fixtures. Challenges are sought. Following losses against France and Spain, the manager has now taken his squad to meet Holland, the first European side to clinch its place in South Africa next summer. Capello was sufficiently in earnest when the prior defeats were mentioned to point out, with good humour, that Germany had been overcome in Berlin. Proceedings in the Olympic stadium that night was an expression of the manager&apos;s stance. England, having led, conceded an equaliser and on many another evening a gentle current of indifference would had the match bobbing gently towards a draw. Instead, the urgency grew and John Terry&apos;s late goal delivered the win. That outcome may have no direct bearing on anything that occurs at a World Cup for which England have all but qualified. It did, all the same, send out the impression of a developing hardiness. These occasions can also have a profound impact that is not at all reassuring. The experience of being outclassed by Spain in Seville six months ago left the squad feeling sheepish, but it had its value. &quot;We probably thought we were one of the best teams in the world,&quot; Terry said of the attitude prior to kick-off. &quot;Actually, that showed us where we want to be.&quot; The suggestion that Spain&apos;s level of technique is attainable may be hopelessly optimistic, but Capello appears to have implanted both an understanding of the team&apos;s defects while also encouraging a faith that they can be overcome by next summer. There are also humdrum experiences to be utilised. The manager is no more immune to annoyances than his predecessors, especially in the approach to a new club season. Steven Gerrard pulled out of the match in the Amsterdam Arena because of a groin strain and his place is to go to Ashley Young. It will be the Aston Villa player&apos;s first start for England. Gerrard had been prospering for his country in an inside-left position, but Young is more accustomed to the wing. With that in mind, Frank Lampard might be more ready to advance from his current station beside Gareth Barry in defensive midfield. It will be informative this evening to learn, in addition, if Capello is as solicitous towards the feelings of club managers as his predecessors Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson normally were. With the Premier League re-opening for business at the weekend, Martin O&apos;Neill would be disturbed on Aston Villa&apos;s behalf by any prospect of risks being taken with Emile Heskey. The target man is affected by an achilles injury that has become a common complaint for him, but he still trained normally last night, and Carlton Cole may start on the bench. Theo Walcott, who injured his side in Arsenal&apos;s friendly with Valencia last week, may well be among the substitutes. That would grant David Beckham a third start under Capello. The former captain has every reason to make a good impression. Capello is understandably concerned with status of a squad member who will be 35 at the time of the World Cup finals. The manager has reiterated that Beckham must find a move on loan from LA Galaxy to European club, as he did with Milan last season, when the MLS closes down during the winter. It would be wise, in addition, for the player to illustrate his worth in Amsterdam tonight. The environment, according to Capello, will be taxing. &quot;It is interesting,&quot; he said, &quot;to play Holland because they are third in the Fifa rankings and play a different type of football. They play more like Spain, even if they don&apos;t have quite the same quality. With Spain there is more dribbling and more offensive football but Holland are still really good.&quot; This generation of Dutchmen may not bear all that much resemblance to the side of the &apos;total football&apos; era in the 1970s, but the coach Bert van Marwijk is well-stocked with sophisticates. The England defence can anticipate as severe a work-out as any section of the team. Glen Johnson will see a difference from the last six starts under Capello. Even when he took part in that loss to Spain, he was not subject to quite as direct as threat as he will be if Arjen Robben is coming down his flank. Capello may understand far more about Johnson&apos;s defensive capacities before the night is over. Van Marwijk, too has strikers such as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has switched from Real Madrid to Milan, to assail the core of the England rearguard. Capello, teasingly, mentioned that he knows who his goalkeeper will be next summer. The veteran David James misses this match and Robert Green will be between the posts. He could have every opportunity to show off his skills against Holland.

Ashley Young and, potentially, Carlton Cole will have opportunities to stake a claim to be regular members of Fabio Capello&apos;s line-up with the former making his first international start against Holland at the Amsterdam Arena, and the West Ham forward expected to feature at some point as Emile Heskey is hampered by a slight achilles complaint despite completing a full training session last night. Young, capped five times already, will replace Steven Gerrard who has returned to Liverpool for treatment on a groin problem. The head coach will seek evidence of continued progress against opponents who England have beaten only once \u2013 albeit riotously at Euro &apos;96 \u2013 in 27 years as he attempts to maintain the momentum that has swept his side to the top of Group Five and within one win of qualification. That form has fuelled the conviction that they can indeed be contenders next summer with the Italian having apparently exorcised an existing fear factor involved in playing for the national side. &quot;Everyone&apos;s playing freely and with confidence under the new manager and, if we can get to South Africa, every big team there will have a good chance and we&apos;ll be no different,&quot; said England&apos;s captain Terry. &quot;If we play the way we have been, we can&apos;t rule out England winning the World Cup. But we must continue to improve. We probably learned more in losing to Spain [last February] than we would have done going there and beating them, and there&apos;s no mental issue any more against the best sides. &quot;We&apos;ve played some good sides under Fabio and beaten them. The Dutch are very good technically and pose a big threat going forward. Defensively, too, they&apos;re solid so it&apos;ll be a good test. But, where in the past players would have been lying if they said there wasn&apos;t any fear coming into big games with England, now that&apos;s been wiped away. &quot;We&apos;ve overcome that mental barrier. We had to, and we&apos;ve done that. We don&apos;t come here over-confident, but we just want to get the most out of what is a big game. This is an important time.&quot; It is a critical opportunity for the likes of Young and Cole, who have both only enjoyed bit-part roles under Capello but who could now take their chances. The England management will check on the fitness of Heskey and Theo Walcott, whose side strain restricted him to a brief, light session on his own in training at the stadium last night, ahead of selecting their side. David Beckham is likely to start in place of the Arsenal winger, but the manager confirmed Young would fill in for Gerrard. &quot;I can&apos;t clone Stevie, but Ashley is one of the English players who can dribble and take people on one on one,&quot; said Capello. &quot;This is very important. He has played a few times with me, but now he will be playing against one of the best national teams in the world, so it will be really important for him to have the confidence to perform. The players&apos; performances will be important this season. I will watch a lot of games. I already watched three or four every week, but I want to be sure [who to select for the finals, should England qualify]. The door is open for every player who plays well during the season.&quot; Yet it has been slammed shut for the Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, whose hopes of earning selection for England rather than his native Spain have been snuffed out by his adopted country&apos;s Italian head coach. &quot;Almunia, for me, is Spanish,&quot; added Capello when asked whether he would consider selecting the 32-year-old should he gain British citizenship. &quot;He&apos;s Spanish and plays for the Arsenal team.&quot;", "sentences": ["Ashley Young and, potentially, Carlton Cole will have opportunities to stake a claim to be regular members of Fabio Capello&apos;s line-up with the former making his first international start against Holland at the Amsterdam Arena, and the West Ham forward expected to feature at some point as Emile Heskey is hampered by a slight achilles complaint despite completing a full training session last night."], "title": "England's captain John Terry has said that the country can win the World Cup in South Africa", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/12/england-win-world-cup-terry", "tags": ["England", "John Terry", "Holland", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-12T09:10:33Z", "article": " Welcome to day three of our rolling sports news blog. As Sean Ingle confidently predicted yesterday and the day before (and I&apos;m reiterating here today through the medium of copy-and-paste) it might work or it might not. The idea is that every weekday for the next few weeks, we&apos;ll post a few things - what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead, a few links to interesting stories, blogs we like etc - across the day and let you have your say below the line. We&apos;ll try to respond to your questions and comments as often as we can - but this isn&apos;t a live minute-by-minute report, more a rolling blog which we will update whenever we get the chance. (BG)  10.20am: It&apos;s mid-August, the silly season. The Sky Sports News yellow ticker has just revealed the sensational news that Cambridge United have reappointed Martin Ling as manager. At the risk of tempting fate, I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and predict that today could be a slow day. We&apos;ve just had our morning news meeting (not as glamourous as it sounds) in Guardian HQ and peered into the crystal ball, so here are some stories to look out for today.  \u2022 Manchester City putting in yet another bid Joleon Lescott.\u2022 Is Carson Yeung set to buy Birmingham City for \u00a370m or isn&apos;t he? \u2022 Some interesting transfer news, including rumoured loan deals for two Chelsea defenders (one of which might raise a few eyebrows). \u2022 There&apos;s an England rugby media session later today. \u2022 And last but by no means least, the official FDA screening of the Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Cole produced gangsta flick Dead Man Running (with 50 Cent and Danny Dyer, among others, delivering performances that will almost certainly be hailed as stellar).(BG)  10.30am: Coming up - or already up - on the Sportblog ... \u2022 Our County Cricket blog will be going live shortly\u2022 Our Premier League previews: Stoke City has already been posted and will soon be joined by Sunderland.\u2022 The Knowledge: the longest time between qualifying for and playing in major event.\u2022 Sid Lowe on David Villa (not literally, that would be hideous). (BG)            11.20am: The good news is that our County Cricket blog has been published. The bad news is that it seems to be raining everywhere. Other underwhelming news from the wires: the Chile v Venezuela and Argentina v Brazil World Cup qualifiers scheduled for 5 September have been postponed until 6 September, Manchester City boss Mark Hughes expects to be without his injured striker Roque Santa Cruz until the end of August, and Saudi League champions Al Ittihad have signed Tunisia striker Amine Chermiti on a season-long loan deal from Hertha Berlin. Bully for them, eh? (BG)  11.35am: He may have a face for radio, but that hasn&apos;t stopped Barney Ronay filming a six-part series of videos to shamelessly plug his forthcoming book The Manager: The Absurd Ascent of the Most Important Man in Football. You can watch the first one here, along with the accompanying extract and G2 cover story, Camel Coat Optional, in which Barney asks when public humiliation and constant hounding became part of the football manager&apos;s job? (BG)  11.50am: Sports news is still as patchy as a spinster&apos;s cardigan, but here goes: Birmingham City fans will be delighted to hear that the man who threw the club into turmoil and accelerated its descent into the Championship in 2008 with a protracted and ultimately failed takeover attempt, Carson Yeung, is back for more. For \u00a370m he reckons he can make the Blues the &quot;most poular team in China&quot;. In Ashes-related news, Aussie opener Shane Watson doesn&apos;t think much of England&apos;s attack. In fact, he reckons he will be able to slam them around The Oval for a century.Latest on the SportblogAndy Wilson believes the Australian contingent at Warrington and Huddersfield can make for a fiercely contested Challenge Cup final. A good showing from the Aussies would be just the tonic after recent regrettable incidents in Australian rugby league. (GR)  1.24pm: This just in: England and Essex batsman Ravi Bopara has done himself no favours as far as retaining his place for next week&apos;s Ashes decider at The Oval is concerned, having been dismissed for just one run as Essex began their reply to Middlesex&apos;s first-innings 356. On the plus side, it&apos;s one more than he scored in his most recent innings at Headingley. Lawrence Booth has kindly taken time out from drinking tea and eating triangule-shaped cucumber sandwiches at Lord&apos;s to report on Bopara&apos;s unfortunate dismissal in our County Cricket blog. (BG)  1.35pm: Elsewhere on the sportblog, Dileep Premachandran blogs on the refusal of India&apos;s cricketers to accept Wada&apos;s controversial &quot;whereabouts&quot; clause, Steve Bruce&apos;s Sunderland enjoy their 15 minutes in the Premier League preview spotlight and Paul Rees says that the inclusion of rugby union in the 2016 Olympics would be beneficial for the sport. (BG)  1.50pm: Asafa Powell has been withdrawn from the Jamaica squad for the world championships in Berlin. No official reason has been given for his removal, but it&apos;s believed to be related to his no-show at a recent training camp. (GR)  2.21pm: England need a hero at The Oval for the Ashes decider. Someone who can be brave and make a stand and build a massive score; and Ian Bell is probably not going to be that man. He&apos;s been dismissed for a single run in Warwickshire&apos;s match with Notts. (GR)  3.39pm: England&apos;s selectors have hinted that Mark Ramprakash, for whom life begins at 40 next month, is being considered for a one-off return for the fifth Ashes Test. It&apos;s no surprise either, after Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara and Alastair Cook have all failed with the bat at county level this afternoon. (GR)  3.45pm: If you click this link to our Sportblog you might catch Sid Lowe pacing around the top of the page, scratching his head furiously and wondering why the hell nobody has yet bought the exceptional talent that is Valencia&apos;s David Villa.  And coming up tonight we&apos;ve got live World Cup action at 5.45pm as Barney Ronay guides you through Scotland&apos;s crucial qualifier in Norway with his minute-by-minute report.  And from 7.30pm you can join Rob Smyth for every minute of England&apos;s intelligenty-scheduled friendly against Holland in Amsterdam. Oh yesh! (GR)             3.58pm: At last! Some serious sports news. Nicklas Bendtner has promised to pay full refunds to any Arsenal fans who paid for a replica shirt with his name and number on it after he changed his squad number to 52 because it&apos;s a &quot;special number&quot;. Apparently the refund only applies to fans who purchased shirts from Arsenal FC outlets. Barring family members, who would buy a Bendtner shirt? It&apos;s cards-on-the-table time. Is there anyone out there who has the balls to admit they&apos;ve bought one? And furthermore, anyone who would actually make that walk of shame to the Emirates shop for a refund? (GR)  4.14pm: Last night a Copa Sudamericana match between Blooming of Bolivia and Uruguay&apos;s River Plate was abandoned after 66 minutes when a fan, who it was later discovered had a knife on him, attacked a visiting player. Thankfully the player wasn&apos;t hurt, but after viewing the video of the attacker flying in at him at full tilt below, you imagine he was left a little dazed.

Mamet will combine Frank&apos;s much-loved journal, a later stage adaptation by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, and his own take on the story. The Diary of Anne Frank records the teenager&apos;s experiences over 25 months while hiding out with her family in a secret annexe in a canalside warehouse in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. It became an international bestseller and made her an icon of the Holocaust when it was published in 1947, two years after she died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. It has been translated into 60 languages and has sold more than 25m copies worldwide. The story has made numerous appearances on stage (a musical version played in Madrid just last year), television (a critically lauded five-part BBC adaptation starring Ellie Kendrick as Anne and Tamsin Greig as her mother was broadcast in January) and film (most notably in 1959: Shelley Winters won the best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal of Petronella van Daan, whose real-life counterpart, Auguste van Pels, was another occupant of the annexe). According to Variety, producer Andrew Braunsberg spent a year working to get the rights to the story from Anne Frank&apos;s estate, and it was he who approached Mamet to gauge his interest. The writer, the son of parents of Russian-Jewish extraction, jumped at the chance to be involved. Mamet reportedly hopes to reframe the story known to millions as a rite-of-passage tale. Mamet&apos;s recent credits as writer and director include the 2008 sporting drama Redbelt, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor as an idealistic ju-jitsu instructor whose financial woes force him to consider going into the ring in defiance of his principles, and the 2004 drama Spartan, about an investigation into a kidnapping of the daughter of a high-ranking US government official. Frank adaptations The Diary of Anne Frank (1955) Dramatised by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, this play was a huge success on Broadway in the mid-50s, receiving both the Pulitzer prize for drama and the Theatre World award. \u00a0One review spoke of the play&apos;s &quot;[invasion of] the privacy of the whole audience&quot;. The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) George Stevens&apos;s 1959 film adaptation of the play was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning three. Anne&apos;s father, Otto Frank, had been keen for Audrey Hepburn to play the lead role, but she declined and the part was taken by teenage model Millie Perkins. Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001) The Anne Frank Foundation refused to endorse this ABC miniseries and so prevented any quotes from Anne&apos;s diaries appearing. Despite this, Ben Kingsley won a Screen Actor&apos;s Guild award for his performance as Otto while Hannah Taylor-Gordon received both Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for her portrayal of Anne. The Diary of Anne Frank: A Song to Life (2008) Madrid hosted Un Canto a La Vida, a musical based on her life story and starring 13-year-old Isabella Castillo. The musical caused a rift between the Anne Frank Foundation, which supported it, and the Anne Frank Fund, which said the diarist&apos;s life was &quot;no theme for a happy evening of song and dance&quot;.\u00a0 Girish Gupta ", "sentences": ["The Diary of Anne Frank records the teenager&apos;s experiences over 25 months while hiding out with her family in a secret annexe in a canalside warehouse in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam."], "title": "David Mamet to tackle The Diary of Anne Frank", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/12/david-mamet-anne-frank-film", "tags": ["Film", "David Mamet", "Holocaust", "Books", "Culture", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-12T13:42:18Z", "article": " Preamble department Hello. David Brent isn&apos;t the only person who has a problem with options. In his time with England, Fabio Capello has somehow managed to produce an extremely strong first XI, despite not having a goalkeeper or a centre-forward, but there are still huge concerns as to what his options might be should any of first XI break down. In tonight&apos;s friendly against Holland we will probably get to look at a couple of those options: David Beckham and Ashley Young. We think we know what Capello&apos;s team will be for England&apos;s first World Cup match in 10 months&apos; time, but don&apos;t bet on it. A lot changes in a World Cup season, even before you factor in the inevitable injury to at least one of Capello&apos;s preferred XI. That&apos;s why games like this aren&apos;t entirely pointless: England&apos;s back-up is so flimsy that they could do with a few squad players, such as Young, establishing themselves at international level.  And we get a chance to watch Arjen Robben, a peculiarly maligned player blessed with a touch of genius. So it&apos;s not all bad. I&apos;m not fooling anybody, am I?  Rhetorical question that has nothing to do with this evening&apos;s game but then old football was ten times better than the soulless filth they serve up these days wasn&apos;t it department How good was Preben Elkjaer?  Why pre-season friendlies are really important and tell you loads about what might happen in the season ahead honest department On 15 August 2001, England played Holland at White Hart Lane. They were thrashed; only 2-0, but they were completely outclassed. Seventeen days later, England smashed and grabbed a 5-1 win in Germany; earlier that day, in a far more impressive performance that has been subsequently forgotten because England produced a few half-decent counter-attacks, 10-man Ireland (or one-man, if you&apos;re a Roy Keane disciple, for he was immense that day) put Holland out of the World Cup with a 1-0 victory at Lansdowne Road. In short: nobody knows anything.  Team news PR champion David Beckham starts, as does Ashley Young. This is Beckham&apos;s 113th cap, and it&apos;s Young first start for England. Didn&apos;t Terry Venables have a bet in the summer of 1996 that Jamie Redknapp would win more England caps than Beckham? Redknapp won 17, so Beckham has lapped him nearly six times. Well done Tel! Holland include three England-based players: Dirk Kuyt, Robin van Persie and Nigel de Jong. Holland (4-3-3) Stekelenburg; Heitinga, Ooijer, Mathijsen, Braafheid; De Jong, Schaars, Van der Vaart; Robben, van Persie, Kuyt. Substitutes: Vorm, Marcellis, Van Der Wiel, Sneijder, De Zeeuw, Afellay,Babel, Mendes Da Silva, Huntelaar.  England (4-2-3-1) Green; Johnson, Ferdinand, Terry, A Cole; Lampard, Barry; Beckham, Rooney, Young; Heskey.Laughably weak bench: Robinson, Milner, Bridge, Upson, Lescott, Wright-Phillips, Carrick, Defoe, Carlton Cole, Walcott, Hart.  An email &quot;Will John Terry stay true to recent form and be telling us that he never seriously considered England winning the World Cup this time next year?&quot; wonders Justin Kavanagh. &quot;And can the good people of 19 Entertainment still sell Americans on the charms of &apos;three-time World Cup quarter-finalist&apos; David Beckham after July 2010?&quot;  In a surprising and unprecedented development, England and Holland fans have reportedly engaged one another in an age-old pastime called &apos;kicking seven shades out of everything that moves and is foreign&apos;. Here&apos;s a wire story on said contest: The Netherlands&apos; national news service NOS is reporting that football supporters have clashed in Amsterdam&apos;s city center and several have been detained by police. Police could not immediately confirm the reports. Authorities have been on high alert for possible violence due to an international friendly match between the Netherlands and England Wednesday evening. However, it wasn&apos;t immediately clear whether the fighting in the city center before the match was between Dutch and English supporters or Dutch clubs. Calls for club supporters to travel to Amsterdam and bring weapons had circulated on various supporter web sites and forums, NOS reported Wednesday.  Here we go then. There is a cracking atmosphere in the aMSTERDaM aRENa, for what that&apos;s worth. It doesn&apos;t feel like a friendly at all.  There is a touching minute&apos;s applause for Sir Bobby Robson. He was simply one of the nicest human beings you could possibly imagine.  1 min England kick off from left to right. &quot;July 11th next year&quot; warbles Clive Tyldesley. Yes, that is the date of the World Cup final. No, England are not going to be there.  2 min Holland appear to be playing Dirk Kuyt as the centre forward with Van Persie on the right of their front three. I like Van Persie in that position, as he has the scope to zip infield and his those brutal left footers. Does anybody in the Premier League strike the ball so cleanly?  3 min In fact Van Persie is now up front with Kuyt wide. Total football? It&apos;ll never catch on. Anyway, nothing of note has happened yet.  4 min The atmosphere is fantastic.  6 min Nothing happening, although it&apos;s reasonably high-octane stuff. &quot;Re: England&apos;s &apos;laughably weak bench&apos;. Is this becoming the latest cliche?&quot; asks David Wall. &quot;It&apos;s true that they don&apos;t have great strength in depth in certain positions. But it seems wrong to say there is no back-up at all. Upson and Lescott are fine centre-halves (even if they have been a little shaky in the few games they&apos;ve had for England so far), and you would hardly describe Carrick, Milner, and Walcott as not being genuinely international class midfielders.&quot; I would, in all three cases. Upson and Lescott are good, but no more than that. Of Capello&apos;s second XI - let&apos;s presume it&apos;s Foster, Brown, Lescott, Upson, Bridge, Beckham, Carrick, AN Other, J Cole, C Cole and Defoe - I&apos;d only feel comfortable with Bridge, Brown, Joe Cole and Other starting against, say, Spain.  7 min A poor backpass from the former Blackburn clown Ooijer almost leaves Stekelenburg in a hole, but he just manages to punt it away from the advancing Rooney.  GOAL! Holland 1-0 England (Kuyt 10) A laughable error from Rio Ferdinand gifts Holland the first goal. Absolutely ridiculous. He played a shocking, half-arsed backpass to Green from the right side of the penalty box, allowing Kuyt to nip in and go round Green. That took him too wide to score, so he came back inside Green and then rammed his shot through John Terry on the line. You wouldn&apos;t believe how bad that was from a world-class defender, especially as he&apos;d been lucky to get away with a sloppy backpass a couple of minutes earlier.  13 min Barry&apos;s deep, right-footed cross from the left is headed over by Beckham at the far post. He was only a few yards out but it was no sort of chance; he couldn&apos;t get on top of the ball.  14 min &quot;I would believe how bad that was,&quot; says Alex Netherton.  17 min &quot;You noticed that when Kuijt get&apos;s a bit out of breath he pulls his lip up, like Elvis?&quot; asks Susanne van Kampen, our drunken Dutch friend of old. I hadn&apos;t, but my God I&apos;ll focus on nothing else for the rest of my days.  18 min &quot;Rio just merked Rob Green (and every England fan who paid to go to the Netherlands),&quot; says Thomas Tharakan.  19 min A good move from England ends with Stekelenburg denying Fwank. Beckham reversed a penetrative, straight 25-yard pass to Johnson on the edge of the box; he immediately slid a ball down the side of the defence for the onrushing Lampard, whose clipped first-time shot flew off the keeper and away to safety.  20 min &quot;I don&apos;t think we should be too hard on Ferdinand,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;He&apos;s obviously distracted by wondering how the film he&apos;s produced, Dead Man Conceding, sorry, Running is going to go down with the hacks tonight, poor lamb. Who can expect him to concentrate on something so petty as an international against the third best team in the world...&quot;  22 min England are having an extended spell of admittedly mostly harmless possession. Heitinga is penalised for a two-footed challenge on Terry. It&apos;s not quite as bad as it sounds: he went very low and didn&apos;t make contact, but he did have both feet off the ground.  23 min &quot;Five Live have decided that Glen Johnson played Rio Ferdinand&apos;s shocking backpass,&quot; says Simon Demissie. &quot;Consider him merked.&quot;  24 min Beckham&apos;s free-kick from the right finds the late-arriving Lampard at the near post, and only a very good piece of defending from Ooijer stops Lampard getting a clean sidefooted volley at goal. Lampard appeals for something unspecified: world peace, perhaps, or free laptops for former smokers with eczema. I don&apos;t know. A minute later Barry has a more credible appeal for handball in the penalty area against his new team-mate De Jong. File under &apos;seen them given&apos;. There was definitely a movement of his arm towards the ball, but against that he was only a couple of yards away from Barry.  25 min &quot;Never mind the reserves,&quot; says Tom Hopkins, &quot;how many of England&apos;s first choice XI would you be comfortable to have starting against Spain?&quot;  26 min Young&apos;s deflected shot goes straight through to Stekelnburg, but England are having an excellent spell here.  27 min So what was Frank Lampard appealing for. &quot;A national spare room database?&quot; muses Alex Netherton. &quot;All fire hydrants should be yellow?&quot;  28 min The increasingly influential Beckham finds Barry, 25 yards out and with a disgraceful amount of time, but Barry slices across a tame shot that flies five yards over the bar.  29 min Frank Lampard takes Arjen Robben from behind, 40 yards out.. Robben, inevitably, rolls around for a few hours. Lampard would certainly have been booked for that in a competitive match.  30 min From the free-kick Rob Green makes an excellent save to deny Kuyt, but it was a save he only had to make because of his own failings. Van der Vaart whipped the ball beyond the far post and Green, having originally come for the cross, was in no man&apos;s land when Kuyt planted a header down towards the near post. But Green adjusted his feet very well to save. If anyone remembers it, it was very similar to a save Massimo Taibi made with his feet to deny Robbie Fowler at Anfield on his debut.  33 min Another vital save from Green. Robben toasted the lunging Johnson with ease and ran through on goal, 12 yards out, but his shot was straight above Green&apos;s head and flapped it over the bar. Robben should have scored. Holland haven&apos;t had much of the ball but they have cut England open with disconcerting ease. They have been helped, admittedly, by the fact that Rio Ferdinand is fast asleep.  GOAL! Holland 2-0 England (Van der Vaart 37) England are going to be introduced to an Italian model of hairdryer at half-time, because this is another dreadful error. Gareth Barry, receiving possession 35 yards out, plays a ridiculous blind pass towards John Terry; Robben intercepts and charges through on goal, and though Green makes another excellent save with his feet, Van der Vaart follows up to sidefoot the ball into the empty net. Pathetic stuff from Barry.  39 min &quot;I am not drunk,&quot; says Sussane van Kampen. &quot;Just drugged. One other thing: are the English fans singing something on the melody of Walking in a Winter Wonderland? If so, that&apos;s kinda cute. Beats Seven Nation Army.&quot; Really? Does it really.  41 min &quot;Does anyone else who enjoys a spot of Pro Evolution hear &apos;Farzel Gart&apos; every time one of the commentary team mention Van der Vart,&quot; asks Sam Thomson, &quot;or is it just me?&quot; I&apos;m more of a Matchday II man.  42 min Rooney&apos;s swirling 25-yarder goes straight at Stekelenburg.  43 min &quot;I rather like Beckham&apos;s new Billy Wright style short back and sides,&quot; says Phil Sawyer of the PR champion&apos;s latest haircut. &quot;They say the modern game is all about pace, so if Capello can get the rest of the squad to adopt the same style and get them running round in super fast motion in the style of the old Fifties news reels we may just have a chance next summer. Or we might get handed a lesson in how to play the game, as the Hungarians did back then. Hmm, wonder which looks more likely tonight?&quot;  43 min Heskey wins a bouncing ball ahead of Mathijsen 25 yards out, as the ball sits up Rooney thrashes it across goal and just wide. That was a beautiful effort, hit with the pure hatred of a man who can&apos;t abide being 2-0 down, not even in a friendly.  45 min A lovely Dutch move ends with Van der Vaart laying an inviting, loving pass back to Kuyt, 25 yards out, but he thrashes his shot over. Ferdinand was beaten again in that attack and he really is having a complete shocker. It&apos;s self-merkification.  Half time: Holland 2-0 England England played well for 44 minutes and 58 seconds of that half. But in the other two seconds, Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Barry played preposterous backpasses that gifted goals to a lively Dutch side. See you in 10 minutes.  Half-time fun &quot;I Just YouTubed Matchday II,&quot; says Daniel Messenger. &quot;That looked awful, truly awful. Fiver says its still more fun than Dead Man Running.&quot;  46 min England have made three substitutions: Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermain Defoe and Michael Carrick replace David Beckham, Emile Heskey and Gareth Barry - all like-for-like replacements. Holland have replaced Robin van Persie and Rafael van der Vaart with Ryan Babel and the excellent Wesley Sneijder. So Robben switches to the right wing.  47 min &quot;I was somewhat shocked to see that Beckham&apos;s tattooed arms have the effect of making him look like a hairy ape,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Is David trying to get in touch with his primitive side (and I don&apos;t mean LA Galaxy).&quot;  GOAL! Holland 2-1 England (Defoe 49) What an excellent goal this is from the substitute. Lampard scissor-kicked a hopeful ball over the top from inside his own half and Defoe, running clear of the defence, controlled the dropping ball beautifully before stabbing it almost nonchalantly in off the post from the edge of the box with his left foot. That&apos;s a wonderfully accomplished finish.  51 min &quot;That first goal brings back memories of the old Rio, who used to experience those sudden mental fugues on the edge of the penalty area,&quot; says Jon B. &quot;You&apos;d just see him standing there. It was like someone had shaken his etch-a-sketch.&quot;  54 min Ibrahim Afellay replaces Arjen Robben, who was subdued by his stratospheric standards but menacing in patches.  56 min Defoe&apos;s shot is cleared off the line by Heitinga. Wright-Phillips played a crafty, disguised pass to put him through down the right side of the box, and Defoe came back inside Mathijsen before sweeping a left-footed shot past Stekelenburg from seven yards. Heitinga punted it clear. Rooney was also in the vicinity but Defoe had every right to shoot from that position.  57 min England replace Wayne Rooney, who had maybe a 7/10 game, with Carlton Cole.  58 min &quot;I arrived home from my Wednesday night 5-a-side just in time for the half-time analysis,&quot; says Mike Gibbons. &quot;I wasn&apos;t in a great mood but can I just thank Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Barry for putting my suicidal pass across our area that was intercepted and ended up in our net in its proper perspective - who said this international was pointless? I feel much better already.&quot; Too right. Every time England lose a penalty shoot out I became a little more at peace with my ridiculous and decisive penalty in the under-13s cup final of 1988-89.  60 min Carrick is robbed in a dangerous position by Babel, who then scuffs a shot well wide from 25 yards. England have given the ball away in dangerous areas a ridiculous amount tonight. I suppose that&apos;s the problem with asking them to play from the back, as Capello is, although that doesn&apos;t really explain why good footballers like Johnson and Carrick have been caught.  63 min Seven of England&apos;s current XI play or played for West Ham: Carlton Cole, Green, Ferdinand, Lampard, Johnson, Defoe and Carrick. Imagine if they had kept them all.  64 min The game still has a good intensity to it, despite a smattering of changes on both sides. Holland should have had a clear chance then, but Dirk Kuyt badly overhit his pass to Babel, who would have been in on Green.  66 min This is a real hodgepodge of an England team now - the front six is Young, Carrick, Lampard, Wright-Phillips, Defoe and Cole - but they are playing pretty well and still having an even share of possession, even if that is part due to the fact that Holland are so comfortable playing on the counter-attack.  67 min After a record 257 games from the under-21s, James Milner is about to make his England debut. I guess he&apos;ll replace Young.  68 min Indeed he does replace Young. He did okay, teasing Heitinga at every opportunity, but I&apos;m not sure his natural, crosses-laden game is what England need on the left when Steven Gerrard is unavailable. Joe Cole is a better replacement, surely.  69 min Milner&apos;s first contribution is a good one, a decent near-post cross that Defoe, running slightly away from goal, heads over from 12 yards. It was no more than a half-chance.  70 min A marvellous piece of play from Carlton Cole almost brings an equaliser. Lampard stabbed a careful pass forward from the centre circle and Cole, on the run, flicked the ball this way and then the other to befuddle Ooijer, and when it bounced up invitingly on the edge of the box he thumped a left-footed shot just wide of the near post with the keeper beaten. That was lovely stuff.  71 min &quot;In addition to the West Ham players you listed featuring for England tonight, I&apos;d also just like to mention that John Terry spent time at West Ham&apos;s youth academy, and if David James and Joe Cole were both fit, they would surely also add to the total,&quot; says Tom Bason, weeping into his West Ham FA Youth Cup final 1998-99 programme.  75 min Schaars completely bottles a 50/50 with Carlton Cole on the halfway line. I don&apos;t blame him, frankly. But Cole is hungry and has imposed himself on this contest. He is, more than most, a confidence player - but when it&apos;s high, as it is a lot these days, he has a fair bit going for him.  76 min &quot;In response to your comment about imagining what West Ham would be like if they&apos;d kept hold of the 7 English players - yes I can, they&apos;d be as useless as this motley shower, not won anything for over 40 years, full of overpaid egotistical second-rate players who are far more focused on their new film rather than international duty,&quot; says Martin Kings. &quot;Now I&apos;m off to watch Escape to Victory.&quot;  GOAL! Holland 2-2 England (Defoe 77) England are level! It came from James Milner on the left, who completely beat Heitinga to a bouncing ball and kept his cool when he got into the box. He kept his head up all the time, surveying the options, and then passed the ball right across the face of the six-yard box to Defoe, who screwed it in off the post. He has four goals in his last two games for England, but really he owes that one to Milner, who has played very nicely since coming on.  78 min Holland replace Dirk Kuyt with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.  81 min It&apos;s only a friendly and all that, but the mental strength England have shown here is extremely impressive. The other thing is that, once again, Capello has made aggressive, decisive substitutions, most notably in the introduction of Defoe at half-time. For those of us who are a little scared by the prospect of England winning the World Cup, he reads a game ominously well.  83 min Carlton Cole pulls away from Mathijsen to win Lampard&apos;s corner, but he could only plant his header wide of the near post. It wasn&apos;t much of a chance, because he was off balance and running away from goal.  84 min Wayne Bridge replaces Ashley Cole.  85 min We don&apos;t see Milner on the left often, because of Ashley Young&apos;s pre-eminence, but he looks a serious threat in that position. He is giving a Heitinga a torrid time, teasing him with that lovely close control. This has been a very encouraging debut.  86 min &quot;I&apos;m joining this late,&quot; says Gary Naylor, &quot;but from what I can see, one more goal and the World Cup is ours! Or is that The Sun tomorrow?&quot; Don&apos;t start. We&apos;ve got another nine months of this.  87 min Ooijer, backpedalling furiously, just takes Milner&apos;s cross of the head of Cole.  89 min Glen Johnson brings down Ryan Babel in the D. The terrible thing about that is that he pointed at the ball, even though he palpably got nowhere near it. Anyway this is a real chance... but Sneijder drives it off the outside of the wall and away for a corner.  Full time: Holland 2-2 England A very good night&apos;s work for England. They gave away two ridiculous goals in the first half, but were much the better team in the second and scored two good goals through the substitute Jermain Defoe. His performance, and those of James Milner and Carlton Cole, will give England real encouragement that there is life beyond their best XI. They&apos;re a decent side, this lot, and if somebody else can take Spain and Brazil out of the draw they might just win the bloody thing, you know.

Tonight they play Holland in a completely pointless friendly, and with this being the start of their 2009-10 season eyes are inevitably turning to their destiny: defeat on penalties in the quarter-final of the World Cup, followed by excuses, remorseless hounding of at least one foreign footballer, and the maiming of at least one foreign supporter, ideally not from the same country that has just beaten England. &quot;If we play the way we have been, we can&apos;t rule out England winning the World Cup,&quot; announced England&apos;s Brave John Terry, although with the speed he has made decisions this summer he probably won&apos;t have a firm answer as to whether England will win the 2010 edition until June 2014.

It means a lot to see supporters wearing your name and number, and I want to ensure people aren&apos;t inconvenienced by the change&quot; - Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner makes a grand gesture after changing his squad number from 26 to 52, safe in the knowledge that his largesse is unlikely to cost him more than a couple of hundred quid. ********************* CHINESE DEEP BURN The Fiver&apos;s noodle-eating, lampshade-wearing Chinese cousin, Yukon Laugh at My Low Wages But Your Broke Western Governments Are My Gimp Now Fiver, assures us that most folks round that way don&apos;t like European wine because it&apos;s too sweet. They either mix it with soft drinks or stick to plonk made from two varieties of grape whose existence had hitherto been unknown to the Fiver: Dragon&apos;s Eye and Cow&apos;s NIpple, both of which are from the country&apos;s booze capital in Shandong province, which borders - and this may not now come as a surprise - the Yellow Sea. It is not clear which type of wine players from Inter and Lazio funnelled into their mouths when in Beijing for last week&apos;s Italian Super Cup, which was presumably switched from Italy over concerns about it being hijacked by savage moped-chucking ultras with designer clobber and home-made daggers. Some have suggested that in the interests of good public relations the players indulged in local produce, but others, including the man appointed to chaperone them, claims good public relations were not uppermost in their minds. &quot;The two teams from Italy were just like two luxury tourist groups,&quot; Wang Bo fumed to the Beijing News before sniffing: &quot;On wine alone they ran up a bill of 70,000 yuan ($10,240) ... and they were extremely inconsiderate, they didn&apos;t think about anybody else&apos;s needs at all.&quot; Inter manager the special One is the perfect man to front a publicity campaign, at least if he&apos;s being lavishly paid to hawk a HD television channel, but it appears he did not win over the Chinese media. After he&apos;d claimed his team&apos;s defeat was down to the poor pitch and intolerable heat, a Beijing News hackette asked him how come Lazio didn&apos;t appear to be affected by these conditions, promoting the Portugeezer to reply: &quot;I know why Chinese football is so rubbish and why China has won gold medals in so many sports but not football, it is because the journalists are so unprofessional.&quot; The Special One had not changed his mind by the time he was accosted by state agency Xinhua later in the day, railing that Chinese media &quot;do not understand a thing&quot;. Now, it could be down to the effects of the Cow&apos;s NIpple plonk our dear cousin just sent us, but we have no recollection of the Special One telling us all the success he enjoyed in London was down to the professionalism of the Fiver. ********************* FIVER LETTERS &quot;Re: Andrew Taylor&apos;s Platinum Players website (yesterday&apos;s quote of the day).

Lee Cattermole is running on a treadmill, blowing into what looks like a breathalyser but isn&apos;t, and coughing for the doctor at Sunderland after the club agreed with Wigan a top-secret undisclosed fee of \u00a38m, with a further \u00a32m in add-ons. Cambridge United have reappointed Martin Ling as their first-team manager less than a week after he quit his post citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; with the club&apos;s then chairman George Rolls after just nine days in the job.

England looked anything but World Cup contenders as Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Barry misplaced back-passes straight to opponents, with Dirk Kuyt and Rafael van der Vaart converting their chances. Yet Capello, who remained calm at the interval despite his side&apos;s 2-0 deficit, effectively dismissed the uncharacteristic errors from two of his stalwarts as freakish events and instead took heart from a second-half revival which was inspired by his substitutes. &quot;I was really calm, really calm at half-time,&quot; said Capello. &quot;These were just two stupid mistakes. Two silly mistakes. Presents, but I prefer to give gifts in non-competitive games rather than in a really important World Cup qualifier. It&apos;s possible in pre-season to make mistakes like these \u2013 I can accept them. I wouldn&apos;t accept mistakes if they are on things we practise in training in the week and then don&apos;t do out on the pitch.

Sometimes, mistakes like these are down to having too much confidence. I just had to make them understand what they had to do to come back [from 2-0 down]. &quot;Psychologically, it is very important to make the players understand that the manager has confidence that they can recover the result. I spoke to them, really quietly, and I was happy to see the spirit in the team. We recovered the result and played very well in the second half. &quot;The spirit and the quality of the players in the second half, with the style we played, was very good. What we achieved tonight recovering the result will help us, for sure. It&apos;s very important. We have to remember this game in the future. But, of course, I think I&apos;d prefer not to have had to come from behind in the first place.&quot; Far from disrupting the team&apos;s play, the introduction of England&apos;s second-half substitutes seemed to galvanise the side. The debutant James Milner and Carlton Cole were particularly impressive, and Jermain Defoe conjured up a performance, and two goals, that will have bolstered his claims for a place in Capello&apos;s World Cup squad. The Tottenham Hotspur forward took his tally of goals under Capello to seven in nine games, a record that appears to establish him as the Italian&apos;s most prolific predatory forward. &quot;I think that was my best game to date in an England shirt,&quot; said Defoe. &quot;I think our performance was generally good and what the manager was looking for. We were a bit unlucky with the goals we conceded \u2013 it&apos;s pre-season for a lot of the lads \u2013 but we deserved the result for what we did after half-time. I just want to get back to my club now and keep working hard, get a good start in the Premier League, and we&apos;ll take it from there.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s one of the best English strikers,&quot; said Capello. &quot;He&apos;s very fast, technically he&apos;s good, and he always finds himself in front of the goal. &quot;But I&apos;m also happy with James Milner, who played very well.

The campaign will run across its channels including ESPN Classic and ESPN America, as well as five of its websites, which include CricInfo, Soccernet, Scrum and Racing Live. It will also run on Sky Sports and Sky Sports News as well as on Sky Movies, Discovery and FX.

The England international was released on bail to return to St Alban&apos;s Magistrates&apos; Court later this month and, with Spurs already willing to listen to offers for the winger, he may now also face a heavy club fine. The 24-year-old insisted the incident had been a &quot;wake-up call both personally and professionally&quot;, though the alleged misdemeanour does little to stall the alarming recent decline in his fortunes. With England&apos;s players travelling back from Wednesday night&apos;s friendly in Amsterdam, Bentley was arrested after his car was involved in a collision with a lamp-post in the early hours of the morning in Judges Hill, Northaw. No other vehicle was involved, with Bentley taken to Hatfield Police station and duly charged. &quot;I should like to apologise to my club and the supporters for my actions which led to my car accident and my subsequent charge,&quot; said Bentley in a statement released through the club. &quot;It was wholly unacceptable and I fully appreciate that as a professional footballer I have a duty to behave in a reputable and responsible manner. I am thankful that nobody was injured in the accident. This has been a wake-up call for me both personally and professionally.&quot; Realisation appears to have dawned too late to save his Tottenham career. Bentley, capped six times but only once as a Spurs player, has started only two of the club&apos;s 18 league games since the turn of the year and has been made available at White Hart Lane having fallen down the pecking order at the club. While Spurs&apos; players were not due to train at their Chigwell base yesterday, any hopes the midfielder might have harboured of reviving his career in north London will now surely have been dashed with the manager Harry Redknapp having made it clear in May that he would implement an alcohol ban at the club this year. The manager reacted to Ledley King&apos;s arrest for an alleged assault outside a Soho nightclub by vowing to stop his players drinking this season. &quot;I&apos;ll implement a strong rule next season that drinking is a no-no here,&quot; said Redknapp. &quot;Footballers should dedicate their lives to playing. Footballers should not drink. You shouldn&apos;t put diesel in a Ferrari. I know it&apos;s hard but they are earning big money, they are role models to kids.&quot; Redknapp will meet Bentley when the first team report back for training with the prospect of the manager imposing the maximum fine of two weeks&apos; wages very real. While the player has recovered from the dead leg that prevented his participation in Spurs&apos; pre-season tour of China and featured in Sunday&apos;s 3-0 friendly win against Olympiakos, it remains to be seen whether he will be made available for the opening league fixture against Liverpool on Sunday. Aston Villa have expressed an interest in signing both Bentley and his team-mate Jermaine Jenas, though the Tottenham hierarchy are keen to recoup as much of the \u00a315m they paid Blackburn for his services a year ago as they can. Meanwhile, the Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe is suing the police after his &quot;wrongful&quot; arrest on suspicion of driving while disqualified, his lawyer said. The England international was held for several hours at a police station in Harlow, Essex, at the end of last month. Essex Police said they have already apologised for their mistake, which was due to a computer inputting error. The striker said he will donate any damages awarded to charity. An Essex Police spokesman said: &quot;We&apos;ve formally apologised, acknowledging our mistake, which was due to an inputting error.&quot; Asked about the force being sued for damages, he said: &quot;Essex Police is conducting an internal investigation and liaising with Mr Defoe&apos;s legal team to ascertain the details of the claim.It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this time.&quot;", "sentences": ["With England&apos;s players travelling back from Wednesday night&apos;s friendly in Amsterdam, Bentley was arrested after his car was involved in a collision with a lamp-post in the early hours of the morning in Judges Hill, Northaw."], "title": "Tottenham not impressed as David Bentley charged with drink driving", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/13/david-bentley-tottenham-drink-driving", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Football", "Premier League", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-13T21:30:01Z", "article": "Jermain Defoe admits he is still driven by the &quot;massive disappointment&quot; he endured after being omitted from Sven- Goran Eriksson&apos;s squad for the last World Cup finals, with the Tottenham Hotspur striker intent on remaining in Fabio Capello&apos;s plans ahead of next summer&apos;s tournament in South Africa. Defoe made his international debut some five years ago but it has only been under the Italian, for whom he has scored seven goals in his last eight games to swell his overall tally to 10 in 35, that he has transposed prolific club form on to the bigger stage. The second-half brace in the Amsterdam Arena, coming against opponents ranked third in the world, offered further proof of his pedigree. &quot;It was a massive disappointment, I was so close back then,&quot; said Defoe, who effectively lost his place in England&apos;s 2006 World Cup squad to the then-uncapped Theo Walcott. &quot;I actually travelled to Germany [as cover for Wayne Rooney] and had to come home, but things happen for a reason. This, now, is the best time I&apos;ve had in my England career. Definitely. I&apos;ve worked really hard and, if you do that, I believe you get results. You can get frustrated, but it&apos;s important to remain positive. &quot;If I don&apos;t start the next game [against Slovenia next month], then hopefully I&apos;ll come on and try and do the same things I did against the Dutch \u2013 get in the box and get my goals. I know I&apos;m going to get chances because I&apos;m playing with good players. I just have to put them away. There&apos;s a long season to go before the World Cup and there are plenty of players aiming to be there. Michael [Owen] is at one of the best clubs in the world and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll score a lot of goals there, but I have to concentrate on myself.&quot; The captain John Terry has been impressed by Defoe&apos;s contribution. &quot;If we get there he could be right in the frame, especially with his work against Holland,&quot; he said. &quot;In training before the game we did finishing and, honestly, he was unbelievable. He is one of the best natural finishers I&apos;ve come across and is so sharp. These games are massively important for those guys on the bench. It&apos;s a chance to come on and show what they can do.&quot; James Milner, after 46 Under-21 caps, and Carlton Cole caught the eye in particular with the striker mustering his most impressive display in an England shirt after replacing Emile Heskey at the break. &quot;We all know we have a chance under this manager,&quot; said Cole. &quot;I&apos;ve been in four squads now and I&apos;m happy to be playing with some of the elite players in the Premier League. I&apos;m thankful that Mr Capello acknowledges I&apos;m doing well for my club. &quot;My game is all about hustle and bustle and keeping defenders on their toes. I enjoyed it. The manager said he had faith in me to make an impact and he told me I would be coming on. I wanted to prove I could do a job for England and needed to carry my club form on in to an England shirt. I saw this as a chance for me to impress. Obviously I&apos;m thinking about the World Cup. That&apos;s everybody&apos;s aim. I&apos;m not here to play about and just make up the numbers.

But that seems precisely the strategy of Fila, official shoe supplier to the Wimbledon tennis championships. Advertising hoardings at England&apos;s friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday night carried the legend: &quot;Fila: Icon Of The Casuals&quot;. This is part of a wider marketing campaign and, with a plug on its official website for a remake of the 1988 football-hooligan movie, The Firm, Fila is clearly aware of the football-violence connotations of the word, and explains how &quot;rival gangs, known as firms, and their members described as &apos;casuals&apos;, wore brightly coloured sportswear&quot;. The FA pointed out that the advertising hoardings at Wednesday&apos;s match had been sold by its Dutch counterpart through a third-party agency. But a spokesman added: &quot;We have a very strong stance on hooliganism; we are held as a standard bearer across the world.&quot; The campaign by Fila, which did not return calls, does not seem to sit well with the demure reputation of Wimbledon. But organisers at the All England Club would only comment on its &quot;tennis relationship&quot; with Fila, which it described as &quot;very good&quot;. Leeds ownership mysteryWhen Ken Bates told a court in June that he did not know who are the investors behind the Forward Sports Fund, owners of Leeds United, it seemed a strange comment. Bates is chairman of Leeds and given that a shareholders&apos; register was being kept at the London premises of his lawyer and Leeds co-director, Mark Taylor, how could he not know its contents? A month later that same register was transferred to Elland Road by the club&apos;s chief executive, Sean Harvey. Moreover the Football League requires that individuals who are the ultimate controlling parties of its clubs be declared so it may apply its fit-and-proper-persons test. &quot;He knows the names of the corporate entities that own the club,&quot; explained Harvey, when Digger asked about the discrepancy this week. But the Football League \u2013 which in order to work through its fit-and-proper procedures has so far refused to ratify the takeover of Notts County by Munto, also an offshore nominee company \u2013 needs to know names. &quot;The Football League has been supplied by Leeds United with whatever information it sought.&quot; So does Bates know? Harvey said he would get back to Digger with a more considered explanation. But despite several follow-up calls, he did not. Mosley&apos;s name in frameThere is talk in the Formula One paddock that Jean Todt will install none other than Max Mosley as his inaugural F1 commissioner if he becomes president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile. With Todt creating new roles, there are concerns among teams that Mosley, against whom they revolted, could return to a position of power. Todt&apos;s campaign manager, Richard Woods, said: &quot;It is far too early to talk about individuals in specific roles.&quot; Although Mosley has suggested he has no desire for a return to the frontline, it will be interesting to see how teams react if Todt grants his ambition to become the sport&apos;s policy manager in charge of safety and environmental issues. Ramps keeping calmFor one who once ripped off his shirt and charged across the Rose Bowl to stare out a section of Hampshire fans, whose team he had just defeated with a run out, Mark Ramprakash has become remarkably placid in his old age. To the extent that although the captain who ended his Test career, Nasser Hussain, and his old mate Mark Butcher both publicly dismissed his usefulness to England, old Bloodaxe has not even mentioned it. &quot;People ask their opinions, whatever they say I respect it,&quot; Ramprakash told Digger.", "sentences": ["Advertising hoardings at England&apos;s friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday night carried the legend: &quot;Fila: Icon Of The Casuals&quot;."], "title": "Fila casual about harking back to hooliganism with ad campaign", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/14/fila-football-advertising-hooligans-digger", "tags": ["Football", "The FA", "Sport", "Leeds United", "Max Mosley", "Formula One", "Cricket", "Formula One 2009"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-13T23:10:02Z", "article": "Most of the surprises in Fabio Capello&apos;s reign have been welcome, but the England team still have a habit of giving their manager the sort of shock he will not excuse. Although it is a very long time since the catenaccio period of Italian football, when a combination of man-marking and a sweeper system stifled opponents and left spectators in a torpor, Capello still craves a high degree of order. The goals conceded by his side in Wednesday&apos;s 2-2 draw with Holland will have been an affront to him. He made an attempt to dismiss them as aberrations that have to be tolerated at this time of the year. &quot;The World Cup is not in pre-season,&quot; he said, acknowledging that his side had not been completely ready. &quot;We moved the ball too slowly at times. Sometimes it was long balls when we should press.&quot; Rustiness was supposedly excused, but there was a glint of Capello&apos;s real reaction to the follies in Amsterdam. He corrected someone who spoke of two lapses in concentration. &quot;No,&quot; said the Italian, &quot;three times we fell asleep.&quot; In addition to the goals, he had in mind the moment when Arjen Robben went clear in a move that ended with his attempt going over the bar. It would be enlivening to hear Capello reveal his true feelings about the defensive work since he has been appointed. There have been half-a-dozen clean sheets in 16 matches under his supervision. That is mediocre, but in context the statistics appear shabbier still. Trinidad and Tobago, Andorra (twice), Ukraine and Kazakhstan fill five places on the list. England can afford only to take a trace of satisfaction out of denying the United States a goal at Wembley in May of last year. Those opponents are 12th in the world rankings at the moment, five places behind Capello&apos;s squad. There is, of course, a case for categorising the main errors on Wednesday as brainstorms. It should be a very long time before Rio Ferdinand or Gareth Barry next tee up attackers with a calamitously misdirected pass. Beyond all that is a suspicion that the back four and the men in front of them have not gelled as well as they must do at the World Cup for which England will qualify, with two games to spare, if they beat Croatia at Wembley next month. Whatever prospects England have in that tournament will be undermined if the lack of rigour persists. Capello is yet to come up with a back four and a defensive midfield that can be trusted. The consolation for him is that the candidates are of a high calibre. He must, for example, be thankful to have Barry, Ferdinand, John Terry and Ashley Cole at his disposal. As a unit, however, the rearguard provokes misgivings. There will be a rush to fault Glen\u00a0Johnson. Even so, he is not the first full-back to be reduced to a state of alarm by Robben and nobody had ever supposed that resistance was his forte. His work on the overlap secured his move from Portsmouth to Liverpool, but now he is at Anfield, with all its expectations, there will be a demand that he becomes steelier when the opposition have the ball. On Wednesday, Wes Brown&apos;s candidacy for right-back was enhanced. Indeed, players who are injured often find that their reputation rises steeply. The reality is that the Manchester United defender, when he next appears for England, will quite conceivably be chastised for not bringing the ball out of defence with the same fluency as Johnson. England need time to prepare and they will not get it until the gap between the close of the Premier League season and the start of the 2010 World Cup. Capello, unconsciously channelling so many of his harassed predecessors, sighed that just 10 players had been in condition to train on Monday. The following day the workload could not be too great, so close to the match itself. The most he can do is bring about a stable environment. He has remarked, teasingly, that he knows who his goalkeeper will be next June. He should let everyone, including his squad, in on the secret. Clarity can only reassure the back four. Considering his age and recent shoulder surgery, there must be reservations about David James resuming between the posts. Ben Foster has work to do to supplant Edwin van der Sar at Old Trafford when the Dutchman recovers from surgery on his hand. In theory, this is a promising period for Robert Green. The flaws in defence left him to show off his shot-stopping against Holland. Without him, England would have been defeated and the margin might have embarrassed Capello. Once again, the decision to meet leading sides in away friendlies has served the squad well. A game at Wembley would never have provided so much to consider. Capello will be encouraged that England, for all the difficulties, found a way not to\u00a0be beaten.", "sentences": ["Sometimes it was long balls when we should press.&quot; Rustiness was supposedly excused, but there was a glint of Capello&apos;s real reaction to the follies in Amsterdam."], "title": "Glen Johnson's frailty puts Wes Brown right back in World Cup race | Kevin McCarra", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/aug/14/england-fabio-capello-rio-ferdinand-gareth-barry", "tags": ["England", "Fabio Capello", "Rio Ferdinand", "World Cup 2010", "Holland", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-14T23:05:11Z", "article": "Last week the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy. It recognised that many of the clients wanting such a change were those whose religious beliefs conflicted with their sexual orientation. Among its suggestions, it proposed that therapists discuss with their religious gay and lesbian clients the possibility of joining gay-friendly congregations. Reading this evoked memories of my journey from religious repression to religious liberation, from ultra-Orthodox Judaism, which condemns homosexuality, to its Liberal counterpart, which celebrates it. As a young teen, I began practising \u2013 along with my family \u2013 ultra-Orthodox Judaism, which was teeming with laws. Cardinal among the prohibitions was one from Leviticus 18:22: &quot;Thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman, it is an abomination.&quot; This made my life untenable. As much as I tried to abide by every commandment, my efforts were insufficient. I knew that I was gay and that made me an abomination. At 17 I moved to Jerusalem to study in a yeshiva, a seminary devoted to the study of the Torah. I naively hoped that by cloistering myself with sacred texts I would be miraculously purged of my deviation. Reality crushed my buoyancy \u2013 my attraction towards men intensified. I tried to exhaust all possible means for my rehabilitation \u2013 crying, praying, fasting. When all this failed, I heard of a support group for Orthodox men struggling with homosexuality. At the group, we were told that homosexuality was a pathology called SSA \u2013 Same-Sex Attraction. We were sick. In our meetings, and also during my private sessions with the therapist, it was said that we could only find fulfilment by marrying a woman. We needed to convert to heterosexuality, and could achieve this by adopting masculine traits and gender-appropriate attitudes, like engaging in team sports or hanging out with the &quot;lads&quot;. With time, I began to feel increasingly pressured to wed, to be fruitful and multiply. This way I would channel my sexual energies and be &quot;cured&quot;. At 21, I went through an arranged marriage. I was engaged within less than a week of meeting my bride-to-be, and we moved to Amsterdam and then to London. Naturally, all those promises were in vain \u2013 and at the expense of an innocent girl. Over the years, my secret began riving at me from my entrails. I was sick of deceiving my wife and myself. I told her the truth. Shortly thereafter she left me, taking our three daughters to Argentina. The pain I put all of them through is an albatross I will carry on my shoulders for ever. After my ordeal, I burst out of the closet and considered renouncing my faith. I nonetheless came to realise I needed spirituality. Just as I couldn&apos;t repress my sexuality, I couldn&apos;t repress my spiritual self either. I needed an alternate source of meaning. With trepidation I approached the headquarters of Liberal Judaism in London, a movement founded on the principles of egalitarianism and inclusivity, which conducts same-sex commitment ceremonies. The movement extended to me its unconditional support.Having been ordained as a rabbi, I joined Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue and it felt like coming home. I now have a partner and have reached a level of happiness I never dreamed possible. There are many other movements across the faith spectrum which fully embrace their LGBT members. Transitioning from a conservative religion to an inclusive one is not easy. Yet the bliss felt by being at peace with oneself and being welcomed into an accepting community outweighs the cost. If you take the leap, there will be many to catch you. Trust me, I was there.

The Community Shield did its damnedest to carry on business as usual: a bit of flair from Manchester United before Chelsea trundled into top gear and the referee got an ear-bashing from Alex Ferguson. In the days of hot metal printing newspapers would have kept headline words like &apos;FERGIE&apos; and &apos;RANT&apos; on permanent standby but now a furious Ferguson has long since ceased to be news and is about as sensational as a Scottie dog barking at the postman. If the Manchester United manager is not careful he will follow Bill Shankly and Bobby Robson on to the list of national treasures, but there is bound to be plenty more to grumble about over the next nine months. Of course no football season is ever normal. It is just that some seem more abnormal than others. Any season preceding a World Cup, and particularly one which should see England complete their qualification with a minimum of fuss, gets increasingly edgy as the domestic programme becomes distracted by the mixture of hope and dread which always accompanies the national side to a major tournament. Meanwhile, England have made their usual torpid start with two slips in Amsterdam. The goalkeeping situation does not inspire an abundance of confidence for South Africa, with Robert Green agile but anxious against Holland, and Fabio Capello may have more difficulty preventing goals than scoring them. The depth of the problem may be gauged by the urgency with which Manuel Almunia advanced his case for selection now he is eligible for British citizenship. Almunia is not a bad keeper but he is nothing special either and the notion that a country which could once choose between Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence should be reduced to giving the gloves to a foreigner was bizarre. Happily, Capello agreed, although after Wednesday he might think differently if Almunia was a right-back. It is bad enough that Spain still has not stopped laughing since Manchester United turned up for the Champions League final only to find that Barcelona rather liked the look of the ball and decided to keep it. The Premier League may still have the power but La Liga now has the glory and if Real Madrid&apos;s latest attempt to hoard the leading stars in the firmament does blow up in their faces, Camp Nou has set standards which the usual contenders from England will struggle to match, even if lousy refereeing did rob Chelsea in the semi-finals back in May. Chelsea may turn out to be the Premier League&apos;s best hope of Champions League success this time. True, parts of their team are not getting any younger but their strength is undiminished and if, under Carlo Ancelotti, Drogba decides to be a Didier rather than a Diddums they may get even closer than a penalty shoot-out to winning the prize that Roman Abramovich craves most. As to the rest of the usual suspects, both at home and in Europe, much will depend on how well they fill the gaps left by players they would rather not have sold: Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez at Old Trafford, Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Tour\u00e9 at Arsenal, and not least Xabi Alonso whose value to Liverpool was not so much the occasional spectacular goal but the quiet efficiency of his passing and movement. Alonso was the book-keeper who kept the shop window stocked up. It will be a pity if the scramble to stay in the Premier League again becomes more compelling than the struggle to win it. That said, football followers of a certain age will be eager to find out if Burnley&apos;s inherent desire to keep the ball on the ground and pass it to feet survives. At least they will find some soul-mates at West Ham and Fulham. Finally, a sad note. Many will always remember where they were when the news came through that Mike Riley had been called to a higher place. Yes, Riley is the new whistler-in-chief and only a cynic would find solace in the knowledge that he will no longer be refereeing Premier League matches. There will surely be a book ...

That his team are being tipped for the title this season (OK, by the Guardian&apos;s football writers) shows: a) how far they have come in these past 60 months; and b) how much their rivals for the Premier League championship have either regressed or tread water this past summer. Admittedly, Liverpool without Xabi Alonso can be regarded as a step backwards too, especially if new signing Glen Johnson&apos;s displays are of an Amsterdam ilk, but this is a squad that has another season of title-challenging experience under their belt and surely, surely they won&apos;t toss away decisively costly cheap points at home against weak opposition as they have in recent years. Their opponents today can&apos;t be considered particularly weak, mind. Spared the millstone of Big Four expectancy of recent campaigns, Harry Redknapp has done what Harry Redknapp does best over the summer and spent money. Peter Crouch, who starts on the bench, might not be much of an upgrade on Twitter enthusiast Darren Bent, but Sebastien Bassong should be a classy addition to a defence that actually had the best home record in the top-flight last season, conceding just the 10 goals in 19 matches. Incidentally, five years ago, Jermain Defoe popped up with a second-half equaliser to grab a 1-1 draw for Spurs and I&apos;m fence-sittingly predicting a similar result today.  Oh, and I&apos;ll apologise in advance for a potential flurry of Rob Shoebridgeesque mistakes in the following report, as I&apos;ve managed to rip a contact lense, helpfully leaving myself with 20/0 vision. Balls.  Teams Should we be surprised that the not-fit-for-England Steven Gerrard starts? Tottenham: Gomes, Corluka, King, Bassong, Assou-Ekotto, Lennon, Palacios, Huddlestone, Modric, Keane, Defoe. Subs: Cudicini, Hutton, Bentley, Pavlyuchenko, Crouch, Naughton, O&apos;Hara. Liverpool: Reina, Johnson, Carragher, Skrtel, Insua, Kuyt, Mascherano, Lucas, Babel, Gerrard, Torres. Subs: Cavalieri, Voronin, Benayoun, Spearing, Kelly, Dossena, Ayala. Referee: Phil Dowd (Staffordshire)  &quot;To me personally, it was a mega-blow ...&quot; No, not a description of that Southport night out, but Steven Gerrard&apos;s verdict on the loss of Xabi Alonso. Rafa Ben\u00edtez has been exceedingly bullish about the form/improvement of Lucas, alongside Javier Mascherano in his midfield, though at this point it seems tough to rate the two in the same league.  Nausea department Sky are reliving Jamie Redknapp&apos;s greatest moments in Spurs v Liverpool games. This is poor.  &quot;Commiserations on the contact-lense injury,&quot; writes Ian Copestake. &quot;If Rafa was an optometrist he could supply you with a decent pair of rosy-tinted specs given that Andriy Voronin is now returning as the best player in the German league last year.&quot; Sorry, Ian, my mind was wandering as the White Hart Lane speakers blast out something that sounds very much like Duel of the Fates, from Star Wars or some such guff. They&apos;ll have to be very rosy if he&apos;s classed as better than Edin Dzeko or Grafite last season.  With White Hart Lane bathed in August sunshine, both sets of players join the crowd in a minute&apos;s applause for the late Sir Bobby Robson. And with that, we have kick-off. Liverpool playing from left to right, in TV terms, with Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe to get the game started.  1 min And we&apos;re under way. Not much to report in the early skirmishes.  3 mins An early thrust down the right flank from Spurs wins the hosts a corner. It&apos;s drifted into the box, skims of a head - probably Martin Skrtel&apos;s - and lands at the feet of Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto, who drills a 25-yard effort well over. &quot;Are Liverpool really title contenders?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. &quot;Not with that bench. These two clubs are always talked about as &apos;about to go up a level&apos;, but they don&apos;t, they just hover. Like England winning a World Cup, I just can&apos;t see Liverpool first and Tottenham fourth without also believing in Father Christmas.&quot; Say what?  5 mins: Fernando Torres gets little change from a physical Bassong challenge, having skipped past two challengers. Moments later, however, and Ryan Babel finds himself behind Ledley King, the last defender, with a bouncing ball. He struggles to get the ball under control, though and King - who&apos;s trained only three times, each for no more than 30 minutes in the build-up to this game - is able to clear.  8 mins: A long ball down the right frees Dirk Kuyt, but despite giving up 10 yards on the Dutchman, Bassong is across to concede the corner ...  9 mins: ... from which the ball beats everyone, runs out on the far side of the Spurs penalty area, and the subsequent cross back into the area is easily plucked out of the air by Heurelho Gomes.  11 mins: Space for Wilson Palacios enables the Honduran to drive in a weak shot from 25 yards, which is deflected behind for a corner. Again, the delivery is poor and comfortably dealt with, before Tom Huddlestone and his big bones clatter into Mascherano, conceding a free-kick in the process.  12 mins: &quot;Talking of benches, who would take Liverpool&apos;s over Spurs&apos;?&quot; notes Nick Hougham. &quot;Not me for one.&quot; It&apos;s interesting to see Yossi Benayoun warming his backside today, especially given his sterling performances last season, though he&apos;ll probably have a role to play here in the second half. Still, it&apos;s eminently forgettable stuff here; tight, dour and generally poor.  15 mins: A serious breakdown in communication for the Liverpool defence as Skrtel and Carragher each target a dipping ball and the latter only gets his head on his team-mate. Both players are down and receiving treatment; Carragher looks like he might even need some stitches.  17 mins: As Skrtel joins Carragher on his way off the field for treatment, the pacy stretcher-bearers arrive belatedly on the scene. Neither player appears badly injured, mercifully. For the time being then, it&apos;s Mascherano and Johnson in the heart of Liverpool&apos;s defence. &quot;Poor Carlo Cudicini,&quot; says Damien Neva. &quot;Is the bench at White Hart Lane really that much better than at Stamford Bridge?&quot; Perhaps it&apos;s heated?  19 mins: A bandaged Carragher returns to the field after a brief spell of Spurs possession produces very little. Skrtel is back on as well, but he looks uncomfortable and concedes a free-kick in a dangerous spot on the Spurs right.  21 mins: It&apos;ll be interesting to see if Ben\u00edtez makes a change in his defence; both Skrtel and Carragher look a tad on the groggy side. Back to the game, where a loose ball skids along the edge of Liverpool&apos;s penalty area and Aaron Lennon advances on to the ball, only to fire his right-footed effort tamely behind for a goal-kick.  23 mins: I&apos;ve counted no more than three touches for Torres thus far, who&apos;s not receiving anything in the way of supply. Not that Keane and Defoe have got body to ball much either, mind. From the touchline, word that Carragher has had &quot;12 staples in a huge gash to his forehead&quot;. My question being: are staples the new stitches? They sound far more painful.  25 mins: The first booking of the game, Lennon catching Skrtel late, offers Liverpool a further opportunity to treat the defender. Spurs fans rightfully bemoan this hold-up in play before we resume and Liverpool are forced to continue with 10 men.  27 mins: The best move of the match, but it&apos;s only three passes, which gives you an idea of the standard so far: Huddlestone eventually feeds Defoe down the inside-right channel, but his run is expertly cut off by Carragher.  28 mins: This is turgid. And I&apos;m sugar-coating it at that.  29 mins: &quot;At least Torres has been visible,&quot; opines Joe Pearson. &quot;Is Gerrard even in this match?&quot; Only now, Joe, as he picks up a loose ball 30 yards out and drives a low shot just wide of Gomes&apos;s right-hand upright. He did have it covered.  30 mins: What. An. Amazing. Miss. A deep cross from the Spurs right evades Liverpool&apos;s defence, but Luka Modric is sharply on to it. He flicks the ball back in with the outside of his right boot to Keane, no more than five yards out and the goal at his mercy. But he manages to give Reina a chance and the Liverpool keeper makes a fine save. It should be 1-0 to Spurs.  32 mins: A bone-jarring challenge from Mascherano on Huddlestone leaves both players floored and the Argentinian holding his ribs. After receiving treatment he returns to his feet, only for Dowd to brandish a yellow card in his face.  33 mins: Huddlestone steps up to curl the free-kick goalwards, around 30 yards out, but it&apos;s weak and takes two deflections before rolling out for a corner. Modric&apos;s delivery is decent, but Liverpool comfortably clear. &quot;I didn&apos;t know Sky were now televising Sunday League football,&quot; sniffs Mark Judd. &quot;Good turn-out from the friends and family members though.&quot;  35 mins: A good period for Tottenham and finally some interest. Firstly, Keane is released down the inside-right, before taking a touch and closing in on Reina. The keeper stands tall, though, and easily turns Keane&apos;s weak attempted lob behind. From the resultant corner, Defoe takes advantage of Liverpool&apos;s abysmal attempt at zonal marking to find space at the near post, flashing a header about a yard wide.  37 mins: &quot;Looking over the Liverpool squad list, do they have the least depth in central defence of any Premier League team?&quot; muses James Wells. &quot;Other than Skrtel and Carragher they have the oft-injured Agger and a whole bunch of reserves without Premier League experience. This will be a problem for them, I predict.&quot; Obviously it remains to be seen if Rafa&apos;s summer business will prove up to scratch, but I&apos;d have thought there were other areas of the pitch he needed to beef up rather than buying Aquilani and Johnson.  39 mins: Having weathered the brief Spurs storm, Liverpool finally find some time in the business end of the hosts&apos; half. They win a corner, which is easily dealt with by Bassong, but at least Tottenham&apos;s momentum has been stymied for the time being.  40 mins: A rampaging run from Palacios, whose turn of pace continually surprises me. He chips a good cross towards the far post, where Johnson strongly clears under pressure. Meanwhile, doomsayer Anthony O&apos;Connell writes: &quot;I didn&apos;t think I would be saying this as a Liverpool fan one game in, but we are seriously missing Alonso today. What&apos;s worse, his replacement Aquilani is months from fitness.&quot;  42 mins: Keane now has a hat-trick of abject efforts from great positions to his name. Here, a loose ball is flicked delightfully into his path, where it sits up on the half volley around 25 yards out. Keane is on to it in a flash, but his shot balloons miles over the bar. Spurs really should be ahead.  43 mins: Another surging run from Palacios, who almost trips over his feet attempting a shuffle before Skrtel does the job by up-ending him 23 yards out, just right of a central position.  GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Liverpool (Assou-Ekotto, 44 mins) Huddlestone assumes free-kick duties, but his effort is poor and strikes the wall. It then rolls to the feet of Assou-Ekotto, 23 yards out on the right edge of the penalty area, and his left-footed arrowed exocet screams past Pepe Reina&apos;s right hand and into the top corner.  45 mins: Liverpool finally show signs of life, but Vedran Corluka is on hand to snuff out a half-chance for Kuyt after Torres broke from deep towards the 18-yard box. &quot;Can I be the first Liverpool fan to ask who we need to bring in to stand a chance of winning the 2010/11 season?&quot; wonders Phil Sawyer.  45+2 mins: A good deal of added-time, given the early knocks to Skrtel and Carragher, is delaying the strongly-worded half-time &apos;talk&apos; Liverpool&apos;s players are about to hear.  Half-time: Tottenham 1-0 Liverpool After the miserable opening half hour of the game, things certainly perked up and Spurs are good value for the lead. Ludicrously, they could be out of sight had Keane had his eye in, but Assou-Ekotto&apos;s goal - he do well to strike a better one - sets us up for a tasty second period. Surely Liverpool can&apos;t be that bad for another 45 minutes?  Chit-chat of the half-time variety: &quot;As a Liverpool fan I am baffled at the predictions of us winning the title this year,&quot; reckons Anthony Clifford. &quot;As with Houllier, Ben\u00edtez seems to have missed the opportunity to seize the initiative. How we are going to last a season with this threadbare squad is beyond me. Maybe a triple swoop for Diao, Diouf and Cheyrou would add some much-needed depth?&quot; &quot;Re: the staples (23 mins). I&apos;ve just had the &apos;footballer&apos;s operation&apos; (ACL reconstruction) and they used staples,&quot; says Matthew Bailey. &quot;However, they&apos;ll be using them here because of how quick they are to put in. And effective. And, yes, they really hurt. Especially when they&apos;re coming out. I can&apos;t believe Carra can play with them poking in at him all match.&quot;  &quot;I think there&apos;s more depth to this Tottenham squad than Liverpool&apos;s,&quot; states Glenn Hoddle in the Sky studio. Anyone agree? This is just 45 minutes of a season, after all.  46 mins: No changes from either side and we&apos;re back under way with a quick bout of Liverpool pressure, which ends in a corner. Gerrard&apos;s cross is flicked away and Spurs clear their lines. &quot;May I be the first point out how terrible, how ridiculously out of touch with both his feet and the team Babel is?&quot; writes \u00d8ivind Ids\u00f8. &quot;He is proving, yet again, to be a mediocre player when met with a half-decent defence and he&apos;s been completely invisible.&quot; Paul Smith seconds this: &quot;Watching Ryan Babel is possibly one of football&apos;s most frustrating experiences. Never has a player promised so much yet delivered so little. I just want to get hold of the lad and shake him. There has to be more!&quot;  47 mins: I think Spurs fans will counter \u00d8ivind Ids\u00f8&apos;s view (46 mins), as Lennon skips brilliantly away from two challenges on the right flank. Bearing down on the penalty area, with men to his left, his touch is needlessly heavy and Lucas pips in to pinch it.  49 mins: An excellent tempo at the start of this second half and Gerrard drills a 25-yard daisy-cutter inches wide. Gomes brushes his fingers on the ball, but it was probably going wide and the ref adds insult to injury by awarding a goal-kick. &quot;Can we safely predict that the subject of Ben\u00edtez&apos;s post-match press conference will be the relative lack of transfer funds he has compared with Chelsea, United, and City, to explain the lack of cover at centre half and on the wings?&quot; begins David Wall. &quot;That&apos;s before he spends the rest of the transfer window spending the surplus from the sale of Alonso on another defensive midfielder and cover for Ngog, El Zaha, and Voronin in case any of them is unable to take his regular seat on the bench.&quot;  51 mins: &quot;How about a different theory?&quot; proposes Rob Moline. &quot;Man U aren&apos;t the best team in England and haven&apos;t been for at least three years. It&apos;s just that no one else is better.&quot; Hmm, go on ... &quot;Chelsea should have won the league in 2007 until Grant replacing Mourinho messed them up. Arsenal were clearly superior in 2008, but had a horror run of five or eight draws and losses in a row (as they do every year), and Liverpool should have won it easily last year, but did a bit of an Arsenal. In each year Man U burbled along not playing well, but doing enough to win most games. Even today they sounded poor against Brum, but won anyway. Chelsea and Liverpool look unlikely already - Chelsea were too old last year, and don&apos;t seem much younger. Arsenal were good yesterday but you just know they&apos;ll slump to about fourth again. So Man U it will be, without ever hitting the heights. Depressing.&quot;  53 mins: A booking for Skrtel as play becomes a little frayed, much like the tempers. Defoe then goes clear down the left, squaring to the advancing Palacios, who thumps a 25-yarder goalwards, where Reina acrobatically tips over. The corner, though, comes to nothing. &quot;In reply to Anthony Clifford (half-time), and in defence of Ben\u00edtez, he was rather hamstrung by the double whammy of Alonso wanting out, and therefore having to alter his spending plans, and the Americans withdrawing the summer spending money he&apos;d been promised,&quot; writes Phil Sawyer. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult to improve both squad depth and quality if you can only spend money raised from sales. Hang on, Glen Johnson? \u00a318m? Ignore everything I&apos;ve just said ...&quot;  GOAL! Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool (Gerrard pen, 56 mins) A brilliant run behind the Spurs defence from Glen Johnson takes him clear and into a foot-race with Gomes for the ball. There&apos;s an inevitablity to it, as Johnson beats the keeper, tips it around him and is cleaned out and sent to the turf. A stone-wall penalty and no complaints, which earns Gomes a booking. Gerrard steps up and comfortably beats Gomes down the middle.  58 mins: In fairness, Liverpool have shown a different side to them since the interval, raising the pace of the game and looking a little more threatening. But Gomes made a terrible decision in coming for that ball and there are bound to be more questions of the keeper after this game.  GOAL! Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool (Bassong, 59 mins) An awful minute for Carragher, who is caught out of position to a through-ball and hauls back Defoe, picking up a deserved yellow card in the process. The set-piece is curled in and Carragher, along with Johnson, give Bassong a free run and jump to attack the ball 12 yards out, and he sends a perfect header past Reina and into the top corner.  61 mins: I&apos;m still reeling at how such a poor game can change into a far more entertaining encounter. Babel now is hauled back, attempting to cut in from the left, giving Gerrard a free-kick at goal. His curling effort is straight at Gomes, who clumsily, but safely, fists it over for a corner, which the Spurs defence easily deal with.  64 mins: A breather on the pitch, while Liverpool prepare a switch, with Benayoun due to come on. Keane then finds the target with a stinging drive from a central position, but it&apos;s right at Reina, who collects at the second attempt.  66 mins: Johnson makes another break down the right touchline, attracting the attentions of Assou-Ekotto, who finds the target again, albeit this time on the Liverpool full-back&apos;s ankle. Another booking, the sixth of the game.  67 mins: Benayoun comes on in place of the ineffective Babel, while Spurs also make a change, Crouch making his Spurs league debut as Keane takes his leave.  69 mins: Sloppy defending from Liverpool, Huddlestone lumbering into a challenge and heading forwards towards Modric on the left edge of the Liverpool penalty area. The Croatian takes a pot shot with his left foot, but fails to find the target on the short side.  71 mins: Patient build-up from Liverpool ends with an inviting centre from Johnson on the right, which Torres flies in to get his head on, although under pressure from King, he fails to hit the target. A half-chance and Torres&apos;s first real sniff of goal.  73 mins: Gerrard finally seems to be coming into the game and here he&apos;s released down the inside left. King does well to keep the angle tight for the England midfielder and his low shot is easily saved by Gomes.  75 mins: Skrtel is replaced, his head injury apparently becoming untenable, and Daniel Ayala comes into the centre of defence.  77 mins: Crouch is making a nuisance of himself, no more, as Spurs begin to slow the pace of the game down, the warm north London afternoon likely to be a fair reason for this as well as the current match status.  79 mins: So, Liverpool plan to save this game by bringing on ... Andriy Voronin. Firstly, though, Benayoun finds half a yard before driving goalwards. It takes a deflection, but loops harmlessly behind for a corner. Voronin then takes the place of Kuyt.  80 mins: Spurs don&apos;t deal with Gerrard&apos;s corner brilliantly, taking two bites of the cherry before Modric hooks upfield. The pressure is beginning to build, mind, with the Spurs defence playing at least five yards deeper now.  81 mins: A breather for Spurs, but not for Lennon, who scampers 80 yards down the right touchline before winning a throw. The subsequent cross is easily claimed by Reina, but vital seconds are eaten up in the process.  82 mins: Both King and Mascherano look to be struggling, the former rubbing his hamstring and the latter holding his ankle. In the meantime, Johnson&apos;s low cross from the right slips under King&apos;s attempted interception but, crucially, evades Torres by a yard or so and Gomes collects.  83 mins: Another change for Tottenham, Jamie O&apos;Hara on for Modric.  84 mins: Much of Liverpool&apos;s title challenge last season was built in the momentum they gained from early victories with late goals against Sunderland and Middlesbrough, but (Spurs hex alert) they don&apos;t look like repeating the trick here. No sooner do I type those words and Benayoun bursts clear and plays Voronin into the box. The striker is slow, though and gets &apos;eased&apos; off the ball by Assou-Ekotto, enabling Gomes to collect. Liverpool and Benitez are baying for a penalty and the defender could well count himself rather lucky.  87 mins: More penalty claims from Liverpool as Torres&apos;s low cross strikes Assou-Ekotto on the right wrist. It would have been very harsh, but it seems to be the defender&apos;s day thus far.  Red card: Sammy Lee (89 mins) Dowd appears agitated at the Liverpool bench, which is apparently even more angry, Sammy Lee in particular, who is sent from the touchline, adding to a sense of pantomime in this finale.  90+1 mins: Both Benayoun and Gerrard have fierce shots blocked, before Spurs make their final substitution, Roman Pavlyuchenko taking the place of Jermain Defoe. Liverpool continue to press, King clearing from Torres and then ...  90+2 mins: ... it&apos;s handbags, Huddlestone, Torres and Lucas all coming together in a tetchy sketch of pushing. Dowd does well to cool tempers and we continue.  Full-time: Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool And probably just about the right result, given Spurs&apos; great first-half Keane chances which went begging. Liverpool belatedly turned up to the party in the second half and will feel that having got back to 1-1 that they shouldn&apos;t be leaving the Lane without a point to their name. For Spurs there were positive signs, looking defensively sound other than Gomes&apos;s lapse in judgement and the odd late penalty scare, but for Liverpool, who lost just twice in the league all last season, this will be a wake-up call. Stoke come to Anfield in midweek, with Villa following that visit up a week tomorrow.

By the time we got to Makrigial\u00f3s and turned left down a bumpy track, away from the sea, we were sceptical and tired, and really quite grumpy.     White River Cottages, Crete Photograph: PR    The White River Cottages, just a kilometre inland, came as such a relief after that. All the visual clamour dies away, and what&apos;s left is a hamlet of 13 interlocking stone cottages so in tune with the rocky hillside that it occasionally takes a moment to realise that what you&apos;re looking at is a roof or a wall. During the day the cicadas scream blue murder, but at dusk, at night and in the early morning, the silence is deep and clear.  And the cottages themselves are calm and cool. The walls are over 1\u00bdft thick and inside, apart from the occasional abutment of exposed rock or recess of fireplace, they are whitewashed. The decor is minimalist but warm: rust-red bedspreads, a vase of flowers, a cookbook and a carafe of local wine. Every cottage has a terrace with a view - of olive groves, mountain, or Libyan Sea, or of all three - a thoughtful piece of planning that, combined with the fact that all the terraces are private, and none look in on each other, must have required a particularly fiendish bit of architectural origami. Ours had an ancient olive tree shading the table; a lemon tree that already bore one yellow lemon (and a flower or two; it seemed a little confused) nudged up against the wall.  Maria Kostantakaki, the housekeeper, sells olive oil, fresh eggs and honey from her village, and Makrigial\u00f3s, with its greengrocers and long cool butcher&apos;s shop selling cured meat and sheep&apos;s milk cheese, and its well-stocked bakeries, turned out to have its uses. With food this good the terrace was the perfect place for breakfasts of Greek yoghurt, local honey and peaches, quiet lunches of Greek salad and fresh bread; and for afternoons of reading, watching the breeze reveal the silvery undersides of the olive leaves and, one surprising day, listening to a violinist practising what sounded like Brahms. It was also a great place to get bitten by mosquitoes. When they became too irritating, there was the swimming pool. Though there nearly wasn&apos;t one, apparently; Vangelis Mavrakis, 56, who bought and began converting the abandoned hamlet in 1986, says his friends tried to persuade him it wouldn&apos;t be in keeping with the spirit of the place. I&apos;m glad he decided not to listen to them. It isn&apos;t very big, but the loungers and flagstones are tasteful, the gardens surrounding it, of whispering bamboo and flowering cactus, carob and oleander, well-kept. To float in the cool water and look up at the blue sky and surrounding hills is a real treat.  Mavrakis, a thoughtful and slightly morose economist from Heraklion, oversaw all the building himself, and still spends hours working out how exactly to provide air-conditioning or free Wi-Fi, say, without ruining the rustic look. The hamlet was originally built for families coming down to the coast for the olive-picking season and he shows me photographs of their ruins - fireplaces open to the sky, wildflowers growing through the floors. There was no road when he began, so all the materials had to be brought up by donkey. He spent months looking for good stonemasons among villagers who thought he was mad to be converting it at all. But it&apos;s worked: the cottages fill with Greek tourists in July and August, when temperatures can rise to 42C; northern Europeans tend to come early or late in the season, when it&apos;s a bit cooler and they can hike through the surrounding hills.  He makes no secret of his annoyance over the housing boom. &quot;The people who destroyed Spain have destroyed Crete. Makrigial\u00f3s was always ugly, but construction has been overdone. There&apos;s no vision.&quot; He is worried by the fact that even before the economic crisis tourism was declining because, in his view, Crete competes with countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt - rather than Italy, France or Spain - but no longer has their low cost of living. So more projects will be left unfinished, more tourist development abandoned.  In the meantime he and his warm, efficient administrator, Iris van der Kaay (who used to work as a social worker and in advertising in Amsterdam), suggest ways to avoid the eyesores. Diaskari beach, for example, just along from the pounding music and idling cars of Makrigial\u00f3s beach, where utterly clear water laps at sand and stony outcrops are embedded with pebbles of red, blue, white, and green, like a natural mosaic. Or the pretty mountain village of Pefki, where a 100-year-old pepper tree is the focal point and the quiet whitewashed cottages, surrounded by flowers, all look out to sea.  A ravine that traces its rocky, pine-shaded way from Pefki to sea level is a popular hike (I declined to attempt it in the heat - it was generally 30C by 9am - but if you&apos;re good at early mornings or there out of summer, it looks like a pleasant thing to do). There are monasteries and boat trips; there&apos;s shiatsu, thanks to Iris&apos;s Israeli husband, Amnon Tepper (who likes Crete because &quot;it&apos;s like Israel but without the war&quot;), and the annual Casa dei Mezzo music festival, where musicians from all over the world come to a Norwegian businessman&apos;s villa in the hills to play, this year, Gershwin and Gounod and Rachmaninov; Schubert, P\u00e4rt and Mendelsohn. That explained the ghostly Brahms. There was also Greek poetry and some specially commissioned music. Gunnar Str\u00f8msholm established the festival because &quot;the &apos;culture&apos; that some visitors bring with them does not always impress the locals.&quot;  But the main thing, for me, was the quiet cottages, their calm and restfulness, and blue pool at their centre. \u2022 EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies to Heraklion from Gatwick and Manchester from \u00a364 rtn inc tax.

The Arsenal manager remains frustrated that Walcott was called up to play for Capello&apos;s England team and Stuart Pearce&apos;s Under-21s in June, thereby ensuring he would make a late return to pre-season training in a World Cup year. Pearce had been determined to select Walcott for the European Under-21 Championship in Sweden and he was fully supported in his decision by Capello. Walcott returned to training with Arsenal on 27 July and Wenger gave him a run-out in the club&apos;s final pre-season friendly against Valencia on 8 August. Walcott played for 45 minutes in the 2-0 defeat at the Mestalla but he suffered inflammation to his lower back and has not trained fully or played since. Wenger has ruled him out of Arsenal&apos;s Premier League visit to Manchester United next Saturday and he is not confident that he will be able to play for Capello in the friendly against Slovenia on 5 September and the World Cup qualifier against Croatia on 9 September. Both matches are at Wembley. &quot;This is why I didn&apos;t want him to play for the Under-21s,&quot; said Wenger, who has noted that Walcott will be expected to be in prime form and fitness for the World Cup finals in South Africa at the end of the season. &quot;I know how it works. The player comes back later than everybody else, he doesn&apos;t have a decent preparation, you are under pressure to rush him back, you play him earlier than you should, he gets an injury and you see him again in October. He has no decent preparation for the season and, in the end, England will pay the price as well. &quot;I am not angry because I knew at the start what could happen. But there is frustration because I can&apos;t see the logic in that whole process. In the end, England and Arsenal have a handicap. &quot;When a guy comes back on 27 July and you start the season on 15 August, he cannot be fit because ideal preparation is four to six weeks. Maybe I should not have played him in Valencia but I thought: &apos;We play a Champions League qualifier [against Celtic on 18 August]&apos;. You cannot give them any less than four weeks of holiday and in England, once you start, you never stop. With no winter break, you cannot catch it back.&quot; Walcott started England&apos;s World Cup qualifiers in early June against Kazakhstan and Andorra before he flew to Sweden to join up with the Under-21s. He was controversially dropped by Pearce for the second group game against Spain but he played some part in all five of the team&apos;s fixtures, culminating in the 4-0 defeat by Germany in the final on 29 June. Wenger was asked whether Pearce&apos;s decision to take Walcott to the tournament had been a selfish one. &quot;It was results-orientated, of course,&quot; he said. &quot;Once a player is already playing for the national team, what is the reason to take him with the Under-21s, whose intention is to promote players to the full team? That&apos;s what I couldn&apos;t understand. And then they put him on the bench.&quot; Wenger said Walcott had not told him he had suffered the injury and the first he knew about it was when England&apos;s doctors informed him. Walcott had joined up with Capello&apos;s squad on 10 August to prepare for the friendly against Holland. &quot;They [the England medics] told me Theo has a back problem but they will take him [to Amsterdam],&quot; Wenger said. &quot;They said, &apos;It will be clear in one or two days&apos;.

Over the years Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton and the Duke of Edinburgh have been guests. But seldom has the host, Jonathan Agnew, an unlikely cross between Roy Plomley and Sue Lawley, salivated quite as much as he did yesterday. &quot;My lunchtime guest has arrived to great excitement,&quot; announced Aggers a full three-quarters of an hour before the interview. This was perfectly dead-batted back by Phil Tufnell, who professed ignorance of any such guest. &quot;Don&apos;t you know? Oh, Tuffers, where have you been? It&apos;s someone who travelled on a bus from Amsterdam to be here.&quot; &quot;Dennis Bergkamp,&quot; guessed Tuffers. &quot;I hope not. I hope she&apos;s going to behave.&quot; &quot;Give me five minutes I&apos;ll work this out.&quot; Once again, Tuffers had bested Aggers. There has been competition between the pair recently as Aggers, plagued by midlife doubts, has vicariously lusted over The Cat&apos;s parallel career as a &quot;celebrity realist&quot;. Aggers, quite simply, is jealous. He is envious of some of the Cat&apos;s action, even his appearances on Hole in the Wall. He wants some for himself and what Aggers wants Aggers gets...Aggers in the Jungle. It will happen. If, and it&apos;s a big if, he could just do a Lembit Opik and pull off some kind of celebrity cross-generational affair. No wonder he was so nervous in the build-up to his interview with Lily Allen: &quot;It&apos;s a bit like my early encounter with Jeff Thompson \u2026 you&apos;re not wearing that Lily \u2026 wardrobe malfunction \u2026 I must say that&apos;s dedication, to come all the way from Amsterdam \u2026 very good effort to come \u2026 singing I do believe in Chelmsford this afternoon \u2026 tremendous stamina \u2026 not sure about the wig, do you know what that&apos;s all about, well you won&apos;t get headphones over it, that&apos;s for sure. I&apos;ve really been looking forward to this one.&quot; And, finally, it arrived but when it did so, and as is so often the case, Agnew/Allen turned out to be more about the interviewer than the interviewee as Aggers attempted to walk the dangerously thin line between benevolent uncle and desperate middle-aged man panting on the edge of the dance floor. He failed. &quot;You weren&apos;t even born then, oh dear&quot; and &quot;I&apos;d have thought you&apos;d be more of a one-day girl&quot; and &quot;I&apos;m quite getting into your music&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ve been out there and played a bit&quot; and &quot;it&apos;s just destined to be&quot; and &quot;is this what you expected to find up here&quot; and &quot;we might go and see Warney later&quot; \u2013 all suggesting that Aggers had positioned himself firmly on the pervy side of things. It had all, as with so many putative celebrity couplings, started with a tweet. Aggers was alone in a stand in Edgbaston. He was lost, but he was found. &quot;We keep plugging the Twitter because it&apos;s good fun,&quot; said Aggers, who went on, not to put too fine a point on it, to admit that he has been stalking the young singer ever since the third Test. So it was that he knew Lily had bought a watch which \u2026 wait for it \u2026 &quot;didn&apos;t fit&quot;. &quot;It looked big,&quot; was the Aggers verdict. It could, it has to be said, have become rather seedy at this point, but fortunately the sensible Lily cold-showered things by reminding Aggers that &quot;I&apos;ve got harassment orders out&quot;. &quot;Really,&quot; said Aggers, and you could almost hear him weighing up the risks. &quot;TMS Honcho in Stalking Shame!&quot; \u2013 yup he could live with that headline. &quot;You have to be quite brave to take you on \u2026 boyfriends and things,&quot; said Aggers, rather uncomplicatedly. &quot;Let&apos;s not go there, Aggers,&quot; said Lily, who, for one, didn&apos;t want to see the fabled TMS interview slot degenerate into Carry On farce. Stoically, she stuck to cricket, expressing her preference for the Test version of the game and suggesting there should be &quot;seven or nine Tests a summer. All-out war.&quot; Uninterested and undaunted, Aggers kept returning the conversation to wardrobe malfunctions. Until even the lovely Lily had had enough and she cruelly scotched Aggers&apos; amorous ambitions by mentioning &quot;I&apos;d like to go and visit Chris Old.&quot; Perhaps appropriately, it all ended in a mess of tweets \u2013 Aggers completely shot as interviewer now and proving it by reading out questions from tweeters.

That is something of a novelty for England managers but he will have completed the first phase of his work if Croatia are defeated at Wembley on 9 September and the national team will have qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals with two fixtures to spare. Even so, there is fine-tuning to be done. He will announce his squad on Sunday for the match with Croatia and a warm-up friendly against Slovenia at Wembley next Saturday. Despite the impact of his management, the troubles that beset his predecessors still have a marginal effect. Goalkeeping remains a delicate issue even if it has not harmed him in any significant game yet. Goalkeeping infirmity was, of course, to the fore when Paul Robinson, in Zagreb, and then Scott Carson, at Wembley, made mistakes that helped Croatia qualify for Euro 2008 instead of England. The issue has not entirely vanished. David James had been between the posts but was not in the party for the recent friendly with Holland. The 39-year-old had a shoulder operation towards the end of last season. His condition is under scrutiny and he will be watched, perhaps by Capello himself, when Portsmouth meet Manchester City at Fratton Park on Sunday. When the England manager said gnomically that he knew who England&apos;s goalkeeper would be next year the assumption was that he had Ben Foster in mind. The 26-year-old has his opportunity to consolidate with Manchester United while the veteran Edwin van der Sar recovers from surgery. The notion of Foster coming to the fore for his country fell briefly into disrepute when he had a bad day for United during a loss to Chelsea in the Community Shield. He then pulled out of the England squad for the Holland match with an injury. He is, all the same, making a good impression now, partly because United have allowed the opposition to create chances that let him display his abilities. Rob Green, of West Ham, pulled off some good saves in the Netherlands but Foster, ultimately, is likely to benefit from the fact that he can gather experience of high-level games for his club. Capello, however, is a man whose views can be hard to discern. There is a usually a surprise or two in his squad announcements. A transfer from Portsmouth to Tottenham, for instance, did not keep Peter Crouch in the manager&apos;s thoughts. Carlton Cole was named ahead of him for the match in Amsterdam. Nonetheless, Capello is likely to have been impressed by Tottenham&apos;s vibrant start, even if Crouch, regularly on the bench, has had little to do with it. Aaron Lennon&apos;s lively play for the club should earn him a recall, particularly since Theo Walcott has a lower back injury and is still to appear for Arsenal this season.

This is basically 13 blokes putting their shoulders to the stable door while the horses bolt down the Chertsey Road towards the M3. The four horses of the Apocalypse: the Auckland sex scandal, fake blood at Harlequins, cocaine at Bath and eye gouging. Boy, you can have some fun in rugby. The RFU see things differently and want the act cleaned up. The problem with rugby&apos;s image is that it is more an abstract painting than an exact representation of probity. People look at rugby and see many different things. You might think that the question of cocaine was unequivocal, but I remember playing at the Amsterdam Sevens and sitting around at the close of play in a fog of narcotic exhalations dense enough to shut Schiphol airport. Sex and booze have been playmates of rugby players for as long as the game has been played. Why should we be surprised that recreational drugs are also present? Would anyone be so very shocked to discover that the body\u2011building imperative of the modern game has persuaded players to take steroids? It&apos;s not a question of the crime, but of how rugby is policed. It strikes me that fake blood was exposed pretty early, from within, a healthy case of internal bleeding. If there was a grave offence committed at Harlequins it was the attempt to cover up the affair. The spear tackle, highlighted in the Brian O&apos;Driscoll injury in 2005, has been almost eradicated. What earned Richard Brown 10 minutes in the bin in last weekend&apos;s Australia v New Zealand game was but the faintest echo of what might have broken O&apos;Driscoll&apos;s neck. The availability of cocaine at Bath was exposed by complaints from members of the club&apos;s academy. The folly of what happened there was that a two-year ban for Matt Stevens seems to have served in no way to dissuade others. Rugby players in general play hard and are quite prepared to cheat. Mostly this happens at a minor level, with a hand in a ruck, or a push, but it can escalate into offences against the law of the land. At whatever level, players take their punishment when caught. When they ignore or try to pervert the sport&apos;s justice system \u2013 be it Harlequins, the drug takers at Bath or the South African arm-band protest at the sentence handed down to Bakkies Botha \u2013 sympathy tends to be in short supply. Rugby is fairly tolerant of smudges to its image because they are inevitable, given the nature of the sport, and quickly wiped away. I bet eye-gouging, the curse of last season, ceases to be a problem. So, why bother with an Image of the Game Task Group? Because it will investigate the &quot;impact of recent events on our commercial partners&quot;. In itself, that says something about rugby&apos;s image.", "sentences": ["You might think that the question of cocaine was unequivocal, but I remember playing at the Amsterdam Sevens and sitting around at the close of play in a fog of narcotic exhalations dense enough to shut Schiphol airport."], "title": "RFU's task force is all about image \u2013 rugby tackles its miscreants | Eddie Butler", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/aug/30/rugby-union-task-force", "tags": ["Premiership", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Premiership 2009-10", "Rugby Football Union"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-08-30T22:10:00Z", "article": "Fabio Capello has not quite secured England&apos;s qualification for the 2010 World Cup finals, but his squad announcement confirmed the stability that has been achieved. The party for the friendly with Slovenia on Saturday and the qualifier with Croatia the following Wednesday had no element of surprise. His goalkeeping deliberations carried a minor interest, David James took no part in Portsmouth&apos;s 1-0 defeat by Manchester City and although he was reported as having treatment for a knee injury it was thought that he would be available for his country. This seems to have been unacceptable to Capello. James, 39, was not involved with the draw against Holland this month. He could make a case for himself if he settles down this season and there has been talk of a move tomorrow, perhaps to join Tottenham Hotspur, whose regular goalkeeper Heureleho Gomes is injured for the time being. In Amsterdam, Robert Green, the West Ham United goalkeeper, made some good saves, but there is no guarantee that he will be between the posts for his country in the forthcoming matches. Foster was not fit to face the Dutch, but he has been appearing for Manchester United. On Saturday, he did not excel when Arsenal opened the scoring, but an excellent stop prevented Robin van Persie from doubling the lead and so left his team in a position to pull off a recovery and win 2-1 at Old Trafford. Capello will have to weigh up that mixed evidence. If James were to change clubs, White Hart Lane would seem the ideal setting for the moment. The side has taken full points from their league programme so far and the run was maintained on Saturday by Aaron Lennon&apos;s last-minute winner over Birmingham City. Capello would have brought back the winger in any case. Lennon&apos;s team-mate Peter Crouch had been left out of the England squad for the Holland match because he was not featuring prominently for Tottenham after his transfer from Portsmouth. On Saturday, though, he came off the bench to make the breakthrough against Birmingham. Capello has not excluded any striker to make space for Crouch. His name is added to those of Wayne Rooney, Emile Heskey, Jermain Defoe and Carlton Cole in a 24-man party. The manager seems to have as many options as he could reasonably have expected. The versatile Wes Brown, of Manchester United, is fit once more and could be an alternative to Glen Johnson at right-back or simply serve as cover for the other back four positions.

That much was evident on Saturday evening when two red-clad speed freaks tore up the pitch in the Allianz Arena to leave even their team-mate Mario G\u00f3mez gasping. &quot;I couldn&apos;t keep up with them,&quot; the Bayern striker said later. Neither could Wolfsburg. Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry only played 30 minutes together in the second half, but that was more than enough to utterly destroy the champions. The visitors were happy with keeping the score respectable at 3\u20130 in the end. The German press went into pun-tastic overdrive in the face of the duo&apos;s devastating display. &quot;Robb and Roll rock Bayern&quot;, gushed the Kicker. &quot;Rib and Rob, the most dangerous wingmen in the world&quot;, wrote Spox. S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung demanded &quot;respect for Robb\u00e9ry&quot; and Bild hailed the arrival of the &quot;Baylaktischen&quot;, the Baylacticos, and their &quot;football from another planet&quot;. The Real Madrid reference is quite apt: Robben, signed for \u20ac25m last Friday, won&apos;t solve any of his new club&apos;s grave defensive problems. On the contrary, Bayern&apos;s top-heaviness is fast approaching Marge Simpson proportions. But as an attacking double-act, the pair will take some stopping. It&apos;s all the fault of little Mainz 05, of course. Their 2-1 win over Bayern last week had the league laughing, Bayern supporters tut-tutting (they wrote an open letter to the board, detailing all the planning mistakes in cod-academic, high-school language) and Uli Hoeness pressing the panic button. He plundered the last few million from the club&apos;s fabled current account to sign one of his favourite players. Robben, who was promised that the mercurial Rib\u00e9ry would stay this season before he signed, duly scored two wonderful counter-attacking goals on his Bundesliga debut. &quot;Tulpen aus Amsterdam&quot; (Tulips from Amsterdam) was booming out of the speakers. The crowd went ballistic \u2013 by Bavarian standards. In the stands, the bosses were waving their arms in the air triumphantly. We shall assume that the stain on Hoeness&apos;s shirt was ketchup. &quot;Money does score goals,&quot; beamed a smug Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the latest impulse acquisition. &quot;Bayern have decided that they want to compete at the top level and compensate for their sporting and strategic weaknesses the way they do it in England, Spain and Italy: at all cost,&quot; wrote Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung with mild disdain. As long as they spend it on genuine stars rather than imagined ones, few neutrals will complain. After the search for a playmaker proved fruitless, Bayern&apos;s coach Louis van Gaal can now play his preferred 4-3-3 system. Going forward, the advantages are obvious: out of form centre-forwards stay on the bench while RibRob/RobRib switch positions to unnerve defenders and enjoy the artistic licence that their creativity demands. &quot;The manager gives me the freedom to go where I want,&quot; said Robben. As in Arsenal&apos;s case, the new formation has the welcome side-effect of providing added protection to the back four. Anatoly Tymoschuk, outplayed as the sole sitting midfielder a week ago, suddenly looked comfortable with a little help from Bastian Schweinsteiger and Hamit Altintop. There&apos;s an interesting lesson here: if your central midfielders aren&apos;t good enough, just add more. Wolfsburg had seemingly little interest in spoiling the Dutch-French love-fest. Armin Veh&apos;s side never got going and left the strikers Edin Dzeko and Grafite completely isolated throughout. Without the injured captain Josu\u00e9, Zvjezdan Misimovic tried to do too much and ended up doing too little. &quot;We wanted to keep it tight at the back and play on the counter,&quot; said the manager. Obviously, no one had listened. Veh must fear that Wolves could suffer the same championship hangover that he experienced two seasons ago with Stuttgart. The Volkswagen club had lost a second match on the trot but should have enough class to ride out the storm. Nobody&apos;s had tougher opening fixtures, either. &quot;Magath&apos;s legacy becomes Veh&apos;s burden&quot;, wrote Welt. The Schalke manager would, however, love to have his successor&apos;s problems. After a promising start that belied the inherent mediocrity of the squad, the Royal Blues lost 1-0 at home to the new boys, Freiburg. It was, according to S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a &quot;headless, helpless, clueless&quot; performance, a revelation of sorts. Even Magath&apos;s magic fitness regime won&apos;t turn this squad into a real force this season. Worse for Schalke, they&apos;ve been unable to strengthen this summer due to acute liquidity problems. The former general manager Rudi Assauer has controversially claimed that players did not receive their wages on time and that Schalke owed money to suppliers. Future sponsorship revenue, it turns out, has already been spent on expensive flops by the previous regime. On Saturday it looked as if Magath could offload the right-back Rafinha to Bayern, but the Bavarians decided against buying the little Brazilian in the end. Serious offers from abroad have also failed to materialise. &quot;Transitional campaign&quot; won&apos;t do the horror justice; it&apos;ll be a long, ugly slog for Schalke. In contrast, there&apos;s something almost romantic about Bayern&apos;s new pairing: Rib and Rob&apos;s passionate affair is no doubt fired by the knowledge that their relationship is sadly of a temporary nature. They will rock Germany hard, for one season and one season only.

Cynics might think we&apos;re trying to pull an SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) fast one to boost our hit-count, but nothing could be further from the truth. That first paragraph is chock full of just some of the many, many subjects that may come up for discussion in today&apos;s Transfer Deadline Day Live, theguardian.com/football&apos;s rolling report on the frantic last-minute horse-trading set to take place in football clubs around the UK, Europe and beyond between now and 5pm, when the transfer window will slam shut. Although you could be forgiven for thinking that the guy who operates the Sky Sports yellow breaking news ticker will be the hardest working man in sports journalism on a day like today, you&apos;d be mistaken. We&apos;ll be here, shackled to our desk with a chain barely long enough to allow access to the bathroom, typing our fingers to the bone as we bring you all the latest news and gossip on a day Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp once described as &quot;my favourite day of the year, my raison d&apos;etre, my first, my last and my everything.&quot; Obviously we want to hear from you, so please email your thoughts on the day that&apos;s in it, or anything else for that matter. We&apos;d particularly like to hear from you if you&apos;ve any transfer gossip of your own, or happen to have seen Sergio Aguero and/or David Villa looking in the window of an estate agent&apos;s office near you.  Preamble Morning and welcome to transfer deadline day, football&apos;s equivalent of those crucial minutes between 1.44am and 2.01am on the dancefloor at JJs circa 1995. DJ Numpty has just put on Celine Dion&apos;s Think Twice, and now everyone is trying to pick up whatever they can before the lights go on. The cool cats, of course, have already got their hands on their chosen ones - only Arsenal of the Do We Actually Call Them The Big Five Yet might do any business today - but pretty much everyone else should be in action. It&apos;s a peculiar form of torture, especially if you are following it via Sky Sports News, but it&apos;s also inexplicably good fun. Let&apos;s get it on, sugarsa.  9.13am Sky Sports News&apos; yellow ticker has already been fired up to report the seismic news that, er, Nicky Shorey is travelling to Portsmouth for a medical ahead of a season-long loan move, and David Bentley might be getting intimate with the substitutes bench at Eastlands over the next few years. Sky Sports News really do come to the party on transfer deadline days: sadly that party is full of absolute nuggets, all clutching seven mobile phones and looking very important. When your pulse-rate increases considerably upon hearing the news that Craig Cathcart might, just might, be going to Newcastle on loan, you probably need to look at what has become of your live. Me telling someone else to get their life in order. Is that irony?  9.18am Portsmouth have made a loan signing, although experienced Nicky Shorey-watchers - to think he played against Brazil! - will be disappointed to know it&apos;s not him. Instead they&apos;ve signed Benfica midfielder Hassan Yebda, a 25-year-old former France youth intenational, for the rest of the season.  9.22am So here are some of today&apos;s possible deals. Who will be the big winners today? I reckon Spurs, who are in for Niko Kranjcar, Martin Petrov and David James. Petrov is magnificent, and could have done a job for Manchester United or Liverpool, while there is a delicious logic to the proposed Kranjcar signing: having lost your Croatian central midfielder who plays in an inside-left position, why not buy the man who actually plays in an inside-left position for Croatia?

I think he means until we all get our sanity back, but he might also have been talking about when the transfer window shuts. The deadline is 5pm today rather than the usual midnight; that&apos;s because, as you may have noticed, this is actually September 1 (although April 1 might be more appropriate) rather than August 31. If August 31 falls on a weekend or a Bank Holiday, the deadline is put back.  9.31am &quot;Can I add to your list of potential deals we will see go through on this exciting close to the summer transfer window,&quot; begins Taylor Hanton. &quot;James Richardson back to Channel 4; Sid Lowe to Serie A coverage; Barry Glendenning to The News of The World in a staggering \u00a3100, four article deal.&quot;  9.33am &quot;&apos;Anyone out there?&apos;. Come on Smyth, this is hardly the deciding say at the Oval,&quot; sniffs Will Beckett. &quot;We&apos;re here, but have nothing of any import to say. If it makes you feel better I&apos;m happy to say that I just saw David Villa being smuggled into a taxi heading to the KC Stadium where he&apos;s going to get Tango&apos;d by some orange fella.&quot;  9.42am &quot;So having lost Michael Turner, who should Hull manager Phil Brent buy?&quot; wonders Paul Lacey? And did he send Michael Turner off in the manner of his cousin David? &quot;If a good man comes to me and says, &apos;Thank you, Phil, for the opportunity and continued support in the work-related arena, but I&apos;ve done that, I wanna better myself, I want to move on&apos;, then I can make that dream come true too, a.k.a, for you.&quot; Anyone else got any more Office/football quotes?  9.44am &quot;Sean Ingle has informed me on Twitter that you will never be persuaded to join in and tweet with Glendenning, Ingle, Ronay et al?&quot; says David Jones, adding a question mark just because he can. &quot;Why the antipathy towards Twitter? You get a chance to send messages to Lily Allen you know...&quot; Well, yes, that&apos;s the first reason not to be on it. The first of 74,129. When it comes to Twitter, there&apos;s just one obvious question: why?  9.45am Nothing happening. Sky are showing an advert for Colin McRae&apos;s Dirt 2. I am lamenting the loss of my beloved green bobble hat, one of the few things that made sense in this world, in Oxford on Saturday. Tom Lutz is working diligently behind the scenes to secure a replacement before the 5pm deadline.  9.47am What do we think will be the most absurd use of Sky Sports News&apos; yellow breaking-news ticker today? I look forward to &apos;Gary Neville seen making fleeting eye contact with a Spanish phrasebook in WH Smith&apos; or &apos;Richard Dunne emerges from service-station toilet in Birmingham grimacing ever so slightly. Sky Sports News sources understand he was simply miffed at having to pay 20p to use the facilities&apos;.  9.49am An early low for the SSN yellow ticker: &apos;Darren O&apos;Dea signs three-year contract extension at Celtic. Defender O&apos;Dea travelling to Reading ahead of proposed three-month loan deal&apos;.  9.50am &quot;How about Phil Brent on the phone to Steve Bruce,&quot; says Andrew White. &quot;Bruce \u2013 Has he passed his medical yet? Brent \u2013 He gives the medicals. (followed by exaggerated Pinocchio nose..)&quot;  9.52am &quot;I just wanted to be the first to say: &apos;Has the football world gone mad?&apos;&quot; says Charlie Gidney. &quot;Seriously - Michael Turner costing more than Kranjcar, Petrov and James combined? Man United and Liverpool - two teams desperate for a creative midfield player/a left winger with a pulse - not picking up Wesley Sneijder/Arjen Robben/Rafael Van der Vaart for a song from Real Madrid? Arsenal not buying a big-name striker to replace Adebayor? Aston Villa waiting until deadline day to replace Martin Laursen even though they knew he was retired months ago, and not replacing Gareth Barry at all? With players like Kranjcar going for a song and Turner costing an absolute fortune, it seems the odd combination of being both a buyers&apos; and a sellers&apos; market - something perhaps that could be henceforth known as a suckers&apos; market?&quot;  9.56am David James has arrived at Portsmouth&apos;s training ground, report Sky Sports News, before going to a break with the words: &quot;Deadline day, are you ready?&quot; Cripes.  9.59am Eidur Gudjohnsen has been bundled through the door marked &apos;do one&apos; at the Nou Camp and has magically come out the other side in Monaco, where he has signed a two-year deal. He&apos;s only 30, so you have to think that&apos;s a decent signing, although we don&apos;t know the fee because it&apos;s undisclosed. You can read all about it here.  10am Christ, now Sky are analysing body language and the like. &quot;Normally Harry Redknapp gives us a wave when he arrives at the training ground; today he was head down and straight in the door to get on with business.&quot; You genuinely couldn&apos;t script this. Oh.  10.03am As modern football is quite annoying and rubbish and needs to be STOPPED, let&apos;s remember a time when things were much better.  10.04am Inevitably, Daniel Levy is shoving his nose where it isn&apos;t wanted: Sky reckon he doesn&apos;t want to bring in David James, because he&apos;s 94 years old, and has told Harry Redknapp he can sign only one of Martin Petrov and Nico Kranjcar. That&apos;s a tricky one. I think Petrov is probably the better player, but he&apos;s a) older and b) a completely different type of player to Modric (and Kranjcar).  10.06am &quot;SSN was made for days like this,&quot; says Archi Campbell. &quot;I hope Jim White is on today, he&apos;s always at his most inane on TDD. I am a bit disappointed that it ends at 5pm though.&quot; Yeah, I&apos;m really disappointed that it finishes at 5pm too. Really devastated.  10.08am &quot;Breaking news,&quot; writes Hugh Lindley. &quot;Darren Anderton sighted in blonde wig, getting into the back of a black Mercedes at Ruddington Service Station with Sven and Uri Geller.&quot;  10.10am Richard Dunne is having a medical at Aston Villa ahead of his \u00a36m move. A good signing that, in my humble one. He&apos;s Laursen-lite; well sort of. But what would happen if, during the medical, Dunne did this?  10.11am &quot;I hate it with a passion,&quot; says Mark O&apos;Neil of life/transfer-deadline day. &quot;Artificially created excitement for deals that could have been completed a month ago in time for the start of the season. Teams are thrown into turmoil with no chance to properly bed in players and then as soon as it shuts, four months of speculation and unsettling of players till the next one. If they want a transfer window, confine it to June and July only with only emergency loan deals allowed outside of that. Otherwise, scrap the damn thing and get back to letting teams perform their business in an orderly (well\u2026) fashion.&quot;  10.13am &quot;This,&quot; writes my imaginary lover/colleague Tom Lutz, &quot;is the biggest story I have broken today.&quot;  10.15am Does anyone mind if I take a two-minute toilet break? Speak now or forever hold your peace. Because I won&apos;t be able to hold mine much longer, etc and so honk.  10.16am One small thing: while I have a lot of sympathy with Arsenal over the Eduardo business, they have apparently produced a 19-page document in his defence. Nineteen pages! How on earth did they fill that?  10.20am A real transfer! Stoke have signed Danny Collins from Sunderland for \u00a32.75m. I haven&apos;t seen much of Collins, but if Tony Pulis has signed him I&apos;m fairly confident he&apos;s a good buy. What an astonishing job Pulis has done in such a short space of time. The biggest compliment you can pay him is that you now expect Stoke to win home games against all bar the top four/five.  10.22am Some transfer news from the Best League in the World: Barcelona have paid \u00a325m for Shakhtar Donetsk&apos;s Ukraine defender Dmytro Chygrynskiy, and Real Madrid have sold their right-back Miguel Torres to Getafe, with a buy-back option if he turns out to be any good.  10.25am A few links: here&apos;s Observer Towers heart-throb Tom Lamont&apos;s guide to deadline day at Sky Sports News, here&apos;s a list of all today&apos;s confirmed transfers, and here are some transfer-related Joys of Six: terrible transfers, transfers that never were, inspired transfers, and big-money debuts.  10.30am &quot;Arsenal&apos;s 19-page Eduardo document could be a flip-book maybe?&quot; says Adam Leier. &quot;That way you can get a REALLY good look at the inconclusive evidence.&quot;  10.32am &quot;I&apos;ve just seen Gary Naylor walk in the Sunday Times office,&quot; says Ben Bradley. &quot;Apparently they offered to print every email he ever sends rather than just 99 per cent.&quot;  10.35am West Ham defender James Collins - is he actually any good? - is also having a medical at Aston Villa with a view to the exchange of five million pieces of silver between two of the good guys of football management.  10.38am &quot;SSN reports Barry Glendenning seen jumping out of a taxi outside NOTW offices,&quot; says Taylor Hanton. I can exclusively confirm that he&apos;s not in the pub today, and he hasn&apos;t been seen in The Swan this morning, so there aren&apos;t many other places he could be. Don&apos;t go Baz!  10.41am &quot;Re: the Arsenal fax,&quot; begins Chris Marshall, &quot;you wonder how many times Wenger could photocopy his genitals before it stopped being funny, but maybe he asked the board to join in.&quot; It stops being funny? Next you&apos;ll be telling me Jackass is lowbrow.  10.42am Niko Kranjcar has passed a medical at Spurs, and is apparently only going to cost \u00a32.5-3m. The fee is low because he&apos;s in the last year of his contract. Either way, that&apos;s a fantastic piece of business, and bad news for Gary Naylor. &quot;I&apos;d quite like Nico Kranjcar to go to Goodison as back-up for Mikel Arteta,&quot; says Naylor, &quot;but that&apos;s not going to happen is it?&quot;  10.43am &quot;We have breaking transfer stories all day,&quot; says Sky Sports News&apos;s Ian Payne, as if that&apos;s a good thing.  10.45am &quot;Thank you sir,&quot; writes Tom Lamont, having finally escaped hordes of females to get to his keyboard just 45 minutes after entering the building. &quot;I prefer &apos;charm bomb&apos;, but yours will do.&quot; I like &apos;heart throb&apos; because I haven&apos;t heard it for years. In reference to myself, obviously, but in reference to anyone. I think we should all endeavour to bring the phrase &apos;heart throb&apos; back.  10.48am Sky Sports News have saved Jim White, like a reverse pinch-hitter, for the crucial 3pm shift. He will redefinine the phrase &quot;on one&quot;. I pity the fool who has to MBM his shift at the transfer window. Yes, it is me.  10.50am So just to recap, it&apos;s been a really, really, really busy deadline day.  South America&apos;s defence union, Unasur, overcame its first major survival test last week, just over a year after being created. The cause of the test was none other than the Pentagon. For all his sky-high popularity in Colombia, \u00c1lvaro Uribe is the most reviled president in the rest of South America. His recent decision to allow the US military to install seven bases in his country has enraged several of his neighbours, like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and concerned others. Yet Uribe was the man of the day last Friday when the presidents of the member states of Unasur gathered in the Argentine city of Bariloche to discuss concerns over the bases. Unasur is meant to be run by a council formed by the defence ministers of its member states. But earlier in August, when regional unease peaked over the Pentagon plans, the Argentine president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, suggested in a meeting in Quito that the matter be discussed in depth by the presidents themselves rather than the ministers. The crux of the discussion would be the need for assurances from Uribe, who was absent from Quito, about what the American bases are to be used for. In the end, the debate in Bariloche lasted more than seven hours, and a sketchy final document called to look further into the matter. Colombian observers celebrated the outcome, for Uribe had arrived to the meeting pre-destined to be defeated and instead left re-empowered because his neighbours did not condemn his treaty with the Pentagon, and he didn&apos;t even have to offer solid assurances. A second summit \u2013 this one of defence ministers \u2013 will be held in the next fortnight to continue discussing the situation. Lula was the other victor of the day. Unasur is especially close to his heart, and a schism in the young union would have damaged his main platform to project Brazil as a true global player. Itamaraty (as the Brazilian foreign ministry is called) has long been admired in other South American countries for the consistency and continuity of its work under different administrations. Under Lula, it has gone a step further and become a true focal point, working for Brazil to become the region&apos;s diplomatic leader. Lula and Uribe had a minor face-off prior to debate over live broadcasting. Uribe said he would only participate if TV cameras were present. Lula was against the live broadcast and later regretted his decision to cave in. Halfway through the afternoon, when all the presidents had spoken and the summit had been going on for well over five hours, he explained why. Live broadcasts affect the arguments because presidents &quot;speak with their own audiences in mind rather than to find a solution,&quot; he said angrily. There is a growing conviction in South America that the war on drugs is a failure. Because of this, most administrations are weary of seeing American troops deployed to help fight drug trafficking. More importantly, most South American leaders feel uncomfortable with Pentagon arsenals sitting in their backyards and want guarantees that the bases will not be used for military actions. Most leaders wished to have a meeting with Barack Obama to ask him about the matter. Lula even invited the US president, who declined. Several leaders still dream about the improbable meeting. Latin America seems unlikely to be that high in the US political agenda. Extreme concern over the bases does not apply only to leaders like Ch\u00e1vez, Ecuador&apos;s Rafael Correa and Bolivia&apos;s Evo Morales. Per\u00fa&apos;s Alan Garc\u00eda is second only to Uribe in the region in his love for the White House, and he is the Colombian&apos;s only open ally in the sub-continent. And yet in Bariloche even he expressed concern. &quot;If the bases were circumscribed to Colombia, we would not be alarmed. But what alarms us is that, at a time when we want to build ourselves as a nation, we could see ourselves becoming part of the strategy of other blocs. We must specify what kind of presence [the American troops] are all about,&quot; he said.  Garc\u00eda spoke of nation building but was referring to what most people would call regional integration. Whatever the phrasing, he aimed at one of the main issues at stake. Currently, it would seem easier to pursue regional integration without Colombian participation, as certain political and ideological differences appear too big to overcome. However, the eternal sluggishness of Mercosur \u2013 the biggest trade bloc in the area \u2013 has proven that shared ideologies do not ensure more integration. Many leaders, and most notably Lula and Chile&apos;s Michelle Bachelet, seem to know this, and turning their backs on Bogota is not even a question. South America is a lifeless body as far as integration goes. Attempts are being made to change this. As part of these, an underlying argument is what Unasur is all about. Bachelet spelled this out when she said that defence ministries in the region have very different areas of competence and jurisdictions in each of their countries, and each ministry uses different methods to undertake its tasks. She set the example of Chile, where &quot;We have never wanted the armed forces to participate in internal security&quot; as they do in Colombia. Because of these local differences, she said, Unasur should look to create standardised methodologies for all members to know what is being talked about when speaking of issues such as defence and anti-drugs operations. She was calling to improve understanding of each other. It seems like a fair call.  10.57am &quot;As disappointed as Barry Glendenning going to NOTW is, I feel that actually it might have a liberating effect on the Guardian Towers Team,&quot; says Ben Bradley. &quot;We might see Sid Lowe move into a more central position, Williams should take on more responsibility now he&apos;s gone as he was clearly affected by being in his shadow, and we might finally see the best of Louise Taylor. My only worry would be if Rob Smyth gets more playing time up front, I will never know how he made the team in the first place.&quot; All that build-up for such an average gag. Not even a gag really, just a statement of fact.  10.58am &quot;Anyone else wish that deadline day had been like this back in the era of ceefax?&quot; says Colin McCracken. &quot;My school holidays were always marked by a compulsion to check ceefax every ten minutes &apos;just to see if we&apos;d signed someone&apos;. Drove my mother to distraction. If I&apos;d had a day like deadline day, I&apos;d have broken the TV. Sky Sports News? Guardian Minute-by-Minute updates? Don&apos;t know they&apos;re born!&quot; I remember sitting by teletext all day during the spring 1994 deadline waiting for Manchester United to sign Chris Sutton. I was devastated when it didn&apos;t happen. Chris Sutton!  10.59am &quot;Anybody fancy Tony Hibbert?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Thought not and thought not. Anyone else want to nominate one regularish starter that they would like to see shipped out today?&quot; Darren &apos;The Scottish Player&apos; Fletcher please. Oh hang on, it&apos;s not 2006, is it? There&apos;s a moral in that story, though.  11am Well this is fun, isn&apos;t it? Just six hours to go now. The main news so far is that Danny Collins has gone from Sunderland to Stoke, and somehow I don&apos;t think we are going to get a JFK moment today, as we did this time two years ago when Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano moved to West Ham Reserves.  11.01am &quot;Is this rumour true?&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;Smyth to the Beano in a swap deal involving Ball Boy and a signed photo of Justine Frischmann?&quot; If they chuck in a green bobble hat I&apos;m off. In fact if the Sport chuck in a green bobble hat I&apos;m off.  11.02am Bizarrely, Sky Man at Portsmouth has just listed all the Portsmouth goalkeepers, calling each of them Mr except David James. I don&apos;t think I will ever again hear the sentence &quot;Mr Antti Niemi&quot;, and I think that&apos;s probably a good thing.  11.03am So if/when Richard Dunne and James Collins join Villa, what happens to Carlos Cuellar and Curtis Davies? At least Villa are starting to get some of the squad depth they were so obviously missing last season.  11.05am With West Ham about to get \u00a35m for James Collins, it seems they will now have enough money to sign Marouane Chamakh for around \u00a37m. Sky Man have been told by someone at Bordeaux that he &quot;wouldn&apos;t rule it out&quot;. Oh the suspense!  11.10am &quot;I bet if James Collins had known a clip of him walking from Aston Villa training ground to car would be shown eight gazillion times on SSN he would have rethought turning up in a filthy Seat people carrier and certainly reconsidered that pinstripe shirt tucked into jeans with MASSIVE Thelma and Louise belt buckle,&quot; says my colleague Mikey Stafford, himself dressed in a scented string vest and leather chaps on the off chance that Sky Sports News cameras appear in Guardian Towers to monitor the rumoured Glendenning move.  11.11am Here&apos;s more on the transfer they&apos;ll be talking about for milliseconds: Darren O&apos;Dea&apos;s loan move from Celtic to Reading.  11.13am &quot;My uncle&apos;s mate&apos;s dentist has a brother who works at the chippy round the corner from Shrewsbury&apos;s training ground and he has just seen Steve McManaman turn up ready to join The Shrews as player coach,&quot; says Bobby Wilcox. &quot;Press conference at 1PM for confirmation.&quot;  11.16am More news, lukewarm off the wires: ENPPI have announced that they have turned down an offer from Sunderland for winger Ahmed Al-Muhammadi. The Egypt international has been on the radar of the Barclays Premier League club in recent weeks, but Steve Bruce was only prepared to offer him an initial one-year loan deal, similar to the one offered to Amr Zaki when the Black Cats boss was in charge of Wigan last season.  11.22am Here&apos;s Dom Jones: &quot;I have just heard a rumour from a friend of mine (who once met Kevin Kilbane, so he&apos;s on the frontline of deadline-day news) that David James will be allowed to join Spurs if he spacehopper-bounces from Pompey&apos;s training ground to Spurs by 5pm. Lets be honest, it would much more exciting to watch Englands No4 bouncing to north London for his England place on Sky Sports News being chased by various Sky Men than anyone called Collins trying to jump ships or Benjani wandering around the country knocking on the door of any Premiership club asking if they will take him in, but only if they match his Man City wages (which they won&apos;t).&quot;  11.23am If/when David Bentley goes to Manchester City, it is likely to be only a loan deal for the season.  11.28am It&apos;s all rather quiet. You can shoot the messenger if you want, and in truth I wouldn&apos;t blame you, but there is nothing new to report. Anyone got anything to say? Wit optional.  11.30am &quot;I am sorry to tell you this but I believe my rumour I just sent you (11.22am) may have been false,&quot; says Dom Jones. &quot;My friend has just admitted he never met Kevin Kilbane, just winked at him at a petrol station. I would like to apologise to the other readers for this false evidence and I urge anyone planning to head down to the A3 to cheer on Mr David James to not bother.&quot;  11.31am Sporting Gijon&apos;s Michel is not going to Birmingham because of a money issue. Astonishingly, this doesn&apos;t make Sky Sports News&apos; yellow ticker, which is currently taking a break. I&apos;ve seen many improbable things in my life, but to see Sky Sports News sans ticker on deadline day is right up there.  11.32am &quot;Kenny Dalglish to Liverpool for 440,000GBP,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Oh, the memories.&quot; Amen to that.  11.33am The Sheffield United defender Matthew Kilgallon, who has a great future behind him, may be going to Newcastle according to Sky Man.  11.35am &quot;Is it too late to hijack the NOTW&apos;s bid for Barry Glendenning?&quot; asks Adrian Cooper. &quot;I&apos;d like to offer \u00a31.27 and a Reese&apos;s Nutrageous for him to write one article a week for a blog (which I promise to set up should he sign with me) in which he states that he has never heard anything by the Fall/the Chameleons/Josef K/[insert early 80s indie/post-punk band of choice] and then, in the following week&apos;s piece, explains just how much he dislikes said band now that he&apos;s heard them. I&apos;d even be willing to throw in the Fire Engines &apos;Aufgeladen und Bereit Fur Action und Spass&apos; compilation album, on vinyl, as a signing on bonus. just to get him started.&quot; I worry about you people sometimes.  11.36am Tony Pulis and Mick McCarthy are reportedly locked in a lycra-clad mud-wrestle. To the victor, the spoils; to the loser, Cardiff&apos;s Joe Ledley.  11.38am Bolton are close to signing Nantes&apos; Croatian striker Ivan Klasnic on loan, it says here. No Nantes jokes please, we&apos;re British.  11.40am &quot;My mother&apos;s sister&apos;s uncle&apos;s friend&apos;s wife&apos;s brother&apos;s mother-in-law&apos;s friend has just told me that her uncle&apos;s brother&apos;s mum&apos;s friend Carol&apos;s been offered a job by a friend&apos;s mother&apos;s uncle&apos;s aunt as a cook for David Bentley,&quot; says Oliver Billenness. &quot;She lives in Liverpool, so maybe that&apos;s where the  useless sack of shi  mercurial right winger might end up by the end of today. Playing for Tranmere.&quot;  11.41am &quot;Is Lucas Neill still alive?&quot; asks Burt Bosma, who hasn&apos;t just read Jamie Carragher&apos;s autobiography. &quot;If so, where will he be playing after today?&quot; It&apos;s odd that there are a few half-decent players who are club-less; England&apos;s Michael Ball and Liam Miller are two others. What&apos;s that about?  11.44am &quot;Quite right about Tony Pulis, but Stoke&apos;s rise is also due to our very great chairman Peter Coates (95 per cent), and the Stoke supporters (5 per cent),&quot; says Alec McAulay. &quot;I&apos;m just getting my voice back after verbally abusing Darren Bent on Saturday. Of course, we know that pride goes before a fall. Last time we were moving this well a great wind blew down a grandstand and we had to sell Jimmy Greenhoff to some bunch in Salford ...&quot; I suppose Pulis&apos;s biggest problem is deciding if/when to try to take Stoke to the next level, or aim for 15th every season. It&apos;s such a difficult balance. In attempting to go to the next level you can often bugger things up completely, as West Ham did on this day three years ago.  11.46am So far this has been a rubbish deadline day, hasn&apos;t it? Sorry.  11.50am The Sky Sports News yellow ticker hasn&apos;t been seen for half an hour now. What kind of sorry deadline day is this? Ah, this is of interest, though not to Sky Sports News, who only focus on The Best League In England: Ajax have signed midfielder Kerlon from Inter Milan on a season-long loan deal. The 21-year-old Brazilian, famous for his unique &apos;seal dribble&apos;, will stay in Amsterdam until June 2010 with Ajax also having the option to make the deal permanent next summer.  11.53am Here&apos;s a bit more on Birmingham&apos;s aborted Michel move, from Alex McLeish: &quot;We couldn&apos;t get the Michel deal over the line which is a shame because I believe he is a very good player who would have enhanced our team. It would have been a much-needed boost to the squad if we could have got him in. The stumbling block has been about money, about payments and the way they are made, agents, everything came into it. The club had stated their stance on it from day one and they haven&apos;t wavered on that. We were hoping to tidy things up at the Sporting Gijon end but it wasn&apos;t to be.&quot;  11.54am When the &apos;Joy of Six: Great Transfer Deadline Days on Sky Sports News, brought to you in association with Sky Sports News and written by Sam Matterface&apos; is written, this won&apos;t be one of them.  11.55am &quot;So who is on their way to the Premier League from Milanello eh Rob?&quot; asks Sean Boiling. &quot;Pirlo? Gattuso?&quot; Pietro Virdis? Okay he hasn&apos;t played football for 18 years, but he&apos;s faster over five yards than Michael Owen.  12.01pm &quot;Could Franck Ribery be on the verge of a sensational move to the Premier League?&quot; asks Sky Sports News&apos; Simon Thomas. Wait I know the answer to this one! No, no he quite obviously isn&apos;t.  12.02am &quot;Do not rule out Franck Ribery coming to the Premier League,&quot; says Geraint Hughes, the, a-hem, transfer expert in the Sky studio. And he&apos;s right: don&apos;t rule it out. Also, don&apos;t rule out [insert name of your favourite celebrity here] arriving at your door tonight and announcing &apos;The milky thighs are on me&apos;. Don&apos;t rule out one of England&apos;s most-capped footballers calling a press conference this afternoon to announce a change of sexual orientation. And don&apos;t rule out the sky raining frogs at some stage in the next few hours. Don&apos;t rule anything out, folks.  12.07pm &quot;SSN are brilliant,&quot; says Michael Scallon. &quot;Basing their excitement on nothing, FRANCK RIBERY IS DEFINITELY COMING TO ENGLAND. Hilarious.&quot; So long as we get to laugh.  12.08pm This is getting worse. Sky Man at Portsmouth: &quot;Roger the security man, who we made friends with this morning, assures me David James is still at the ground. The clock is ticking on his move to Spurs.&quot; Something&apos;s ticking, I&apos;ll give him that. Why don&apos;t Sky just ask the FA for permission to stick tracking devices on all transfer targets&apos; genitalia so that they know where they are at all times?  12.11pm &quot;How did you miss DEFENDER BROMBY COMPLETES LEEDS MOVE,&quot; shouts Dave Kelly-Hughes. &quot;Highlight of the third best league in England news so far, and he&apos;s a Yorkshire boy, so proving it&apos;s not only the Geordies who believe being local somehow makes you a better player.&quot;  12.12pm &quot;The Croatian boss is insisting his players have &apos;not available to play against Birmingham&apos; clauses written into future contracts,&quot; says Ian Copestake.  12.14pm Luciano Spalletti has resigned as Roma manager after a bad start to the new season. Always sad to see a fellow member of the bald community suffering. Take care, brother.  12.15pm Sky&apos;s yellow ticker is back, and it&apos;s... recycling information we first heard three hours ago. (And no, we&apos;re not going to criticise them for that, given that we&apos;re still recycling gags (sic) first used last century.) Collins to Stoke... Bentley maybe to City... Kranjcar passes medical at Spurs... . Of slightly more interest - and this is how low we&apos;ve sunk, already - is that Wigan&apos;s Ben Watson is going on a six-month loan to QPR. Oh and &apos;Whatever Happened To&apos; Jerome Rothen is going on loan from PSG to Rangers.  12.20pm &quot;God I&apos;m bored...&quot; says Dave Kelly-Hughes, speaking for us all.  12.23pm &quot;If you punched Gordon Strachan for a while then stretched him on a rack, would you get Alex McLeish?&quot; saks Gary Naylor, speaking for us all.  12.24pm &quot;Deadline day was better when it finished at midnight,&quot; says Mark Taylor. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure SSN showed Big Ben bonging last year, they built it up all week like it was like New Year in Time Square. Imagine watching the ball drop with its rotating ticker telling everyone Dougie Freedman had just made a last-minute move to Rochdale. It would be great for the economy to have a Christmas event halfway through the year; they almost managed it.&quot;  12.25pm &quot;No one has got my first Soccer Sequence yet,&quot; says Yannis. &quot;Any ideas?&quot; England caps during which Peter Shilton made filthy howlers? No, I have no idea.  12.31pm &quot;Yannis&apos;s sequence (12.25pm)&quot; says John Allen. &quot;I&apos;ll eat my hat if it&apos;s not the 1966 World Cup final goals.&quot; It can&apos;t be - there are six times there, and we all know England won 3-2.  12.33pm Ipswich are about to sign Grant Leadbitter (\u00a32.6m) and Carlos Edwards (\u00a31.35m) from Sunderland. Edwards, oddly, seems to be one of those players who is far too good for the Championship and nowhere near good enough for the Premier League.  12.36pm &quot;I&apos;m imagining Alex McLeish&apos;s attempt to woo Michel to Birmingham,&quot; says Michael Hunt. &quot;&apos;If I tell you I once managed a little-known Scottish outfit called Rangers... people look at the suit, they go &quot;You&apos;re not fooling anybody&quot;; they can see I&apos;m rock and roll, they can see I&apos;m a player. But the thing with us and Rangers is that we&apos;re good at different things. They couldn&apos;t just make it out of the Championship, and almost compete in the lower reaches of the Premiership, and Birmingham couldn&apos;t walk to the Scottish league title\u2026 well, we could actually\u2026 and I think they know that. Probably what spurs them on&apos;.&quot;  12.37pm Portsmouth have confirmed the signing of Tal Ben-Haim from Manchester City on a four-year deal.  12.38pm &quot;Not sure about the first two numbers in Yannis&apos;s sequence (12:25pm), but are the last four the average age of Sam Allardyce&apos;s Bolton squads?&quot; honks Dean Anderson. &quot;Incidentally, weren&apos;t transfer deadlines more exciting in the past because we didn&apos;t have 24 hour coverage of nothing happening. Kenny Dalglish just moved clubs and then people told us about it. Back in the day &apos;Michel not going to Birmingham&apos; would not have constituted news. In case anyone&apos;s wondering, I&apos;ve not yet been approached by Arsenal.&quot;  12.39pm Anyone nomination for best and worst signing of the summer? Best: Robben. Worst (possibly): Ibrahimovic.  12.42pm &quot;I am absolutely certain that Yannis&apos; second sequence is the last ten birthdays Kanu celebrated,&quot; honks Steven Eccles.  12.44pm I can exclusively reveal that, in 16 minutes&apos; time, I&apos;ll be swooping for a packet of Scampi Fries on a four-minute contract. That is about as interesting as it gets just now. &quot;John Allen (12.31pm) is correct,&quot; says Yannis.  12.45pm Mr Sky Sources Understands reckons Middlesbrough have bid \u00a33m for Derby striker Rob Hulse. That would be a very decent short-term signing. File under Carlos Edwards.  12.46pm Phil Brown is too quiet. I don&apos;t like it when Phil Brown is quiet. Well I do like it, very much, but it&apos;s so unusual as to be more than a little unsettling.  12.48pm &quot;Harsh on Ibrahimovic,&quot; says Michael Scallon. &quot;You&apos;ve totally ignored what you typed two minutes earlier. As for the best signing of the summer, I reckon Wesley Sneijder could a brilliant coup for The Special One.&quot; Agree on that. There&apos;s a pattern forming with all these good signings. To put it another way re: Ibrahimovic, I think it&apos;s an unnecessary gamble to rip up such a thrillingly successful attacking template that has just brought you the European Cup to buy a superbly talented but notoriously languid striker. I bow to Pep Guardiola&apos;s superiority in pretty much every walk of life, and there&apos;s every chance the signing will be hugely successful. But one look at what has happened to the previous European champions over the last 12 months tells you that it&apos;s a big gamble to fiddle with the golden goose.  12.50pm &quot;Which club do think is going to grab tomorrow&apos;s headlines then Rob?&quot; says Jack Lee. &quot;I&apos;m not a betting man in general, but I&apos;d put a sneaky \u00a35 on Notts County myself...&quot; I agree. Their decision to swoop for Franck Ribery and Tom Lutz will make waves.  12.52pm &quot;Is Yannis&apos;s second sequence the age of your last 10 lovers?&quot; honks Robert James. &quot;Or more boringly the number of points the 18th-placed team in the Premiership has got in the last 10 years.&quot;  12.54pm &quot;Ibrahimovic is going to be a sensation at Barca,&quot; says Alex Warwick. &quot;Watching the preseason games and the first league match, he&apos;s been running and everything, but also links up the play. Take E&apos;to out put him in, you jusy get Messi and Henry scoring more from fancy you tube flicks. And Robben is injured all the time.&quot;   think Ibrahimovic might be, and I thought some of the stick he got last season was unfair, but it&apos;s such a risk to sign a completely different type of player when you&apos;ve just scored over 100 league goals. As for Robben, his injury record isn&apos;t that bad (I think he played two-thirds of the league games at Real); he&apos;s younger than you think (25), for obvious reasons; and he has a touch of genius. At that price it&apos;s an extraordinary bargain, in my humble one.  12.56pm Breaking news!!!! Swansea have rejected a new offer from Wigan for Dutch midfielder Ferrie Bodde.   1pm I&apos;m about to hand over to John Ashdown for an hour. In the meantime, here&apos;s Mikey Stafford: &quot;Don&apos;t you think it is indicative, on this most dull of best days ever in the best league in the world ever, where SSN have their correspondents?&quot; says Mikey Stafford. &quot;No one, seemingly, at Man U, no one at Liverpool, Arsenal or Chelsea. Instead they&apos;re stalking around glamorous Chigwell looking for Birds of a Feather cast members, chatting up the security guards at Pompey and (presumably, even in September) freezing their nads off outside the KC Stadium. Ribery to Hull anyone? Phil could loan the gnarly one some concealer.&quot;  Afternoon all! Just four hours to go!  1.05pm: Did we know that Johnny Heitinga has arrived at Everton for his medical? Or that Nickey Shorey is having a medical at Pompey? Or that Claude Davis has signed a two-year deal with Crystal Palace? We did? Oh.  1.08pm: SSN reckon Marouane Chamakh is going nowhere - bad news for West Ham, great news for Bordeaux. &quot;I can exclusively confirm my own switch from a one o&apos;clock to a two o&apos;clock lunch break to provide emergency cover for Sanjay who will be out for up to an hour with a suspected ham and cheese sandwich,&quot; writes Alex Marsh.  1.12pm: &quot;Let&apos;s get Bristol City&apos;s two season-long loanees on the page please,&quot; writes a suitably over-excited Will Jones. &quot;Alvaro Saborio, a Costa Rican international striker from FC Sion, and Evander Sno from Ajax. Evander Sno! And can you fix it so that neither Marvin Elliot or Nicky Maynard leave, please?&quot; As I&apos;ve got this hour we should probably keep an eye on the moves outside the Premier League: Peter Gilbert, for example, has been released by Oldham.  1.16pm: In lieu of any fresh news, here&apos;s some transfer deadline day-related comedy.  1.18pm: A big move - the guy who used to tell me I could &quot;change my career, change my life&quot; by becoming a driving instructor is now doing adverts for broadband. Oh, and here&apos;s that big Ben Watson news in full.  1.20pm: &quot;Boylesports are offering 8/1 on Franck Ribery on being a Manchester United player by 5pm, with Man City at 16/1 and no odds being offered Real Madrid capturing the France international,&quot; notes Barry &apos;Sean Ingle&apos; Landy. &quot;It must be a done deal.&quot;  1.22pm: Ever Banega isn&apos;t heading to Everton - pesky work permits have scuppered that one. And in more Championship news, Brian Howard is believed to be in Reading ahead of a move from Sheffield United.  1.25pm: Looks like David Bentley and Martin Petrov are indeed going to swap clubs on a loan basis. And feel free to have a proper chuckle at this.  1.27pm: Diomansy Kamara. Bolton. Season-long loan. You fill in the gaps.  1.30pm: David James is doing a superb job of winding up the Sky reporter outside the Pompey training ground, by driving away - &quot;David James has left the building!&quot; - and then driving back in again. Top work.  1.32pm: &quot;Forget Ben Watson, word up and down the Goldhawk Road and spreading fast through the streets of West London is of this up-and-coming Norwegian starlet - spotted at Saturday&apos;s game against Scunthorpe in replica shirt - bolstering QPR&apos;s promotion push.&quot; The most unlikely part of that sentence is the phrase &quot;promotion push&quot;.  1.35pm: &quot;In reference to Diomansy Kamara, the gaps, as you put it, must surely include the large hole this move leaves in Fulham&apos;s strikeforce,&quot; writes a concerned Barry Landy. &quot;With Andy Johnson out for a substantial amount of time, this leaves only Bobby Zamora and Erik Nevland as recognised strikers at Craven Cottage. Has Roy Hodgson got something or someone up his sleeve?&quot; If he lets Kamara go, you&apos;d imagine wily old Roy would be up to something ... though he is apparently interested in Swedish striker David Elm.  1.37pm: Horrendous news for Watford fans - Portsmouth have agreed a \u00a33m fee with the Hornets for Mike Williamson, according to &apos;sources&apos;. He&apos;d be a big loss.  1.41pm: SSN are currently trying to make THE PAPERWORK a thrilling element to proceedings. It&apos;s isn&apos;t. It really isn&apos;t. &quot;Notts County are going to sign Henrik Larsson,&quot; suggests Richard Jones. &quot;Apparently.&quot;  1.44pm: &quot;Fulham will compensate Kamara&apos;s loss by loaning in Arsenal&apos;s Carlos Vela for the season,&quot; writes a confident Greg Cross. &quot;Will Hangeland go the other way though?&quot; Ever seen that episode of the Simpsons with the chili cook-off? No?&apos; Well, my analogy with Roy Hodgson and Brede Hangeland will mean nothing to you then.  1.47pm: Aston Villa have confirmed they have agreed a fee with West Ham for defender James Collins. Always good to get official word.  1.48pm: &quot;Is that the same Henrik Larsson who broke his knee a month ago?&quot; wonders Gerry Scott. To be fair, no one said he&apos;d be playing.  1.51pm: &quot; I was walking down Holloway Road earlier and noticed Tom Daley heading into the Emirates,&quot; chuckles Dan Johnson, barely able to contain his mirth. &quot;News is that there is a swap deal with Eduardo on the cards.&quot; I&apos;m not even going to dignify that one with a &quot;bom-tish&quot;.  1.53pm: It&apos;s all gone quiet. Well, quieter.  1.57pm: &quot;I am almost certain that I just spotted Rafael Van der Vaart eating a frittata in the back of a limo on Holloway Road,&quot; writes Richard Scannell. This&apos;ll be the same Rafael Van der Vaart whose brother, according to one correspondent, was in an estate agents in Liverpool earlier today asking to see all the mansions in the area, will it?  1.59pm: Right, my time is up. Rob Smyth will be back to guide you through to 5pm, at which point Barney Ronay will pick up the mopping up shift.  2.01pm Hello. &quot;I hate transfer deadline day,&quot; says Paul Lloyd. &quot;I hate transfer windows. I hate rumours. All because I can&apos;t stop checking to see if, somehow, by some chance Arsene will be buying someone new.... and I always know the answer (i.e. the opposite of &apos;Yes&apos;). But I just can&apos;t stop looking. Why can&apos;t I just get on with my work ? That&apos;s what I&apos;m supposed to be doing. I hate myself.&quot;  2.02pm Sky Sports News are still trying to solve the riddle of David James, the Portsmouth goalkeeper who has spent all day at Portsmouth. It&apos;s as if he&apos;s not going anywhere! Apparently Sky Sources also understand that Kristin Shephard shot JR.  2.03pm &quot;News felch&quot; announces Tom Lutz.  2.04pm This is almost certainly a heated plate of horse pucky, but we&apos;ll leave you to draw your own conclusions.  2.05pm A human being has been seen driving a car in north London. What can it mean?  2.06pm Viagra prescriptions have increased by 0.00004 per cent in the Manchester area. Does this mean City have lured Pele out of retirement?  2.07pm Manchester City say that they will not be buying David Bentley today. And with Mark Hughes being an entirely honest man, we&apos;ll take that as gospel.  2.10pm This deadline day is now officially so bad that it&apos;s gone past good and back to bad. Can somebody sign a cheque please? Do you reckon they still sign cheques or they do just do internet transfers? It&apos;s not as good it used to be.  2.14pm Sky Sports News flunkies have shoved more fertiliser into their magical Breaking News Ticker machine and the following has emerged as a result: Fulham deny they are in talks with Bolton over a season-long loan for Diomansy Kamara. Is that really news?  2.20pm Is it time to make things up yet?  2.25pm Phil Brown. What is going on with Phil Brown? I don&apos;t like how  orange  quiet he is. He can&apos;t still be giving himself his morning pep talk in the mirror.  2.26pm &quot;Blaise Matuidi is about to sign for the Gunners,&quot; says Alex Kouzarides. &quot;This is the news. Happy now?&quot; Delirious. I&apos;ve stripped down to my Superman Y-fronts and am high-fiving everyone in sight. That&apos;s what deadline day does to a man.  2.29pm &quot;So have Aston Villa given up their chase for Stephen Warnock?&quot; says Matthew Webb of the man Villa signed last week. &quot;As a Villa fan, I think it would be nice to have two players for the same position so that O&apos;Neill doesn&apos;t have to play Guzan at left-back, to cover Steve Stride from midfield covering for Reo-Coker playing at right-back. Would be even better if one of them was decent.&quot; Tonight, Matthew, you need to watch your Aston Villa 1990-91 season video as penance for that howler.  2.33pm Bad news for Everton: it looks as if they will sign Johnny Heitinga from Atletico Madrid.  2.34pm &quot;Is it &apos;news&apos; enough for me to tell people that I live in the same apartment block as Nigel Reo-Coker, and I saw him in our corner shop last night buying Maryland cookies, so it is unlikely that he is going anywhere?&quot; says Karl Gibbons. &quot;No? Oh, ok. I will see if SSN want to quote me as a &apos;source&apos; instead.&quot; You are rich enough to live in the same apartment block as a Premier League footballer? Will you marry me?  2.35pm Chris Wallace says Olivier Dacourt is going to Burnley. If it comes to pass, you heard it here first. If it doesn&apos;t, this entry will be conveniently deleted at 5.01pm.  2.41pm &quot;In my defence (2.29pm), I&apos;m a very bu....no, there&apos;s nothing I can say, is there?&quot; says Matthew Webb.  2.42pm Nicky Shorey is still travelling to Portsmouth, as he has been since 9am, to complete a season-long loan move.  2.44pm Ipswich have formally signed Grant Leadbitter and Carlos Edwards from Sunderland. The combined fee can go up to \u00a33.95m. I have absolutely nothing to add to that.  2.47pm &quot;Have Spurs given up their chase for Pascal Chimbonda?&quot; says Adrian Cooper. &quot;I realise that we only sold him to Blackburn a few days ago, but now that King has picked up a new non-knee-related injury, it&apos;s surely only a matter of time before &apos;Arry tries to bring Chimbonda back again.&quot; I don&apos;t know about Chimbonda, but Tony Galvin, Tony Parks, Nico Claesen and Micky Hazard have been seen loitering around White Hart Lane.  2.51pm I am really sorry about this. This remarkably tedious deadline day, obviously, but also pretty much everything else.  2.52pm &quot;When you mention Phil Brown&apos;s morning pep talk,&quot; begins Jacob Steinberg, &quot;do you mean something like this?&quot; Phil Brown&apos;s in his fifties, you know. His fifties.  2.53pm &quot;I am hoping and fervently praying that someone, preferably S*urs, swoops in at the 11th hour and takes Bendtner off our hands,&quot; says Sonia Charles. &quot;I e-mailed Arsene and asked him about this earlier today.&quot; He replied? Blimey. I think Bendtner is a very good player, a view I have held for at least the 3.4 seconds since I read that Arsene Wenger thinks he has never had a bad game, and I quite like him in this newish right-sided role. Obviously&apos;s he no world-beater but I reckon he&apos;s a perfectly competent member of the squad.  2.55pm &quot;We could always make up transfer rumours using fictional characters/inanimate objects (e.g. I&apos;ve heard whispers of a possible three-way swap deal involving Iggle Piggle, Desperate Dan and a frozen stick of butter),&quot; says Colin Greer. You lot can do what you want. Make yourself at home. Riff away.  2.59pm And now we move on to the main event, the most special torture: Sky Sports are introducing the crack team of Jim White, Georgie Thompson and Andy &quot;Hearing Nicky Shorey Had Gone To Portsmouth Was The Greatest Moment Of My Life, Just Ahead Of My Kid Being Born&quot; Burton for the final two hours.  3pm Jim White is already on one, talking with the seriousness of a man reporting the death of JFK, or the decommissioning of Poirot. Lord. Anyway they&apos;ve gone straight to Portsmouth, where they can exclusively repeat that still nothing has happened involving David James. He has just left the training ground? Could he driving to White Hart Lane? Or could he be driving home for a corned-beef roll and an afternoon nap?  3.03pm &quot;What&apos;s Georgie look like?&quot; pants Alex Warwick, mistaking this for skysportsfetish.co.uk. In other news, here is a story on Ipswich&apos;s signing of Grant Leadbittr and Carlos Edwards.  3.05pm &quot;My favourite news of the day,&quot; writes my colleague Tom Lutz. &quot;Midfielder Tom Kilbey, 18, has joined Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on a month-long loan.&quot; I&apos;m genuinely surprised it didn&apos;t make the Sky Sports ticker. Jim White&apos;s take on it can only be minutes away.  3.06pm Sky Man at Spurs has just broken the news that Martin Petrov won&apos;t be joining Spurs. Odd that, given that they already said this morning that Redknapp was only going to sign one of Niko Kranjcar and Petrov.  3.07pm &quot;Do not think for a moment this transfer window is going to be a damp squib&quot; says Jim White, admirably ignoring all evidence to the contrary. Even Andy &quot;173 phones&quot; Burton has admitted it&apos;s pretty quiet, which is as improbable as Richard Keys being Sky&apos;s half-time chat with &quot;Well that was a load of bobbins, wasn&apos;t it?&quot;  3.10pm &quot;Just met Phil Brown in my local tanning salon,&quot; lies Phil Brown. &quot;He said he tried to buy this fella, couldn&apos;t raise the cash but all in all he was proud to be in the running.&quot; I am starting to love Phil Brown. Look at the genuine glee on his face in that picture. Nobody else on the planet could derive such genuine please from meeting a horse. Brown really is a breath of fresh air. Or a blast of artificial sun, I&apos;m not sure which.  3.13pm Johnny Heitinga is officially at Everton, dotting the Is, crossing the Ts and having disconcertingly long needless shoved in hitherto unmolested parts of his body. Everton are paying \u00a35.8m for Heitinga, who will presumably replace Tony Hibbert at right-back.  3.14pm There&apos;s a presumably absurd rumour doing the rounds that Ruud van Nistelrooy is going to sign for Liverpool. When that happens, Liverpool will also buy Phil Neville, Dwight Yorke and Jonathan Greening, while Manchester United will pick up Robbie Fowler, Bjorn Tore Kvarme and Phil Babb.  3.16pm: BREAKING NEWS THAT ISN&apos;T EVEN ON SKY SPORTS NEWS&apos; TICKER YET, AKA SMYTH 1-0 BURTON Rangers have completed the signing of left winger Jerome Rothen from Paris St Germain on a one-year loan deal. In hindsight, it probably didn&apos;t justify the above spurt of excitment.  3.18pm Jim White reports that Jerome Rothen has signed for Rangers on a one-year loan. He also reports that the Titanic is struggling, and England have won the World Cup.  3.20pm &quot;Moving to Ipswich has opened up a brand new avenue for Roy Keane, &quot; says Niall Hughes. &quot;He&apos;s no longer limited to signing former Man Utd, Ireland and Celtic players. Now he can sign former Sunderland players too.&quot; It is interesting how many managers have an incredible loyalty to certain players, though: Roberto Martinez and Harry Redknapp are others. It&apos;s like those people who only ever eat four or five foods. They don&apos;t know  how exquisitely moreish fish-finger sandwiches can be  what they&apos;re missing.  3.24pm Phil Brown has sprung to life! He may not have signed his beloved horse (3.10pm), but he has got his hands on a donkey: West Brom ball-watcher Abdoulaye Meite is going to move to the KC Stadium on a season-long loan.  3.26pm It&apos;s not transfer news, but Rafael Benitez has been charged with improper conduct for his comments after Andriy Voronin fell over at Tottenham a couple of weeks ago. Benitez, a strong advocate of the Respect campaign, said Liverpool should have had a second penalty in a match they lost 2-1.  3.27pm &quot;I really don&apos;t understand the massive Bendtner hating,&quot; says Thad Brown. &quot;He&apos;s had some off games (what striker doesn&apos;t?) and he wore some very silly boots last year, but he&apos;s also scored some gorgeous goals and is quite unselfish for a striker. An Arshavin, van Persie, Bendtner attack is not going to be the reason many games are lost. If Unky Arsene could have Wilshere or Vela as they&apos;ll be in 2-3 years they might get the nod, but Bendtner gets way too much stick from Arsenal fans.&quot; I think there are two reasons: 1) that people took a dislike to him because he acted like a vainglorious tool early in his Arsenal career and that unfairly seeped into their judgement of his playing ability; 2) that judgement was passed off as fact because it saved people doing difficult things like actually watching the match and thinking for themselves. He&apos;s not going to win the Ballon d&apos;Or any time soon, but I think he&apos;s a very decent player, and some of his one-touch play is exquisite.  3.31pm Lee Hendrie - that&apos;s England&apos;s Lee Hendrie to you - has gone from Sheffield United to Derby in a swap deal with Jordan Stewart. &quot;Hendrie tries to pass the ball so he&apos;s no good to us&quot; apologises John Ashdown, our resident Sheffield United fan. &quot;Jordan Stewart runs a lot. He&apos;s our type of player.&quot;  3.36pm Sky Man David Craig&apos;s mobile phone is going off live on air. What a farce. I can&apos;t place the ringtone but it&apos;s appropriately dreadful. Anyway, he tells us that Afonso Alves&apos;s move to Qatar has hit a snag.  3.38pm &quot;It&apos;s not just that with Bendtner, Rob \u2013 he gives every indication that he is on a par with Michael Laudrup winning trophies with Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Instead he&apos;s not won anything with the &quot;&apos;aven&apos;t won anything for ages, but still one of the Big Four&apos; Arsenal. He&apos;ll be at Stoke soon as the new James Beattie \u2013 good, but not that good.&quot; He&apos;s better than that. I think he&apos;s learned - or more probably been taught by Arsene Wenger - a bit of humility, and that shirt gesture was a fine one. Even if he is not very likeable, though, that shouldn&apos;t inform our judgement of him as a player, and I reckon it did in this case.  3.40pm &quot;Liverpool are in the verge of signing Argentinian wunderkid Sergio Armando,&quot; says Niall Mullen. &quot;He&apos;s two footed, lightning fast and entirely fictional. He&apos;ll bag at least as many goals for us as Andriy Voronin this season.&quot; He&apos;s no Didier Baptiste.  3.42pm &quot;Have you got a resident fan from all the clubs?&quot; says Louise Wright. &quot;How does one apply for the position? How do you fit them all in the GU Towers cupboard you call home? Or are they just the voices in your head?&quot; Sorry, what was that?  3.47pm &quot;Rob \u2013 just got this from my source at Anfield - David Bentley @ Melwood having medical,&quot; says Andy Thornley. &quot;You heard it first here!!&quot; Why would they need a right winger? They&apos;ve got Dirk Kuyt?  3.50pm &quot;My carpet cleaner says that Italian wonderkid Sergio Giorgini has been spotted outside Phi Brown&apos;s static caravan,&quot; says Tom Seavers. &quot;Wearing a light brown leather jacket.&quot;  3.51pm Ajax have also snapped up Serbian forward Marko Pantelic. Pantelic has agreed a one-year contract and signs on a free transfer after being released by Hertha Berlin. I cut and pasted that.  3.52pm So, here&apos;s a quick summary of the day&apos;s most interesting transfers:  3.53pm Oh all right then, here are today&apos;s deals.  3.55pm Just over an hour to go, and even Sky are struggling to hype this up. In fact, they&apos;re talking about horse racing. There won&apos;t be much high-fiving today.  3.58pm See 2.51pm.  3.59pm It&apos;s official, even though Sky Sports News haven&apos;t reported it yet: James Collins has swapped one lump of claret-and-blue polyester for another, having moved from West Ham to Aston Villa for \u00a35m. That may or may not allow West Ham to buy Marouane Chamakh from Bordeaux.  4.01pm &quot;I think people would do well to remember that Bendtner is only 21 years old and is probably better than Emile Heskey,&quot; says Dan Clancy. &quot;In other words, he&apos;d be playing for England if he was English, wouldn&apos;t he?&quot; That&apos;s racist.  4.02pm I wonder where Bentley is. He&apos;s gone somewhere, and it isn&apos;t Manchester City. Maybe he is at Liverpool, or maybe he&apos;s at home watching a Miami Vice boxset. I don&apos;t really care, to be honest. I made that first sentence to see if I could summon a bit of internatl excitement.  4.03pm Oh, Sky Man says that David Bentley definitely isn&apos;t going to Liverpool or, indeed, anywhere else. His career is going to go to seed, isn&apos;t it? Such a shame as he is enormously gifted. In an unrelated development, Bolton have signed Croatian forward Ivan Klasnic on a year-long loan from Nantes.  4.04pm &quot;Shorey tucking into scotch egg as he approaches Portsmouth...&quot; reports/lies Alex Kouzarides.  4.06pm Celtic have agreed a deal with Zheng Zhi, the China captain.  4.10pm &quot;I spoke to Tony Pulis and he couldn&apos;t wait to get me off the phone&quot; says Sky Man. I don&apos;t need to add much to that, do I.  4.11pm Andy &apos;Phones&apos; Burton tells us that Nicky Shorey&apos;s proposed loan move from Aston Villa to Portsmouth has hit a snag. &quot;Is &apos;snag&apos; a code word for &apos;they&apos;ve come to the realisation that he&apos;s actually cack&apos;?&quot; asks Colin Greer. He played against Brazil you know. Mind you, so did Colin Cooper.  4.13pm This whole day has been like getting a packet of Chewits and a haircut for your birthday. What a let down.  4.16pm So who do you think are today&apos;s winners and losers? Tottenham and Aston Villa have done good business, but poor old Phil Brown hasn&apos;t had the best 24 hours. And as for Portsmouth...  4.17pm Everton have officially signed Johnny Heitinga from Atletico Madrid on a five-year deal for \u00a36m, rising to \u00a37m. Heitinga-Jagielka/Yobo-Distin-Baines is a pretty decent upgrade on the defence they were fielding a week ago, although I&apos;m not sure Heitinga is that good.  4.18pm &quot;This morning SSN were very excited to have a man ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND AT SPURS&apos; CHIGWELL TRAINING GROUND WHO EVEN SAW HARRY REDKNAPP ARRIVE IN HIS CAR, but so far it seems absolutely bob all has happened,&quot; says my erstwhile colleague Georgina Turner. &quot;Have I missed something? Anything?&quot; I think I drifted off to sleep for a couple of minutes this afternoon until I actually banged my head onto the desk, but nothing else of note has happened.  4.20pm &quot;I think the actual terms of Klasnic&apos;s loan deal is that he stays at Bolton until 26th September, at which point an as-yet-unspecified Birmingham player will kick his shins into orbit,&quot; saysa James Murton. &quot;Also, as a Derby fan, this Rob Hulse-Middlesbrough stuff better not be true - it&apos;d be nice to have at least one striker at the club, we can&apos;t rely on Forest to score all our goals for us.&quot;  4.21pm &quot;What do you mean &apos;and as for Portsmouth&apos;?&quot; says Jon Comlay. &quot;We&apos;re building a fine squad for our Championship challenge.&quot;  4.22pm Here&apos;s David &apos;Ringtones&apos; Craig, reporting that the Afonso Alves deal has gone to seed. Middlesbrough were hoping to get \u00a37m for him; it&apos;s hard to see what the problem is.  4.24pm &quot;If nothing else happens in the next 40 minutes I&apos;d like to see an angry Simpsons-style mob form at SSN HQ demanding the promised excitement and baying for Andy &apos;769 phones&apos; Burton&apos;s blood,&quot; says Alex Kouzarides. &quot;I&apos;ll let Jim White off as I think he secretly knows. Burton is just a custard gannet.&quot;  4.25pm &quot;Being a civil servant I&apos;ve sat through a lot of days reading the Guardian, be it OBO, afternoon European games or Champions League draws,&quot; says Alex Warwick. &quot;But I have to say that today has been the panicle of both boredom and low productivity.&quot; Just because I wouldn&apos;t tell you what Georgie Thompson was wearing, you get all nasty. It&apos;s so transparent.  4.27pm &quot;Leeds have signed a South African striker called Davide Somma,&quot; says Richard Lindley. &quot;No - me either. Just as long as it&apos;s not a prelude to losing Beckford to Real Madrid in the last twenty minutes......&quot; I was absolutely bloody determined to write the word &apos;Johansson&apos; today, and now I can, ever if I will have to mis-spell it: Somma will continue the proud tradition of South Africans at Leeds, starting with the legendary winger Albert Johanneson and continuing with Lucas Radebe.  4.29pm &quot;Please ask GT to write the Fiver again, for a few days at least,&quot; says Gulshan Khan, &quot;You people aren&apos;t funny, the standard has gone down, I&apos;m not kidding. It was only funny the days she wrote it.&quot; Well I don&apos;t know about anyone else but I agree that I&apos;ve never been funny. Georgie&apos;s Fivers were great. In fact pretty much all the work she did was great. Or rather is: she still writes for the Guardian, you know. But she had Steps on her iPod, so ours was always an awkward relationship after that discovery.  4.31pm Half an hour to go, and most of the major issues seem to have been resolved. I suspect Hull, Portsmouth and Stoke are the most likely to be shoving paper in faxes over the next half an hour. &apos;Phones&apos; Burton tells us that Blackburn and Wigan are done for the day, but that Everton and Hull aren&apos;t.  4.34pm Sky Man No4, the one lurking outside Tottenham&apos;s ground, reckons that Sunderland and Spurs are discussing a swap deal between Alan Hutton and Anton Ferdinand.  4.36pm The China captain Zheng Zhi has officially joined Celtic on a two-year deal, having been a free agent since leaving Charlton. Celtic have also sent their goalkeeper Mark Brown on loan to Kilmarnock.  4.38pm Sky Sports News&apos; Jim White is beginning the process that will culminate in him spotaneously combusting at 4.59.59. He has really skipped the gears, breathlessly informing us that Hutton and Ferdinand (A) are on the verge of a swap deal, and that Spurs also made an enquiry about West Ham&apos;s Matthew Upson.  4.39pm Spurs. Stephen Appiah. Email from Jack Ettinger.  4.40pm &quot;I have been away from my desk,&quot; says Ben Bradley. &quot;Have the deals for Gary Naylor and Barry Glendenning gone through yet?&quot; Naylor has been remarkably quiet since lunch. And Bazza&apos;s Twitter page is suspiciously silent. Either they are both on the move or they both actually have lives away from this place. It&apos;s 50/50.  4.41pm &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to hammer out a deal with Goodwill Towards Humanity, but we&apos;ve not been able to agree personal terms,&quot; says misanthropology expert Alexander Netherton. &quot;I have though signed Latent Alcoholism on a free to add competition to Rampant Despair.&quot;  4.42pm Adboulaye Meite&apos;s move to Hull is apparently off, but Hull are taking another Stoke reject: Ibrahima Sonko on loan for the season. Thanks to Gary for pointing that out.  4.44pm Eduardo has been given a two-game ban for his nonsense against Celtic. That would be a great move from Uefa if there was more than a 0.000000004 per cent chance of them adhering to this precedent from hereon in. Things could get very messy now.  4.46pm &quot;Shorey in Pompey car park, crying uncontrollably...&quot; says Alex Kouzarides. He played against Brazil, you know.  4.47pm Nicky Shorey&apos;s loan move to Portsmouth. Apparently he couldn&apos;t reach agreement with Portsmouth - but it wasn&apos;t over money. So what was the problem? They wouldn&apos;t let him take throw-ins? They wouldn&apos;t let him play Akon in the dressing-room before games? How you can fail to agree terms on a bloody loan move? Anyway, Portsmouth have officially signed Watford&apos;s centre-back Mike Williamson for \u00a33m.  4.50pm &apos;Ringtones&apos; Craig tells us that Birmingham have made a &quot;late swoop&quot; for Sunderland&apos;s Teemu Tainio. Now it&apos;s back to &apos;Phones&apos; Burton, who reckons Daryl Murphy might be going to Ipswich. My colleague Mike Adamson walks past, looks me down and further down with a delicious combination of pity and contempt, and says simply: &quot;You&apos;re getting lower and lower in that seat.&quot; It&apos;s amazing how tiring reporting absolutely nothing can be.  4.55pm &apos;Phones&apos; Burton reckons Anton Ferdinand will not be going to Spurs, but that Alan Hutton may go to Sunderland regardless. That would be an excellent signing, especially if they keep Ferdinand.  4.57pm More disciplinary news: Standard Liege midfielder Axel Witsel has been banned until November 23 for the tackle which broke Anderlecht defender Marcin Wasilewski&apos;s leg.  Being the epitome of Modern Man, I sincerely cannot look at that Wasilewski tackle, but it sounds utterly awful.  4.58pm &quot;My mobile&apos;s going bananas with people spotting my name on the site,&quot; says Alex Kouzarides. &quot;I feel like &apos;Phones&apos; Burton!&quot;  4.59pm Anton Ferdinand definitely isn&apos;t joining Tottenham. It&apos;s official, and it didn&apos;t even appear on Tw*tter. &apos;Phones&apos; Burton comes out with one of the great insights: &quot;The pending deals are still pending.&quot;  5pm I&apos;m panting my last, so it&apos;s time to tag in Barney Ronay. Thanks for all yours emails. Bye.  5.01pm Hello. Welcome to the after-party. Already it feels like something significant has passed. Like an enormous bolus of cheese you were having terrible trouble swallowing.  5.02pm One of the most absurdly portentous bits of TV I&apos;ve ever seen: Sky Sports News actually counted down the end of the transfer window with the bongs from Big Ben, like it was New Year&apos;s Eve. On the last bong a voice broke in &quot;we&apos;re just hearing Peter Lovenkrands has signed for Newcastle!&quot;Incredible. History in the making.  5.04pm The Kranjkar move is now done and apparently dusted. Heitinga is a Blue. Anton Ferdinand is definitely not leaving Sunderland. And Jordan McEvoly is worried: &quot;Hey Barney. Getting worried that Shorey may have been called back from Pompey because the Dunne deal fell through for the Villa. Just speculation. Any word?&quot;No word here. Not yet. As sson as I get one I&apos;ll splplzzzzzzzz it out really quickly. And Sky are announcing &quot;we can NOW say there have been NO OFFERS AT ALL FOR DAVID JAMES!!&quot; As though this is news. Read alla bout it. Nothing happens. Men with mics stand in carpark looking silly. Get it here.  5.09pm Yes, yes, yes. Niko K has signed for Spurs. Personally, for what it&apos;s worth, I think that&apos;s a really good signing. Kranjkar is a very clever player. I saw him take Germany apart in Klargenfurt at Euro 2008, alongside Modric and the other fellow, the 20-year-old, tip-top little player, and thought he was real class. A bit slow maybe, but real quailty.  5.12pm Ivan Rakitic he&apos;s called, the other bloke. And I&apos;m hearing the Dunne deal may well be done. Not quite sure 100%, but Sky are hinting desperately that it is  5.14pm  Phil Mannion isn&apos;t feeling the white heat of transfer fury: &quot;So deadline day has been a bit rubbish, but any thoughts on why that is? Does nobody have any money? Were all the deals just done earlier? Are we simply victims of relentless hype, and this was always the way? Or has every team already assembled the perfect squad, and thus we are in for an astounding festival of football?&quot;Most of them were done earlier in the summer. Is that it? no reason you have to wait until the last minute. They&apos;re not cheaper.  5.18pm &quot;We have reached agreement with Portsmouth for the transfer of Niko Kranjcar to the club,&quot; reads a statement from Spurs.  On new-Blue Heitinga Joe de Haas says &quot;Heitinga was pretty good for Ajax, but put in some shocking performances for Atletico and Holland. He&apos;s also know in Holland (justly or not) for being a little bit thick, immortalised in a comedy video in which he needs his name repeated to him over and over through his iPod, in case he forgets..&quot;  5.21pm The official inconclusive latest word on Dunne according to the wires: &quot;Richard Dunne can still complete a move from Manchester City even though the entire deal appears not to have been finalised by the transfer dead-line. Villa can continue to try to sign Dunne providing they started formal proceedings to tie up the deal by the 5pm cut-off point. &quot;There you go. Richard Dunne a bit late. No change there then.  5.24pm On Spurs Jim Denvir says &quot;So what happens at Spurs when Modric is fit again? Does this spell the end for Huddlestone?&quot; No, what spells the end for Huddlestone is the enormous quantity of Haribo Star-Mix heaped up in his kitched. Harry likes stock-piling his players. Lest we forget, they are down to the bare bones.  5.26pm Pranjal diwari asks: &quot;Was wondering if there was any news on the rumoured transfer of Foxes striker Matty Fryatt to Hull. Say it ain&apos;t so...&quot; I think it ain&apos;t so Pranjal. Unless Phil Brown has been up to somehting furtive.  And this just in: Teemu Tainio has signed for Birmingham. Yes he has. That is the news.  5.30pm  And Tony Cross is rubbing his hands together and snickering over sell-on fees: &quot;Hurrah, Hull swap one ex-Brentford defender for another. Shame Sonko isn&apos;t quite as good as Turner. There was a lot of speculation about Turner&apos;s departure because Brentford had a nice sell on clause, which will help us get through another season or two. I&apos;m not sure whether to thank Hull or Sunderland.&quot;The Bees certainly need all the pennies they can get. Many thanks Steve Bruce.  5.31pm Blimey it&apos;s all kicked off from 5.00. Lots of last-minute reduced-aisle rummaging. Right. The Dunne deal is definitely done now. It is done. All done.  5.32pm And here&apos;s another! David &quot;The Nuge&quot; Nugent has signed for Burnley right on the buzzer! Not sure about the fee, but presumably a four-pack of Diet Lilt will have done the trick for the one-time England man (with the I beleive 100% goals-to-games ratio).  5.35pm He he he. Jim White on Sky just said &quot;when Paul Duffin woke up this morning he said to me, I want two new players...&quot;All boys together eh? Nothing wrong with that. Get in there.  5.38pm More Spurs chunter as Adrian Cooper muses: &quot;Hopefully when Modric is back he&apos;ll get moved into the middle, where he plays for Croatia, and Kranjcar will stay out on the left, where he plays for Croatia. There&apos;s a clue there as to their best positions, only I&apos;m not completely convinced &apos;Arry will spot it.&quot; Hark at him. Lots of news about David Bentley not going anywhere today. Seems to suit him somehow.  5.42pm Taking a Man U view, Andrew Fitchett grumbles: &quot;Now the window is firmly shut, can we now ask the question: Why didn&apos;t Fergie spend much of the Ronaldo money? Is he saving for a holiday or something? A holiday he&apos;ll be able to take around the time of this season&apos;s Champions League final if their squad is anything to go on\u2026&quot;Didn&apos;t Ferguson say he didn&apos;t want any more players about a month ago? Not even a whiff of a sniff of a proper rumour about them today. Must be happy with Valencia and the injured French fellow. Takes all sorts.  5.46pm Benry91 slavers: &quot;Is Matuidi coming to Arsenal I&apos;ve got to know, there were a few lines but nothing more.&quot; No he isn&apos;t. Peter Storrie has just said &quot;Niko really is a great guy&quot;. Which is nice. Should help him slot into that over-manned midfield. Quentin Seik asks: &quot;Any news on any transfers to Nottingham Forest? There were some rumours about a loan deal for Gareth Bale and just about every surplus centre back in the lower half of the Premier League.&quot;I&apos;m getting nothing. I&apos;m closing my eyes and trying really hard. I&apos;m moving a cup around on my desk. But nothing so far.  5.50pm Oh Crickey. Sky are about to go to Villa for the absolute last, final word on what on earth Richard Dunne thinks he&apos;s up to. And Paul Lloyd is refusing to look on the bright side of things:&quot;Is it just me, or do you get the feeling that even the top managers are bored of the transfer deadline ? Last year we had all the Robinho/Berbatov/Silvestre last minute swapsies, but this year.... zilch, nada, zero. The only major thing we have seen is Arry&apos;s continued attempts to bankrupt Spurs.&quot; Times are hard. The cash has ceased to slosh insanely. And who signs a player in the final half hour of a three-month window anyway? Hopeless really.  5.55pm The FA got the Dunne papers in time. The Premier League haven&apos;t said if they did yet. Richard Dunne is currently poised, press conference replica shirt half-pulled over his head. All going on.  5.58pm Matt Bourke feels insufficiently fluffed and teased. &quot;there must be something more exciting to tell us? what about Bentley to liverpool gossip, - where did that nugget go ? cant believe no one would pick him up&quot;. No one picked him up. It went nowhere. Like the man himself trying to run really fast down the right wing. But wait! Wayne Rooney has sensationally not moved anywhere, and neither has Lionel Messi, who&apos;s quite happy beetling about at Barcelona thanks. Meanwhile Tom Finney is still dead. There. Did that raise the pulse? (Thanks to Colin Greer)  6.01pm Nugent has gone to Burnley on loan. There you go.  6.05pm Phil Smith argues that Tom Finney isn&apos;t actually dead.  6.07pm Phil Sawyer has news of a new signing: &quot;I&apos;ve just got back from the shops where I signed a quality lump of Lancashire cheese for \u00a32 on a one week contract just before the transfer window slammed shut. It has all the qualities I was looking for - crumbly and salty, and has a good tang for a mild cheese. It&apos;s also very good at playing between the lines.&quot;  6.08pm Sky have just claimed John Terry as &quot;the signing of the transfer window&quot;. Which is cheating.  6.09 pm And a man in a suit keeps talking about Daivd James turning up for training at ten to nine this morning (&quot;nice and early&quot;). How have we come to this?  6.11pm Ha ha. Richard Dunne has &quot;left by a back entrance&quot;. They&apos;ve missed the money-shot there. Villa are convinced they&apos;ve signed him. But the Premier League have yet to confirm they got the papers in time. What are they doing over there? Get on the fax man.  6.14pm Tom Chivers is taking the long view: &quot;Phil Sawyer&apos;s cheese may be exactly what he&apos;s looking for in the short run, but in these days of football-as-a-business you really have to be thinking in terms of the resale value.&quot; What kind of cheese has a re-sell value? I&apos;ve got asingle really old mini-Babybel in the door of my fridge. I reckon it&apos;s worth about 3p. I just feel a move would do it good at this stage in its career.  6.17pm Some Sky-backlash already. James Murton says: &quot;Sky Sports say they&apos;ve been following David James&apos;s movements all day. Might as well have followed his bowel movements, and who knows, if it can slot into a midfield role they could hock it to Spurs.&quot;Adam Leier notes: &quot;It must be so annoying to work for sky. I bet they make you drink a red bull during every commercial break The music! So serious and lumbering! AHHH. Don&apos;t they all have headaches? They are obsessed with talking to Richard Dunne.&quot;Look at you - you&apos;re like disappointed toddlers howling for ice cream and vicious when you don&apos;t get your way.  6.20pm News that Niall Quinn has just sent an email to Sky Sports thanking them &quot;for a great transfer window&quot;. Eh?  6.27pm &quot;We are delighted to have got a player of David&apos;s stature,&quot; said Clarets manager Owen Coyle. &quot;Portsmouth paid \u00a36million for him and I think we would recognise that it has been a bit stop-start for him.&quot;That&apos;s one way of putting it.  6.28pm  This on the wires: &quot;Fulham have confirmed the signing of striker David Elm from Swedish side Kalmar on a one-year deal for an undisclosed fee.&quot; Thought that was already out there. Any views on David Elm? Could this be a succesful branching out for him?  6.32pm Phil Smith is increasingly convinced Tom Finney, Preston&apos;s current president, isn&apos;t actually dead. There is a body of evidence building.6.36pm  6.37pm It&apos;s gone a bit quiet now. Even Sky have started changing the subject and talking about Eduardo. Could there still be a twist in the tail out there? (Answer: no)  6.45pm Beep... Beep.... Beeep.... Beeeeeeeeep. Transfer window deadline day is now officially flat-lining. Claudio Ranieri is the new Roma manager. &quot;I am honoured and convinced I will be able to do and give the best for Roma,&quot; he said in his very distinctive friendly voice.  6.54pm Um... I see Ian Blackwell took 5-7 today for Durham. He&apos;s still got the hunger.  7.05pm And with that I&apos;m going to declare this deadline day blog closed. Thanks for all your emails. Good night.", "sentences": ["The 21-year-old Brazilian, famous for his unique &apos;seal dribble&apos;, will stay in Amsterdam until June 2010 with Ajax also having the option to make the deal permanent next summer."], "title": "Transfer deadline day - as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/01/transfer-deadline-day-live", "tags": ["Transfer window", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-01T18:01:58Z", "article": "Barry Flanagan, who has died of motor neurone disease aged 68, decided upon his vocation early: &quot;I was a fully fledged sculptor from the age of 17. I stepped right into it and embraced the physical world.&quot; In late 1979 the first of his trademark hares was cast in bronze, the classic material he believed best suited an artist whose vision depended on a linear predisposition, the dark surfaces lending what he called bloom and drama to the work. Flanagan&apos;s hares adopted the energies of humans, their facial expressions ranging from insouciant to melancholic. The wide appeal of his bronze animals (also cougars, elephants and horses) seemed at odds with the more oblique nature of his early works, which were made in humble materials, such as sand, sticks and hessian. His art was associated with the minimal and land art movements of the 1960s, frequently addressing process and language (a rope piece installed in two spaces, for example, was titled 2sp rope 2&apos;67/9). With hindsight, the consistently authentic, original nature of the work is rooted in Flanagan&apos;s way of lightly touching the materials and his rather British (or Celtic) understatement and playfulness. Flanagan&apos;s life story has been well documented, since he was eager to cite experiences and people as the context for particular achievements. He was born in Prestatyn, north Wales, not far from Liverpool, where his father worked for Warner Brothers film studios. After boarding school at Foxhunt Manor prep school and Mayfield college, in East Sussex, Flanagan briefly studied architecture, and then sculpture, at Birmingham College of Art (1957\u201358). Supporting himself by various short-term jobs, for bakers, frame-makers and builders, he mastered techniques, which he called &quot;recipes&quot;. He sampled five art schools, choosing St Martin&apos;s in London, after having attended in the summer of 1961 an evening course there led by Anthony Caro where the students were set exercises such as being given wire and told to make a sculpture of a &quot;ZABAUUUM&quot;. While he was still a student, Flanagan&apos;s stitched cloth creations, filled with plaster or sand, aroused the interest of dealers and critics. In his final assessment, Flanagan&apos;s tutor, the sculptor Phillip King, noted this distraction but judged him to be already a deep thinker, an artist whose work was surprising and likely to remain challenging. Flanagan was attracted to the concrete poets who gathered at Better Books across from St Martin&apos;s on the Charing Cross Road. He co-produced a college magazine lasting five issues, Sil\u00e2ns (its title a phonetic version of the French for &quot;silence&quot;). After being given a copy of the Evergreen Review of May-June 1960, the issue devoted to Alfred Jarry (1873\u20111907), he developed a lifelong appreciation of Jarry, his character Ubu and his science of pataphysics, or the &quot;science of imaginary solutions&quot;. Writing in 1965 to Caro, who was away in America, he defined a young sculptor&apos;s challenge: &quot;to assert himself twice as hard in a negative way&quot;. The one-page text by Flanagan published in Studio International in September 1967 contains a statement frequently quoted: &quot;One merely causes things/to reveal themselves to the sculptural awareness. It is the/awareness that develops, not the agents of the sculptural phenomena.&quot; It appeared opposite a photograph of the curious work comprised of four wobbly, tapering columns, a large linoleum ring and a rope, titled Four casb 2 &apos;67, ringl 1 &apos;67 and rope (gr 2sp 60) 6 &apos;67 (now in the Tate Collection) that was installed the same month in the Biennale des Jeunes in Paris. A second work shown in Paris, 1 ton corner piece &apos;67 (one hundredweight of sand poured on to the floor, scooped four times from the centre) had first appeared in the artist&apos;s inaugural one-person show at the Rowan Gallery in London in August 1966. Of variable dimensions, depending on context, its gentle curves reminded the artist, he said, of playing in sand dunes near his childhood home. These works preceded similar pieces by Carl Andre and Robert Smithson who, in 1966, were unaware of Flanagan&apos;s parallel explorations. However, interest in &quot;land art&quot; and arte povera spread at a wildfire pace and Flanagan was invited to show in the leading private galleries and museums of Europe, the US and Japan. His contributions to temporary and performance-based events, like the short film A Hole in the Sea (1969), shot on the beach at Scheveningen, near The Hague, for the Land Art group exhibition (actually a Berlin television broadcast masterminded by Gerry Schum) are now the subject of academic research. Flanagan&apos;s work was championed by the writers Gene Baro and Charles Harrison and the curators of the seminal exhibitions of 1969, particularly Eddie de Wilde, at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (OP Losse Schroeven) and Harald Szeeman in Berne (When Attitudes Become Form). Michael Compton, selecting 6 at the Hayward in 1969, expected Flanagan to produce something &quot;paradoxically very cheap and yet unsaleable, a parable therefore of an ideal art&quot;. Although fundamentally bohemian in character, Flanagan resented his relative poverty. Obliged to pay a girl acting in one of his films with home-made money, he explained this expedient as underscoring &quot;the dreadful way in which money punishes art&quot;. In 1975 Flanagan established a trade account called Rowford Process and the following year joined the Waddington Galleries. Rudi Fuchs, in the foreword to the early retrospective he initiated at the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, in 1977, recognised the &quot;purity of position&quot; necessary for the avant-garde artist wishing to effect historical change, and contrasted this strategy with Flanagan&apos;s practice, &quot;based on the notion of skill within a particular craft&quot;. When the exhibition travelled to the Arnolfini in Bristol and the Serpentine, London, new works in Hornton stone and marble were added, roughly shaped and stacked, and revealing a quixotic, &quot;animalistic&quot; character, such as Miracle in the Cabbage Patch (1978). The idiosyncratic silk-screened poster came from a design with two crossed axolotls suspended over mountains, compass and right angle, one image among a terrific range of works on paper \u2013 portraits, diagrams, collages, prints and scores of notebook doodles. Flanagan taught at St Martin&apos;s and the Central School of Art (1967\u201371) where Henry Abercrombie and Andy Elton ran the foundry and they invited him to work in their business A&amp;A Sculpture Casting in Bow, formed in 1978. Modelling a hare from one bought from a butcher, Flanagan also found inspiration from an earlier sighting of an animal he had seen bounding east to west on the Sussex Downs. George Ewart Evans and David Thomson&apos;s 1972 book The Leaping Hare was used as a reference, as was the animal in world mythologies, but Flanagan insisted that his creative decisions came when shaping the armature of the sculpture, and were governed by a graphic rather than volumetric sensibility. The variations and new editions realised over the next 30 years depended on the scale and the identity of the base, either a classic form, such as a latticed pyramid, upturned anvil or cast-iron bell, or a cultural one, with examples ranging from cricket stumps to a model of the Empire State Building. Flanagan travelled in 1981 to Washington to a Rodin exhibition and paid homage to the master with reconceptions of The Thinker and Nijinsky (Rodin&apos;s improvised plaster for Nijinsky measured 18cm, whereas the dancer&apos;s body was eventually reconceived by Flanagan at more than five metres high). In 1990 a pair of Leaping Hare sculptures, commissioned by the Kawakyo Company, Osaka, were placed atop high columns at the main entrance to a hotel on the Japanese coast. Parades of bronze figures were installed temporarily on Park Avenue in New York, Grant Park in Chicago and on O&apos;Connell Street in Dublin. Flanagan gave sculptures to Jesus College, Cambridge, and a Kouros Horse to the town of Santa Eulalia near his house in Ibiza. Other permanent fixtures are Hare on Bell in the Equitable Life Tower West, New York; Nine Foot Hare in the Victoria Plaza, London; and Leaping Hare on a Crescent and Bell at Broadgate, London. Exhibitions have been organised by prestigious venues, among them the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Fundaci\u00f3n &quot;La Caixa&quot; in Madrid, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Tate Liverpool, the museum in Recklinghausen, Germany and IMMA (the Irish Museum of Modern Art) in Dublin. Earlier this year a small retrospective was held in the New Art Centre in Wiltshire. Flanagan defined himself as an English-speaking itinerant European sculptor. His restlessness was apparent in short-lived ventures with collaborators, from skilled carvers in Pietrasanta, Italy, to diorama enthusiasts meeting at the Museum Tavern, London, and in his many changes of residence. Leaving Kentish Town in the early 1980s, he moved through a sequence of London addresses, spending part of the year in Ibiza, as well as periods in Amsterdam, New York and Dublin; the one consistent action was the laying of his trademark green carpet in every home. In his last years, he was accompanied during seasonal migrations by his partner Jessica Sturgess, a kindred spirit, their ideal means of transport a vintage camper van. In his notebooks, Flanagan reflected on his increasingly marginal position, wavering between a desire to computerise his records and sort out his legacy and a need for control. His speech was marked by long pauses and elliptical observations; however, he loosened up in the congenial atmosphere of bars. He was a proud Royal Academician \u2013 elected in 1991, the year he was appointed OBE \u2013 loyal to old friends and a generous patron of favoured causes. One can observe essential nuances in the demeanour (and in the quality) of Flanagan&apos;s individual hares. The seated posture sometimes conveys dejection or boredom, as in the creature with folded legs uncomfortably perched on a gigantic computer, or the lonely fellow in a little boat. Flanagan remarked: &quot;I have never travelled far, in the sense that I have never been a voice of my generation&apos;s aspirations and being a happy man at work and liking things to do, never strayed far from the practical confines of occupation.&quot; He is survived by two daughters, Samantha (Flan) and Tara, from his marriage to Sue Lewis; a son, Alfred, and daughter, Annabelle, by Renate Widmann; and by Jessica. \u2022 Barry Flanagan, sculptor, born 11 January 1941; died 31 August 2009", "sentences": ["Flanagan&apos;s work was championed by the writers Gene Baro and Charles Harrison and the curators of the seminal exhibitions of 1969, particularly Eddie de Wilde, at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (OP Losse Schroeven) and Harald Szeeman in Berne (When Attitudes Become Form).", "Leaving Kentish Town in the early 1980s, he moved through a sequence of London addresses, spending part of the year in Ibiza, as well as periods in Amsterdam, New York and Dublin; the one consistent action was the laying of his trademark green carpet in every home."], "title": "Obituary | Sculptor | Barry Flanagan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/01/barry-flanagan-obituary", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "Anthony Caro", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-03T14:30:36Z", "article": "Hometown: Amsterdam. The lineup: Eva Simons (vocals, music). The background: There was some speculation recently that Silly Boy \u2013 something of a YouTube sensation, with 4m hits \u2013 was an unreleased or unannounced single by Lady Gaga or Rihanna. Some imagined it might be Gaga because of the robo-rockin&apos; tune, arrangement and Auto-Tuned android vocals, while others suspected it might be Rihanna because of the lyrics that nail an unknown male moron for his dumb behaviour, many assuming the titular twat to be one Christopher Brown, because the track began circulating around the same time that the R&amp;B diva was accusing her ex-squeeze of assault. Anyway, it turns out that the illegally uploaded demo was by a Dutch girl called Eva Simons. You might have seen her \u2013 she&apos;s hard to miss. She wears a shiny cyber-dress with sharp edges that apparently made her bleed during the making of her video, and she&apos;s got a giant red mohawk that makes La Roux&apos;s barnet look ever so slightly unadventurous and tame. &quot;I like to be a bit freaky and dark, but power doesn&apos;t mean you have to be a bitch. I&apos;m a nice person, but I know what I want,&quot; she says, and what she wants, fairly evidently, is to be a star of hot-rockin&apos;, electro-poppin&apos; R&amp;B. She already is a star in the Netherlands \u2013 in 2004, after winning the Dutch version of the reality TV show Popstars, she became a member of a girl group called Raffish, who had a No 1 hit and released an album, How Raffish Are You?, before disbanding in 2006. Earlier this year, she sang on the Dutch edition of The X Factor. She&apos;s got a bit of a celebrity family, actually. Her grandfather was a famous accordion player who has his own statue in Amsterdam, her dad is a pianist, her stepdad plays trumpet for the apparently renowned German WDR Big Band, and her mum has been a backing singer for the stellar likes of the Supremes. She&apos;s been composing since she was 12, writing songs about &quot;love, breaking up, quarrelling with your mum, or a dog that has died&quot;. She studied music theory at a prestigious college and has written tunes for other artists and well as various advertising jingles. She&apos;s got 30 songs in what we in the trade call the &quot;can&quot; for her 2010 debut album, but we&apos;ve only heard one: Silly Boy. It comes in a variety of forms on the CD single, from semi-acoustic and sultry to a mad supertronic version that approximates the effect of being catapulted through a neon metropolis in a silver suit while futuristic bees swarm their way into your brain. The song&apos;s not up to much, but the producer deserves a medal, or perhaps a statue in the centre of Amsterdam. The buzz: &quot;Gahanna, anyone?&quot; The truth: She&apos;s less auteurish and in control than La Roux but she&apos;s as involved as Gaga in the writing \u2013 we just need to hear more of it than the generic, Poker Face-ish Silly Boy. Most likely to: Challenge La Roux to a red mohican-growing contest. Least likely to: Write a stomping, computer-funk paean to a deceased canine. What to buy: Silly Boy is released by Virgin on 12 October. File next to: Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Keri Hilson, La Roux.

The band were on a short tour, including a festival date in Sweden (on the same bill as Primal Scream) and a gig the night before at the Astoria in London, where Paul Weller had gatecrashed the aftershow party. The Tories were still in power; no one had heard the term Britpop yet; the band&apos;s debut album Definitely Maybe would be released at the end of the month. The others \u2013 bassist Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan, guitarist Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs, drummer Tony McCarroll and singer, Liam Gallagher \u2013 left the dressing room while I spoke to 27-year old Noel Gallagher. I think I&apos;m right in saying it was his first broadsheet interview and during the course of it he&apos;d show why he wasn&apos;t just the best songwriter in the UK: for the next 15 years, he&apos;d be the best interview in rock music, too. Caspar Llewellyn Smith: How&apos;s this last tour been?Noel Gallagher:  Where do I start? Started last Tuesday \u2013 so that&apos;s a week and one day. So we&apos;ve had a fucking riot: a broken ankle; we&apos;ve been barred from two hotels; been to Sweden and made the front page of the national newspaper. They called us &quot;English scum&quot; and told us we weren&apos;t allowed back in the country. Throb from Primal Scream&apos;s got a broken nose and had to have eight injections in his knee. CLS: So that&apos;s pretty much everything you&apos;ve ever wanted \u2026 Noel: It&apos;s been all right. This has been the wildest tour. We thought it&apos;d be boring &apos;cause this is about the fifth one and we thought it would be just like the others but somehow this one has just got a bit out of hand. CLS: What&apos;s it like doing Top of the Pops?Noel: You&apos;ve got to do it, you know what I mean? You can be a fucking knob like Joe Strummer and say you&apos;re never going to do Top of the Pops. You&apos;ve got to get on and do it and try and be as fucking big as you can. It&apos;s all about ambition, innit? CLS: Is that your aim? To be the biggest band ever?Noel: You&apos;ve gotta. If somebody says: &quot;Do you want to be put into how-many-ever fucking million homes on a Thursday night?&quot; it&apos;s like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; You&apos;ve got a duty to the people that buy your records. The people that buy your records are going to be sat at home on a Thursday night, and saying to their mams and dads, &quot;See, this is the band I&apos;m into. This is what I like.&quot; We don&apos;t want to be an indie band from England who&apos;ve had a couple of hits. We want to go on and be an important band and there&apos;s certain things you&apos;ve got to do. You want to sell 5,000 limited-edition red vinyl seven-inches, that&apos;s fine. Make music for a closet full of people in Bradford somewhere ... but it doesn&apos;t mean anything to anyone. Phil Collins has got to be chased out of the charts, and Wet Wet Wet. It&apos;s the only way to do it, man, to fucking get in there among them and stamp the fuckers out. CLS:  It&apos;s a pretty dire time.Noel:  There&apos;s more bands about now than there has been for the last three or four years. A lot of them are mediocre. A lot of them get press coverage and they&apos;re not very good. The only bands I&apos;m into are Paul Weller, the Verve, Primal Scream and that&apos;s it. CLS: Was it weird having Weller at the show last night?Noel: We&apos;ve met him a couple of times. He&apos;s all right. He&apos;s older than us and set in his ways. It&apos;s like, I totally respect him but he does his thing and we do ours. He likes our band and we love his band. He&apos;s a fucking top guy.     Oasis at the Knebworth Festival, 1996. Photograph: Rex Features    CLS:  What happens if it ends tomorrow? Do you carry on writing songs? Is that what it&apos;s really about?Noel:  The thing about all this fucking hype shit and press about our tours and drugs, although it&apos;s true, they write about it &apos;cos it sells papers. You&apos;ve got to get your records out because your records last forever. Press stories last for a week until someone else is doing something else. The songs are what it&apos;s about and the albums, gigs, that&apos;s what sticks in people&apos;s memories \u2013 not being bundled off a ferry in Amsterdam. In 20 years&apos; time our album Definitely Maybe will still be in the shops and that&apos;s what it&apos;s about. In 20 years&apos; time people will buy the album and listen to it for what it is. They won&apos;t listen to it because we were rock&apos;n&apos;roll or something like that. That&apos;s what matters. CLS: What&apos;s about the stories about rows with your brother?Noel:  The thing about brothers, the thing between me and him, is ... he can bullshit to other people and they believe him and I can bullshit to other people, but we can&apos;t bullshit to each other because we&apos;ve known each other for too long. Brothers are always competitive anyway. Aren&apos;t they? CLS: Is he happy with all your lyrics?Noel: Yeah. If any of the band ever said, &quot;I&apos;m not singing that or not playing it ...&quot; I&apos;d say, &quot;Right, we&apos;ll we&apos;re not changing it because that&apos;s the fucking song,&quot; you know what I mean? Of course he&apos;s happy. I mean, why would he not be? CLS: The story is that he formed the band. It seemed that you needed that to get you off your arse...Noel:  Totally. I didn&apos;t know anybody else who I would desire to be in a band with, except these four guys. It&apos;s as simple as that. It&apos;s fate I suppose. CLS:  Is writing songs the most important thing in your life?Noel:  Totally. Writing songs, that&apos;s what gets me going. Not the drugs or the sex or the rock&apos;n&apos;roll behaviour, it&apos;s the music. I write all the time. I&apos;ve got the attention span of a fucking gnat so if I&apos;m not doing something like writing or doing interviews I just sit there vegetating, fucking taking drugs. CLS: How would you describe your sound to someone who&apos;s never heard you before?Noel: I&apos;d just say, all the best bits of every band that anyone&apos;s ever liked. We sound like all the important bands. People slag us off and say we sound like the Beatles, T-Rex, the Stones, Jam, Sex Pistols, but it&apos;s better than sounding like Spandau Ballet. CLS:  What&apos;s the best thing that you&apos;ve written?Noel:  On the album I&apos;d say Slide Away, personally. I remember the times when we recorded Supersonic and it was supposed to be a B-side and it ended up being the first single. That&apos;s my favourite for that reason. Married with Children, because it&apos;s funny. Sad Song, because I sing it. But Slide Away is probably the best song I&apos;ve ever written. At the moment. CLS:  One of the things I love about your band is the sense of humour.Noel: Most of the bands in England are just too inward looking. Bollocks! Music should be like TV. Turn it on, it entertains you. That&apos;s what we&apos;re about. The lyrics do mean certain things. I don&apos;t like talking about it &apos;cause it&apos;s too difficult for me. Each line in a song means something else. They mean what they mean to people. [But] we don&apos;t aspire to be deep like Suede or the Smiths. A lot of people want to go out and change people&apos;s lives and dictate to them what they should be doing and what they should be wearing and who they should be voting for. Our music has changed people&apos;s lives, I know it has, Live Forever has, but all the songs on that album were written when I was on the dole and I had fuck all going for me. I was writing about escaping. I wasn&apos;t writing about being on the dole and how shit it was. I was writing about how great it could be if we were in a band. That&apos;s what [people] \u2013 especially the people who come to the gigs \u2013 can relate to cause we&apos;re singing about them. If it takes you out of your surroundings, if you&apos;re listening to it at work or on the bus, then that&apos;s what it&apos;s all about.     The brothers Gallagher practice looking moody. Photograph: Peter Anderson/SIN/CORBIS    CLS: Do you not find it weird with pop music \u2026 it&apos;s not like an advert. That entertains you but it&apos;s just so what. [Pop is] three minutes of ... a bit of magic.Noel: Yeah. If you try too hard you&apos;re never going to get there. Most of the pop stars today ... Blur are trying to be entertaining but they&apos;re trying too hard. Their music just doesn&apos;t mean anything. They get people to gigs and sell out and that&apos;s fine. They&apos;re a working band and play live. Fucking great, I&apos;ve got respect for them but it sounds like they&apos;re trying too hard. What we do is just completely natural. I sit there and just pick up a guitar and I wait and I wait and I wait and then something goes and it fucking comes out. I don&apos;t try to write songs about things. Like Girls and Boys about being on holiday in Spain. I ain&apos;t the voice of a generation for anyone and neither is anyone in the band. We&apos;re not figureheads of any movement and we don&apos;t aspire to be. People are saying we&apos;re the most important band since blah blah blah and that&apos;s their opinion. We&apos;re not going to say, &quot;No we&apos;re not&quot;. If you say we&apos;re the most important band since the Smiths then fine. But I&apos;m not going to go and say, &quot;I&apos;m the most important songwriter since John Lennon&quot;. It&apos;s not within me to say that. CLS:  What were you doing before [you joined the band]? Roadying?Noel:  Yeah. For a Manchester band. Fucking about. Before that? Fucking fish-tank maker. I worked in a bakery. As a signwriter. As a labourer. Worked in a dry cleaners. You fucking name it, I done it. I only done it because I had to. I only did it for the money, I only did it because that&apos;s what I had to do. Why the fuck would I aspire to be a fucking fish-tank maker? Beyond me. I was 16, 17. You do what you have to do, because your mam boots you out of bed at 11 o&apos;clock in the morning and says, &quot;Get down the fucking job centre!&quot;. CLS:  Do you think you are special in that you&apos;ve got this ability?Noel:  If it was that easy every fucker would be doing it. If it was that easy, you&apos;d be doing it. I believe people have got certain talents. Not everyone can write songs, that is special &apos;cause you&apos;re communicating with people. If it&apos;s for building walls or plastering or painting or something like that, then that&apos;s a fucking talent. You can&apos;t build a house yourself, you&apos;ve got to get someone to build it for you. I believe everyone&apos;s got special talents, it&apos;s just a matter of finding it, realising what it is and then getting on with it and doing it. I was always told when I was young, there&apos;s no point in playing that guitar because you&apos;re just going to end up working in Maccy D&apos;s. It was like, no. Fuck that. CLS: What was school like?Noel: I wish somebody had actually taken the time to realise that I could actually play the guitar and could write songs and took me to one side and gave me a bit of fucking time. They always take the best footballers and put them in their own little class and they get treated better at school. There should be more emphasis put on music and the arts. The education system doesn&apos;t understand musicians ... doesn&apos;t understand music except classical music. Classical music means fucking diddle in this country to the kids. CLS:  What&apos;s this about you saying you&apos;d like to move about a bit more on stage?Noel: But I can&apos;t because I&apos;m concentrating too much on playing guitar. Yeah. I&apos;d hate to be like Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix who actually mastered the guitar. Then I&apos;d just go, &quot;Pfft, fucking hell, it&apos;s just not exciting anymore&quot;. I learn new chords everyday. I&apos;ll get dead excited and fucking be like, &quot;here, check that out for a chord. Fucking ace!&quot; Someone will be like, &quot;Oh yeah, G minor flat suspended&quot;. &quot;I just invented that chord! And it&apos;s called N!&quot; CLS: What about your brother on stage? He stands dead still. Noel:  Well, I mean, he shakes the tambourine, doesn&apos;t he? Sings the songs. Not that much else to do really. Unless you want to be Brett Anderson. CLS:  Is he never tempted to do a Jagger or Bobby Gillespie number?Noel:  Us lot would all laugh at him. That&apos;s him. He is his own man. It&apos;s as simple as that. He just doesn&apos;t do them sort of things. He doesn&apos;t talk to the crowd. That&apos;s him. If he started acting like Brett Anderson I&apos;d fucking take my guitar off and I&apos;d fucking smack him round the back of his head. CLS:  Has it all come naturally to him?Noel: I&apos;d imagine so. CLS: Does he get nervous?Noel:  Him? Oh yeah, absolutely fucking terrified. But he&apos;d never admit it to anyone. You see that look of fear in his eyes before he goes out on stage. The shitbag. But that&apos;s him. He doesn&apos;t scare me. CLS:  What if he wants to start writing songs himself?Noel:  Erm ... I suppose we cross that bridge when we come to it. If they&apos;re all right songs, then fine, but he won&apos;t be writing them for this band. It&apos;s taken us three years to get where we are today and I&apos;m not going to hand over the reins ... You can keep your songs and stick &apos;em up your arse. When the band splits up or runs its course, then you can write your own songs, but it was me who got us where we are. CLS: The music you seem to like, it&apos;s all white rock guitar bands, isn&apos;t it?Noel: When it first kicked off in 88, 89, I was at the Hacienda every night, into dance music and hip-hop and all that. But I got bored of it &apos;cos it ran its course, and now it&apos;s just 2 Unlimited and the Prodigy and it&apos;s too fast and it&apos;s lost its groove. I&apos;m not really a dance music fan. But people who are into it are into it ... and people who are into dance music can&apos;t understand people like us. CLS:  Does it bother you that it&apos;s not like the 60s, when everyone liked the Beatles and the Stones? Does it upset you that it&apos;s never going to be like that again?Noel:  Totally. It upsets me that Suede have to all intents and purposes split up. Blur are a musical joke. So really there&apos;s only us that are a new young band doing anything and there should be six or seven of us, but there ain&apos;t. People are trying to build up Shed Seven against us but Shed Seven couldn&apos;t tie my shoelaces. They go on in the press saying, &quot;Oasis stole our thunder&quot;. But thunder belongs to no one ... it belongs to the kids. If it wasn&apos;t for us, fucking Echobelly and Shed Seven would be the most important bands in Britain and that would be a farce. CLS: Can you ever see yourself settling down with a couple of kids?Noel: No, fucking never. CLS:  A nice semi in the country? A big mansion in LA?Noel: Well, that&apos;s the general plan! Buy an island ... build a big fence, keep the fuckers out. Maybe I&apos;ll wake up one day and think I&apos;ll want two kids and a wife but I can&apos;t see it, I&apos;m too selfish. When I&apos;m 50, am I going to be bankrupt and in rehab? I don&apos;t think about that. I just think about today and tomorrow. I don&apos;t believe in that ethic of live fast and die young \u2013 which is what the song Live Forever is about \u2013 I hope to live to be 390. But what will be will be. I believe everything is mapped out for you anyway. Nothing gets me down about life in general, nothing pisses me off. I&apos;m ambidextrous, I write with my left hand and I play guitar with my right. I&apos;m right-footed, I&apos;m double-jointed in one elbow: I&apos;m the most bizarre character ever. So nothing amazes me. If I see a spaceship land I won&apos;t get freaked out. I&apos;ll just say, &quot;What kept ya?&quot;. As long as people keep buying the records and coming to the gigs, there&apos;s no point in being down about anything. We&apos;re not deep people, we don&apos;t worry about what&apos;s going to happen in five years&apos; time. I might get up in the morning and inclination might take me to say, &quot;Fuck it, I don&apos;t want to be in a band no more&quot;. You live and die by your decisions and I&apos;ll live and die by whatever decisions I make.

Then he speaks approvingly of &quot;progress and the right decision&quot; by the country&apos;s seven supreme court judges, who decided last week that prosecuting people for the private consumption of small amounts of narcotics was unconstitutional. &quot;Last year three of my friends were caught smoking a spliff in a park and were treated like traffickers,&quot; he said. &quot;They went to court, which took six months. One went to jail alongside murderers. The others were sent to rehab, where they were treated for an addiction they didn&apos;t have, alongside serious heroin and crack users. It was pointless and destroyed their lives.&quot; The court&apos;s ruling was based on a case involving several men caught with joints in their pockets. As a result, judges struck down an existing law stipulating a sentence of up to two years in jail for those caught with any amount of narcotics. &quot;Each individual adult is responsible for making decisions freely about their desired lifestyle without state interference,&quot; the ruling said. &quot;Private conduct is allowed unless it constitutes a real danger or causes damage to property or the rights of others.&quot; Is the &quot;war on drugs&quot; ending? The Argentinian ruling does not stand alone. Across Latin America and Mexico, there is a wave of drug law reform which constitutes a stark rebuff to the United States as it prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of a conflict officially declared by President Richard Nixon and fronted by his wife, Pat, in 1969. That &quot;war&quot; has incarcerated an average of a million US citizens a year, as every stratum of American society demonstrates its insatiable need to get high. And it has also engulfed not only America, but the Americas. At El Paso at the end of the month, experts from the US and Mexico will gather to take stock and thrash out alternatives. El Paso stands cheek by jowl with its twin city, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the Rio Grande. There, last Wednesday, the day after the Argentinian court ruling, cartel gunmen broke into the El Aliviane drug rehabilitation centre, lined 17 young people against a wall and cut them down with a fusillade of machine-gun fire. Troops last night captured the suspected killer, Jose Rodolfo Escajeda, considered one of the most brutal hitmen in Chihuahua and one of the leaders of the Ju\u00e1rez cartel. The executions, coming shortly after the killing of 40 people over three days in Ju\u00e1rez two weeks ago, take the death toll to about 1,400 this year, making it the most dangerous city in the world. Never have the war on drugs and its flipside, the drug wars, raged so furiously as on this anniversary. Yet Mexico&apos;s is only the latest in a series of murderous conflicts that have scarred the pan-American war on drugs, starting with Operation Condor in the 1970s, whereby the US helped Mexico to obliterate poppy crops, only to give birth to the new cartels and institutionalised corruption. Meanwhile, there have been catastrophic drug wars and narco-insurgency in Colombia, combining with political struggles to create the biggest internal displacement of people in the western hemisphere. Drug-related violence has blighted Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and anywhere the Mexican and Colombian cocaine cartels sought their product. Latin America has also become a factory for synthetic drugs, much of it now under Mexican control. Latin America is seeking a different route to that of outright interdiction as advocated \u2013 and for decades directed \u2013 by Washington. The new thinking is emblematic of a new era in South American politics and statehood, in which the lexicon demands partnership with the US, not the subjugation that hallmarked the presidencies of Nixon, Reagan, the Bushes and Clinton. Argentina&apos;s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, has openly supported freeing up the courts of cases involving people caught with small amounts of drugs. In 2008, she said she complained that in Argentina &quot;an addict is condemned as if he were a criminal&quot;. The government&apos;s cabinet chief, An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez, said the decision was a move away from &quot;the repressive politics invented by the Nixon administration&quot; and will offer the opportunity for the state to focus on going after major traffickers. But a line is drawn between marijuana and hard drugs, the decision being seen as a step towards freeing resources for the battle against &quot;paco&quot; cocaine paste, a cheap but toxic and addictive drug that has swept through Argentina&apos;s barrios. Between 2001 and 2005, the use of paco increased by more than 200%. Brazilian drugs campaigners see decriminalisation as a way of wresting power from heavily armed gangs. Under Brazilian law, possession of any drug is a crime, and any move to relax drug laws is likely to face fierce opposition from the Brazilian right and the Catholic church. But &quot;for South American countries, the &apos;harm&apos; from drugs comes less from drug use than the war against producers and traffickers&quot;, said Benjamin Lessing, a University of California researcher. &quot;The bloodshed in Mexico is grabbing headlines, but thousands of people die every year in Rio de Janeiro in clashes between police and traffickers.&quot; Eduardo Machado, an activist from the PE Body Count group, which documents homicide levels in Recife, one of Brazil&apos;s most violent cities, said the country&apos;s war on drugs had sidelined debate over &quot;the huge public health problem&quot; they caused. &quot;As long as we look at the problem of drugs in terms of repression, we will carry on failing,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as the debate about drugs revolves around being more or less repressive, we will continue to lose thousands of young lives each year.&quot; Even before conventional wisdom began to turn against the war on drugs, some leftwing leaders in Latin America had their own reasons to shun collaboration with the US. Not only was the policy failing, they said, but it was a pretext for Washington meddling. Venezuela&apos;s president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, cut ties with the US Drug Enforcement Administration in 2005, accusing its agents of espionage. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales, a Ch\u00e1vez ally, expelled American counter-narcotic agents, also claiming they were spies. He campaigned to rehabilitate the maligned coca leaf as a sacred Inca symbol with medicinal and ceremonial properties. On one occasion, he brandished a leaf during a speech to the UN general assembly and offered coca tea to visiting dignitaries. When addressing Aymara Indians, the president is known to shout: &quot;Long live the coca leaf, death to the Yankees!&quot; Bolivia&apos;s impoverished highlanders revere Morales as a fellow cocalero \u2013 coca grower \u2013 and are grateful the era of coca crackdowns and shoot-outs with US-backed drug officials is over. Morales, however, has promised zero tolerance for cocaine, which he considers a malign perversion of the coca leaf. Ecuador&apos;s president, Rafael Correa, another leftwinger, has refused to renew the US military&apos;s lease on its base at Manta which was used for counter-narcotics operations in the Pacific. Last year the president pardoned 1,500 &quot;mules&quot; who had been sentenced to jail, saying they were impoverished people who had been exploited. Ecuadorean legislators have signalled they will follow Argentina in decriminalising cannabis. Despite almost a decade of US-backed counter-insurgency operations, Colombia&apos;s cocaine output has proved remarkably resilient, a tribute to the ruthlessness and inventiveness of coca growers, guerrillas, paramilitaries and smugglers. Peru, the second-largest cocaine exporter after Colombia, is the odd country out in South America&apos;s shift against the drug war. It has made no move towards decriminalisation and is braced for confrontation. Shining Path guerrillas, a near-extinct movement, have roared back in the past 16 months, killing soldiers and police and seizing control of coca-producing valleys. Mexico is in a curious position: a battlefield in a drugs war that has claimed some 14,000 lives since December 2006, but also a laboratory for an experiment that goes beyond even Argentina&apos;s \u2013 opting no longer to prosecute those carrying small quantities of marijuana, cocaine, heroin or synthetic drugs. Decriminalisation is openly aimed at redirecting stretched resources against the warmongers and opening prison space to accommodate them rather than petty addicts. Few serving Mexican politicians have tried to pretend that, without the war, the legislation would not have been considered. In Tijuana, addicts cannot believe their luck \u2013 those arriving at the Narc\u00f3ticos An\u00f3nimos session are amazed that possession of up to four lines of cocaine or 50mg of heroin will be legal. Juan Morales Magana, 17, a windscreen-washer and registered methamphetamine and heroin addict, was working out how many hits the legal limit of 40mg of meth would get him, though his counsellor, an evangelical pastor, was ambivalent: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want anyone to think that, just because it is legal, one should live like this for fun. Drugs are the scourge of our society. All this can do would limit killing between small-time cholos [gangsters] for street-corner turf, allowing the army to go after kingpins and middle men. The danger is that kingpins will accelerate the domestic market if possession is legal and smuggling into the US more difficult.&quot; In barrios such as this, drugs are sold from tienditas controlled by gangs that operate an outsourced tender system for the battling cartels. &quot;It&apos;s unsure how the legislation will affect actions against the tienditas,&quot; said police officer Elisio Montes, whose two best friends, his former boss and assistant, were murdered by executioners for the cartels. &quot;Personally, I sometimes wish drugs would be made legal so that the gringos can get high and we can live in peace. Then I say to myself: no \u2013 these drugs are addictive after one single hit. They&apos;re terrifying \u2013 they destroy lives, they destroy our young people. If they are legal, they will buy more.&quot; A further reason for scepticism is the prospect of mass drugs tourism from the US. This is not what Mexican businessmen in the border town of Nogales, Sonora, had in mind last Tuesday when they discussed how to restore the image of cities that until recently enjoyed thriving trade from Americans looking for cheap pharmaceuticals, dental treatment, souvenirs, alcohol and sex. The prospect of border towns becoming the equivalent of Amsterdam, only with cocaine and heroin freely on sale, was not discussed. &quot;It&apos;s interesting,&apos; said hotelier Jesus Antonio Pujol Irastorza. &quot;I have seen a lot written about this potential problem in the US media, but almost nothing in the Mexican press.&quot; &quot;For a country that has experienced thousands of deaths from warring drug cartels,&quot; said San Diego police chief William Lansdowne, &quot;it defies logic why they will pass a law that will clearly increase drug use.&quot; The counter-voices will continue to make themselves heard. But even in the US, the discourse on drugs is changing. The prosecutor general in Baja California, Rommel Moreno, said months ago that he found it &quot;very hard&quot; to talk to his American counterparts &quot;about fighting drugs with any means other than interdiction&quot;, but senses &quot;an important shift&quot;. Officials in the border states talk about legalising marijuana for personal use, while Professor David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute in San Diego, said: &quot;I think it is inevitable that possession of marijuana will be legal in the US within a decade.&quot; Powerful voices against prohibition will create the underlying theme at the major conference in El Paso this month and there is even a movement of police officers and law enforcement agents urging decriminalisation, unthinkable until recently. &quot;Today, drugs are illegal, they are out of control, and they are everywhere&quot;, said Kristin Daley, projects director for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. &quot;If they were managed in the way that alcohol is, they would be under control. Instead of criminals getting richer, violence escalating and drug-related deaths on the rise, we would live under a system of established pricing, peaceful purchase and a regulated labelling system.&quot; But they remain wary in Tijuana. Before the drug war, this border city was a capital of vice tourism, which has now disappeared. Tijuana lies opposite San Diego, from where most of those seeking prostitutes and other distractions came, and where a letter recently appeared in the local Union Tribune newspaper from Omar Firestone, principal cellist in the Orquesta de Baja California. He warned that the last thing the city needs is &quot;offering sanctuary to American druggies&quot; who will &quot;draw the worst of our society to the streets of Tijuana and increase the flight of those seeking a better life. I guess the cartels needed a government bailout.&quot;", "sentences": ["The prospect of border towns becoming the equivalent of Amsterdam, only with cocaine and heroin freely on sale, was not discussed."], "title": "Is America ready to admit defeat in its 40-year war on drugs?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/sep/06/war-on-drugs-latin-america", "tags": ["Drugs trade", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Argentina", "Bolivia", "Mexico", "Colombia", "Venezuela", "Brazil", "Law", "Americas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-06T23:10:03Z", "article": "The presence of Holland and play-offs in the same sentence still chills Scottish blood six years on from a 6-0 annihilation in Amsterdam that ended their interest in Euro 2004. That they can be legitimately mentioned in the same breath again, when it seemed even George Burley&apos;s employers were at Hampden Park on Saturday to pay their last respects, now represents a lifeline to the besieged Scotland manager. &quot;Seeing those fans lifted has made it all worthwhile for me,&quot; said Burley, as he reflected in ending another torturous week in the job with the most important victory of his international reign. &quot;Now we have to do it all again.&quot; Given it is the unbeaten Dutch who stand between Scotland and a possible place in the World Cup play-offs, the task confronting Burley could not be more onerous. The defeat of Macedonia did little to inflate expectations for his team, who laboured badly until Scott Brown&apos;s header transformed a subdued Scotland and Hampden crowd, and will be without the suspended James McFadden on Wednesday. But at least now there is hope where previously there appeared none. During the qualifying campaign for Euro 2008 the carriages on the train from Glasgow Central out to Mount Florida resounded with the Tartan Army&apos;s colourful repertoire, but the silence of the masses on Saturday offered a more damning assessment of recent results than anything uttered by the SFA president, George Peat. But there was renewed vigour in hoarse voices on the journey back, feeling perhaps they had just witnessed a sea-change in fortune under Burley, rather than any realisation of the manager&apos;s bold vision of how a Scotland team should play. Luck, the absence of which is often a convenient excuse but a valid argument during Burley&apos;s tenure, was certainly on Scotland&apos;s side. In Craig Gordon the Scots boasted the game&apos;s outstanding player and three excellent low saves from the Sunderland goalkeeper were a reflection of talent, not fate. But they were also indebted to a glaring miss from Slavcho Georgievski, while even the mistaken identity that cost McFadden a chance to revive memories of the 1-0 victory over Holland in the first leg of the Euro 2004 play-off paid dividends. McFadden was cautioned for Brown&apos;s unsporting behaviour when the latter won a corner from a bounce ball that Macedonia wanted to concede to Scotland. Cue pandemonium and a loss of focus from the visitors, not that they were in any position to bemoan unsporting actions given their histrionics. Indeed, the bounce ball was awarded after the Macedonia striker, Ilcho Naumoski, reacted to a ball in the face as though felled by a seizure. Had the referee, Wolfgang Stark, booked Brown and not McFadden, however, it would have been the combative Celtic midfielder&apos;s second booking inside two minutes. &quot;They were more riled than us. It was them who were causing the arguments,&quot; insisted the Scotland captain, Darren Fletcher. &quot;They were the team that was angry, it was important for us to keep our calm. We couldn&apos;t afford to go down to 10 men and we kept saying that to each other.&quot; Eleven minutes into the second half, Brown headed his first Scotland goal into the far corner of Jane Nikoloski&apos;s goal and his team-mates were transformed. Alan Hutton, Brown and McFadden suddenly rediscovered the hunger for the ball and the responsibility that has been lacking in this campaign to inspire Scotland&apos;s recovery. Burley&apos;s pre-match assertion that Macedonia are a strong, technically accomplished team with a tendency to lose their shape late in games proved unerringly accurate. &quot;I watched them go two-nil up in Spain against Spain&apos;s full team but I feel they&apos;ve always had a weakness as games go on,&quot; explained Burley. &quot;That gave me the belief that if we kept in there we would have enough strength and passion to overcome them.&quot; Scotland overcame with a flourish. McFadden, collecting the ball inside his own half, swept past Veliche Shumulikoski with 10 minutes remaining, ignored two inviting passes to nutmeg the Macedonia captain, Goce Sedloski, then rounded the keeper for a glorious second. One of those rarities for supporters, a goal they can start to celebrate before the ball is in the net. In an instant, McFadden&apos;s earlier, awful miss was forgotten, so too the initial rustiness of David Weir and Stephen McManus in central defence and the mountainous task still to come. Burley ran from the touchline to the dug-out without his feet appearing to touch the ground. He deserved the release. &quot;The last week did not distract me at all,&quot; insisted the Scotland manager. &quot;I&apos;ve been a manager a long time and I know I&apos;ll get criticism but I&apos;ve nothing to prove. I got the job because I&apos;ve done it and a lot of people don&apos;t realise that and don&apos;t give me respect. I can&apos;t stop that, but it was an honour for me to get the Scotland job and I am totally committed.&quot; Man of the match Craig Gordon The Scotland keeper made a string of fine saves to thwart Macedonia, and in particular their danger man, Goran Pandev, while the scores were level and dominated his area.

This explains why he still holds a lucrative post at the age of 63. The England manager&apos;s praise for his men is firmest when anyone suggests an alteration. &quot;[Glen] Johnson is one of the best right-backs in the world,&quot; Capello said on Saturday. &quot;This is my opinion,&quot; he added, staring down the sceptics. It would be unlike him to shock anyone with his team selection for Wednesday&apos;s qualifier against Croatia at Wembley, where victory will clinch a place at the 2010 World Cup finals. There is conviction in Capello&apos;s appraisal of the squad and a rickety victory over Slovenia in a friendly cannot unsettle him. When a person&apos;s judgments are as reliable as his, this is a boon. Unkind as it is to rake over Steve McClaren&apos;s tenure, there is value in remembering how his changes of tack took England on to the rocks. Defeats by Croatia stopped the side from going to Euro 2008. The first came in Zagreb, where he abruptly opted for a back three. McClaren quite often made that particular switch at Middlesbrough, but the squad there were used to it. The effect on England was harmful. In the home match with Slaven Bilic&apos;s side, McClaren felt moved to give the goalkeeper Scott Carson his first competitive outing. Misery ensued. Capello is old-fashioned in his fairly consistent belief that it ought to be tough to break into the line-up. Eight of the men who started against Slovenia are 28 or over. At 25, Glen Johnson can therefore be classified as a young buck. His defending is sometimes gauche and Nejc Pecnik outfoxed him in the 84th minute to send in the cross from which Zlatan Ljubijankic scored after getting in front of the substitute Joleon Lescott. Ditching Johnson would not, in theory, be difficult since Wes Brown was trusted enough to be Capello&apos;s right-back when Croatia were swamped 4-1 in Zagreb. However, he has only lately recovered fitness at Manchester United and was confined to the bench at Wembley. Capello was in the mood to applaud Johnson doggedly, even though his opposite number Matjaz Kek admitted that Slovenia&apos;s plan had been to exploit the space he leaves when pushing so far downfield. There were no reservations from Capello about the trial to come against Croatia. &quot;I think it will be [Niko] Kranjcar who will be worried about Johnson,&quot; said the manager, who also ranked the Liverpool full-back among the best on the planet &quot;defensively&quot;. Johnson&apos;s capacities in attack may be what matter when England are seeking to beat Croatia, although we could also see him receiving a little more cover than he had on Saturday. The diversion into a debate over Johnson or anyone else is not tolerated just when England have almost completed the journey to the World Cup. Emile Heskey&apos;s showing against Slovenia had overtones of his lacklustre form at Aston Villa, but Capello reaffirmed the point that he opens up space for Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. The manager is unlikely to reconsider now, even though Jermain Defoe did score after coming on for the second half. The Tottenham attacker racked up an eighth goal in his last nine outings for England after an exchange of passes with fellow substitute Aaron Lennon and a quickly taken drive that deflected off Aleksander Radosavljevic in the 63rd minute. Capello was not overwhelmed. &quot;Perhaps he would be tired if he played from the first minute,&quot; the manager jested. Capello has allowed Defoe to start a competitive match on a single occasion and the forward was removed at the interval in Barcelona last September, when the match with Andorra was goalless. Fielding him at kick-off on Wednesday in preference to Heskey would be more than a tweak. It would require England to play in a different style. Any such experiments will surely be postponed until a spot at the World Cup finals is clinched. Capello was exasperated that patterns of movement practiced in training were not used against Slovenia, but the team performed to a tolerable level and might have had other goals, with John Terry coming close as he headed a corner against the bar. There were minor exercises that appeared to be valued by Capello. James Milner, who made his debut in Amsterdam, was brought on so that he could be studied in the wholly different circumstances of a home game. It might be better to ponder such matters than reflect on England&apos;s opener. Rooney went down in an incident where he seemed to be fouling Bostjan Cesar and appealed for a penalty. His wish was granted by the referee Jonas Eriksson. Frank Lampard converted the kick after 31 minutes and an injured Cesar could not continue.

Sort of. Just 34 minutes remained in what would have been the world champions&apos; fourth game without a goal when the Georgia captain, Kakha Kaladze, diverted an Angelo Palombo strike past his own goalkeeper. Eleven minutes later he repeated the trick, this time slotting the ball in at the near post off a cross from Domenico Criscito. It finished 2-0, and though the first goal was officially attributed to Palombo, there was little doubt that Kaladze&apos;s intervention had been crucial. &quot;One and a half own goals&quot;, was how Gazzetta dello Sport delicately put it. The goals had eventually arrived but whether they would have done without Kaladze&apos;s accidental assistance is open to debate. Italy were far from convincing going forward and had not even managed a shot on target until early in the second half. The fact it was Kaladze, a Milan player, who made such a decisive contribution has inevitably caused eyebrows to be raised. In the wake of Calciopoli some observers feel Italian football has lost the right to be presumed innocent. That is a pretty unfair situation for Kaladze \u2013 who was playing his first game back after a seven-month injury lay-off and is hardly the first player to put past his keeper twice in a match. The Georgian press, while not levelling any accusations, were hardly sympathetic. &quot;In truth, Kaladze has never been an idol in Georgia,&quot; wrote one columnist in Msoklio Sport. &quot;He has not been that impressive for the national team.&quot; But if it was a bad day at the office for Kaladze then it was just the latest in a series of them for Italy going forward. Before Palombo&apos;s goal they had gone 327 minutes without a goal \u2013 taking in defeats to Egypt and Brazil at the Confederations Cup and a goalless draw with Switzerland in a friendly last month. On paper the problem would appear to lie with the team&apos;s frontmen. Although Italy have scored 11 goals in seven qualifiers so far, only four of those have come from the men playing up front. That is a poor return for a group with plenty of goalscoring pedigree. Luca Toni has 38 goals in 56 league games for Bayern Munich and before that hit 47 in 67 for Fiorentina; Alberto Gilardino managed 19 in 33 for Fiorentina last year and Giampaolo Pazzini 11 in 19 after moving to Sampdoria in January. The other four strikers used in qualifying \u2013 Giuseppe Rossi, Fabio Quagliarella, Antonio Di Natale and Vincenzo Iaquinta can point to similarly impressive figures throughout their club careers. Indeed, Marcello Lippi&apos;s problems may stem in part from the fact he is spoilt for choice. By using seven different strikers in as many games, Lippi has denied his team the opportunity to develop any sort of consistency and understanding \u2013 though it must be said his hand has often been forced by injuries. In reality, though, the greater problems may lie further back with a midfield that no longer boasts the creativity to provide the front line with opportunities. Against Georgia Lippi abandoned 4-3-3 in favour of a 4-4-2 but while the new formation helped to shore up a defence that had been badly exposed down the flanks in South Africa, it was no more effective going forward. Mauro Camoranesi (and perhaps the injured Claudio Marchisio) aside, Italy lack natural wingers and the supply of balls from wide was sporadic. Inside, both Palombo and Andrea Pirlo struggled to retain possession against opponents with far greater energy. Pirlo&apos;s increasingly lethargic performances on the national stage have not gone unnoticed. Lippi&apos;s claim that the midfielder is short of full fitness might have sounded more convincing had the player not been similarly subdued in so many other games for Italy over the past 12 months. A refusal to be hurried when in possession that was once viewed as admirable is threatening to make him a liability against any team willing to close down rapidly and apply pressure in the middle of the park. Lippi&apos;s immediate solution to this \u2013 if today&apos;s reports are to be believed \u2013 has been to move Pirlo away from his deep-lying role and into a position behind the attack for Wednesday&apos;s game against Bulgaria. Certainly Italy could do with someone linking play in that part of the field. Asked after the game how he could persist with a team lacking a fantasista, Lippi insisted his team already had one \u2013 the goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. The question had been a loaded one, of course \u2013 a great portion of the Italian media have been campaigning for months now to have Antonio Cassano called up. Polls conducted by national papers suggest the majority of Italian fans want the same thing, though it is clear at this stage that Lippi has no intention of heeding them. Fabio Cannavaro was quick to dismiss criticisms, claiming Italy have always played scrappy football but won on the basis of a strong defence. Lippi pointed to the fact that during the qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup, his side had scraped past Moldova 1-0 away from home only with the help of Buffon \u2013 who made a stunning save to keep out one header on Saturday \u2013 and had lost in Slovenia. Neither point is without justification, but neither paints a full picture. The results mentioned by Lippi were more than offset by impressive showings in a 4-1 friendly win over Germany and a 3-1 triumph over Holland in Amsterdam. Even the 2-1 win over Ireland in Dublin was achieved with a degree of confidence that has been lacking so far in the current campaign. Lippi pointed out that other big teams \u2013 such as Argentina, France and Portugal \u2013 are enduring far greater struggles. That much is true, and a home win over Bulgaria on Wednesday would leave Italy four points clear at the top of Group Eight with two games to play. To get that, though, someone is probably going to have to work out how to score more than half a goal.", "sentences": ["The results mentioned by Lippi were more than offset by impressive showings in a 4-1 friendly win over Germany and a 3-1 triumph over Holland in Amsterdam."], "title": "Italy's scoring crisis continues despite win in Georgia | Paolo Bandini", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/07/italy-world-cup-georgia-bulgaria", "tags": ["Italy", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-08T21:10:39Z", "article": "Holland are set to pitch in an inexperienced goalkeeper and, in doing so, offer a glimmer of hope to Scotland before tonight&apos;s pivotal World Cup qualifier at Hampden Park.

History tells him that Holland can be beaten at Hampden Park tonight. If they are not, he may be consigned to it. Nothing in the 53-year-old&apos;s career prepared him for the glare and fierce criticism of the international spotlight. However, the experience of being told he would never play again, as a young man at Ipswich Town, and then enduring three play-off failures while manager at Portman Road, has given Burley a perfect grounding for Group Nine&apos;s final match. The task ahead of Scotland is a huge one, against runaway group leaders who are aiming for their first 100% qualification record. The Scottish Football Association has left little doubt over the manager&apos;s fate should the national team fall at the last hurdle once again. But Burley has come out fighting. &quot;As a player in 1981 I tore my cruciate ligament and cartilage and was told by Dr David Dandy, the top knee specialist in the world then, that I would never play again. A year later I was at the World Cup in Spain,&quot; said the Scotland manager, who is in training for next year&apos;s London Marathon as part of his fundraising efforts for Brain Tumour UK. &quot;I missed out on three play-offs with Ipswich before winning promotion with the fourth and finishing fifth in the Premier League the following year. I was written off as Scotland manager before this campaign had even started, and after one defeat people were saying we wouldn&apos;t qualify. It has been a tough challenge, but here we are with one game to go and everything still to play for. &quot;Football is a test of character, just as life is. Everything is a tester, but I have been fortunate to be involved in football all my life. I have no complaints. I have a great family, the best wife in the world. It has been an honour to manage my country and if we show passion and courage and belief and bravery \u2013 everything that is good about Scotland \u2013 we can beat Holland.&quot; Burley has rarely appeared so impressive in public as the Scotland manager before, but even if he repeats that address to his players at Hampden Park tonight, fine words alone will not reduce the chasm in quality between the two teams. Typically, Scottish preparations that had been relatively serene, in comparison to the build-up to recent matches, have now been disrupted by an injury to Craig Gordon, the goalkeeper who was invaluable against Macedonia on Saturday but who now has a thigh strain. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be against playing him with the injury,&quot; said Burley. A fitness test is scheduled for the Sunderland player this morning. &quot;If he can do his goalkeeping work, that is the key. We can get someone to do the kicking for him if needs be. He is such a key member of the team.&quot; Gordon was absent when the Dutch cruised to a 3-0 win at the Amsterdam Arena in March. So too, cynics might say, were the defenders who did play. A promising 30 minutes disintegrated into a torturous final hour as Mark van Bommel orchestrated Holland&apos;s advances and Arjen Robben spread mayhem among the visiting defence. Burley said that the scars of that night \u2013 and those from the 6-0 defeat in the same stadium that shattered Scottish hopes of a place at Euro 2004 \u2013 have been forgotten. &quot;There is no danger of Scotland having an inferiority complex at all,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to win it more, we are desperate to win it and we believe we can win it. Holland have won the group and I don&apos;t know if that will affect their mentality but we have certainly got to be positive and make it a difficult evening for them. &quot;The players are looking forward to it. It is a massive game for them, a one-off.

People are in the throes of hope once again, fending off thoughts of the trouble that ensues whenever England fly off to a World Cup. This time you don&apos;t have to be gullible to believe that the 2010 tournament will be different. Transformation already has been achieved under the Italian. It sometimes seems that false dawns are the only kind of light that shines on England. No fearful fan could look at the 5-1 win over Croatia without thinking of the same euphoric score against Germany in Munich eight years ago and the anti-climax that ensued at the 2002 World Cup. There is a remorselessness to Capello that makes him as infuriated by a player&apos;s lapse in stoppage time as he would be if the mistake had occurred when the outcome hung in the balance. Irascibility, of course, is commonplace, although it is more common among those whose teams are failing. Capello also has a bond with the group he leads. The aloofness was set aside when he winked at the people on the bench after Frank Lampard had scored the third on Wednesday night. The footballers are enjoying life even if the England environment is now a strict one. The manager has recreated the ambition and professionalism expected by the many players who take it for granted each year that their teams will be genuine challengers in the Champions League. For them, the transition from club to country is now seamless. It is silly, for instance, to suppose that people who work under, say, Sir Alex Ferguson or Rafael Ben\u00edtez would be upset by the occasional severity of Capello. More likely they nod in recognition when he is at his most uncompromising. Capello, too, creates a challenging environment because his meritocratic instincts run deep. On a practical level, it is to his benefit if he can send out footballers who are accustomed to being in the thick of the battle for honours with their clubs, but he primarily treats people according to their contribution. A \u00a322m transfer from Everton to Manchester City, for instance, has not transformed Joleon Lescott in Capello&apos;s eyes. His value seemed to dip after he was partly to blame, as a substitute, when Slovenia scored in last Saturday&apos;s friendly. The manager did not find a place for Lescott on the bench for the game with Croatia. His preference at present is for the stolid Matthew Upson when Rio Ferdinand is unavailable, even if he is at financially beleaguered West Ham rather than affluent City. Conclusions of that sort come naturally to Capello. It must baffle him that the continuing omission of Michael Owen is treated as if it were noteworthy. He has amassed two goals so far in 2009. Since 19 August Jermain Defoe has scored four for Tottenham Hotspur alone. Capello must be the least enigmatic manager there has ever been. All the same, he now enters a different phase in the job. A commonsense approach has scattered all foes, but there are harder times to come. Many nations dread the tiredness of footballers who go to the World Cup after a hard programme in domestic football. The Premier League is usually considered more attritional than the club campaign in other countries and it is there that the England players, with the exception of David Beckham, earn their living. There will be exertion as they acclimatise to the altitude at which some games will be played during the World Cup finals. It does not come readily to England in sapping conditions to keep possession and recuperate in spells when they lower the pace of a match. Until now, Capello has sanctioned the headstrong football with which his team has overrun opponents. He has sought to make his squad more alert, but appreciates that they will tend to falter if they are not playing at full throttle. Somehow or other, an adjustment will have to be made. Capello knows that and, to an extent, the friendlies have had an importance they seldom held for his predecessors. England did win in Berlin, but had lost to France and Spain before they rallied from 2-0 down to claim a draw in Amsterdam last month. The formalities, following Wednesday&apos;s victory, are now being completed for a meeting with Brazil, who head the world rankings, in Doha on 14 November. After that, in his mind, Italy will be the only members of the elite he has not faced. Capello may be the one manager who discovers the truth about his team in friendlies. He bears little resemblance to the great majority of his predecessors, but he will also engineer one of England&apos;s most cogent bids for the World Cup.", "sentences": ["England did win in Berlin, but had lost to France and Spain before they rallied from 2-0 down to claim a draw in Amsterdam last month."], "title": "Fabio Capello determined there will be no more false dawns for England | Kevin McCarra", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/10/fabio-capello-england-world-cup-2010", "tags": ["Fabio Capello", "England", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-12T23:10:03Z", "article": "Barcelona won the Champions League with unanswerable majesty, but as if to make it more interesting this time round, Pep Guardiola, the all-conquering rookie coach, has exchanged the speed and directness of Samuel Eto&apos;o for the more static and egocentric talents of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Camp Nou has always been a casino. Guardiola may never be this powerful again. He entered the new campaign parading Bar\u00e7a&apos;s unprecedented haul from his debut year: Champions League, La Liga, Copa del Rey. This blitz, which prompted Real Madrid to shake the money tree to its roots, entitled Catalonia&apos;s latest saint to stick to the same formula for 2009-10. Instead, Guardiola imported tactical change and an awkward personality. The first major test is Ibrahimovic&apos;s return to Inter on Wednesday night, six weeks after Eto&apos;o moved in the opposite direction from Barcelona to San Siro. This player swap would have been big enough news already without the \u00a340m Barcelona had to add on top to bring European football&apos;s great enigma to Spain. Eto&apos;o had scored 108 times in 145 outings for the Blaugrana. In return, they took possession of a 27-year-old Swede who divides the sages into worshippers and indignant disbelievers, of whom Martin O&apos;Neill, the Aston Villa manager, is one. &quot;Good grief, he is the most overrated player on the planet,&quot; exclaimed O&apos;Neill in his pundit&apos;s role at the last World Cup. Rather in the John Jensen tradition of I-was-there-when-he-scored T-shirt making, there are people who swear they have seen the giant-but-dexterous Ibrahimovic excel in a big game. He scored his second goal in two games for his new club in Barcelona&apos;s 2-0 win away at Getafe last night. The disdain is largely confined to games involving English clubs, in which &quot;Ibracadabra&quot;, as he was known in Italy, has a history of going walkabout. But there is such a welter of evidence in the opposing camp \u2013 including Barcelona&apos;s willingness to stump up \u00a340m in cash \u2013 that it feels perverse to keep thinking last season&apos;s top scorer in Serie A is a self-obsessed impostor. How can it be so, when the European champions have built a new forward line around him, when he was voted the best player in the Italian league in 2008, when some of the game&apos;s biggest names constantly compare him to Marco van Basten? Fabio Capello, the England coach who helped him to two league titles at Juventus, told Italy&apos;s La Repubblica: &quot;When Zlatan arrived in Italy he was a rough diamond. But now he is very complete, the best striker in the world and impossible to mark inside the penalty area. I know comparing Van Basten to Ibrahimovic is like comparing Picasso to Rothko, but I believe that because of his power and his technique Zlatan will become stronger than Marco. &quot;Zlatan needed to learn and mature, but he&apos;s an intelligent lad. He also has an incredible gift for maintaining his position, freeing himself from defenders and at the same time seeing a pass, a space or a chance to shoot. What Van Basten and Ibra have in common is their natural elegance. We&apos;re talking about giants who are like poetry in motion.&quot; Ibrahimovic was born in Malmo to a Bosnian father and Croatian mother. He joined his local club at 13 and left after Malmo had been relegated, moving to the great Ajax finishing school for \u00a35.5m in 2001. But he always stood outside the herd. He was described as &quot;a shit&quot; by Milan&apos;s Alessandro Nesta and drew this stinging review from his headmaster, Agneta Cederbom, who once said: &quot;I have been at this school for 33 years and he is easily in the top five of the most unruly pupils we have had during that time. A one-man show. Completely outstanding in his field, and a prototype of the kind of child which ends up in serious trouble. And I think things could have gone horribly wrong if it hadn&apos;t been for the football.&quot; Ibrahimovic left Ajax for Juventus for \u20ac16m and, after serving two years with Capello at the Turin club from 2004-2006, he joined Inter when Juve were relegated for their part in the great Serie\u00a0A match-fixing scandal. There, he agreed with the directors that the only club Inter could sell him to was Barcelona, where a record 60,000 Catalans turned up to see him introduced. On that day in late July, the club&apos;s president, Joan Laporta, said: &quot;He is not a conformist, he is ambitious, a winner, an authentic man with strong feelings and he wanted to come to Barcelona.&quot; Thierry Henry said: &quot;Whichever ball you throw at him, he will keep it. What I like about him is his character. I know for some people it is too much, but I don&apos;t mind. To be a player like he is, you need to have it sometimes.&quot; In a major study of Ibrahimovic&apos;s growth from enfant terrible to aristocrat striker, Sweden&apos;s Offside magazine recalled the day Lazio&apos;s Dejan Stankovic was watching a 2001 pre-season friendly between Ajax and Milan, and turned to a team-mate \u2013 as Paolo Maldini struggled against Ibrahimovic \u2013 to ask: &quot;Who is this phenomenon?&quot; Scouting reports all noted the unusual convergence of power and skill. Ivica Kurtovic, who coached him at his first childhood club, FBK Balkan, said: &quot;He was completely fearless on the field. He put his head straight in where the others didn&apos;t dare put their finger. [At nine] he was very forward and hungry. Many of the boys could have been as good as Zlatan. What tipped the scale in his favour was his attitude to the game. A few of them missed training but Zlatan wanted more. I often saw him in his garden playing football on his own when I rode my bicycle home during those years.&quot; In Rosengard, where he grew up, Ibrahimovic has paid for a rubberised surface, golden goals, and lights at the small practice ground where he learned to be adroit in tight spaces. He posted a plaque, which reads: &quot;Here is my heart, here is my history, here is my play. Take it further.&quot; &quot;You had to run less, but you had a lot of time on the ball, and I like a lot of time with the ball,&quot; he said. &quot;The margins are very small, and it makes you think what you have to do with the ball on a bigger pitch.&quot; Then, he was known as a volatile type with no patience, inconsistent, self-absorbed. That reputation followed him to and from Amsterdam, where the coach David Endt said: &quot;At Ajax we&apos;re very good at discovering talent, but you have to use talent in a functional way. Sometimes that&apos;s hard to accept for players who know they&apos;re good. Ibrahimovic had a magic touch and my first thought was: &apos;Here&apos;s the new Van Basten.&apos; I thought: &apos;I&apos;ll have to keep this to myself.&apos; No player should have to be under that kind of pressure.&quot; Co Adriaanse, another Ajax coach, said: &quot;Here, Zlatan was a very difficult person, an introvert who was thinking only of himself. He&apos;d got something wrong in his head. I couldn&apos;t get any contact with him. David Endt tried to get contact with him as well, but it was hard to reach Zlatan&apos;s heart.&quot; Tommy Soderberg, the Sweden coach, prescribed patience and told the Ajax staff that Ibrahimovic &quot;didn&apos;t trust anybody&quot; but would respond to careful handling. At Inter, where he was an automatic starter for Roberto Mancini and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Ibrahimovic shed much of his reputation for turbulence and unreliability, and it may be that Guardiola has gambled at just the right point. Certainly, Ibrahimovic&apos;s self-critique of two years ago chimes with the theory that he is a misunderstood master of the striker&apos;s art: a thinker who can see geometrical possibilities to which others are blind. &quot;I&apos;m very quick because I can see still pictures in my mind during the game,&quot; he said. &quot;When I&apos;m playing I can see things no one else can see, and it&apos;s still in my head five seconds later. They are pictures of what&apos;s going to happen on the pitch and what I&apos;m going to do next. I didn&apos;t have them when I was younger but when the play reached a more serious level they started turning up. When the play was getting quicker I had to try to find the right solutions.&quot; While Inter and Bar\u00e7a lock antlers, last season&apos;s beaten finalists, Manchester United, face a less glamorous assignment at Besiktas. This week Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on the 2-0 defeat at the Stadio Olimpico in May, in which Eto&apos;o scored Barcelona&apos;s first after 10 minutes. &quot;When you look at these things you can find reasons or excuses, and it&apos;s always better to look at the reasons,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;I&apos;ve watched the game since and I&apos;m quite clear about where we went wrong. That&apos;s always helpful. If there are good reasons you can put a lot of things to the back of your mind and get on with your life. If it was a case of not finding any reasons at all then we would be worried.&quot; Ferguson craves a rematch with Guardiola: &quot;Absolutely. I&apos;d love another final. That was the first Champions League final I had lost and obviously it was very disappointing, but it&apos;s over. There&apos;s no point kicking yourself all summer over it, and I haven&apos;t. You can&apos;t win &apos;em all, bad days come along, put it behind you and move on.&quot; Barcelona had good days \u2013 the best days in their history, some think \u2013 but moved on, too, from Eto&apos;o to Ibrahimovic.

As the car pulled up at the huge, heavily guarded gates, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck bristle. Memories came flooding back. Twenty years ago I had asked myself how long I would be here: would I ever see my children again? In the 1980s, I served a sentence at Yeserias prison in Madrid, once the most notorious women&apos;s jail in Europe. This time I was in Alicante, on the set of a film about my ex-husband, the drug smuggler Howard Marks. &quot;This is too realistic,&quot; I mumbled to the director, Bernard Rose. In the distance, I could see Rhys Ifans, hunched over, handcuffed and dressed in prison attire, looking just like Howard. The new film, Mr Nice, is based on books Howard and I both wrote. I have yet to see the finished result (it will be released next year), but it will be strange seeing our lives \u2013 and our children&apos;s \u2013 up there on the screen. As a director, Rose is best known for the horror film Candyman and the romantic Beethoven biopic, Immortal Beloved. Horror and romance: very apt. The film charts Howard&apos;s childhood in Wales, his Oxford days, and his life on the run as Britain&apos;s most wanted man, with me at his side. He was on the run when we met \u2013 I was madly attracted to him. We embarked on a life of smuggling hashish and marijuana around the world. The US Drug Enforcement Administration arrested us at our home in Mallorca, in front of our three young children. We were extradited to the US and put in prison in Miami. All of this is in the film. Howard, the kids and I all have cameo roles. Rose thought it would be amusing for me to play a US immigration official, the one who let Howard be escorted into the US without a visa. Rhys and I found it impossible to make eye contact during this scene. I felt strange playing the baddie. For years I&apos;ve been asked who I&apos;d want to play me if there were a movie about our lives. I can think of many great British actresses \u2013 Helena Bonham-Carter, Kate Winslet, Anna Friel \u2013 but somehow I could never envisage them playing me. Initially, I was surprised by Rose&apos;s choice of Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, an American. But my children kept telling me how cool she was. I was nervous about meeting her and, according to Rhys, she was equally nervous about meeting me. But we discovered we had much in common: we both had a middle-class upbringing, we were raised as Catholics, we have the same star sign (Scorpio), we made our own clothes as kids, we had a teenage love affair with hallucinogens and dope (giving up in our early 20s). I didn&apos;t watch Sevigny on set. I felt it would inhibit her: many of the scenes shot in Alicante were emotionally charged. She told me she regretted not meeting me earlier, when they were filming in Wales, as she would have played me stronger. I took that as a compliment, though I&apos;m worried she made me look too weak. Rhys was a brilliant choice for Howard, and not just because he&apos;s Welsh. He has Howard&apos;s intelligence, charm and looks (in his black wig) \u2013 as well as his devilry. They both like drinking. David Thewlis, who plays an IRA man, told me he is often mistaken for Rhys: &quot;Twice a week, people come up to me and say &apos;You were great in Notting Hill.&apos;&quot; His partner Anna Friel winked at me and said: &quot;David&apos;s so much uglier.&quot; He was reading a copy of Mr Nice. I gave him my book, Mr Nice and Mrs Marks, and told him to read it instead \u2013 it&apos;s by far the better book. Howard and I overlapped on set by a day, which was always going to be interesting (it is four years since our divorce). In the end, I needn&apos;t have worried: when I arrived, I was told Howard was &quot;preoccupied&quot;. Rose and Luc Roeg, the producer, were relieved to see me, thinking I&apos;d somehow be able to &quot;sort Howard out&quot;. It was a role I had played all our married life. Our son Patrick and I got him to a tapas bar, made him eat and slowed down his drinking. To Roeg&apos;s relief, we got him to bed by midnight; there was a shoot early the next morning, in which Howard was to play an Amsterdam coffee shop owner. After Patrick and I had returned home to Mallorca, I received a very penitent message from Howard. He said he had remained &quot;otherwise preoccupied&quot; for days, before coming to his senses in the middle of &quot;an incredibly huge and noisy march in the middle of Lahore&quot;. There are some aspects of life with Howard I don&apos;t miss at all.", "sentences": ["To Roeg&apos;s relief, we got him to bed by midnight; there was a shoot early the next morning, in which Howard was to play an Amsterdam coffee shop owner."], "title": "Judy Marks: the day I went back to being Mrs Nice", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/13/judy-marks-interview", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Howard Marks"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-15T15:39:34Z", "article": "Once America was in thrall to the Marlboro man. The hard-smoking cowboy, staring moodily from his horse at a far-off horizon, became a visual icon that symbolised a certain kind of freedom and - not coincidentally - helped sell millions of cigarettes.  But now America&apos;s smokers are groaning - or should that be wheezing - under a flood of new measures designed to make them give up their habit. Or at the very least driving it from public view and turning it into something furtively done in private.  New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has announced plans to try and ban smoking in the city&apos;s public parks, already adding to a hefty 2002 ban that has chased smoking from it&apos;s offices, restaurants and bars. That would see the Big Apple take on one of the most ambitious urban anti-smoking bans in the world, forbidding its citizens from lighting up on hundreds of city parks and 14 miles of beaches.  But the New York move is actually just the tip of an iceberg of anti-smoking policies that are now sweeping across the whole country spreading from rental cars to the army to people&apos;s homes.  From next month Avis and Budget will be the first major American car rental companies to ban smokers from puffing away in their vehicles, charging cleaning fees of up to $250 for those who flout the rules.  Chicago has already taken its ban outside by forbidding smoking on its beaches and playgrounds. In California the small city of Belmont, just outside San Francisco, has even banned it in its apartment buildings, marking the first real advance of anti-smoking laws into people&apos;s personal homes.  Perhaps the biggest recent shock has been a survey commissioned by the Pentagon which has argued that smoking should be banned in the military. Though few changes are expected soon in the army, the idea of stopping American soldiers from lighting up in a combat zone after a firefight triggered a wave of headlines.  Yet it is still New York that is on the front lines of America&apos;s new anti-smoking wars. The city celebrates itself for its global reputation for hard partying, tolerance of everyone&apos;s lifestyle and rabid individualism, yet Bloomberg has successfully made the Big Apple&apos;s smokers one of the few social groups that it is acceptable to ostracize.  On Monday Bloomberg - a former smoker - himself admitted that he personally gives smokers he sees &quot;a not particularly nice look&quot; as he walks by them hunkered together outside buildings.  His comments appeared to be aimed at encouraging other New Yorkers to do likewise.  &quot;Social pressure really does work,&quot; Bloomberg said. It certainly seems to have made New York smokers into a fairly subdued bunch as they faced yet further limits on their habit.  Hurrying across New York&apos;s Madison Square park - one of the areas where a ban would come into place - Janaria Kelly shrugged off the news even as he clutched a lighted cigarette in his hand.  &quot;They have already banned it in so many other places, that it won&apos;t make much difference,&quot; said the 43-year-old salesman. Kelly added that he understood, and even sympathised with the reasons for the ban. &quot;Smoking is my choice, but I know it is bad for me, so I get why they are doing it,&quot; he said.  That is music to the ears of the anti-smoking movement. Some reports have shown that smoking-related healthcare costs are almost $100bn a year at a time when governments face spiralling healthcare costs.  Bloomberg, and many others, have made it clear that they see smoking as expensive to society as a whole, not just as a private habit for the individual, and thus have not shied away from draconian measures that would be hard to impose on other products.  But smoking rights groups have made no secret of their horror at the latest moves, equating it with a loss of individual freedom being imposed on the public from above.  &quot;The American public is not asking for this. It is coming from government and non-government groups and it is attacking basic individual rights of freedom,&quot; said Maryetta Ables, president of Forces International, a conservative group that campaigns on issues of personal freedom in smoking and eating and other consumer choices.  But Ables admitted that the current climate in the US seemed to indicate that her group was fighting a losing battle at the moment. &quot;There is going to be more of this sort of thing to come,&quot; she said.  That did not seem to bother Paul Collins, 39, another smoker lighting up in Madison Square park as he recovered from the stresses of his morning commute into the city.  &quot;If they do it, they do it,&quot; he said with an air of resignation &quot;The smoking ban in bars was actually good for me. I cut down a bit. So I don&apos;t really mind,&quot; he said. That is not the fighting spirit among smokers that the Marlboro man was meant to encourage. But then the Marlboro man is perhaps not the best smoking symbol anymore. Several of the rugged cowboys used as models in the campaign contracted lung cancer and became anti-smoking campaigners. Leading the way \u2022 New York banned smoking in most restaurants in 1995, followed by workplaces and indoor public places in 2003, three years before such bans in Scotland and four years before England and Wales. The Department of Health in England says it has no plans to extend smoke-free areas, saying such moves are up to local authorities. \u2022 Smoking was banned on Sydney&apos;s Bondi beach in 2004, after similar prohibitions on dogs, ball games and frisbees. Soon after, the council restricted alcohol consumption on the beach. \u2022 Amsterdam&apos;s coffee shops, where marijuana is often available, were not exempted from a smoking ban.

The compensation deal for the victims of toxic oil waste dumping in west Africa \u2013 likely to be confirmed imminently \u2013 means the full extent of attempts to cover up what really happened can be spelled out for the first time. The truth is laid bare in Trafigura&apos;s hitherto secret documents, published by the Guardian today. The company&apos;s internal emails show the true nature of the toxic waste dumped around Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast. Trafigura had publicly claimed the waste was harmless. The exposure of the company files has contributed to Trafigura&apos;s climbdown after three years of bitterly contested legal battles. We are publishing them online today. Martyn Day is a senior partner at the British law firm Leigh Day, which has brought one of the biggest group actions in legal history, seeking damages of \u00a3100m. He said today in Abidjan, where he has been negotiating the settlement: &quot;The claimants are very pleased.&quot; He was in the process of putting a global deal to the victims, he said. &quot;The sum being discussed is based on the range of short-term symptoms claimed by our clients.&quot; Thousands of west Africans besieged local hospitals, and a number died, in 2006 after the dumping of hundreds of tons of highly toxic oil waste around Abidjan. Official local autopsy reports on 12 alleged victims showed fatal levels of the poisonous gas hydrogen sulphide, one of the waste&apos;s lethal byproducts. The traders have been publicly insisting for three years that their waste was routine and harmless. They claim it was &quot;absolutely not dangerous&quot;. They have until now denied the compensation claims, and their lawyers repeatedly threatened anyone worldwide who sought to contradict their version. They launched a libel case against BBC Newsnight, forced a &quot;correction&quot; from the Times, demanded the Guardian deleted articles, and yesterday tried to gag journalists in the Netherlands and Norway with legal threats. But dozens of damning internal Trafigura emails have now come to light. They reveal how London-based company employers were told in advance that their planned chemical operation, a cheap and dirty process called &quot;caustic washing&quot;, generated such dangerous wastes it was widely outlawed. Claude Dauphin, the managing director, was told by the London manager, Naeem Ahmed, on 28 December 2005: &quot;Caustic washes are banned by most countries due to the hazardous nature of the waste (mercaptans, phenols, smell) \u2026 there are not many facilities remaining in the market. There is a company in Rotterdam that burns such waste in a high stack chimney and charges are approximately $200/kg.&quot; An email from Ahmed the previous day to the head of gasoline trading spelled out: &quot;US/Singapore and European terminals no longer allow the use of caustic soda washes since local environmental agencies do not allow disposal of the toxic caustic after treatment.&quot; Transport of such toxic waste across EU borders was outlawed, he told his bosses. It was illegal to dump it on any EU landfill. The London-based traders pressed on regardless, the documents reveal. They hoped to make profits of $7m a time by buying up what they called &quot;bloody cheap&quot; cargoes of sulphur-contaminated Mexican gasoline. They decided to try and process the fuel on board a tanker anchored offshore, creating toxic waste they called &quot;slops&quot;. One trader wrote, on 10 March 2006: &quot;I don&apos;t know how we dispose of the slops and I don&apos;t imply we would dump them, but for sure, there must be some way to pay someone to take them.&quot; The resulting black, stinking, slurry was eventually dumped around landfills in Abidjan, after Trafigura paid an unqualified local man to take it away in tanker trucks at a cheap rate. Trafigura&apos;s libel lawyers, Carter-Ruck, recently demanded the Guardian deleted published articles, saying it was &quot;gravely defamatory&quot; and &quot;untrue&quot; to say Trafigura&apos;s waste had been dumped cheaply and could have caused deaths and serious injuries. Both the Dutch paper Volkskrant and Norwegian TV said they were yesterday also threatened with gagging actions. Trafigura launched a libel action against BBC Newsnight, complaining Trafigura had been wrongly accused of causing deaths, disfigurement and miscarriages, and had &quot;suffered serious damage to their reputation&quot;. The BBC filed a fighting defence this week, accusing Trafigura of knowing its chemicals were &quot;highly toxic, potentially lethal and posed a serious risk to public health&quot;. The BBC also alleges a cover-up, saying Trafigura&apos;s denials &quot;lack credibility and candour&quot;. Newsnight plans to transmit another programme on the subject on BBC2 tonight. The UN human rights special rapporteur Professor Okechukwu Ibeanu criticised Trafigura for potentially &quot;stifling independent reporting and public criticism&quot; in a report the oil traders tried and failed to prevent being published in Geneva this week. The report said Ibeanu &quot;views with great concern reports that the company has filed or threatened to file lawsuits against various civil society and media institutions that have reported \u2026 in a critical manner&quot;. He wrote: &quot;According to official estimates, there were 15 deaths, 69 persons hospitalised and more than 108,000 medical consultations \u2026 there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping.&quot; The report is written in cautious terms, but Trafigura&apos;s lobbyists, Bell Pottinger, responded by claiming to be &quot;appalled&quot;, saying it was &quot;premature&quot;, &quot;inaccurate&quot;, &quot;potentially damaging&quot;, &quot;poorly researched&quot;, and &quot;deeply flawed&quot;. Yesterday Greenpeace, which has been investigating the issue, along with Amnesty, launched a legal action in Amsterdam calling for the oil firm to be prosecuted there for homicide or grievous bodily harm. It said: &quot;This intentional pollution \u2026 has caused many people to suffer serious injuries and has even led to death.&quot; Trafigura said it &quot;utterly rejected&quot; claims of a cover-up. &quot;Every statement that has been made \u2026 has been made in good faith.&quot; The traders said the autopsy reports were unreliable, and that hydrogen sulphide in the waste was only there in &quot;potential&quot; form. It has never actually been released. They said the emails contained &quot;crude and distasteful&quot; language, but had been taken &quot;out of context&quot; and should &quot;not be taken literally&quot;. They repeated denials that the slops could have caused death or serious injury, and were highly toxic. They denied lying about the composition of the slops.

Thousands of tonnes of &quot;coker gasoline&quot; was being sold off from a Mexican state refinery at Cadereyta. Trafigura trader James McNicol wrote from the firm&apos;s Oxford Street office block: &quot;This is as cheap as anyone can imagine and should make serious dollars \u2026 Each cargo should make 7m!!&quot; To clean up the dirty fuel, which they described as &quot;crap&quot; or &quot;shit&quot;, the traders planned to add caustic soda to absorb sulphur contaminants, despite being told this process was banned in the west. The &quot;most difficult&quot; problem, as they recorded, was how to dispose of the resultant stinking toxic waste. In December 2005, McNicol promised the company head, Claude Dauphin: &quot;We will make it happen&quot;. He told colleagues: &quot;We should be talking to specialist chemical clean-up companies.&quot; He wrote: &quot;Claude owns a waste disposal company and wants us to be creative.&quot; His colleague Naeem Ahmed warned: &quot;US/Singapore and European terminals no longer allow the use of caustic soda washes since local environmental agencies do not allow disposal of the toxic caustic after treatment.&quot; He reported to Dauphin: &quot;Caustic washes are banned by most countries due to the hazardous nature of the waste (mercaptans, phenols, smell) \u2026 There are not many facilities remaining in the market. There is a company in Rotterdam that burns such waste in a high stack chimney and charges are approximately $200/kg.&quot; That was considered too expensive. A Tunisian tank terminal was finally persuaded to handle caustic processing, but the owners ejected Trafigura because the stench caused protests from workers. Trafigura&apos;s London head of gasoline trading, Leon Christophilopoulos, suggested a desperate remedy: a floating refinery: &quot;I don&apos;t know how we dispose of the slops and I don&apos;t imply we would dump them, but for sure, there must be some way to pay someone to take them.&quot; A chartered tanker, the Probo Koala, was anchored off Gibraltar. Between April and June, it took three cargoes, each of 28,000 tonnes of contaminated gasoline, and mixed them with caustic soda and a catalyst. About 47% of the sulphur was removed, said statements filed at the high court by the BBC. The Probo Koala&apos;s spare tanks soon filled up with waste containing freshly created sulphur compounds. Company emails show a highly concentrated 33% caustic solution had been used on board. This may have produced an even higher proportion of toxic compounds than in conventional refinery waste. By 18 April, Christophilopoulos was fretting: &quot;We \u2026 still haven&apos;t tackled how we will dispose of the washings on board the vessel.&quot; In June, the tanker headed for Amsterdam. Ahmed booked a disposal firm, claiming the waste was simply routine &quot;slops&quot; from rinsing out petrol tanks. The plan failed. After uproar over the stench Trafigura reloaded the waste and sailed to Africa. Ahmed and Trafigura currently face prosecution in the Netherlands where they deny telling lies. The tanker finally sailed to Ivory Coast, for the waste to be dumped by a local contractor, Salomon Ugborugbo. Ugborugbo had no experience, or facilities. He had somehow obtained a port licence shortly before. For a very low price his hired tanker-trucks took away the black slurry. What followed was an environmental and human catastrophe. The waste ended up being tipped all around Abidjan. It would have contained such unstable substances as mercaptans, mercaptides, sodium sulphide and dialkyl disulphides. Those living and working nearby risked burns, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of consciousness and death from contact with such compounds. The most sombre allegations concern the killer gas hydrogen sulphide. Sulphur compounds can break down in the environment and release it. The thousands of reports of casualties followed a pattern which appears consistent with an escape of hydrogen sulphide. Inhabitants near the dump sites reported respiratory and eye problems, while further away, people reported nauseating smells. However, Trafigura went on to issue a series of public statements which said the victims&apos; claims to have been poisoned by Trafigura were imaginary. Trafigura yesterday said that &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that the slops would generate hydrogen sulphide at levels that could have caused the deaths and serious injuries alleged&quot;. As 31,000 Africans, many desperately poor, joined in an unprecedented group action for compensation organised by London lawyer Martyn Day, Trafigura tried repeatedly to give the impression that its ship had only pumped out ordinary slops from tank-cleaning: a completely different type of activity. It claimed such discharges from ships were &quot;a routine procedure that is undertaken all over the world&quot;. It said that &quot;to label Trafigura&apos;s slops as &quot;toxic waste&quot; in no way accurately reflects their true composition&quot; and that &quot;Trafigura is in no way responsible&quot; for any sickness in Abidjan. The Baron Eric de Turckheim, another founding director, told BBC Newsnight that his firm&apos;s waste was &quot;absolutely not dangerous to human beings&quot;. Trafigura maintained this position as long as it could, muzzling the media with aggressive statements from the expensive lobbying firm Bell Pottinger and the equally expensive libel lawyers Carter-Ruck. It was only yesterday afternoon, facing likely publication of their internal emails, that the firm announced it was suing for peace with the 31,000 Ivorians who have been trying to get compensation. After three years, the cover-up had collapsed.", "sentences": ["By 18 April, Christophilopoulos was fretting: &quot;We \u2026 still haven&apos;t tackled how we will dispose of the washings on board the vessel.&quot; In June, the tanker headed for Amsterdam."], "title": "Trafigura hoped to make a fortune.

Their lecturers are doing the same. Another Dutch university, in Groningen some 330km north, has decided to print its newspaper in English at least three times a year. English, it seems, is everywhere on campus in the Netherlands, with Sweden also joining the trend. This is nowhere more apparent than in lecture theatres and classrooms. At least 4,200 degrees are now taught only in English in European countries outside the UK and Ireland, a study for the Academic Cooperation Association found last year. That is triple the number reported seven years ago, Bernd Waechter and Friedhelm Maiworm, the study&apos;s authors, say. Almost all these &quot;English medium&quot; degrees are based in the Netherlands or Scandinavia with few to report \u2013 so far \u2013 in southern Europe, Franco phone Belgium, Austria or Russia, although Spain&apos;s private sector is moving in the direction of its Nordic peers. About 80% of these English- medium degrees are at master&apos;s level, but undergraduate programmes are on the rise. The courses aren&apos;t just in business-related subjects or the sciences \u2013 even general literary theory is served up only in English at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Anders Flodstr\u00f6m, chancellor for Swedish universities, predicts that all university education in Sweden will be delivered in English within the next 10 to 15 years. It&apos;s fast going that way. The vast majority of Sweden&apos;s 500-plus English-medium master&apos;s degrees have only been developed in the last couple of years. Why the rush? It&apos;s not just because of the global dominance of English in academia. Nor is it, in most cases, a financial decision by universities eager to charge higher fees from inter national students. Most of the students on English-medium courses come from Europe. In the Netherlands they pay the same as Dutch students, while in Sweden, higher education is free for all. It&apos;s partly to do with the Bologna Process, under which some European countries have signed up to a European Higher Education Area within which academic degree standards are comparable and compatible. But the driving factor is prestige. Andr\u00e9 Gerrits, professor of European studies at the University of Amsterdam, says: &quot;Switching to English is a precondition for having a more international student body. Increasing foreign staff and students is a precondition for being accepted as a place of international learning.&quot; This is all very well for university leaders tucked up in their offices anticipating their institutions&apos; rise up university league tables. But how are students and staff helped to make the switch from learning or teaching in their mother tongue to processing or communicating complex ideas in a second language? There is potential for much to go awry. Students at the University of Groningen have complained that professors who crack jokes during their lectures in Dutch turn dull when they give the same class in English. Research by John Airey, a lecturer in scientific literacy at the University of Kalmar in Sweden, shows non-English students are less willing to ask and answer questions when lectures are in English. Those who take notes spend most of their time focused on the process of writing in English, rather than understanding what they are writing. In some cases, lectures become sessions for mechanical note-taking. Marcel Duits, a master&apos;s student at Rotterdam School of Management, says: &quot;The university assumes that in our first year we have sufficient English to be able to read and understand course literature. This is generally the case, but it doesn&apos;t say anything about our ability to speak fluently. Courses would help tremendously.&quot; Universities are starting to realise that, at least as far as their students are concerned, they should be providing assistance. English for Academic Purposes courses, designed to help students use language appropriate for university study, are springing up, although are not yet common. However, says Robert Wilkinson of Maastricht University, &quot;students expect these courses to have a link with their studies&quot;. The reality is that often they don&apos;t, and students have to pay either a contribution or the full fee for a course that may be held at a language institute off campus. Universities have until recently assumed that lecturers&apos; English will be up to the task, given that they publish and read their international colleagues&apos; work in English, but more formal testing regimes are being introduced. Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands now asks its staff to sit both a computer-based and oral English test unless they have a high score in internationally recognised English-language qualifications or a UK or US passport. Those that don&apos;t pass, don&apos;t teach in English. The University of Groningen is going the same way as Delft, while the University of Utrecht says that in the future, lecturers on its English- medium courses will have to have the Base Qualification for Teaching, a qualification in teaching English. There are dissenting voices. Wilkinson says asking lecturers to sit tests or have extra qualifications is &quot;probably impractical&quot;. Marianne Schouten, public relations manager of the Rotterdam School of Management, says tests and courses are unnecessary. &quot;We expect our lecturers to be capable of lecturing in English,&quot; she says. &quot;English is taught from the age of 12 in the Netherlands, so it really is a second language to most people.&quot; Airey, who teaches English language courses for lecturers, admits that those who attend are probably not the ones who need to improve their English. And in any case, he says, &quot;the pedagogical awareness of the lecturer is much more important than their language capability. A good student-centred lecturer will be good whatever the language.&quot; English support for students and staff is, for now, mainly still a matter of choice. But how much longer can this be the case if these universities&apos; dreams of a truly international staff and student body are realised?", "sentences": ["Andr\u00e9 Gerrits, professor of European studies at the University of Amsterdam, says: &quot;Switching to English is a precondition for having a more international student body."], "title": "Language switch challenges on campus", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/sep/17/tefl-netherlands", "tags": ["Tefl", "Netherlands", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-17T16:01:08Z", "article": "Six men plotted to flood the island of Jersey with \u00a31m worth of cannabis, a court heard today. Among the gang was Curtis Warren, 46, of Liverpool, who was the man with the &quot;clout and influence&quot; to lead the conspiracy, the royal court in St Helier was told. Warren and his co-defendants all deny conspiracy to smuggle 180kg (397lb) of cannabis, which has a street value in Jersey of \u00a31m, significantly higher than in the UK. The prosecution said that undercover police officers followed the gang, bugging their cars and tapping their phones, for a number of months before they were all arrested in July 2007. Warren was the linchpin between dealers in Jersey and the Netherlands and the ringleader of the plot, which took place between 1 May 2007 and 23 July 2007, said crown advocate Howard Sharp. The plot was intended to be merely a warm-up for bigger conspiracies to come, he added. &quot;Warren was the senior figure, he was the man at the top who pulled all the strings. He had considerable clout and influence. We say he organised and orchestrated this conspiracy,&quot; said Sharp in his opening speech as the drugs trial began amid high security. He added: &quot;Warren considered the planned importation, to quote him directly, as &apos;just a little starter&apos;. He stood to make a significant profit had the conspiracy borne fruit.&quot; . The gang allegedly planned to buy the drugs in Amsterdam and transport the consignment by car to the coast of Normandy, France, where it would be placed on a boat to Jersey. The jury heard a tape which the crown said recorded Warren and his &quot;right-hand man&quot;, Jonathan Welsh, 43, also on trial, checking out a secluded location on the island to land the drugs. Warren did not get his hands dirty with the nitty-gritty of the deal, Sharp told the jury. &quot;Warren has a light touch. You won&apos;t see him handling the drugs or shipping bags of cash about. He leaves such chores, the really risky part of the drugs business, to others lower down the food chain. Warren was cautious. He often remained in the shadows, he rarely stepped out into the light.&quot; He made 112 calls from public phone boxes in Jersey and the UK during the five-week conspiracy period, said Sharp. He deliberately didn&apos;t use mobile phones or landlines to make it &quot;difficult, if not impossible, to attribute the call to [him]&quot;, said Sharp, adding: &quot;Warren&apos;s difficulty, as you will see, is that the police were watching.&quot; Also on trial is James O&apos;Brien, 44, who the jury were told today has a conviction for importing 60kg of cannabis into Jersey by boat from Normandy in 2002.

Evidence was disclosed in the Guardian today that the London-based firm has carried out a huge cover-up of its role in an African waste-dumping scandal.     Lord Strathclyde, leader of Conservative party in the Lords. Photograph: David Mansell    Strathclyde said: &quot;I&apos;ve read today&apos;s stories about Trafigura with concern and I am making inquiries about the situation.&quot; He is to leave his post as a non-executive director on the board of Trafigura&apos;s hedge-fund arm, Galena Asset Management, which pays him an undisclosed fee. Strathclyde said today that he had already intended to stand down from Trafigura and all his other business roles by the end of the year &quot;in preparation for the forthcoming general election&quot;. A second senior Tory, former minister Peter Fraser QC, has now registered on the register of Lords interests that he is being paid by Trafigura. This follows a formal complaint by Lib Dem Norman Lamb. Internal emails published by the Guardian revealed that Trafigura, whose traders declared $440m profit last year, knew its oil waste was highly toxic, before hundreds of tonnes of it were dumped around the west African city of Abidjan, in Ivory Coast. The company has now agreed to pay compensation to more than 30,000 inhabitants who say they were injured by toxic fumes. Greenpeace in the Netherlands, where Trafigura has a holding company, have launched a legal action in Amsterdam calling for the firm to be prosecuted for manslaughter or grievous bodily harm, quoting documents they say detail the waste&apos;s toxicity. Trafigura continues to deny its waste could cause &quot;serious&quot; injury. In November 2006, the firm&apos;s directors anticipated the prospect of litigation against them over the waste dumping. Strathclyde had since 2004 sat as a non-executive director on the board of Galena, which shares directors with the oil-trading operation and is based at the same London office block, Portman House, near Marble Arch. He was asked for assistance in dealing with the controversy, and recommended Fraser. Trafigura hired Fraser to write &quot;an independent report&quot;, also for an undisclosed fee. Fraser says he accepted the job on a similar basis to that of Lord Woolf, the retired lord chief justice, who was paid \u00a36,000 a day by BAe, to write a report on allegations of bribery. Woolf declared his BAe work on the Lords&apos; register, but Fraser initially decided not to do the same over Trafigura. Asked if it was appropriate to take the job, considering Trafigura&apos;s chequered history, including US penalties for involvement in Iraqi sanctions-busting, he said: &quot;I know of nothing of Trafigura&apos;s other activities, as that falls well outside the terms of my remit.&quot; Strathclyde said yesterday that he was not involved in any way in Trafigura&apos;s oil operations. &quot;I sit as an independent non-executive director on the board of Galena Asset Management Ltd, a British registered company, regulated by the FSA, specialising in managing funds in metals based commodities of which Trafigura is the shareholder. The businesses are run separately and Galena has no involvement in any of the allegations made today. &quot;I have already indicated that I will be giving up my non-parliamentary business roles around the turn of the year, in preparation for the forthcoming general election in 2010.&quot;", "sentences": ["Greenpeace in the Netherlands, where Trafigura has a holding company, have launched a legal action in Amsterdam calling for the firm to be prosecuted for manslaughter or grievous bodily harm, quoting documents they say detail the waste&apos;s toxicity."], "title": "Tory peer severs links with oil trader after waste scandal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/17/lord-strathclyde-end-trafigura-links", "tags": ["Conservatives", "House of Lords", "Trafigura", "Oil", "Pollution", "Oil", "Politics", "Environment", "Business", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-18T13:25:37Z", "article": "A portrait of a brooding young man, one eyebrow fractionally raised with a hint of a sardonic smile, is predicted to smash the world record price for a Rembrandt when it is auctioned in London in December, estimated by Christie&apos;s at up to \u00a325m. The record was set almost 10 years ago, also at Christie&apos;s, when a Rembrandt portrait of an old lady sold for just under \u00a320m, still the fourth highest price ever for a painting by an Old Master. The highest ever was the \u00a349.5m paid in 2002 by the media baron Lord Thomson, for a newly identified painting by Rubens. The unknown young man hasn&apos;t been exhibited since 1970 but had a colourful time in the 20th century. The painting was owned for decades by the richest man in the world, George Huntington Hartford\u00a0II, heir to 16,000 supermarket branches. He was only 21 when he bought it, calling it &quot;the greatest Rembrandt portrait I have ever seen&quot;. He presented it in the 1950s to Columbia University, where it was still hanging in the president&apos;s office in 1968 when students occupied the room and the administrative block for a week. The sit-in voted to admit two policemen to remove the Rembrandt for safe keeping and, after years in storage, the university then sold it, reputedly for more than $1m. Richard Knight, joint head of the Old Masters department at Christie&apos;s, called it &quot;a truly remarkable portrait&quot; in Rembrandt&apos;s late style, by one of the greatest and most influential artists in European history. The sitter, picked out in light against a sombre background, has never been identified \u2013 the painting was once catalogued as Portrait of an Admiral despite his rakishly unmilitary air. Whoever he was, the commission will have been welcomed by Rembrandt in a desperate year. It is signed and dated 1658, a year when only one other painting is recorded, the great self portrait now in the Frick in New York. Rembrandt&apos;s life and career were then in tatters: his wife and three of his children were dead, and he was bankrupt, living in a small rented house with his mistress and surviving son, his grand home in Amsterdam and all the contents of its studio sold to satisfy his clamorous creditors. The painting will be on display at Christie&apos;s for four days in December before the sale on 8 December, the first chance for the public to admire it since an exhibition in 1970. It has only been auctioned once before, in 1930, for \u00a318,500, then an enormous sum, and is now being sold by an anonymous private collector.", "sentences": ["Rembrandt&apos;s life and career were then in tatters: his wife and three of his children were dead, and he was bankrupt, living in a small rented house with his mistress and surviving son, his grand home in Amsterdam and all the contents of its studio sold to satisfy his clamorous creditors."], "title": "Rembrandt portrait for sale.

Curtis Warren, 46, is the only drug trafficker to make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List, and was once Interpol&apos;s most wanted man, a jury at the royal court in St Helier heard. Liverpool-born Warren denies planning to import 180kg (396lbs) of cannabis into the island by boat along with five other men in 2007. The prosecution says Warren had the &quot;clout and influence&quot; to lead the conspiracy, which he allegedly orchestrated from public phone boxes in Jersey and the UK in an attempt to avoid detection. He was arrested weeks after being released from jail in the Netherlands, where he had served 10 years of a sentence for drug trafficking and firearms offences and manslaughter, the court heard. Ordinarily, a defendant&apos;s previous convictions may not be aired in open court, because of the obvious risk of prejudicing the jury. But today , Warren&apos;s counsel, Stephen Baker, took the unusual decision of revealing his client&apos;s most sensational crimes, while cross-examining the Jersey police officer in charge of the case. These included Warren&apos;s conviction in the Netherlands in 1997 for importing 400kg of cocaine, 100kg of heroin, 1,050kg of cannabis and 50kg of ecstasy. The jury was also told that while serving his sentence, he killed another prisoner. Baker told the jury that Warren, a drug dealer of &quot;substantial wealth and influence&quot;, is so famous that an unauthorised biography has been written about his life. The book, Cocky, has recently sold out at the island&apos;s branch of Waterstone&apos;s, Baker said, despite the media blackout on Warren&apos;s previous convictions. Baker added: &quot;[Warren] is the only alleged drug trafficker to have appeared in the Sunday Times rich list and, did you know, in Liverpool and London, you buy T-shirts with his photograph on them?&quot; The jury heard about another of Warren&apos;s court appearances, in Newcastle in 1993, when he was accused of smuggling 1,000kg of cocaine into the UK, hidden in lead ingots. That trial was stopped and Warren walked free when it was revealed that one of his associates, Brian Charrington, was a Customs informer. All this was disclosed as his counsel tried to discover whether one of the men involved in the Jersey plot was in fact a police informant. Mohammed Liazid, a Moroccan living in the Netherlands, is accused of providing the cannabis which Warren and his alleged gang plotted to bring to Jersey via boat from France. Liazid was secretly taped discussing the alleged deal with Jonathan Welsh, 43, one of Warren&apos;s co-accused, a friend of his for 20 years who was referred to in court as Warren&apos;s &quot;right hand man&quot;. But Liazid has not been arrested. Baker suggested no attempts had been made to arrest him and asked whether he could be an informer for either the Dutch or Jersey authorities. During cross-examination, Detective Sergeant Paul Kennea, the Jersey police officer leading the case, said he had no knowledge that Liazid was an informer, and said the police had no idea of his whereabouts. The court heard yesterday that much of the evidence against the gang was obtained through covert surveillance of Warren and others by police in Jersey, Britain and the Netherlands, some of which Warren&apos;s counsel described yesterday as &quot;unlawfully gathered&quot;. The jury has been played covert recordings of a meeting in Amsterdam between Liazid and Welsh and a telephone conversation he had with Warren. Baker suggested Warren had been somehow set up because he was such a famous scalp for a police force to claim. He said: &quot;The Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the Dutch prosecution authorities and the Jersey police were so desperate to get Mr Warren that they will use police agents to incite him into conversation.&quot; The detective replied: &quot;This operation was conducted professionally and by the book, arrests were made when evidence was at hand, evidence gathered by lawful means.&quot; But Baker said the officer had not been honest with the jury. He explained that a bugging device in a hire car used by Welsh to drive from France to his meeting with Liazid had been fitted illegally with a listening device. French and Belgian authorities had refused Jersey police permission to fit the bug, but it was placed in the car anyway, the jury was told. During an earlier hearing, the judge had described the Jersey police action as &quot;reprehensible and unlawful and to say the least regrettable&quot;. Warren didn&apos;t get his hands dirty with the nitty gritty of the deal, the jury was told on Thursday. Howard Sharp, for the prosecution, said: &quot;Warren has a light touch. You won&apos;t see him handling the drugs or shipping bags of cash about. He leaves such chores, the really risky part of the drugs business, to others, lower down the food chain. &quot; Despite owning at least three mobile phones, Warren made 112 calls from public phone boxes in Jersey and the UK during the five-week conspiracy period, said Sharp. He deliberately didn&apos;t use mobiles or landlines to make it &quot;difficult, if not impossible, to attribute the call to [him]&quot; said Sharp, adding, &quot;Warren&apos;s difficulty, as you will see, is that the police were watching.&quot; Also on trial is James O&apos;Brien, 45, who the jury was told today has a conviction for importing 60kg of cannabis into Jersey by boat from Normandy in 2002.

Doesn&apos;t it get terribly dirty? &quot;Yes, but that is beautiful,&quot; Barenbrug enthuses. &quot;I used this and everything became grey, everything became dirty. It is\u2026&quot; he uses a Dutch word and searches for the English, inadvertently making one up. &quot;What is the word? &apos;Smuggy&apos;, that is nice. If you have kids, you soon find out that once they are in your stroller it will get smuggy anyway, there is nothing you can do about it,&quot; he starts to laugh, &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; He has a habit, he says, of approaching people in the street, if something on their Bugaboo isn&apos;t connected properly. &quot;I take all the crumbs and all the food and vomit and everything for granted,&quot; he says. You have to embrace the vomit and the poop? &quot;Mm hmm,&quot; he says, nodding his head vigorously. &quot;Mm hmm.&quot; You don&apos;t need to have children to have heard of Bugaboo, you just need to know a middle-class parent. Actually, all you need do is open the paper, and there will be a celebrity mum or dad pushing the 4x4 of prams, which cost up to \u00a3660, along the pavements of Primrose Hill. There is a healthy resale market on eBay for anyone who can&apos;t afford them new. Barenbrug says the company is quite strict about not giving the prams away to celebrities. Madonna paid for hers, he says, as do members of the Dutch royal family, although he did give one to his favourite Dutch actress, Kim van Kooten. He does, he admits, &quot;like it a lot&quot; when he sees members of the A-list pushing his buggies. Others pictured with a Bugaboo have included Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney, Gwen Stefani and Matthew McConaughey. Barenbrug produced his first Bugaboo as his final year project at Eindhoven Design Academy, 15 years ago. The original idea was to make a pram that a man would like, and the chunky design and solid colours owed much to the aesthetics of outdoor gear used for climbing or camping. &quot;It had to be tough, it had to be multifunctional, it had to be used outdoors. Like you want a car, you want this stroller,&quot; he says. &quot;The parent that buys this buys it for themselves.&quot; People, he says, don&apos;t suddenly change because they have children. He yanks a model from the shelves and energetically turns it into a two-wheeler to show how it could be used on the beach. The one-piece handlebar, allowing dad to steer with one hand, the ability to switch the seat from front-facing to parent-facing and its modular design, as well as the use of more fashionable fabrics, made it different, he says. He tried to sell the concept to a pram manufacturer for a number of years but failed to spark any interest. His then brother-in-law, Eduard Zanen, invested some money and they made the buggy themselves, from a factory in Taiwan, displaying them at an industry fair in Cologne. That attracted huge interest, including an offer for the company. Instead they decided to go it alone. The first Bugaboo came onto the market in 1999. Today the company employs 800 people, Bugaboos are on sale in 50\u00a0countries and the company has annual revenues of \u20ac70m (\u00a363m). Eight months ago, Barenbrug hired a chief executive to run the company, Nico Moolenaar, allowing him to focus on design. The design has evolved in the past decade. The tread in the tyres has changed because customers complained that dog faeces got wedged in, and the suspension improved after Barenbrug had his own two daughters. The company also launched the Bee, a smaller, lightweight version. Nurseries in west London had started banning the Bugaboo because they were taking up too much space. Another key moment for the brand came when one was used on Sex and the City, before it was available in the US. It got a huge amount of press coverage. Before Bugaboo, the market had been &quot;very backward&quot; Barenbrug says, with manufacturers simply trying to make prams as cheap as possible. It is a feat, though, to convince consumers they should pay four or five times what they ordinarily would for a product. It is like Starbucks convincing us to spend \u00a32.40 on a coffee. Barenbrug doesn&apos;t like the comparison. &quot;Starbucks I don&apos;t like. They don&apos;t give value for money, period. I take a big circle round to avoid Starbucks,&quot; he says, walking in a big circle. A better comparison, Moolenaar says, is Bang &amp; Olufsen, the high-end stereo equipment. Bugaboo does especially well in Spain, Holland and Britain, although it is not so strong in the US, where Barenbrug says price remains the main driver in the market. The status attached to a Bugaboo has brought it equal adoration and loathing. &quot;People buy it because the neighbour has it, this I don&apos;t like,&quot; Barenbrug says. &quot;What I like is when people really like this product for what it is.&quot; But there is undeniably a snob value. &quot;Well, this is true, but what can I say? I continuously say in interviews that the product is worth it. You get value for money.&quot; The company is still 50/50 owned by Barenbrug and Zanen, who is largely a sleeping partner. Moolenaar has been brought in to make the business run more efficiently and to drive its expansion. One plan is to put the Bugaboo name onto other &quot;mobility&quot; products, from bicycles to bags and walking frames for the elderly and disabled. Another is to speed up production of new models. &quot;It is like any other company that has been going for 10 years, you go from the pioneering stage to the more mature stage and you have to revisit your structure and policies and management,&quot; Moolenaar says. To mark its 10th anniversary, the company said it would donate 1% of revenues to Red, which battles HIV and Aids in Africa.

He confides that he is thinking of moving the design team from the corporate headquarters on an industrial estate back to the centre of Amsterdam. He wants, he says, to have better lunch options. &quot;This is catered, I don&apos;t like it,&quot; he says, wrinkling his face. He also tells a revealing story about the Bugaboo name. He came up with it when he looked up buggy in the dictionary and saw the word bugaboo. The definition, he says, was a little goblin or ghost. &quot;I liked the name because it was teasing. An annoying little ghost. But our PR agency started going through all the dictionaries in the world to give it a more &apos;proper&apos;, positive meaning and found one.

If money is no object head to rue de la Grand Chauss\u00e9e, home to designer boutiques such as Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Lacoste \u2013 but it&apos;s the smaller shops on and around rue de la Monnaie, Lille&apos;s most beautiful street, lined with 18th- and 19th-century houses, that are really worth exploring. Foodie stops should include the Meert (meert.fr) tearoom on rue Esquermoise for lipsmacking pastries, and Philippe Olivier (3 rue du Cure St Etienne), one of France&apos;s top cheese shops. \u2022 Stay at: Le Brueghel (00 33 320 060669;  hotel-brueghel.com) is classically French, with an oak-panelled breakfast room and simple but comfortable bedrooms from \u20ac67 (breakfast \u20ac8.50) For nightlife: Antwerp Time: 2hrs 55ins/price: \u00a359 Any city that is home to 10,000 students will have a pretty kicking nightlife, and Antwerp&apos;s scene comes with added Flemish eccentricity. Start with a beer at Het Elfde Gebod at Torf Burg 10, where drinks are served among church memorabilia and religious pictures (the name means the 11th Commandment) and move on to cocktails at elegant Sips (Gillisplaats 8).

The one remaining original brewery in the city is De Halve Maan ( halvemaan.be), which offers tours \u2013 or try lunch at Den Dijver (dijver.be; Dijver 5), where many of the dishes are flavoured by or cooked in beer.

To experience Paul Bocuse&apos;s culinary arts, book in advance at L&apos;Auberge du Pont de Collonges (bocuse.fr). Otherwise, stroll down rue des Marronniers and pick a suitable spot for supper \u2013 it&apos;s a far better bet than the tourist-heavy rue Merci\u00e8re. \u2022 Stay at: Coll\u00e8ge Hotel (00 33 4 72 100505; college-hotel.com) is a former school revamped with sleek white bedrooms and an elegant book-lined lounge.

At the heart of the town lies the Palais des Papes, one of the largest Gothic buildings in Europe. The city is encircled by walls and the medieval streets are enchanting, dotted with small bars and bistros. Its Unesco world heritage status means the old centre remains pristine. Twenty minutes outside the town lies the Pont du Gard, a spectacular Roman aqueduct, though of course Avignon has its own famous bridge, immortalised in the nursery rhyme. \u2022 Stay at: An elegant B&amp;B in an 18th-century townhouse, Le Limas (00 33 4 90 146719; le-limas-avignon.com) has great views and sleek doubles from \u20ac120 B&amp;B For champagne: Rheims Time: 4hrs 10mins/price: \u00a379 Beneath the city streets, Roman tunnels and caves store millions of bottles of vintage Krug, Veuve Cliquot and Taittinger while above ground the outskirts of town are dotted with elegant estates owned by the champagne houses. Every bar will serve a huge range of coupes de champagne (tiny glasses around 100ml), which means you can compare the different houses without crucifying your wallet, or falling over. Take a tour of the champagne caves with Taittinger (taittinger.com) before a sundowner at one of the pavement cafes on rue de Vesle and dinner at the art deco Brasserie Flo (96 place Drouet d&apos;Erlon). \u2022 Stay at: The Grand Hotel des Templiers (grandhoteldestempliers.com) is a renovated 19th-century mansion that feels classically French; doubles from \u20ac190 For chateaux: Tours  Time: 5hrs 15mins/price: \u00a379 The Loire is rich in heritage and wine-making, and the countryside is dotted with fairytale chateaux. In Tours itself, half-timbered houses open on to bustling squares. It&apos;s an easy day trip to some beautiful chateaux: elegant Chenonceau, Azay-le-Rideau \u2013 built on an island \u2013 and the medieval Amboise. Return to the city for a slap-up dinner at Les Tuffeaux (19 rue Lavoisier), which serves local specialities such as pigeon-stuffed ravioli, or head to picturesque Place Plumereau, with its lively bars and restaurants. \u2022 Stay at: Hotel de l&apos;Univers (00 33 2 98 44 38 38; oceaniahotels.com) is the most glamorous address. It may be a little faded, but the room rate of \u20ac130 B&amp;B means affordable old-school style. For art: Basel Time: 6hrs 11mins/price: \u00a3105 Every June the great and the good of the art world descend on Switzerland for ArtBasel, one of the biggest art shows in the world. For the rest of the year the city keeps the art theme going, with stunning galleries interspersed with stylish eateries and glitzy bars. Kunsthaus Baselland (kunsthausbaselland.ch) is a large exhibition space that specialises in contemporary shows by groups and individuals, with between seven and nine curated exhibitions taking place at all times. Those with more traditional tastes should head to the Kunstmuseum (kunstmuseumbasel.ch), where works by a diverse collection of artists including Rubens, Mondrian, Picasso and Klee hang alongside changing exhibitions by contemporary artists. If all the culture makes you thirsty, head to the Campari Bar at the Kunsthal restaurant, perfectly situated on the banks of the Rhine, or cross the river to the Marktplatz and pick up a slice of flammkuchen \u2013 a Swiss take on pizza, smothered in Emmenthal, onions, bacon and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. \u2022 Stay at: Part art gallery, part hotel, the St Gotthard (00 41 61 225 1313; st-gotthard.ch ) has doubles from \u00a3105 B&amp;B How to get the best-price ticket Travelling through Europe by rail is a dream, but buying tickets can be a nightmare. The various rail companies have been making efforts to make their ticketing systems &quot;talk&quot; to each other, so passengers can book a seamless through journey, but they still have a long way to go. Moreover, just as with UK rail tickets, the price often seems to bear little relation to the distance travelled. The simple rule is that the further in advance you book, the cheaper the ticket \u2013 a second-class return from London to Berlin can cost anything from \u00a387 to \u00a3299, depending on when you book \u2013 and early birds can get some amazing deals. Returns to any city in Belgium start from \u00a359, as do returns to Paris and Lille; returns to Geneva start from \u00a399. A more complex issue is who to book with. Eurostar (08705 186 186; eurostar.com) says its website now allows tickets to be booked from most British stations to most French stations, 18 Swiss ones, seven Belgian ones and four in the Netherlands. In our experience, this still doesn&apos;t work very well: the website is often unable to find availability, or thinks for a while before giving up. The site also covers just two German cities, Aachen and Cologne. You can book direct with a foreign rail company \u2013 Deutsche Bahn, for example, has a UK telesales office and a website, and often has the best special deals (08718 808066; bahn.de.db_uk). For France see sncf.co.uk, Switzerland sbb.ch, Belgium b-rail.be, and the Netherlands ns.nl. Railteam is a joint venture between the European high-speed rail operators, but its website, railteam.eu, doesn&apos;t offer booking facilities. Given the number of rail operators required for most cross-Europe journeys, you will probably find it easier to get information and tickets through a third party. For information, the best site remains seat61.com, founded as a hobby by enthusiast Mark Smith, but now his full-time job. For tickets, use an agency such as Rail Europe (08448 484064; raileurope.co.uk), which will navigate the maze of information for you at no additional cost. Smith points out that Rail Europe lets you select different classes for different sections of the journey. &quot;The London-Paris section in first is expensive, but from Paris to Switzerland, for example, it&apos;s often not much more than second class,&quot; he says.", "sentences": ["For culture: Amsterdam Journey time: 5hrs 5mins (4hrs 6min from 13 December)Return from St Pancras: from \u00a389 A high-speed link between Brussels and Amsterdam opens on December 13, slashing the journey time from London by an hour.", "Follow a morning of culture with a spree in the boutiques of PC Hooftstraat, Amsterdam&apos;s glitziest shopping street."], "title": "Europe's top city breaks by rail", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/sep/20/city-breaks-rail", "tags": ["Rail travel", "City breaks", "Lille holidays", "Bruges holidays", "Amsterdam holidays", "Avignon holidays", "Antwerp holidays", "Cologne holidays", "Lyon holidays", "Travel", "Short breaks", "Weekend breaks", "Europe holidays", "France holidays", "Netherlands holidays", "Belgium holidays", "Green travel", "Switzerland holidays", "Germany holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-19T23:06:28Z", "article": "Usually I try to blot out other people&apos;s mobile phone conversations when I&apos;m on a train, but there was something intriguing about this one. I was on an early Eurostar heading for Zurich via Paris, sitting across the aisle from a typical British banker, when he took a call from his wife. Even across the carriage I could hear her agitation at the other end of the line, and his attempts to hush the call only made it all the more interesting. He signed off by promising to call someone \u2013 which he then did. By the sound of it that &quot;someone&quot; was both a friend and business contact, and after the usual niceties my fellow passenger cleared his throat nervously, and dived in. &quot;Jacques, I have a difficult question to ask,&quot; he started. &quot;But is our au pair staying with you?&quot; Of course, I couldn&apos;t hear the answer, but judging by his reaction it was neither a clear yes nor a definitive no. Evidently, the plot had just thickened. At which point, possibly aware that I was listening in, my fellow passenger rose from his seat and left the compartment to conclude the conversation in the corridor. Although I&apos;m not proud of the eavesdropping component, this tantalising glimpse of someone else&apos;s life is actually typical of travel by train. On a plane, you see nothing but clouds, and on a motorway you see the back end of the lorry in front. But a train allows insight into a destination, peering into a nation&apos;s backyards as it runs unfettered through country and city, transporting a cross-section of locals and travellers, some of whom may be disposed to talk \u2013 even if it&apos;s just on a mobile phone. New high-speed links have cut journey times significantly over the last two years, with the next big step forward due on 13 December, when new track brings Amsterdam an hour closer, as well as shortening trips to many other cities. Building on the next phase of Europe&apos;s high speed rail project begins next year. And now that we have modern, high-speed services running to the heart of city destinations, trains are no longer the dog-eared refuge of enthusiasts. Thanks to exhilarating speeds, upmarket lounges and interiors designed by the likes of Philippe Starck (in the case of Eurostar) and Christian Lacroix (on new TGVs) \u2013 they&apos;re attracting a more fashionable crowd. People who have au pairs. Eurostar itself is an unbeatable formula, especially with its starting point in the wonderful railway cathedral of St Pancras, which combines the glory of railway&apos;s golden age with the technology of new generation trains. For someone heading for Lille, Paris or Brussels for the weekend, Eurostar is an obvious choice, but it is also the conduit to further rail-based city breaks. The train quits London through a concrete canyon, shrugging off one of the world&apos;s greatest cities in a few brief minutes, passing close to the 2012 Olympic Village along the way. It slices through the garden of England, with orchards and occasional vineyards. After a short interval of darkness, it&apos;s in France, among poplar-lined expanses of giant ploughed fields, which become an impressionistic blur of colour at speed. The buffet car fills up with the British middle-classes, waxing lyrical about the countryside around their French second homes. Some of them get off at Lille for TGVs to more rural France because this avoids changing trains in Paris for many destinations. You can get down to Tours, across to Rennes and down to Dijon and even as far as Lyon with a simple change of platform at Lille. This is the first serious connection to Europe&apos;s 7,500km of high-speed rail routes, a quantity scheduled to double by 2020. Lille is also the diverging point for Eurostars to Brussels, where travellers can connect with the Thalys, a high-speed train run jointly by the French, Belgians and Germans, which connects to cities such as Antwerp, Rotterdam and Cologne. For my journey to Zurich, I was tackling a harder proposition: changing trains in Paris. On previous rail trips I&apos;ve had to cross the city from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon. Crossing a big city with luggage may sound intimidating, but the trans-Paris RER network runs frequently and fast, and Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyons is only two stops. This time, however, for Zurich, all I had to do was a trolley-trundle down the hill to Gare de l&apos;Est. The modern generation of TGV is even more sophisticated than the Eurostar. On some of the routes south of Paris, the trendy double-decker iDTGV rents out PlayStation Portables and encourages singles to mingle. My TGV Lyria to Zurich was a bit more sedate than that, but it sizzled east out of Paris on one of the latest high-speed tracks to open, and we were soon in Champagne country. Then came Strasbourg, the line slowed, and I was peering through the window to see if I could spot the German border, and then the Swiss one. Next we were in the giant tangle of lines entering Zurich&apos;s Hauptbahnhof, seven and a half hours after leaving London. This Swiss city is ideal for visiting by train. Zurich&apos;s Hauptbahnhof is right in the heart of the action and Bahnhofstrasse is reputed to be one of the most prestigious shopping streets in Europe. Prestigious shopping leaves me cold, but happily Zurich was far livelier and more cosmopolitan than I expected. Its setting, alongside the Limmat river where it flows into Lake Zurich, is refreshing, and its cafe culture in the pedestrianised alleys of the Old Town was a surprise. All that wealth has sponsored creative architecture and a luxuriant arts scene, from the Museum Rietberg (rietberg.ch), a fabulous villa stuffed with oriental works, to the Schiffbau (schauspielhaus.ch/www/160.asp), a former shipbuilding hall which is now a trendy spot for eating, drinking, and performance. In the end, though, I didn&apos;t stay long. I had a train to catch. \u2022 Andrew Eames is the editor of Great Train Journeys of the World, to be published by Time Out on 1 October, price \u00a316.99.

Tom Hall of Lonely Planet picks his favourites. Hlavni, Prague Among the many things that took travellers&apos; breath away when Prague emerged from behind the Iron Curtain in the 90s was the dramatic railway station. Hlavni Nadrazi is one of many art-nouveau gems in the city. The station&apos;s lavishly decorated lobby and ornate ceilings create a superb first or last impression, and the terminus is slowly being renovated. Centraal, Antwerp Don&apos;t be fooled by the modesty of Brussels&apos; Midi Station: the Belgians do grandiose terminals as well as any European country. Prince among them is Antwerp&apos;s recently renovated Centraal Station. It&apos;s hard to know where to look \u2013 at the giant dome, the vaulted ceiling or the dramatically sweeping main staircase. The station is also home to a diamond gallery with 30 shops, a nod to the city&apos;s jewel-dealing heritage. Santa Maria Novella, Florence This is a slightly surreal introduction to what is, for most visitors, a few days bingeing on Florentine art, architecture and food. It&apos;s a Fascist building, built with Mussolini&apos;s approval. Everything from signal boxes to station clocks is resolutely modernist. The platform-side memorial to Jews deported from here to concentration camps is a reminder of the more chilling consequences of Fascist rule in Italy. Rautatieasema, Helsinki When a station has a lounge reserved exclusively for the use of the President, you know it&apos;s a bit special. Clad in Finnish granite and fronted with iconic statuary, Helsinki&apos;s main train station was brightened up in 2000 by the installation of a glass roof. S\u00e3o Bento, Porto The spectacular murals made with blue azulejo tiles are so dramatic as to be a tourist attraction in their own right. Jorge Cola\u00e7o&apos;s work covers the walls of the station and depicts great scenes from Portugal&apos;s history. \u2022 To read a longer version of this article, including five more of Tom&apos;s favourite European stations, go to Lonely Planet&apos;s website.", "sentences": ["New high-speed links have cut journey times significantly over the last two years, with the next big step forward due on 13 December, when new track brings Amsterdam an hour closer, as well as shortening trips to many other cities."], "title": "The high-speed train route to Europe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/sep/20/city-break-rail-zurich", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Zurich holidays", "Switzerland holidays", "Lille holidays", "Travel", "Green travel", "Short breaks"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-22T20:30:01Z", "article": "Most conductors dream of being the principal conductor of a big US orchestra, but Bernard Haitink seems to have harboured no such ambition. Speaking of his decision to join the Chicago Symphony Orchestra three years ago, he squints into the sun glaring down on his garden above Lake Lucerne in Switzerland and says: &quot;These things are never planned, but things just happen to me \u2013 I&apos;m not a chess player. But it&apos;s very difficult to say no to an orchestra like Chicago.&quot; The idea was for Haitink to fill the\u00a0four-year void between Daniel Barenboim, leaving his post as the CSO&apos;s music director, and Riccardo Muti, who starts next year. &quot;I\u00a0said, &apos;That suits me very well.&apos; So I had a series of concerts with them, and I\u00a0enjoyed it so much. You know, from one thing comes another thing.&quot; Haitink&apos;s description of his time with Chicago is disarmingly down-to-earth. But then, this is the conductor who said, at the time of his appointment, that &quot;every conductor, including myself, has a sell-by date&quot;. He has certainly not reached his: this summer, the 80-year-old Dutch-born maestro conducted the concert that, for me, was the highlight of the Proms \u2013 his performance of Mahler&apos;s Ninth Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra. This week, he brings the CSO to London for two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall; he is also planning a complete cycle of Mahler&apos;s symphonies next season \u2013 and this while recovering from a serious back operation. He didn&apos;t think he would be fit enough for the LSO Prom, but, on the day the BBC insisted he make up his mind, he felt OK, so he said yes: &quot;Then, after that, I\u00a0felt miserable. But that&apos;s the way these things go. I don&apos;t regret the concert. The\u00a0Proms is such a special thing.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to see all this teeth-gritting as a form of Dutch Calvinism. For many music-lovers, Haitink is the living embodiment of Dutch musical culture: he was made principal conductor of Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw Orchestra in his early 30s, a position he held for nearly 30 years. Haitink still enjoys a closer relationship with the Concertgebouw musicians than anyone else, as two concerts at the Barbican in London earlier this year proved; there were revelatory performances of Haitink party pieces by Beethoven, Bruckner and Debussy. But Haitink is neither a Calvinist, nor does he now identify himself as Dutch. &quot;I&apos;m not Dutch any more \u2013 I&apos;ve been too long out of the country.&quot; Although he grew up in the occupied Netherlands, He was not raised in a religious environment. &quot;That was quite amazing for a Dutch family of the time.&quot; he says. He hasn&apos;t lost his accent, however, in spite of 12 years in charge of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and 15\u00a0at the Royal Opera House. A lost generation of musiciansThose formative years during the war still haunt him. &quot;There was so much talent lost. During the occupation, it became clear the Germans wanted to isolate the Jewish population. However, at the time, we didn&apos;t want to believe it. We couldn&apos;t believe they would all be murdered. I remember I went to see a young Jewish violinist play a concert at\u00a0his home \u2013 he played Beethoven&apos;s Kreutzer Sonata quite beautifully \u2013 but then, of course, he disappeared. I think the whole scene would have been different if Hitler and this whole fanatic policy had not existed. It becomes very odd and frightening when you think about it.&quot; He looks troubled. &quot;These are\u00a0very dangerous and unpleasant thoughts \u2013 but I would never have been a conductor if all of these catastrophes had not happened. There would have\u00a0been more talented conductors than\u00a0me.&quot; Musicians who play for Haitink today would disagree. Concertgebouw members speak of him with reverence; no one seems to know exactly how he does it, because he doesn&apos;t say much during rehearsals, but Haitink makes them play with more concentration, intensity and freedom. Simon Rattle says he can tell when Haitink has conducted his own orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, because they sound more relaxed, spacious and expressive. But ask Haitink how he does it and the answer is a pained expression and a few cryptic phrases. &quot;It&apos;s very dangerous to talk about these things. I try to have\u00a0an utmost concentration, focused on the music, not thinking about unnecessary things \u2013 and there are so many unnecessary things.&quot; OK, so what did he think about a huge work like Mahler&apos;s Ninth? Was there an idea, a plan? &quot;One of the things I was thinking was: how can I\u00a0keep it quiet at the end? Because it&apos;s a\u00a0unique ending, this breaking off of everything and disappearing in the air. And I thought, &apos;Whatever I do, they [the audience] must be silent.&apos; I\u00a0don&apos;t know what I did, but they were silent! Then you have one or two idiots in the hall shouting &apos;Bravo!&apos; and the whole thing is\u00a0broken.&quot; Haitink laughs at the Proms audience, but he is deadly serious: anything that gets in the way of the music is his enemy. He fought singlehandedly for the orchestra of the Royal Opera House during the tumultuous late 1990s, when it looked as if Covent Garden could lose its musicians; he had done the same for the Concertgebouw during a financial crisis in the 1980s. &quot;It&apos;s very important that the musicians trust you,&quot; he says, &quot;that they know, when the hour comes, you will stand for them, and not leave them alone.&quot; Famously, during his time at the Royal\u00a0Opera House, Haitink disapproved of some of the important productions he conducted, especially Richard Jones&apos;s Ring Cycle in the mid-1990s. But he describes Jones as &quot;an extremely talented theatre man&quot;, and cites some &quot;fantastic, impressive&quot; scenes, even if he remembers the overall production as\u00a0cartoonish and gimmicky. He conducted his last opera at Covent Garden, Wagner&apos;s Parsifal, at the end of\u00a02007, in the criminally poor production by Klaus Michael Gr\u00fcber. Haitink smiles and sighs. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but, you know, one closes one&apos;s eyes and lives in\u00a0the\u00a0music.&quot; Astonishingly, Parsifal might not have been his last opera, had Covent Garden made good on an invitation for Haitink to conduct Beethoven&apos;s Fidelio. &quot;For mysterious reasons, the production has now disappeared,&quot; he says, &quot;and they have told my agent it is not on. It&apos;s a bit odd, I must say.&quot; Why any opera company would pass up the chance to have Haitink conduct Beethoven&apos;s only opera is beyond me, but he is resigned to a future without opera. &quot;With my experience with my back, I have decided I cannot work in the opera house any more, and I will not.&quot; He said the same in these pages five years ago, and then conducted Wagner \u2013 but this time, it seems, he means it. So what of the composers Haitink is conducting? Last year, to everyone&apos;s surprise, he conducted his first-ever St Matthew Passion. &quot;I&apos;m not written down as a Bach specialist,&quot; he says. This is something of an understatement: few conductors are as removed from the world of early music as Haitink. &quot;And I never did Bach in Holland with the Concertgebouw, because the people who knew everything decided it should be [Nikolaus] Harnoncourt who played Bach and not me. I totally accepted that. But they offered me the chance to conduct Bach&apos;s B minor Mass. I wouldn&apos;t do it.&quot; Why not? &quot;This piece is too great for\u00a0me. That is not false modesty. The B\u00a0minor Mass comes from an enormous religious and contrapuntal upbringing. I\u00a0don&apos;t share that religious background, and I don&apos;t feel ready for all that counterpoint. It is a work I love to listen to, but I don&apos;t want to struggle with it and fall on my face. So I said I won&apos;t do it. In a way, it&apos;s very liberating, to say: &apos;No, goodbye!&apos;&quot; People play Mahler too loudOn the table, beside his iPhone (Haitink is a gadget freak, according to his wife Patricia), is the score of Mahler&apos;s Song of the Earth. The composer&apos;s symphonies will take up most of the next two years. &quot;People play Mahler far too much,&quot; he says, surprisingly. &quot;My worry is that Mahler is performed louder and louder to make a success.&quot; This is the opposite of Haitink&apos;s considered, architectural approach. &quot;When I was very young and I started playing Mahler in London, the halls were half empty. Now he has this enormous popularity. Any orchestra that wants a success goes on tour with a Mahler symphony. Mahler said, &apos;My time will come.&apos; But I&apos;m not sure how pleased he would have been.&quot; With the CSO, Haitink is touring four\u00a0other composers he loves: Haydn, Mozart, Brahms and Bruckner. I wonder how he can find Bach&apos;s music too religious yet feel an affinity with Bruckner, one of the most devoutly Catholic composers. &quot;This music speaks to me,&quot; he says. &quot;Yes, there is a very strong Roman Catholic feeling, but\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.&quot; His words dry up, so I try again. Does he find Bruckner&apos;s music \u2013 the Seventh Symphony, say \u2013 a spiritual experience? &quot;It&apos;s very difficult to talk about this,&quot; he\u00a0says at last. Far easier simply to conduct it: as ever with Haitink, the performances will\u00a0do the talking.", "sentences": ["For many music-lovers, Haitink is the living embodiment of Dutch musical culture: he was made principal conductor of Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw Orchestra in his early 30s, a position he held for nearly 30 years."], "title": "The passion and pain of Bernard Haitink", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/22/passion-and-pain-bernard-haitink", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Proms", "Culture", "Gustav Mahler", "Bernard Haitink", "Conducting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-25T15:00:30Z", "article": "It&apos;s the London Design festival this week, and the capital is celebrating its creativity. But if you&apos;ve been reading the International Herald Tribune or watching the BBC recently, you might wonder if there was much reason for merriment. Last month, design critic and former head of the Design Museum, Alice Rawsthorn, suggested that \u2013 at least in some respects \u2013 British design isn&apos;t what it used to be. Then what happens? Philippe Starck pops on our TV screens in a reality show called Design for Life, with a brief to &quot;save British design&quot;. There&apos;s just one problem: if there&apos;s one thing that the London Design festival repeatedly demonstrates, it&apos;s that there is no such thing as British design. At this week&apos;s official opening, mayor Boris Johnson regaled his guests with such glories as &quot;the, um, phone box \u2013 and, of course, um, Harry Beck&apos;s tube map&quot;. These cliches sustain the myth of British design genius. But design, like architecture, is fast becoming post-national. How do you classify a product designed by a German educated and based in London for a French brand manufactured in Italy? One of the showpieces of this year&apos;s festival is Jaime Hay\u00f3n&apos;s giant chess set in Trafalgar Square. It&apos;s lovely not just because of the workmanship of the man-size pieces, but because it is the festival&apos;s first public-spirited gesture in the six years it has been running. The colourful Hay\u00f3n himself is a Spaniard living in London, while his chessmen were born in the Veneto region of Italy. Not far away in Covent Garden, at the Aram Gallery, is a show of brilliant flatpack bamboo furniture by Amsterdam-based Israeli-Austrian Jair Straschnow, each piece full of craft ingenuity and innate social intelligence. Out west, in the South Kensington neighbourhood that blossoms once a year as the Brompton Design District, you can see an exhibition of work by Dutch designer Dick van Hoff in a former garage. This &quot;industrial tailor&quot; has created evocative hand-blown glass vessels fitted with what look like saw handles. Across the road, the Victoria and Albert Museum is tackling the timely theme of the return of narrative to design, in a show. The stars of Telling Tales are the likes of Dutch designers Tord Boontje and Jurgen Bey, of whom the former heads the Design Products department of our cherished Royal College of Art, and the other teaches there. Over in the east, meanwhile, drop in on a collective of young RCA graduates called Okay Studio. These wonderfully talenteddesigners live in London and hail from Holland, Spain, Israel and Norway, among other places. Or, if your tastes are more classic, visit Jasper Morrison&apos;s semi-secret little shop just down the road; you&apos;ll find perfect but anonymous designs hand-picked by Britain&apos;s celebrated minimalist, who happens to live in both Paris and Tokyo. My point is that British design is increasingly like Premier League football: it&apos;s not about British players. London is a nexus of international talent, training and investment watched by a global audience. By the same token, neither is the iPod a British design simply because Jonathan Ive, leading a team of thousands at Apple in California, is a Briton. When Rawsthorn complains about the design of new post boxes, phone boxes and buses, she&apos;s not really complaining about the decline of British design. Really what she&apos;s bemoaning is the decline of British services \u2013 the Royal Mail, public transport, banking. Politicians in the UK love paying lip service to design almost as much as they do measuring its net worth \u2013 \u00a311.6bn, according to Boris \u2013 but they are not patrons of it. National design declined when national manufacturing began to die. Ask any design-world insider for their highlight this week, and there&apos;s a chance they&apos;ll say it was the Established &amp; Sons&apos; party, hosted by this most glamorous of British furniture brands, known as much for its celebrity-studded parties as for exclusive designs such as Zaha Hadid&apos;s \u00a3180,000 table. What most of the guests won&apos;t have known is that although the company set out with the slogan &quot;Made in Great Britain&quot;, it proved an impossible ambition. Now it manufactures in Italy and India, just like everyone else. It is unfortunate that we make so little here, but what the London Design festival draws attention to each year is what a design hothouse the city is. Designers flock here from all over Europe to study and work here; the city is an international hub of ideas and dissemination.

Hidden behind a deceptively dull front door in the Vieux Port area, Casa Honore is an extremely hip option. Black, white or glass walls set the minimalist tone, but the rooms also have a few North African accessories, several green lamps strung from long wires around the bed, and contemporary art. Breakfast is in a beautiful black kitchen with French windows opening onto a balcony overlooking the pool. Did we mention the pool?

Old Market B&amp;B - Vilnius      Old Market Guesthouse, Vilnius, Lithuania     At this new Old Town pad, the corridor walls are papered in the type of floral patterns usually found on a Topshop summer dress and the rooms are, somewhat bizarrely, themed as different sorts of markets - flower, chocolate, sweets, fleamarket and er, fish and animal. Thankfully the code doesn&apos;t extend to smells and sounds, though &quot;animal&quot; has funny pictures of squirrels and otters splattered across one wall - it looks cool though, trust us. There&apos;s no doubting this is a fun place to stay - the flora room has a greenboard wall you can scribble on with chalk for example, plus breakfast is organic and the staff can arrange anything you need - transfers, theatre tickets, even a night out with a local guide.  \u2022 00 370 5240 4923, oldmarket.lt. From \u20ac55 per double, \u20ac65 for a triple. Bread and Butter - Bruges This unique B&amp;B defies the norm with its aesthetic quirks - a psychedelic orange 60s bath, vintage wallpaper, salvaged furniture, and its most prized accessory, Arthur the house cat. But apart from all that its most unusual feature is that it has only one &quot;vintage guestroom&quot; - making it one of the most exclusive budget stays on the planet. It also makes a virtue of having an old fashioned TV instead of internet connection, and proudly boasts that you get Belgian chocolate for breakfast. \u2022 00 32 5033 4726, breadandbutter.be, doubles from \u20ac75 B&amp;B. Floroom - Florence You&apos;ll probably be spending your days wafting through dusty galleries full of Rennaissance masterworks, so for a bit of a contrast, the Floroom in Oltrarno will bring you back to the future with its four funky double bedrooms, featuring aluminium framed beds, blow ups of black and white photos, walnut furniture and bathrooms separated by sand-blasted glass. Breakfast goes beyond the typical Italian espresso - fresh fruit, cereal, yoghurt, cheese and prosciutto, and a freshly baked cake - left all day for guests to help themselves. The B&amp;B is an apartment at the top of a residential building, and there isn&apos;t much space, but the fact it&apos;s designed and run by a local couple with backgrounds in fashion and tourism really shows. \u2022 i-escape.com/floroom.php.

Aquarius B&amp;B - Ghent      Aquarius Boutique B&B, Ghent, Belgium     Ghent is a city that&apos;s serious about style, so of course it takes the B&amp;B concept to another level. At Aquarius, cow hide rugs cover exposed beams, rooms have red leather chaise longues, flatscreen TVs, free standing oval baths, designer radiators and abstract art. Three suites include a loft room and a pool house opening out onto a smart spa area, with slate tiles, a heated indoor pool under a huge curved glass ceiling and an outdoor area with funky wooden sun loungers and hot tub. It&apos;s still a home rather than a hotel though, with breakfast artfully presented among exposed bricks and low lights. A nearby bus stop gives access to the city&apos;s historic centre, and the B&amp;B is a great base for exploring Brussels, Antwerp and Bruges by train. \u2022 00 32 477 501 365, aquariusboutique hotel.be.

The enthusiastic and passionate owner is determined his guests make the most of their trip, so expect to be armed with all the local tips required to live like a Lisbonite. The four rooms are simple, smart white and bedding and furnishings come in primary colours.

Baudon de Mauny - Montpellier  It&apos;s rare to find a chic chateau hotel in the centre of a city - and even rarer to find a boutique pad in Montpellier, despite the fact that it&apos;s France&apos;s fastest growing city. What has been a family-run hotel particulier since the 18th century has been transformed by the 7th generation heir and his wife into an upmarket B&amp;B. Its five vast suites have been jazzed up with Cole &amp; Son wallpapers, regency chairs, silk curtains and designer lamps, while keeping the flagged stone floors and decorative cornicing. Breakfast is in a fabulous room with little tables, red sofas and panels of golden silk, and the food is equally tasty - custard - filled pastries, fromage frais and fruit salad. Owner Alain can arrange private dinners with a chef (as well as after hours tours of the Musee Fabre nearby) or there are tons of places to eat right on the doorstep.  \u2022 i-escape.com/baudondemauny.php. Doubles from \u20ac160 room only. Breakfast costs \u20ac15pp. Nouvelle Vie - Brussels  This classic late 18th century building in the Ixelles district is as quintessentially Brussels as chips with mayo, peeing statues and Tintin. It&apos;s a classic townhouse with oak floors, decorative ceilings, marble fireplaces and antiques, along with three pretty guestrooms in pale shades, featuring ornate headboards, oriental rugs and embroidered bedspreads. Breakfast means baskets laden with waffles and pastries in a sunlit room whose impressive glass wall has floor to ceiling views of the garden. Though it&apos;s really a B&amp;B, the owner is something of a foodie and is more than happy to cook her favourite Italian dishes for dinner on demand. \u2022 nouvellevie.eu.

Leeson Inn Downtown - Dublin With its regency armchairs upholstered in hot pink, gilt fittings and antique vases full of roses creating the vibe of a Georgian drawing room, the Leeson&apos;s very grand lounge could be a culture shock after an afternoon in a scruffy Irish pub. By contrast its 25 rooms are a bit on the beige side, but they&apos;ve still got a contemporary design. This is a handy option for exploring the historic centre, the National Art Gallery, National Museum and the shoppers&apos; heaven - if you can stomach the euro price-tags on familiar brands - of Grafton Street. There&apos;s an airport shuttle service and breakfast is a proper Irish, although it costs \u20ac10.  \u2022 00 353 1662 2002, leesoninndowntown.com. Doubles from \u20ac45, room only.  Amsterdam at Home - Amsterdam  An elegant black facade with big square windows on a quiet side street near Nieuwmarkt Square hides a cosy home from home, run by Christel and Hans. There are only a couple of rooms - one for B&amp;B customers, which has wooden floorboards, subtle cream and white decor, pretty furniture, and a private apartment with its own entrance, kitchen and a double bed. You&apos;re likely to end up sharing a drink or three with the jolly owners in the evening - and they also rent bikes and organise private boat tours. \u2022 00 31 644 388 289, amsterdamathome.eu.

Le Lumie - Modica, Sicily The city of Modica, in the Ragusa region of Sicily is a gorgeous, higgledy piggledy mess of ancient winding streets, jostling over the hillsides and speared with palm trees. Tucked into the labyrinth near the Duomo di San Giorgio, three modern B&amp;B rooms around a courtyard have bold colour walls, damask rose or silver-grey wallpapers, wooden floors and multicoloured mosaic showers, while outside there&apos;s a terracotta terrace littered with sun loungers. There&apos;s no restaurant or bar, but you can use the kitchen and the owners also run Torre d&apos;Oriente, a hugely successful seafood restaurant. \u2022 00 39 932 751 439, lelumie.com.

Art Bed &amp; Breakfast - Oslo &quot;The colour scheme is genuine 1980s, but we don&apos;t charge extra for that,&quot; jokes the website for this B&amp;B boat in Oslo harbour. We can&apos;t sell it on style, but this is a fun option as you stay in your own en suite cabin on board the MS Innvik - and it&apos;s also good value for a seriously pricey city. The renovated cruiser also has a deck cafe, theatre and, that rare joy, a disco . . . for families (so thankfully it has early closing and a no techno-till-dawn music policy).  \u2022 0047 22 41 95 00, new.msinnvik.no.

Bedrooms have exposed brick walls, and a bounty of hip flourishes, with neon yellow or grey blankets on the beds, modern artworks and ceiling height windows. Taking your time over breakfast on a city break may seem a waste of precious sightseeing hours but here the vast spread of pastries, sausage, cheese, cereal and cool common areas in which to hang out, featuring a funky white sofa with red cushions and oversized bulbs dangling from the ceiling will make you linger longer. Apartment rooms with their own kitchens are available too and larger and more lavish suites are planned for the future. \u2022 00 34 93 342 7880, thefiverooms.com.

White to move. RB Over the next six weeks Dan and I will be announcing our shortlist for the fourth Guardian Chess Book of the Year award. I start today with Chess Strategy For Club Players by Herman Grooten (New in Chess, \u20ac25.95). According to Grooten, the book is for &quot;ambitious club players and tournament sharks&quot;. Often such books follow a tediously familiar pattern. The author selects a number of fairly recent games from a database, annotates them \u2013 with Fritz lurking in the background \u2013 throws in a few diagrams and groups them in whatever thematic arrangement suits his ostensible purpose. Grooten&apos;s book is different. The focus is on strategy rather than tactics. It&apos;s about what happens when the opening is over. At certain points, depending on the type of position, concrete calculation will be needed. But in a substantial part of the game there is nothing concrete to calculate. What do we do then? Obviously, we try to improve our position while creating weaknesses in our opponent&apos;s. The beginner will usually attempt improvement by mounting an attack. But, even for more experienced players, finding a good plan once the opening phase is concluded is not easy. When I looked at the position in the diagram \u2013 Grooten&apos;s challenge is to &quot;find a plan for White&quot; \u2013 my eye instantly fell on the tactical try 1 Bxh5, with the obvious idea that if 1... gxh5 2 Qd1 with an excellent attack for White. Even if Black declines the sacrifice by 1... Nf8 White simply plays 2 Be2 with a pawn to the good. This seems to me a valid line, but in the game White found 1 Nh1. What on earth is that about? The answer is strategy. White takes advantage of Black&apos;s powerlessness to improve the position of his knight, bringing it to g5 via f2 and h3. Once there, all White&apos;s pieces are poised to mount an irresistible attack. If you like the look of 1 Nh1, this is the book for you. chess@guardian.co.uk", "sentences": ["Piket-Van Baarle, Amsterdam 1984."], "title": "Ronan Bennett and Daniel King on Chess: Book of the Year", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/29/chess-book-of-the-year", "tags": ["Chess", "Sport", "Books", "Sport and leisure"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-09-29T20:08:00Z", "article": "The European commission announced an overhaul of the EU&apos;s VAT system today in its latest attempt to prevent its much-vaunted carbon trading system being riddled by multimillion-pound fraud. Criminals who for years had been ripping off VAT from finance ministries around the EU on the trade of items such as mobile phones and computer chips have recently moved in on Europe&apos;s \u20ac90bn (\u00a381bn) carbon market. Last month Revenue &amp; Customs raided 27 businesses and private addresses across London in relation to a suspected \u00a338m VAT fraud on carbon credits. It has since released nine suspects on bail but the investigation is continuing. With just two months to go before the Copenhagen climate summit in December, the EU is desperate to get its house in order as it tries to get its form of &quot;cap-and-trade&quot; carbon trading scheme adopted around the world as a key weapon against carbon emissions. Officials know that a carbon market leaking millions to VAT &quot;carousel&quot; fraudsters would be difficult to sell on the international stage so it has moved quickly in response to a surge in VAT fraud on carbon this summer. Brussels said it would harmonise policy between EU states and introduce a so-called &quot;reverse charge&quot; mechanism, which would remove the need for VAT to change hands between carbon traders every time carbon credits are sold. Surge This was the method adopted by the Dutch government in July as carbon traders noticed a surge in trading volumes that could only be attributed to fraud. The French government simply removed VAT from carbon markets, while the British made carbon trading zero-rated for VAT purposes. The three countries are home to the bloc&apos;s main carbon exchanges: Climex in Amsterdam, BlueNext in Paris and London&apos;s Climate Spot Exchange and European Climate Exchange. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, the European commissioner for taxation and customs, said: &quot;VAT carousel fraud is against member states&apos; finances and they should have the means to combat it efficiently. However, actions taken against this fraud should be taken in a consistent manner across the EU and clear evaluation criteria should be established. &quot;Very recently, several member states have been confronted with carousel fraud related to greenhouse-gas emission allowances \u2026 the very high mobility of these allowances and the very high amounts at stake are an important element.&quot; A Treasury spokesman said: &quot;The UK government took decisive action in July to protect taxpayer revenue from the threat of VAT fraud on carbon credits. &quot;We support the commission in seeking an EU-wide solution and will consider any proposal carefully.&quot; Missing trader In its simplest form, the fraud occurs when a trader of credits in, say, Britain, buys some from another country free of VAT, then sells them on within Britain, charging the VAT to the buyer. The seller then disappears without handing the VAT over to the taxman. This is known as &quot;missing trader&quot; fraud. Some criminals re-export the credits, reclaiming VAT as they do so, then re-import them again. They can do this repeatedly, reclaiming VAT many times, hence the term &quot;carousel&quot; fraud. Britain lost billions of pounds to carousel fraud, mainly on mobile phones, in 2006 and 2007 before the government changed the mobile trade to &quot;reverse charge&quot; VAT, meaning the tax was only levied on the final buyer and removed from the supply chain. The European Union&apos;s carbon market is now worth about \u20ac90bn a year. It is a combination of futures and spot trading and it is the largely unregulated spot market that has been targeted this summer by the fraudsters. Sophisticated The European police agency, Europol, has said it is convinced many other carbon credit VAT frauds have been committed across Europe but the total losses to national governments are largely unknown, although probably run in to the hundreds of millions of euros. &quot;This represents a considerable degree of sophistication on the part of the fraudsters,&quot; said Andrew Roycroft, a tax lawyer with Norton Rose. He noted that the commission had also empowered member states to bring in a reverse charge on other items where fraud is suspected, including trade in perfume and in precious metals such as platinum \u2013 widely used in jewellery and catalytic converters in cars. &quot;There is clearly a problem in more than one member state and not just in the markets for mobile phones and carbon credits,&quot; he said. Richard Ainsworth, professor of VAT policy at Boston University, applauded the commission&apos;s move as a short-term fix. But longer term, he said, countries could fix their VAT systems and make them fraud-proof by introducing a system of certified tax compliance software that firms would have to use to prove their legitimacy.", "sentences": ["The three countries are home to the bloc&apos;s main carbon exchanges: Climex in Amsterdam, BlueNext in Paris and London&apos;s Climate Spot Exchange and European Climate Exchange."], "title": "Brussels targets carbon trading fraud ahead of Copenhagen summit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/29/carbon-trading-carousel-fraud-eu", "tags": ["European commission", "Emissions trading", "Business", "Environment", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-01T18:14:17Z", "article": "The 1960s was when ephemera became non-ephemeral. Starting from small boutiques in Chelsea, Mary Quant and Barbara Hulanicki conquered the known world and Jean Shrimpton was crowned queen; Alan Aldridge proved that covers sold Penguins; each successive Beatles album sleeve became as collectable as the vinyl within; David Bailey inspired Michelangelo Antonioni to mythologise the scene in his movie Blow-Up; and Time magazine pronounced the benediction. With the passing of the 60s, none of this curled up into yellowing heaps of fading memory. Instead, it has gained a quasi-immortality in the salerooms and on eBay \u2013 among it the early work of\u00a0the artist Michael English, who has died aged 68, after five years of suffering from bone marrow cancer. English&apos;s epiphany was the moment in King&apos;s Road, Chelsea, in December 1966 when he chanced upon the graphic artist Nigel Waymouth painting the facade of Granny Takes a Trip, London&apos;s first psychedelic boutique. Together they created a graphics team doubling up as a rock group called Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. This kind of music and this kind of pop art seemed natural bedfellows; both emerged from the art schools to which, before educationists pasted on an academic veneer, kids had no need of any passport but talent. English studied at Ealing art school in west London, where Roy Ascott had introduced an innovative method of\u00a0inducing creativity called the ground course. Ascott had studied at Newcastle upon Tyne under Richard Hamilton. And so it goes. Hamilton was the intellectual face of pop art, operating at a cool remove from the actual pop scene, commenting on it without being directly involved. Ascott was a facilitator, and English became the most prolific producer of pop art at the interface with the real admass \u2013 a potent mix of art nouveau with hard-edge sci-fi applied to disposable items such as union flag sunglasses, T-shirts, carrier bags, and graphics for the underground paper International Times. Most of all there were the posters, for the UFO (Unlimited Freak Out) club in Tottenham Court Road, for Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, in favour of saving the Earth (already), a glorious sunburst for a Hapshash album sleeve and, prescient of work to come, a sensual, vermilion painted mouth with gleaming white teeth spilling out tendrils blossoming into fat letters like lush tropical fruit spelling out &quot;Love festival&quot;. However amorphous the 60s prescription for love to save the world, in his own life those close to English testified to his kindness, warmth and loving nature. The unlikely source for the general burst of graphic creativity was the Victoria and Albert museum, that vast mausoleum of the art and artefacts of empire which nudged the zeitgeist with exhibitions of Aubrey Beardsley and the Czech genius of art nouveau, Alfons Mucha. The images emerging from the languid and insolent decadence of their spiralling line held immense appeal for the 60s generation, and Hapshash and the Coloured Coat made the most of it. English was born in Bicester, Oxford-shire, and, like a lot of children in service families, was constantly on the move. His early education was at a series of boarding schools. After the second world war his father, Nigel English, left\u00a0the RAF and worked for the electrical engineering firm Ferranti. Some of this may have rubbed off on his son, because when Michael tired of\u00a0the 60s scene after the total flop of\u00a0a\u00a0Hapshash musical gig in Amsterdam in 1968 (&quot;We lost the plot,&quot; Waymouth later confessed), he worked his way through to an unabashed style of hyper-real art celebrating the triumph of\u00a0commerce. The engorged lips of the love festival poster mutated now into lips blowing an improbably beautiful transparent globe of bubblegum or viscously spilling syrup. The fascination with surfaces produced possibly the best known of his pieces, the Coke bottle cap of 1970, bent after being removed by a bottle opener and splashed with liquid. The same year saw a crushed can of tomato juice spilling its thick red liquid, and an SR toothpaste tube with the paste oozing forth in a serpentine ribbon recalling the art-nouveau wrigglings of his first works. He moved on to industrial hardware, objectified like sexual fetishes: a wheel and pistons of a railway engine, an aircraft jet fan, a truck&apos;s diesel filling cap, a smashed bottle lying on a bed of moss. And in all these, the paint surfaces, the hints of rust, the dangerous edge of broken glass appear with a heightened fidelity that made him the must-hit target for advertising agencies. And so English loaned his talents to marketing the products of such diverse companies as Bertolli, Swiss Air, BA and Porsche. All along he yearned to go straight, to paint like a &quot;real&quot; artist. He went to the Seychelles for subject matter and came back, of course, with hyper-real natural imagery. He painted it proficiently but his real talent lay in romanticising the chill seductiveness of the machine age, a talent reprised with designs for special postage stamp issues in 2001 (old London buses) and 2004 (vintage motorbikes). His wife, Jaki, survives him, and is organising a show of his work. \u2022 Michael English, artist, born September 5 1941; died September 25 2009y", "sentences": ["Some of this may have rubbed off on his son, because when Michael tired of\u00a0the 60s scene after the total flop of\u00a0a\u00a0Hapshash musical gig in Amsterdam in 1968 (&quot;We lost the plot,&quot; Waymouth later confessed), he worked his way through to an unabashed style of hyper-real art celebrating the triumph of\u00a0commerce."], "title": "Michael English obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/01/michael-english-obituary", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Fashion", "Time magazine", "Pop and rock", "Posters"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-02T13:03:09Z", "article": "     The only existing film images of Anne Frank have been loaded on to YouTube by Amsterdam museum the Anne Frank House. The footage, from 1941, is the only time Anne has been captured on film. The 20-second footage uploaded to the museum&apos;s recently launched Anne Frank Channel shows Anne&apos;s neighbour on her wedding day. A 13-year-old Anne is seen nine seconds into the video, leaning out of a second-floor window to get a better look at the bride and groom. At the time of the wedding the bride-to-be lived at No 37 Merwedeplein, next door to the Franks at No 39. The scene was filmed on 22 July 1941, just under a year before the Frank family went into hiding above the family business. The family were discovered in August 1944 and Anne died in a Nazi concentration camp in March 1945. A shorter, five-second version of the video was given to Otto Frank, Anne&apos;s father, by the married couple in the 1950s. After Anne&apos;s published diary became widely known in the 1950s the couple recognised her in the film and contacted Otto. Annemarie Bekker, from the Anne Frank House, said using YouTube was a way to introduce the life of Anne Frank to people who may never have heard of her diaries. &quot;The footage is very moving and very unique because these are the only moving images of Anne Frank,&quot; Bekker said. &quot;The museum has had the footage for some time, but thought YouTube would be a good platform to show the film and the other films about her life. It&apos;s another way to bring the life of Anne Frank to the attention of younger people, and all people worldwide.&quot; The husband and wife, who are still alive and living in the Netherlands, were contacted by the Anne Frank House in the 1990s and provided the longer video. The video channel also includes excerpts from interviews with Otto Frank and Miep Gies, who helped to hide the Franks from the Nazis. The film has already attracted more than 275,000 views, with scores of comments.

You can see it in the way Pedro Almod\u00f3var&apos;s direction caresses Penelope Cruz in Volver and Broken Embraces and in the way Edvard Munch daubed his lovers on the canvas. The devotion of Amadou for his wife Mariam in the songs of Malinese band Amadou &amp; Mariam is almost tangible. Love wouldn&apos;t be love without mentioning Shakespeare&apos;s sonnets, especially sonnet 130. Now there is a study, featured in this week&apos;s Scientific American, that explains why being in love can be such a fruitful creative state. The study, led by German professor Jens F\u00f6rster, who lectures at the University of Amsterdam, strove to compare cognitive processing styles of people experiencing or imagining love versus sex. F\u00f6rster and his team think love is a wee bit more complicated than Darwin&apos;s evolution theory would have us believe. Neuroscientists and evolutionary psychologists have agreed that love is not just of a symptom of sexual desire and our drive to procreate but a defined psychological state, albeit interconnected with the brain&apos;s sexual urges. The premise of the study is based on a psychological concept called construal level theory. This means that things that we feel distanced from by space or time are thought about in a different way than the immediate: the mind acts like a zoom lens. If we feel passionate love, then we have a mental overview that stretches into the future. This has us fantasising in Technicolor about the cake at our wedding, or the chances of &quot;our&quot; children having cute freckles on their noses just like our beloved. Whereas if it&apos;s just sex, we zoom back, focus on the moment and think in a more detailed, analytical manner. This explains awkward, self-conscious, sober non-loving sex. If you think they are inspecting your cellulite, the shape of your willy, or your orgasm face then they probably are. And this is probably why the cliche of sex being better when you&apos;re in love is true; instead of focusing on that pimple on their backside you can actually release yourself to enjoy the experience. People tend to focus on how heartbreak or self-destructiveness and creative genius go hand in hand. Think of Bon Iver, Amy Winehouse or pretty much the whole of pop music. However, F\u00f6rster et al&apos;s study has shown that thinking about love \u2013 not only in a maudlin way \u2013 puts us in a broader frame of mind that this is closely linked to creative thought processes and even blocking analytical processes. This explains a few things. The suspension of my analytic faculties when I am in love is much to my friends&apos; merriment. They say: &quot;Oh no! You haven&apos;t been sending love poetry again, have you?&quot; Usually, this is the bloke&apos;s cue to sprint away faster than you can say Linford Christie. On an anecdotal level, my experiences, and those of others I have straw-polled today, match up to the findings of the research, which was published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, a well-respected, peer-reviewed journal. The research was made up of two studies. There were 60 students in each group and they were split almost 50/50 male and female. In the first study, one-third imagined a romantic walk with their love, another a sexual encounter with someone they fancied but not loved, and the control group imagined a walk by themselves. Then they were all tested on creative tasks and logical tasks. The first lot fared better in the creative task and worse in the analytical task than the control group, and vice versa for the ones imagining the loveless slap and tickle. In the second study, the method was similar, but this time the students thought they were engaged in research into attention tasks. Then they were given words, some among them that implied love or copulation, and the control group got a random jumble of letters. The subconscious influence of these words hidden in the text, such as &quot;loving&quot; or &quot;erotic&quot; caused parallel results to the previous, overt study. In the discussion of their findings, the authors suggest that platonic love has the same characteristics as romance, in that there&apos;s an element of wanting to be friends forever. They also speculated that: &quot;The focus on details in sexual situations may prevent people from acknowledging the complex personality of their partners.&quot; This means boringly sensible advice about fools rushing in may be upheld by social science. As mentioned in Scientific American, it&apos;s worth noting that this research signifies that love and sex are factors that colour our entire way of viewing everything in our lives.

We make our ice and I usually check on that first. The next hour or so is spent on admin. Our clients include film directors, ad agencies and party planners. We&apos;ve done a lot of work for celebrities \u2013 Justin Timberlake, Sir Elton John and Sir Philip Green have been clients. It doesn&apos;t make any difference to us though; a client&apos;s a client. We switch the phones through to the studio around 10.30am and start sculpting. We don&apos;t have any moulds and 80% of what we make is a one-off, so this job is physically and mentally demanding. We sculpt at room temperature but if it&apos;s very refined work, we work at -24C. We have two freezers, one for storing finished pieces of work and one for ongoing pieces. You have to work at speed with ice. It&apos;s like a runaway train but I&apos;m used to it; it&apos;s like a performance in a way. Once I start something I like to keep going, but if it&apos;s a difficult piece we put it in the freezer and come back to it. That way you get the best results. Our workspace is customised for our needs. We need good drainage. All our waste is water, so we&apos;re eco-friendly. We smooth the work off on aluminium benches which my brother-in-law made \u2013 they&apos;re all at the right height. Our tools are Japanese. They hold an edge well and feel good to hold. We always stop for lunch. If you don&apos;t stoke the fire it goes out and this is a physically demanding job. Ice is heavy and you need to be strong to lug big blocks around. We all have arms like gorillas. I like the variety of work we do. I&apos;m hand-carving 400 tiny swans for the starter course at a wedding next month. That&apos;s technically difficult in terms of getting the timing right. Commercials are short and punchy and you have to hit the ground running. My favourite work is photography. It&apos;s very demanding because, regardless of whether it&apos;s a big or small sculpture, the camera is highly critical. Ice is the most beautiful thing to work with. Each piece is different. I once did a commercial in Amsterdam and the director wanted the ice to fracture rather than explode. It worked very well in rehearsals. I prepared 16 blocks of ice for the shoot and not one of them worked. That&apos;s ice for you; it&apos;s powerful stuff \u2013 it can knock down mountains, after all. We usually stop at 5pm but if we&apos;re working on a film or a commercial, it can be well after midnight and has been as late as 4am. Have a passion for what you do is my motto. Don&apos;t accept anything less than your very best. I&apos;m passionate about all aspects of the job I do, from the lighting and presentation to the dismantling of the sculpture. I&apos;m always asked whether I care that my work melts but it&apos;s an exercise and once it&apos;s done it&apos;s done.

Murray, who is half Moroccan, remains in jail there and may now face trial for the robbery in that country. He denies the charges. Murray and Allen, a 31-year-old father of three from Chatham, Kent, grew up together in south-east London. Both were martial arts experts and steroid-users, although it was Murray, nicknamed &quot;Lightning&quot;, who had an international reputation as a cage-fighter \u2013 even if he preferred the term mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. Allen acted as his minder and driver. They trained together, hung out in clubs together and were eventually accused of robbing together. Allen had previous convictions for the relatively minor offences of possession of an offensive weapon, drink-driving and affray and was not high on the police&apos;s radar after such an audacious crime. The pair were already on the run by the time the first arrests were made in England. They went first to Amsterdam, then drove south through Spain to Morocco. For a while the two friends lived the good life in Rabat, staying in a villa in the expensive part of town, going clubbing at night, taking cocaine and spending heavily in the Megamall \u2013 Rabat&apos;s flashy shopping centre. But, unwittingly, they were drawing attention to themselves: it was rare for two single men to be sharing a house so locals thought they must be gay. They were also spreading large sums of money in the casino \u2013 a classic money-laundering tactic \u2013 where it was possible to buy \u00a3100,000 worth of chips and cash them in for different money a few hours later. They had already drawn the attention of the local police, following allegations they had beaten up a Moroccan after an argument. The day their life on the run came to an end was meant to be a relaxed one, watching England play Portugal in the World Cup football finals on a big screen in the Megamall. Allen had just parked their Mercedes when he noticed a large group of men, many in tracksuits. &quot;Who are those guys?&quot; he asked Murray, thinking they looked like a football team. Moments later, they had their answer. A transit van drew up and men armed with guns and batons jumped out. The men in tracksuits whipped out their own automatic weapons. Moroccan police said later that the men resisted arrest, while Allen claims they realised they were outnumbered and swiftly surrendered. He claimed they were punched and &quot;picked off the ground and run through the Megamall like a battering ram&quot;. The Crown Prosecution Service wanted Allen and Murray to return to Britain to face trial but, on his lawyer&apos;s advice, Allen decided to fight extradition. Murray, with his Moroccan nationality, was entitled to stay and face the local criminal justice system. Allen was taken to the jail, which housed 4,000 prisoners, where he was held in the &quot;hole&quot;. &quot;It was like a cave, I could only stand in the middle of it,&quot; he said later of the cell. &quot;There was water dripping down the wall and no electric light. The food was boiled slop, uneatable \u2026 rats came up from the toilet, you would feel them on your leg and it was cockroach-infested. It was my worst nightmare, beyond belief. It was very traumatising.&quot; He remained there until the British embassy was able to get him moved. It was 23 months before he lost his extradition battle and was finally flown to Biggin Hill airport en route to his trial. &quot;I&apos;m just glad to be home,&quot; he said after touching down. Allen pleaded not guilty at his first trial earlier this year and went into the witness box to claim he had been completely unaware of any plot, although the police believed his role was as one of the heavies used to intimidate Securitas staff during the robbery in which the depot manager, Colin Dixon, and his wife and child were held hostage. He acknowledged he had trained with Murray on a daily basis but said mixed martial arts was &quot;no more violent than any other contact sport&quot;. He admitted taking steroids \u2013 he lost 14kg (30lb) of mostly muscled bulk in prison \u2013 but denied they had any side-effects. &quot;It&apos;s a load of rubbish that they make you aggressive.&quot; He said he was angry with Murray when he realised the robbery had taken place. Allen told the court he would never have taken part in a crime in which a woman and child were involved. &quot;I am not a monster,&quot; he said. He admitted he had bought a miniature camera \u2013 which was later used by the gang&apos;s inside man at the depot \u2013 but denied that he knew it was for a criminal purpose. At one stage he had to be told by the judge not to make a speech to the jury, after he had pleaded with them: &quot;I can&apos;t take no more. Do I really deserve 25 years or the rest of my life in prison for buying a car or a camera?&quot; Five other members of the gang are already serving lengthy sentences after being convicted in an earlier trial that ended in February. Lea Rusha, Stuart Royle, Jetmir Bucpapa and Roger Coutts were given indeterminate sentences with a minimum of 15 years. Emir Hysenaj, the inside man who had previously worked at the depot, was jailed for 20 years. The investigation cost \u00a35 million and more than 100 officers were involved. Of the \u00a353m stolen, only \u00a321m has been recovered. Murray may now face trial in Morocco. One other man, believed to be possibly in the West Indies, is still sought.

The insurer said it wanted to list a minority stake in the business on Euronext&apos;s Amsterdam exchange in November, in what will be Europe&apos;s largest flotation in more than a year. Most analysts welcomed the decision to boost Aviva&apos;s capital base at a time when regulators and investors were concerned about the insurer&apos;s balance sheets. Aviva has a 92% stake in Delta Lloyd, which sells life and pension policies in Holland and was the only major Dutch insurer not to have received a capital injection during last year&apos;s financial crisis. Aviva chief executive Andrew Moss said in August that he wanted to sell part of firm and the entire Australian business to move up a gear in the search for bargains and allow for further debt restructuring.

Critics also argue the sale has been partly triggered by a failed attempt to change corporate governance rules that limit its control over Delta Lloyd. Aviva has only two seats on the eight-member supervisory board.

And just as at the project&apos;s original incarnation in Amsterdam earlier this year, there was some festively enthusiastic booing at the Salle Pleyel \u2013 but I&apos;ll come on to that in a minute. It&apos;s a surprise to realise that Var\u00e8se wrote less than classical music&apos;s most famous miniaturist, Anton Webern. Despite the monumentalism of Var\u00e8se&apos;s work, his dreams of a new universe of sonic possibility that takes in everything from ancient mythological arcana to ultramodern electronics, it is possible \u2013 just \u2013 to cram his entire completed oeuvre (as well as some of it finished after his death in 1965 by his amanuensis, Chou Wen-chung) into just a couple of concerts. A couple of pretty long concerts, mind you: I saw the second performance in the Salle Pleyel, all three hours of it, with Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s conducting the Orchestra Philharmonique de la Radio France, the Asko/Sch\u00f6nberg Ensemble and Capella Amsterdam. Musically, it was a triumph. Nobody knows this music better than E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, and the big pieces were magnificent, like Arcana, D\u00e9serts and, especially, Ecuatorial, my new favourite Var\u00e8se work: the whole two theremins, organ and voices combo is one the 20th century&apos;s boldest and bravest sounds, sounding like a church service on Mars, and simultaneously prophesying B-movie soundtracks and Stockhausen at his craziest. The smaller works were excellently handled, too, like the virtuosic barrage of Ionisation, with its 13 percussionists, or the air from another planet of Density 21.5 for solo flute. But to hear Density, you had to put up with Jeanette Landr\u00e9 performing in a Tron-like get up, a dress that looked in outline like one of those loo-roll holders in third-rate B&amp;Bs, but whose contours were picked out by yellow LEDs. Landr\u00e9 was helped out of her costume by three more Tron-ified minions, and my question was a simple one: why? But watching Gary Hill&apos;s visuals over the whole evening, which also included poetic aphorisms by George Quasha projected on to the ceiling and walls of the Salle Pleyel, and live, filmed micro-theatre from Christelle Fillod, Els van Riel and Charles Stein, I finally realised that &quot;Why?&quot; was really the wrong question to ask. There were connections, sometimes, between what we saw and what we heard, like Stein&apos;s mythological menagerie of amulets, charms and symbols, which were projected during Nocturnal and Arcana, or the gradual accumulation of sand over a loudspeaker in D\u00e9serts, or the abstract computer-ography of the images for Ionisation. But Hill&apos;s point was not to find a particular collection of images as metaphorical resonances for Var\u00e8se&apos;s music, but rather to conjure up a constantly changing visual improvisation (which he controlled in real time from a vast computer screen) that would sometimes be in sync with the music, and sometimes not. This risky approach often didn&apos;t pay off, thanks to the trite pseudo-profundity of Quasha&apos;s texts, and the banality of Hill&apos;s source material \u2013 a computer-rendered image of a brain in a box, some abstract geometry, a shot of rippling water, another of a bubbling hot spring, none of which came close to rhyming with Var\u00e8se&apos;s elemental music. But in the continual flux and foment of visual information, there were moments of real illumination, especially in the cascading computerised vortices Hill found for Ionisation. Hill&apos;s way of working is the exact opposite of Bill Viola&apos;s technique in his film for D\u00e8serts a few years back, in which the brilliance and craft of the visuals had something powerful to say to the music (have a look in not very high YouTube quality here). But Hill&apos;s project is the more ambitious, and the more dangerous. And because it&apos;s so open-ended, there&apos;s time for Hill to develop it again by the time it comes to London in April, when the music will be performed by the London Sinfonietta and the National Youth Orchestra. I&apos;m looking forward to seeing how the ideas change between now and then \u2013 by which time, maybe it won&apos;t be booed: a devoted claque of anti-Hillites waited patiently until the end of the performance at the Salle Pleyel to boo him passionately. Gamely, Hill came back on stage with his team to boo them back.

Topics include the rebirth of Far Cry 2, employment law and how to get away with murder. Literally.  Remember, if you&apos;re out and about and spot an interesting videogame ad, someone dressed as Sonic the Hedgehog, or something else vaguely game-related, take a photo (in landscape format), then send it to gamesblog + at + googlemail + com. There&apos;s no prize beyond the pride of seeing your masterpiece on a national newspaper website... Chatterbox - w/e September 25By Craggy Island The week began with the controversy surrounding Manchester United&apos;s late, late winner in the derby win over City [Arghhhhhh! Just as I&apos;d recovered! - Keef] as well as other chat about the weekend&apos;s results. Sheep also embarrassed himself with his list of who the most annoying &apos;cockney&apos; teams are. Spurs only 5th and the Hammers as bad as Millwall. He is, as the Cockneys themselves might say, &apos;having a laugh&apos;. Here is the list in full:  1= Millwall, West Ham3) Chelsea4) Crystal Palarse5= Spurs, Arsenal7) Fulham8) QPR9) Charlton10= Brentford, Barnet, Leyton Orient  Mercifully, talk then turned to the big event of the weekend: the London Skyride and the small blog meet-up in Waterloo afterwards. In attendance were myself, Lazybones, Crispycrumb, Davefalse and CunningStunt. We were also joined by MrsCraggyIsland and MrsCrispycrumb. In the words of Crispy,   &quot;@Meeting bloggers Awkward. Long uncomfortable silences. Weird stares. But enough about CunningStunt! Lovely to meet Craggy and davefalse yesterday after the bike ride&quot;  Much booze was consumed and this may have led to Crispy&apos;s next comment, &quot;Lazy you fool. I had so much of your Bloody Mary down my leg it looked like I&apos;d been dry humping a bottle of ketchup. Did you manage to get your bike home?&quot; In the end it was decided that it was Davefalse who was actually responsible for the spillage and the tipsy Lazybones was blameless. Unfortunately we couldn&apos;t get Cunningstunt&apos;s take on the incident as by this point he had made his slightly sudden drunken exit. Let&apos;s hope that he managed to get the tube in the right direction this time! BeardofBees then tried to turn conversation on to more &apos;game-y&apos; matters by mentioning a TV show named Second Skin, all about online gamers:  &quot;One guy was 35, and had no job, no relationship or family, all of his utilities had been cut off and then his house foreclosed, and had to hobble around on a zimmer frame because he&apos;d done his back in playing World of Warcraft too much. Amazing. A few weird couples that had met and got married through games. Also some more normal folks and some good commentary about games and online worlds in general. One guy who&apos;d written a book about &apos;synthetic worlds&apos; made a telling point - if we lose people so entirely to these worlds - which they love because they&apos;re not judged for being ugly, or shy, or whatever - what kind of comment is that on the real world we&apos;ve built for ourselves on the outside? Some sad stories. Recommended.&quot;  Spinky led us onwards into a discussion about the ethics of &apos;rubbing&apos; in racing games after he received abuse from what he termed &quot;Gotham snobs&quot; online at NFS: Shift. Some boxers thought that it was acceptable to do whatever it took to win, whilst others were firmly of the opinion that it was game wrecking. I guess that it depends on the game? There was a renewed enthusiasm for Far Cry 2 this week as well, probably helped by the fact that it was less than a tenner in HMV at the time. Lots of love for it from a lot of people, though it does sound as though you have to devote an awful lot of time to it? Then things careered off on a slightly grisly tangent. Prospective criminal mastermind BeardofBees provided his thoughts on getting away with murder:  &quot;Mrs bees asked speculatively recently what I&apos;d do if you accidently killed someone? As in, would I cover it up or go to the police? &quot;I said I&apos;d go home whilst making various phone calls to mates saying I was in the pub or something. I&apos;d go around the back and into the garden whereupon I&apos;d strip off and rub myself all over as thoroughly as possible with dirt, mud etc. Totally scrub hair and nails and everything. Then leave the clothes in the garden and go indoors, trying to touch as little as possible. Up to the bathroom, under the shower for 20 mins cleaning thoroughly. Back out with a pair of tongs and put the clothes into a bin bag, tongs in the bag too, and take the whole thing to the tip at the earliest opportunity. Go home, relax. The wife was pretty horrified. Do normal people not think these things through?&quot;  Apparently some of the &apos;normal&apos; people on here do. Alfie, Rusty and Mollocate all seem to have something planned for &apos;accidents&apos; and so does Davefalse: &quot;If I ever &apos;murder&apos; someone accidentally I&apos;d probably go straight to the police and admit manslaughter. Not sure I could handle the guilt otherwise.&quot; [This quote then descends into an American Psycho-esque fantasy that i thought more sensitive readers could possible live without... Keef] Luckily, there was an alternative conversational thread on offer: which &apos;Soap&apos; is the best and/or boasts the most attractive cast. Talk then turned to celebrity bore-fest Strictly Come Dancing. Davefalse was on a bit of a roll at this point:  &quot;This will possibly be the most embarrassing comment I&apos;m ever likely to post, but I really quite enjoy Strictly. Sit around with my housemates bitching about how rubbish everyone looks and dances while being entertained by Bruce&apos;s &apos;funny&apos; comments, and fit dancers wearing very little. I even voted one year when Mark Ramprakash was on. Worryingly, it&apos;s one of only about a couple of shows I make sure to watch.&quot;  To add to the odd nature of the days chat, a &apos;discussion&apos; then broke out about what is acceptable language/humour for use on the blog. It is best not discussed any further except to say that at the end of it opinions were still very divided. Uncleben had the last word: &quot;Good lord. Your various employers must have suffered today.&quot;  11 pages of chatter, and little that can be safely repeated. Possibly the most foul-mouthed day in Chatterbox history. The next day things got back on topic with a discussion about game length. The dilemma was short and sweet (Dead Space, Batman etc) versus massive and time consuming (Oblivion etc). Obviously both sides had their champions and it isn&apos;t impossible to love both. From the type of characters that we get on here I would have predicted that there would be a fair bit of anal-retentive ordering/alphabetising of things and I wouldn&apos;t be wrong. We seem to have some that are worse than others but StainlessStyle&apos;s take on it is quite interesting:  &quot;@Putting things in order. I do it by colour. Which really doesn&apos;t help you find anything unless you can remember what colour the spine is. However looks pretty. I am becoming a female cliche.&quot;   whilst Simian has a different take on things:  &quot;DVDs are organised by genre on specific shelves (from top to bottom it goes Porn (yes, I admit they&apos;re on permanent display which the missus just laughs at). Under that is martial arts, action, thriller, drama, TV series, comedy, chick flick. Then, within each shelf they&apos;re organised by A-Z from left to right as you look at them.&quot;  Smellavision takes the prize though:  &quot;I have 6000+ comics. Alphabetical ordering, by title, is the only way to go. It&apos;s a bugger when a title gets a name change, or when an issue 0 comes out, or they start renumbering. I&apos;ve spent weeks with piles of comics on the floor sorting them out - now I just need to record which issues I actually have!&quot;   Or so he thought. Here comes Beardofbees...  &quot;I feel I should comment on OCD stuff as I have a reputation as a high-ranking geek to uphold and my lapsed DVD/CD/Book collections don&apos;t do the job. Board games then. My board games, of which I have about 60-70, are organised by size. Mostly they are stood on their side like books which takes more space but stops the dreaded box compression which happens when you stack them. All a publisher&apos;s titles are generally together, more because they are the same size than anything else. Some games have very large boards, and sideways storage can warp these, so some are stacked horizonatally, but always making sure that equal size boxes only are stacked, so their corners line up exactly and take the weight. &quot;All components of the games are carefully bagged up in polythene bags or paper envelopes. No rubber bands are used on cards as they dig into them, and over time also degrade and go sticky. After playing, all bits must be carefully sorted and put back into bags before the box goes away.There. I am your king once more.&quot;  This fascinating conversation about alphabetising and storage couldn&apos;t last forever though, and eventually, in that charming Chatterbox way, talk turned to something much more scintillating... keyboard layouts. And then specifically the &apos;windows key&apos;. If anyone has ever wondered about the power that it holds let Cunningstunt and Beard fill you in:  &quot;I use windows + e to open explorer and windows + L to lock the pc all the time. Also windows, up, enter, enter to shutdown.&quot; &quot;From Vista onwards it&apos;s invaluable. Don&apos;t bother clicking to launch a program. Want to launch powerpoint? Hit windows key, type &quot;powerp&quot; or something, hit return. Job done. Also windows-M minimises so you can see the desktop.&quot;  Another of the blog&apos;s perennial favourite topics also raised its head with Silveryfox after advice about quality TV shows to watch on DVD. Most of the usual suspects were mentioned (The Shield, West Wing, Deadwood, Generation Kill, I Claudius (HenryPootle), Band of Brothers, Prison Break, Dexter, Rome, Sopranos, Firefly, Madmen). In the end, lucky little Foxy got sent Band of Brothers as a loaner from the exceptionally generous Supersmashin. Nice fellow. [Lost, for heaven&apos;s sake, Lost! Every gamer should watch it - Keef] Friday morning could offer up no more excitement than chatter about the rumoured inclusion of cross-game chatter on the PS3. Opinion on it seemed to be divided. Those with 360s were bigging it up and saying that it would be a great addition. This from Umboros:  &quot;@PS3 Voicechat This could well be the final step in matching 360&apos;s online capabilities. Like others have said, voice chat in games where it is a necessity is often poor on PS3. This could fix it. I might need to get a better headset when this comes through. Lack of headsets is still an issue, but at least I can annoy friends who have the black machine to get one now.&quot;  Meanwhile, those with PS3s didn&apos;t really seem all that fussed, such as Pootle:  &quot;@Voicechat in front of others... Mrs P knew I was sad before she started going out with me (I worked in the IT department, while she was all glamorous in Buying) and has now known me intimately for eight years... There is no shame any more. She does find it funny though.&quot;  We also got into a discussion about downloading from the interwebz, brought on by the excessive pricing of new games like Uncharted 2 and MW2. This then moved on to music and videos etc. A lot of people found agreement with what Sheep had to say on the topic:  &quot;It&apos;s tricky, especially with stuff you can see or hear for free on radio or TV, but I am happy to say that if something is available to buy then you should not be downloading it using torrent sites. If it&apos;s not available (i.e. because there is not a large enough market, not because it is awaiting release) then I don&apos;t see the problem&quot;  Whereas a lot of people will find more sympathy with the returning RobLindsay:  &quot;Unfortunately \u00a345 seems to be par for the course with regards to new &apos;AAA release&apos; games these days. Rip off Britain is alive and well, might try to import things from Gamestop again now our prices have risen so much...&quot;   Only other news from the week was that Goody apparently won some competition or other on a football game on the PS3. I guess that he should be congratulated? Games: Uncharted 2 chatter, Infamous, Footy game demos, Batman AA, Halo ODST, Trine, Monkey Island, C+C3, IL-2 Sturmovik, More MHFU, Prof Layton 2 and Pandora&apos;s box, Fallout DLC, MUA2... Music: John Martyn, Editors, Interpol, Joy Division... Films: Blackbook, Frost/Nixon, Black Hawk Down, Miami Vice, Warriors, Outlander, Religious, Crank 2, Ironman, Sin City... Quotes of the week &quot;Gemma Atkinson is kind of attractive, but I had only really noticed her in that &apos;Calendar Girls&apos; advert. Having said that - it&apos;s Jill Halfpenny who really caught my attention ... so much so that I dreamt I had won a date with her. At the end of the night she seemed intent on me coming in for &apos;coffee&apos; but I couldn&apos;t work out if this was part of the prize, whether she thought I was genuinely charming; or maybe she would want me to pay her for sex. All this confusion woke me up.&quot;Lazybones &quot;Batman - I need to get this back off a mate. He has grand ideas of 100%. Not on. I have grand ideas of \u00a325 trade-in, and soon. He&apos;s also in the throes of a new relationship after a looong wait. The idea of me losing money because he&apos;s having lots of new sex doesn&apos;t sit well with me.&quot;Uncleben &quot;I don&apos;t like it when radio or TV volume levels are on odd numbers. It sounds funny.&quot;HenryPootle &quot;A man behind the counter at Foyles bookshop engaged me in conversation. Looking back I think he was hitting on me. I&apos;ve still got it...&quot;Crispycrumb Best of chatterbox - w/e October 2By Beardofbees As the darkening of days heralded a farewell to September and a final drawing-down of the last lazy summer nights, the Gamesblog did not mourn the loss of the season&apos;s warmth or the fading evening light. For in the videogame calendar, this is now a special season; the beginning of Gametember, that magical interlude when major release after major release hits the shelves for the consumption of the gaming public. Some would say these releases are timed to be Christmas purchases, but only the most feeble of true believers would wait to be given a new game when they can buy it themselves on release day. Reinforcing this stance through the validation of our peers, Chatterbox was on hand as ever to usher in the new month. &apos;Kicking off&apos; the week with what would later be revealed as an auspicious first post, silveryfox began a discussion on the demos that landed over the weekend. At last we came to it - the great battle of our time - as the newest titles in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer franchises waged war for the hearts and minds of gamers. Of the two, it seemed that FIFA was doing a number on the gamesbloggers&apos; minds; the new advances and robust gameplay convincing many that the series is now the one to beat. But for loyal fans, their hearts still belong to PES after all these years, and toppling such emotional attachment will be tough indeed. Gaming chat was soon interrupted by moral outrage, as Simian revealed that his annual leave at work is frequently cancelled at the eleventh hour by the powers-that-be, such a thing again being threatened this week. Rallying around in a defence of worker&apos;s rights that would have made the Tolpuddle Martyrs proud, the Gamesblog encouraged our ape-like chatterboxer to stand up and stick it to the man this time. It remains to be seen how the fallout of this develops, but I think we can speak collectively when we say to Simian: no employment law advice is given or implied by the chatterbox and the Gamesblog cannot be held responsible for the consequence of any action arising out of its usage. We&apos;re behind you all the way, buddy. As Monday developed, work didn&apos;t seem to want to play fair for any chatterboxer. &quot;Anyone else know what it feels like to have stress physically pulsing out of your eyeballs?&quot; asked Makar27, to some weary nods in reply. Even TonyHayers claimed to be very busy, and when this happens there is clearly something wrong with the world. Luckily, FerrisSaved was able to restore good humour with a tale of woe that had befallen a double-glazing fitter doing some work at his property, who had discovered a wasps nest, gotten stung, and suffered an allergic reaction requiring the attendant gamesblogger to inject him full of medication. Fast-thinking enough to do all of this and still report live on the chatterbox during the ongoing emergency, the blog was impressed with the performance even as they questioned the man&apos;s priorities in a crisis. Into Tuesday, where silveryfox claimed another first post of the day, and where the games of the moment were Halo: ODST, picking up both praise and critique from the gamesblog, and Far Cry 2, which despite having been released for a long while saw something of a second surge in popularity within the chatterbox. Perhaps the discovery of the game in a major retailer&apos;s sale for ten pounds this week had something to do with getting the tight-fisted &apos;bloggers to give it a chance. [I&apos;m getting deja vu - Keef] Conversation took a surreal turn in the afternoon, with the gamesbloggers debating (inspired by Call of Duty: World at War&apos;s &quot;Nazi Zombie&quot; mode) the likely attributes of various nationalities&apos; zombies, as well as, for some reason, the subscribed religion and acting prowess of Whoopi Goldberg. Actual real-world concerns were never far away however, as the ongoing saga of Roman Polanski then reared its head. Those calling for his prosecution and severe punishment were balanced against those who still owe the man a debt of gratitude for making it possible to see vast arrays of bare flesh during an English lesson at school, thanks to his 1971 film adaptation of Macbeth. Whatever his dubious personal history holds, such fine treatment of the bard&apos;s work will not idly go forgotten, Mr. Polanski. A high-spirited and obviously entirely hypothetical conversation about what sorts of substance intakes were acceptable in Amsterdam these days soon gave rise to Wednesday, where silveryfox surprised precisely no-one by taking the first post of the day once more. A dedicated hat-trick for the Gamesblog&apos;s earliest riser and speediest presser of the F5 key indeed. Chat soon began in earnest around the broadcasting of Gameswipe, a satirical look at the world of videogames by Charlie Brooker that had been aired the night before and was well covered by the Guardian Gamesblog writers themselves. Those who had enjoyed the programme pointed to its sharp writing and comprehensive coverage of the medium, the remainder feeling short-changed by the light touch of the piece and lack of substance for the already die-hard gamer. Almost unanimously however, the chatterbox agreed that a full series of Gameswipe would be no bad thing, allowing him to write more segments for the veteran gamer and to silence the voices of the critics crying for such material. Brooker&apos;s hands are as safe as any, it seems, in which to place responsibility for the rescue of games from the current mainstream media. As the afternoon jogged over the horizon, the chatterboxers fondly remembered gaming milestones from their past; those glorious memories of victories over friends or achievements earned back in the days when Microsoft or Sony didn&apos;t even pop up a little window in recognition of your effort. ToMadeira elegantly encapsulated the spirit of the debate with the following tale of misery:  &quot;One of my mates once picked Dhalsim for me on SF2 and claimed I had picked him myself. Things kicked off, our respective brothers joined in and we were sent home after a massive scrap. We all didn&apos;t speak to each other for literally months after that. I did NOT choose Dhalsim.&quot;  Those who&apos;ve grown up around games have all been there, my friend; the bitter memories run deep indeed. Into Thursday and you could have knocked us all down with a feather as silveryfox was out of the traps like a bullet yet again, claiming first for the fourth time in a row. It was talked about only in hushed whispers, but barely could the &apos;boxers wait another day to see if he could pull out an entire week&apos;s worth of victories. But wait we were forced to, although talk of the Uncharted 2 demo which had been released kept us all amused for some time. The press seemed to consider this title the second coming of gaming, with ten out of ten reviews piling in thick and fast. Lots of love for the demo was found on the Gamesblog too, and it was soon proven that a great many chatterboxes are getting suitably hot and sweaty about this title being released.  To counterbalance such geeky joy, several chatterboxers then took to proving themselves not entirely antisocial, and discussed an upcoming Gamesblog meet-up scheduled over the next few weeks in London. Veterans of the chatterbox will remember several previous episodes where the &apos;bloggers dared to meet, although these were historically still based around games - Capcom&apos;s Monster Hunter events in London during August. This time, an entirely games-free evening of meeting, boozing, and trying to appear normal awaits those brave enough to attend. &quot;I&apos;ll be slumped in the corner shouting at the TV,&quot; promised TonyHayers, by way of identification and to alleviate the doubts of anyone having second thoughts about the quality of the company on offer. The afternoon&apos;s chat was occupied with cats: owning, admiring, feeding, having them run away and/or despising the entirety of their species with an unchecked and terrible loathing, depending on who you asked. CBPodge was on hand with a valiant attempt to get cultural: &quot;Books written in first person are better than books written in third person. Discuss.&quot; he instructed, although nobody did. A frothy-mouthed and energetic discussion about grammar did occur however, the main battlefields being the usage of apostrophes and the acceptability of beginning a sentence with a conjunction. Nobody can accuse the chatterbox of disregarding the arts entirely. Time was called on the day to the chorus of eager discussions around both TV personality chefs and spouses that are purchased over the Internet, both groups being feared and mistrusted in equal measure. &quot;Do they come with a cooling off period?&quot; asked SuperSmashin, &quot;Do John Lewis do a price match?&quot; although it wasn&apos;t clear whether it was chefs or Thai-brides he was interested in. An attempt to bolster the PR image of both groups through a television series depicting various chefs buying, and then cooking for, mail-order brides of various nationalities was sadly not formulated by the chatterboxers, taking the prize for missed opportunity of the week. [Or how about a show in which TV chefs are offered as mail order brides? Imagine paying your cash and having Antony Worrall Thompson turn up on your doorstep with his suitcases and a hopeful glint in his eye... Keef] Finally into Friday where, as if there was ever any doubt, silveryfox triumphantly claimed his five-in-a-row of first posts. &quot;It&apos;s going on my CV,&quot; he proclaimed proudly, to the cheers of his adoring public. FIFA was available on shelves, leading to a good deal of chatter around where to procure it from, and plans were formulated for online fixtures over the weekend. Amipal took the opportunity to show off some online pictures he snapped at the &apos;Bovington Tank Fest&apos;, an event that split the gamesbloggers right down the middle as to whether it was the best and most enthralling show on Earth, or a depressing indictment of humanity. Mention of the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123 quickly led to a savage attack upon the person of John Travolta, RustyJames declaring that the actor has only ever been in one good film. With gusto the Gamesblog set upon the task of identifying the highlights of his career, hitting upon Michael, Phenomenon and Battlefield Earth along the way. Soon, the names of other A-list actors with a history of making rubbish films were being bandied about, and it was a good thing that the Gamesblog readership doesn&apos;t seem to include Kevin Costner, Harrison Ford or Eddie Murphy, all of which took a savage verbal beating from the chatterboxers. As the week dwindled away like the resolve of any chatterboxer who hadn&apos;t yet come to terms with the concept of buying FIFA 10 that evening, the flow of conversation turned to night terrors: those incidents of waking in fright, or experiencing a loved one walking about or otherwise acting oddly in their sleep. The end-of-week lull then brought many weary employees to the Gamesblog for solace, where fighting for control in a sudden explosion of chat were topics such as escort services, European cities to visit to enjoy the company of escorts, European cities to visit to enjoy a nice wholesome Christmas market, the lack of major advances in the current generation of gaming, cures for acid heartburn, the best musical acts to see live, and a moment of pure consumerist rage from OfficePest which ended with, &quot;Get the f**k out of my personal space before I batter you with my tub of chicken and sweetcorn sandwich filler.&quot;  A more fitting end to the week could not be found, and so with that, the chatterboxers slunk off once more to their dens for a weekend of wine, women, song, and the playing of football games until their brains dissolved into head-porridge. Quotes of the Week &quot;I agree, there is something unnerving about him, but then again I feel unnerved sitting by myself. Have taken to pulling the hairs out of my ears and worrying about the contrasting greys and blacks. I think it&apos;s slater&apos;s alcoholic eyes brooding over the puddings, he&apos;s a petri dish for resentment.&quot;mollocate focuses his keen analytical mind upon TV chef Nigel Slater.  &quot;I did hesitate with recommending the whole of Norfolk.

It&apos;s an absurd and obscene development, and one which has made embittered jackasses of the many respected folk who had predicted a return to past heights for the low country&apos;s national team. While Turkey travel to Brussels this weekend in search of a win that will keep alive their hopes of World Cup qualification, supporters of the home team no longer entertain any ambition beyond avoiding another bloody fiasco. Their chances? Poor to middling. Two days after Franky Vercauteren became Belgium&apos;s manager last April, one of the country&apos;s leading celebrity news websites exclusively revealed that he&apos;d been killed. For the 52-year-old things went downhill from there. Belgium have some of the best young footballers in Europe \u2013 Arsenal&apos;s Thomas Vermaelen, Lille&apos;s Eden Hazard, Manchester City&apos;s Vincent Kompany, Marouane Fellaini of Everton and Axel Witsel and Steven Defour of Standard Li\u00e8ge \u2013 but last month, five months after the erroneous declaration of his death and a couple of hours after a shambolic 2-1 defeat in Armenia, Vercauteren stepped down from his post. He left behind him the worst managerial record in the country&apos;s history \u2013 one draw and four losses from five matches \u2013 and a set-up so infected with ill-feeling that the entire medical staff resigned too, but not before offering a damning diagnosis of a generation of players that seems more blinged-up than golden. &quot;I won&apos;t make any comment on the sporting performances since that is not my remit,&quot; said Marc Goossens, who had been the national team doctor for 26 years. &quot;But the mentality of some of the players is deplorable ... we got fed up with the many intolerable things that made it impossible for us to do our jobs ... they are pseudo-stars ... with the sick attitude of childish snobs.&quot; Vercauteren had been No2 to the previous incumbent, Ren\u00e9 Vandereycken, and had been hired specifically because he was thought to have the acumen to heal the fissures that were forming between the team&apos;s older players and the cocky new breed. That task proved much more tricky than anticipated. Throughout this campaign stories seeped out about players asking to be declared injured so they could skip training and go carousing instead; of players refusing to travel unless allowed to carry their gear in Gucci manbags; of a fight in a nightclub after the 5-0 defeat in Spain; of high jinks in a nightclub a few hours before the 2-1 defeat in Bosnia-Herzegovina; of substitutes refusing to play; and of an experienced player being dropped after turning up for a match without any boots. &quot;The players don&apos;t know what the top level is,&quot; groaned Vercauteren after his resignation. &quot;I tried to tell them what it means to be a professional but they don&apos;t want to listen. I picked them and they abandoned me.&quot; One of the team&apos;s veterans, the 31-year-old striker Wesley Sonck, was no lapdog of Vercauteren \u2013 indeed, when replaced with the team 2-0 down in Armenia he was heard to sneer: &quot;Oh, well done coach, we need three goals so you take off a striker&quot;. But he expressed sympathy for the manager after his departure. &quot;You don&apos;t know the half of what&apos;s been going on,&quot; he told the press. &quot;What can I say about our dear Red Devils? Not the truth, that&apos;s for sure. And I think that alone speaks volumes. I would have done exactly the same thing as Vercauteren.&quot; Most supporters have turned their back on the team \u2013 a grand total of one fan travelled to watch those dear Red Devils in Armenia (and the reason for his trip was the subject of much speculation by the country&apos;s comedians, the most common theory being that it was his way of asking his wife for a divorce). The media, however, is all over the team&apos;s travails. Vermaelen wrote a letter to a national newspaper to profess his commitment to the national team and call for the players to show renewed seriousness and unity, but his has been a lone pacifist voice. Vercauteren revealed yesterday that after making a mistake against Spain, the Portsmouth right-back Anthony Vanden Borre was ostracised by the rest of the squad. &quot;Vanden Borre was dropped by his team-mates, he didn&apos;t get the slightest support from his so-called chums,&quot; said the coach. &quot;You see what I mean when I say there was no team spirit?&quot; Another of the country&apos;s full-backs, AZ Alkmaar&apos;s S\u00e9bastien Pocognoli, was chided by Vercauteren for storming home after being withdrawn from a training match because the manager wanted to practise playing with 10 men so that the team would not be perturbed by red cards. &quot;I&apos;m not a bad apple,&quot; complained Pocognoli after press criticism. &quot;There are players with plenty of caps who are protected in Flanders and think they can get away with anything.&quot; &quot;The dressing room is divided into clans,&quot; claimed &apos;a source close to the team&apos; to the newspaper La Derni\u00e8re Heure. &quot;There is the [Daniel] van Buyten clan, the France-based players, the trio of [Timmy] Simons, Sonck and [Stijn] Stijnen, the guys from Amsterdam, the guys from AZ, and then, of course, the Standard and Anderlecht factions.&quot; The media has been accused of bias too. &quot;One of the Francophone newspapers has photos of the players in a nightclub before the match in Bosnia,&quot; claimed the Flemish daily De Morgen. &quot;But they won&apos;t publish them because all the players involved are French speakers.&quot; One of the few players to be considered neutral was Steven Defour, the 22-year-old midfielder who hails from Flanders but is the captain of Standard Li\u00e8ge, the flagbearer of Wallonia. But his status has been compromised by the toxic fallout from August&apos;s brutal Li\u00e8ge-Anderlecht clash, during which Anderlecht&apos;s Polish midfielder, Marcin Wasilewski, suffered a gruesome leg-break in a clash with last year&apos;s Belgian player of the year, Axel Witsel, who insisted it was an accident but was banned for three months nonetheless. &quot;Vincent Kompany used to be considered the brat of Belgium football,&quot; says the journalist Joost Houtman. &quot;But he seems to have matured and now there&apos;s a whole load of guys coming through who behave far worse than he ever did. They seem contemptuous of everyone but themselves, and they don&apos;t seem to see anything wrong with that.&quot; Last week a new manager, Dick Advocaat, arrived on a mission to foster improved relations and harness the team&apos;s undoubted potential. This week the Dutchman got an additional demonstration of how difficult that will be when Stijnen, the team&apos;s first-choice goalkeeper, announced his retirement from international football at the age of 28 after being called &quot;inexperienced&quot; by a member of the federation. If there is one team in which spirits should be high at the moment, it&apos;s Turkey.", "sentences": ["&quot;There is the [Daniel] van Buyten clan, the France-based players, the trio of [Timmy] Simons, Sonck and [Stijn] Stijnen, the guys from Amsterdam, the guys from AZ, and then, of course, the Standard and Anderlecht factions.&quot; The media has been accused of bias too."], "title": "Belgium turn on their own team as self-obsessed players hit new lows | Paul Doyle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/oct/07/belgium-world-cup-qualifying", "tags": ["Belgium", "World Cup 2010", "Turkey", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-08T14:10:36Z", "article": "Across four floors of an Amsterdam museum, 2,164 pages of six magnificent books, a free iPhone app, and thousands of images on an astonishing website, the fruits are being harvested of 15 years&apos; work \u2013 a unique project honouring an artist who was an utter failure in life. That artist, of course, was Vincent van Gogh, and, courtesy of the Van Gogh Museum, the world can now see for the first time every painting and every drawing that survives \u2013 and burrow ever deeper into how he made them. Director Axel Ruger calls Van Gogh &quot;the James Dean of the 19th century&quot;. The artist was 37 when he walked into the French fields he had been painting just the previous day, and shot himself in the chest. He had been painting in earnest for just 10 years. &quot;It is the romance of the unrealised promise,&quot; says Ruger. &quot;His story is so fantastic \u2013 it is one of the great what-ifs in art history: what would have happened if Vincent had lived.&quot; The exhibition, some sections of which will be loaned to London&apos;s Royal Academy for a separate show in January, provides as many answers as it can, bringing together over 120 letters, the largest selection ever exhibited, and hundreds of related paintings and drawings. It is subtitled &quot;the artist speaks&quot;. But he doesn&apos;t just speak; he enthrals. In the letters on show here he is often miserable, sick, hungover, scared, broke and sorry for himself. But he is more often gossipy, thoughtful, clever and hugely entertaining. He is never that wild man of Hollywood caricature, bellowing incoherently and hurling daubs of paint at the canvas. The exhibitions also bring together letters where separate pages have ended up in different ownership, and unite vivid thumbnail sketches with preparatory drawings and the finished paintings. The originals are fragile, light-sensitive, and after the show is over will go back into their vault, to be shown only by appointment to scholars (only 36 letters will reach London). But the Van Gogh Museum is also keen that the work should be made available permanently to a wider audience. To mark the exhibition&apos;s opening, six volumes have been published simultaneously in Dutch, French and English, transcribing every one of 819 letters the artist wrote \u2013 mostly to Theo, his brother, best friend and the man who kept him financially afloat \u2013 and 83 written to him. Alongside Van Gogh&apos;s own work, every print, painting or drawing he refers to, every artist he meets or mentions, every scrap of a book, poem or bible verse that he quoted (or misquoted), has been traced. In one letter, from Arles in May 1888, Vincent muses quite cheerfully to Theo on alcohol and depression: &quot;Take our sister Wil, she has neither drunk nor led a wild life, and yet we know a photograph of her in which she has the look of a madwoman.&quot; And there on the page is the photograph of poor Wilhelmina \u2013 looking perhaps a bit anxious and strained, but surely not actually mad. There is also a phenomenal website, launched last night, with a facsimile of every letter, which can tell you whether the paper is machine-woven or handmade, and whether it has a watermark. It all creates a slightly eerie feeling of looking over Van Gogh&apos;s shoulder as he writes \u2013 knowing, as he did not, where the story would end. The exhibition was officially opened by Queen Beatrix yesterday, but most of the gallery has been open all week: many people have come in the morning and stayed for an entire day. In a glass case on the first floor of the exhibition, there is a permanent queue to stare at one scruffy, creased sheet, with six enigmatic stains. The letter, the last the artist ever wrote, is one of the most famous in the history of art; every word has been pored over for evidence of Van Gogh&apos;s state of mind. In the gallery, people peer intently into the dimly lit case. On the website, you can zoom right in, and still not answer the ghoulish and irresistible question: paint, ink \u2013 or blood? That last missive began &quot;thanks for your kind letter and for the 50-franc note it contained&quot; \u2013 a phrase repeated so often that you wonder whether the curators thought of that as an alternative subtitle. It was never finished; it was found on his body on what Theo called &quot;that horrible day&quot; when he staggered back, mortally wounded, to the inn he had been staying in.  The penultimate letter Theo received, only a few days earlier, is also on display, one floor up. In it, Van Gogh is clearly not feeling great, but nonetheless includes lovely drawings of three pictures he is working on, and asks Theo to send more paints. &quot;Here,&quot; he writes, &quot;one can&apos;t find anything good in the way of colours.&quot; It doesn&apos;t read like the letter of a man who knows he will be dead before the week is out. The colours he wanted are not the ominous cobalts and chromes of the painting often \u2013 and wrongly \u2013 described as his last, but the calm tones of the oil sketch hanging a few feet away. It depicts a garden, described here as &quot;green and pink grass, on the left a green and lilac bush and a stem of plants with whitish foliage. In the middle a bed of roses.&quot; There is no catalogue for the show. Instead, several sets of the six massive volumes \u2013 I carried one back from Amsterdam, and was glad my hand luggage wasn&apos;t weighed \u2013 are laid out on tables on every floor in the exhibition. I watched one elderly couple, and a goth-ish teenager, sit side by side reading companionably for an hour. The drawings for one of his earliest works, The Potato Eaters \u2013 a claustrophobic crowding of near-grotesque figures around a table \u2013 are on the ground floor. Upstairs there is the painting itself. Vincent&apos;s letter to Theo explains that he was seeking &quot;the colour of a good dusty potato, unpeeled of course&quot;. Theo appealed to him to make the pictures just a little less muddy. Also included here is the devastating response to The Potato Eaters from the artist Anthon van Rappard: &quot;You dare to invoke the names of Millet and Breton?&quot; he demands. &quot;Come on! Art is too important, it seems to me, to be treated so cavalierly.&quot; Van Gogh, mortified, sent back the letter, and the friendship was broken. When the museum&apos;s staff started work on the project, they thought it might take five years to complete; in the end it took 15. The team were young art historians when they launched into it, middle-aged when they finished. One of the most difficult tasks proved to be tracking down every one of the ardently religious artist&apos;s frequent, and sometimes inaccurate, references to the Bible. &quot;We must have missed some,&quot; one of the editors, Leo Jansen, says wearily, &quot;but we really did our very best.&quot; For his part, although Axel Ruger takes a proper scholarly pride in the whole project, he seems secretly most chuffed with the iPhone app. He is constantly waylaying visitors to demonstrate its glories. &quot;Anyone, anywhere in the world, can carry around a pocket full of these letters,&quot; he says, grinning. &quot;It&apos;s just so cool.&quot; \u2022 Vincent van Gogh, the Letters is published in six volumes by Thames and Hudson.

We are interested in the latest sector reports and activities covering the gamut of our sector, ranging from editorial and commercial to operations and procurement. A case in point is that the deputy editor of our environment site Adam Vaughan emailed this morning to alert us to the fact that the BBC has just introduced an innovative business travel policy. Executives have been told they can only fly when travelling by train adds more than three hours to the journey. The edict, from the BBC&apos;s commercial arm, means that staff have to take the train to all domestic locations, as well as European cities as far afield as Strasbourg, Amsterdam and Bordeaux.In addition, they must formally explain why a meeting cannot be held using one of the company&apos;s five videoconferencing suites before they can book a long-haul flight. Adam was wondering if we could do the same. In fact, we are currently reviewing our current travel arrangements and we will now look at the BBC&apos;s approach to see whether it is something we could or should replicate. We hope to have a new policy in place early next year. Business travel at the Guardian is expected to fall sharply in 2009-10 because of the necessity to cut costs. Local taxis have been banned for all staff and overseas travel requires the agreement of a director.

Other actions we have already taken include reducing the impact of our staff travelling between home and work by creating storage for almost 200 bikes in our new offices in Kings Place. As a result, there is space for only three cars. We have new video-conferencing facilities, but need to see whether we can monitor use to know if they have an impact in terms of reducing travel.

His fashion pictures appeared in Vogue from the 1940s onwards, but he became known, too, for his portraits of writers, artists, celebrities, children and tradesmen, as well as his studies of tribesmen, nudes and still-lifes, which found beauty in decaying fruit or cigarette ends. He once claimed that &quot;photographing a cake can be art&quot;. One of Penn&apos;s preferred descriptions for his photographs was &quot;beatitudes&quot;. But rather than decorative Baroque angels, Penn&apos;s &quot;religion&quot; was defined by the utmost serenity and a deceptive simplicity, at the meeting point where form becomes style. This style, which showed a firm maturity from his early career, remained true whether applied to fashion or flowers, in colour or in black and white, in photographs taken in the US or Africa. In the encyclopedia Contemporary Photographers (1982), Penn&apos;s work is represented by Ospedale, taken in 1980. It shows an austere arrangement of a\u00a0cracked jug surmounted by a toothed skull and encircled by a rough crucifix, a scattering of ashes, and an unstoppered bottle of either medicine or poison. Such a composition painted in the middle ages might have appeared with a moralistic title, like Sic transit gloria mundi. Penn&apos;s picture, under the simple title &quot;hospital&quot;, can be read as a\u00a0very different parable of contemporary attitudes to life. Not that the world&apos;s glories passed him by, and he was ever a curious blend of the aesthete with the ascetic. He was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, the son of Harry, a watchmaker, and Sonia, a nurse. His younger brother, Arthur, became a well-known film director. From 1934 until 1938, Penn studied design at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art under the legendary designer Alexey Brodovitch, who would travel to Philadelphia each week from New York, where he worked for Harper&apos;s Bazaar. After working unpaid under Brodovitch at Bazaar, Penn spent a brief \u2013 but formative \u2013 period redesigning the advertising strategy for the Fifth Avenue department store Saks. He also began photographing Manhattan street scenes. He then spent a year painting in Mexico, which he later claimed gave him much of his insight into devising the starkness of lighting and simplicity of form that became two of his signal characteristics. On his return from Mexico, Penn was introduced through Brodovitch to Alexander Liberman, art director of Vogue, and became his assistant. Penn&apos;s first photographic work for Vogue, a\u00a0still life of glove, belt and purse, was published as the cover of the October 1943 issue. Over his long years with Cond\u00e9 Nast, publishers of Vogue, his photographs would appear on more than 150 covers. Some of his first incursions into professional photography were with the American Field Service during the second world war, assisting the British army in Italy and India in 1944-45. He\u00a0returned to Vogue as staff photographer in 1946. In 1950 he married Lisa Fonssagrives, a leading fashion model, with whom he continued to work. Yet he began to succeed in bending the rarefied ambience in which he moved at Vogue to admit a form of photography (including a black-and-white cover shot) that the magazine had never previously contemplated. He began, even, to admit his increasing restlessness with fashion and a growing interest in portraiture, influenced by the socially conscious work of Walker Evans and the meticulous documentation of domestic detail by the early French photographer Eug\u00e8ne Atget. Penn had the gift of taking inspiration from whatever source of influence he chose and then, avoiding the derivative, honing it down to its essence. Hence the much-vaunted sparseness of his work. Hence also the apparent anachronism of his captions. Together with the Mexican photographer Alvarez Bravo, Penn believed captions to be an integral part of the picture. A fleeting 1951 fashion shot of Lisa in a ballgown, there only in silhouette, was captioned Woman with a Handkerchief, one element vividly catching the light. In The Girl with Tobacco On Her Tongue (in the same year), a tobacco curl is scraped from the poking tongue by a pointedly long nail, sidelining the fashion accessories of hat, earrings and halterneck. Penn&apos;s eye for what verges on the mysterious and sinister was employed to perfection in his famous 1974 series Worlds in a Small Room, its title referring to the portable studio he took with him while travelling through Asia to Australia. Thanks to this, he could recreate his preferred blank background and shoot the &quot;mud men&quot; of Asaro or the peasants of Peru in the same neutralised setting as his fashion shots. His eye for often surprising detail, combined with the extreme formality of composition, and the contrast of chiaroscuro illumination, lends a New-York-meets-Rembrandt incongruity to all of Penn&apos;s work, regardless of its subject matter. By the 1960s, this paring down had led to a sequence of nudes as experimental in their own way as Bill Brandt&apos;s, but with meticulous exactitude replacing Brandt&apos;s contrived distortions. They were shown many years later in Earthly Bodies at the Marlborough Gallery in 1980. From the 1980s, Penn increasingly moved over to colour portraits, preferring flowers and still lifes to people. The paradox whereby even the most perfect bloom is also in a\u00a0state of decay intrigued him, as an awareness of mortality impinged. Such themes allowed him to refine his belief in the links between painting and photography, the aesthetic principles by which he could impose order on nature and so the world. Maurice Goudeket, husband of the French writer Colette, expressed Penn&apos;s capacity to shock with the familiar, describing his visit to photograph the novelist in 1951 at the approach of her 80th birthday: &quot;He took a stupefying photograph. It discloses all that Colette wished to conceal and of which she was no doubt ignorant about herself. In reality it was the hidden person we all have in us. A great portraitist \u2013 they are very few \u2013 is a sort of sorcerer who sees beyond resemblance.&quot; Penn&apos;s manner of working was highly unusual. According to Cecil Beaton, writing in 1975: &quot;Penn makes everything extremely hard for himself. He employs no gadgets, no special props, nothing but the simplest lighting \u2013 probably a\u00a0one-source light coming from the side of the sitter&apos;s head.&quot; Too true. In Penn&apos;s 1950 portrait of Beaton, one half of his face is in deep shadow while the other is highlighted, a perfect foil for the sweep of his black cape and the soft folds of his white cravat. It was a technique that proved equally well suited to Penn&apos;s portrait of a Coal Man (1950), whose leather helmet, with its long back-flap (against which he would carry his hod of coal) gleams black against the white of one shirtsleeve, though the shoulder is striped with dust. Both men are shot against the same studio backdrop Penn used regularly for his fashion shoots in the 1950s. Whatever the source of Penn&apos;s inspiration in Latin America, the fascination with abstractions about what was hidden and what revealed, or with the use of light and contrast over subject matter came, as Beaton went on to conclude, from his being &quot;dans le vrai ... it is the burning intensity of Penn&apos;s own being that puts the value into his pictures&quot;. In 1984 a retrospective was organised by John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and from 1987 Penn&apos;s work was exhibited regularly at the Pace-MacGill Gallery in New York. In 1996 Penn presented archives and prints to the Chicago Art Institute. His work is held in collections including the Metropolitan Museum and MoMA, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, the Galleria Civica d&apos;Arte Moderna in Turin, the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Fonssagrives died in 1992. Penn is survived by their son Tom, a step-daughter, Mia, eight grandchildren, and\u00a0his brother, Arthur. Veronica Horwell writes: Alexander Liberman, who, as art director of Vogue in 1943, gave Penn a job, remembered that the young man &quot;wore sneakers and no tie&quot;. Liberman thought him direct, clear and possessed of &quot;American instincts that made him go for the essentials&quot;. What Liberman understood was that Penn&apos;s view of the world, and\u00a0soon of fashion, was the equivalent of the hard prose of American literature, a technique of artful sparseness. Penn&apos;s\u00a0postwar return to Vogue as a staff photographer was perfectly timed, as\u00a0fashion turned sculptural even before Dior&apos;s 1947 collection made an extreme outline and a moulded shape the bases of the mode for 20 years. The details \u2013 hats, gloves, amplified sleeves and collars \u2013 were like wearable maquettes for bronzes, and that&apos;s how Penn shot them, so solid they could have been put on a plinth. The overall ensembles were meant to be seen as silhouettes, and that&apos;s how Penn pictured them, removing all superfluities except the poses of his favourite models, often gesturing with cigarettes, before a textured back wall. His 1947 portrait of 12 models allowed the tatty floor to show between their gowns. Sent to Paris in 1950 to\u00a0photograph the collections, he\u00a0borrowed a studio and shot by daylight with an old theatre curtain in lieu of the wall. Not all the drama in Penn&apos;s images was provided by the clothes, although his great 1950 Vogue cover of amused eyes and mouth beneath a hat veil and atop an insane bow is a romantic comedy in itself. He liked to project the\u00a0bold characters of his favourite models (including his wife) and tell a\u00a0story without a location and with few props. Look at his 1949 conversation piece, two\u00a0models (one wearing purposeful glasses) slouched at a table, reading, smoking, drinking coffee, their\u00a0bags dumped on the floor or over the chairback. It&apos;s a proposal about female independence of behaviour well over a\u00a0decade before it became fact. Even his wackier images, such as\u00a0Jean Patchett sweetly disordered in\u00a0a\u00a0crumpled bed, suggest women with\u00a0an inner life, and possibly a full-time job. He was enthusiastic about the assertive physical vocabulary women began to use by the early 1960s. The model Wilhelmina folds herself firmly into a Penn cover space, her boot balanced on the bottom of the frame. But he was less comfortable with the later 1960s sensation of fast movement in fashion photography, and with the formlessness of the garb. He arranged hippies against the same wall as for his dozen models in 1947, but their messiness and droopiness confounded his Shaker purity. Penn went on responding to couture with line and mass, and Issey Miyake wrote of\u00a0the pictures Penn took in the 1980s of\u00a0his designs, with their paper sculpture quality: &quot;The clothes have been given a voice of their own ... Here were my clothes, but shown in such a way that they appeared totally new to me.&quot; He finally stripped away even the wall as not minimal enough, in 1988 producing a sequence with no background at all. Christy Turlington simply existed, relaxed, on the bare pages. Penn also pioneered the beauty image as Vogue introduced substantial sections given over to cosmetics and skincare. He kept to the details, abstracted into a calm American surrealism (among his heroes was Giorgio de Chirico). His cool visions of glass bottles for advertisements for Est\u00e9e Lauder&apos;s medicalised Clinique line still dominate the business nearly 40 years later. \u2022 Irving Penn, photographer, born 16 June 1917; died 7 October 2009", "sentences": ["His work is held in collections including the Metropolitan Museum and MoMA, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, the Galleria Civica d&apos;Arte Moderna in Turin, the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London."], "title": "Irving Penn obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/08/irving-penn-obituary", "tags": ["Irving Penn", "Photography", "Art", "US news", "Fashion"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-11T23:10:00Z", "article": "It was the result Fabio Capello needed, although he will never own up to the benefit of seeing his side reintroduced to the truth about themselves. The England manager has a habit of emphasising his desire to win, as if this distinguished him from counterparts who presumably have a song in their hearts regardless of the outcome. The true difference lies in his ability to organise a side and keep its competitive spirit burning. England were fully committed in a fixture of no importance to them but they also suggested that they are not part of the elite. While the end of the perfect record in the group is regrettable there was a reminder that the side will have to make great improvements if they are to be a force at the World Cup finals. Above all England are doomed in South Africa should they be such a soft touch again. The defence swayed so often on Saturday that you felt seasick if you stared at it for too long. Robert Green conceded the penalty that Andriy Shevchenko squandered in the 16th minute by clipping the outside of the post as the substitute goalkeeper David James dived the other way. Green had been startled by Rio Ferdinand&apos;s failure to cut out a pass from the right and was tentative about coming to meet the impressive Artem Milevskiy, whom he brought down. James, at 39, has a laconic touch that meant he had no qualms about stepping into an arena where the England penalty area had been inundated in the first minute with flares hurled from the stands. &quot;Fortunately I was prepared to go on and had even taken my Pro Plus,&quot; said the veteran. Green had been on edge. Even so Ferdinand was far more blameworthy. The new career as saboteur appears to be coming along nicely. He had set up one of the Dutch goals in the Amsterdam friendly and has come up with the odd error for Manchester United as well. Ferdinand does not appear imposing for the time being but that may reflect his state of mind more than the condition of his body. The defender is extremely significant to England, since the alternatives lack his inherent quality. It was to be expected that Capello, in public at least, would brush aside the towering blunder. &quot;He made one mistake,&quot; said the manager. &quot;The ball bounced and he didn&apos;t judge the direction well. But after that he played a good game, like the other players. We had good chances to draw.&quot; Having been coaxed into agreeing that Ferdinand has not been dependable for his club, Capello then rallied. &quot;You cannot question his value,&quot; the Italian insisted. There is a rationale to that assertion but it is not a happy one. If Capello ditchedeveryone who causes him anxiety, he would condemn himself to building a new back four from scratch. John Terry had a moderate day and Glen Johnson keeps suggesting that he is a full-back mostly because it is a nice spot from which to hare off down the wing. Even Ashley Cole, who has been outstanding for Chelsea, was fallible at the goal. He tried a drag-back near his area and lost the ball. Vasyl Kobin raced across the face of the area and when he was tackled by Johnson possession ran to Sergii Nazarenko. The ensuing 25-yarder deflected off Cole, still trying to atone for his lapse, and beat James. Ukraine, who are virtually sure of a play-off slot, were also to hit the post inthe first half and there should be no cavilling from England. The 22-year-old Yevgen Khacheridi, on his debut, impressed in defence. The visitors did menace on occasion as they tapped the prodigious efforts of Wayne Rooney, who did the work of two players since England were a man down. &quot;It is incredible,&quot; said Capello. &quot;He can play forward, left, right, he defends.&quot; That will not count for much if eccentricity at the back undermines people like him, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, who went off with a groin injury at half-time. England&apos;s clean sheets in the group have come merely against Andorra, twice, and Kazakhstan. The situation is so ridiculous that it must be a priority at Wembley on Wednesday to keep Belarus at bay. Life would be better for Capello if he could coach the side out of its brittleness at the back but the blunders come, as in Ferdinand&apos;s case, from individual aberrations more than organisational failings. Everyone would find life easier if they could count on an efficient defence. Team-mates chose to display solidarity with Ferdinand. &quot;I think he&apos;s doing well,&quot; Rooney asserted outlandishly. &quot;Everyone makes mistakes. He knows he is a top player and he will forget about that. There is no need to go on too much about it.&quot; Terry, too, was emphatic. &quot;I don&apos;t feel for Rio,&quot; said the captain. &quot;I don&apos;t have to look out for him. He&apos;s suffered from a couple of injuries of late but he&apos;s one of the best defenders in the world. We&apos;re all human. After a mistake the good thingis that he doesn&apos;t just fade away. He&apos;s abig personality. We know we can all trust each other.&quot; Perhaps so but it may have done no harm for a chastened England to appreciate that they can be vulnerable even with Capello in charge.", "sentences": ["He had set up one of the Dutch goals in the Amsterdam friendly and has come up with the odd error for Manchester United as well."], "title": "World Cup qualifier: Ukraine 1-0 England", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/12/world-cup-qualifier-ukraine-england", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Ukraine", "England", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-12T22:00:00Z", "article": "England&apos;s players consider themselves blighted by their reputation as the &quot;golden generation&quot;, a moniker first granted them by the former chief executive of the Football Association Adam Crozier, with Frank Lampard stressing that they would only be worthy of the tag should they triumph at a major finals. Crozier originally coined the phrase for a crop of players that included Lampard, John Terry, Steven Gerrard, David Beckham and, more recently, Wayne Rooney during the giddy early days of Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s reign, but it has weighed heavy at times on the squad. Indeed, their failure to qualify for Euro 2008 prompted Lord Mawhinney, the Football League chairman and an FA board member, to bemoan: &quot;If this is the golden generation, the sooner we move away from the gold standard the better.&quot; Better times potentially lie ahead under Fabio Capello, with qualification for the 2010 World Cup secured ahead of Wednesday&apos;s final qualifier against Belarus, though the current crop still feel uncomfortable with the term. &quot;The whole golden generation thing is quite frustrating for us players,&quot; Lampard said. &quot;We didn&apos;t make it up. Adam Crozier did, and look what happened to him. It is difficult. People talk about the golden generation because we have a good crop of players. They are very talented individuals, but we have not made the most of it. We have all held our hands up to that many times. &quot;The golden generation should only be said once you have won something. Then you can be called the golden generation. Look at 1966 when they won the World Cup. That was a golden generation. It was said much too early about us, and people picked up on it, but by calling us that it was almost as if people were waiting for us to fail. We haven&apos;t followed through with it in terms of what people expected us to achieve, and the proof is always in the pudding. Once we have finished playing and, hopefully, have won something, then we can talk about generations and, at the moment, we are in better shape than we have been.&quot; While Lampard celebrates a decade as an England player with his own form thriving, one of the other key members of that much heralded group of players, Rio Ferdinand, is enduring a personal downturn in his fortunes. Niggling injuries over the past 12 months appear to have left him ring rusty, with lapses in concentration blighting his displays against Holland and Ukraine this season to suggest a return to the bad old days when the Manchester United centre-half was more prone to defensive aberrations. Ferdinand conceded last week that his inclusion in Fabio Capello&apos;s squad for the tournament next summer may hinge upon his retaining match fitness, though he will be anxious to offer a more watertight display against Belarus tomorrow to erase the memory of his 14th-minute blunder that allowed Artem Milevskiy a free run on goal, checked only by the unfortunate Robert Green&apos;s trip, in Dnipropetrovsk on Saturday. Likewise, the wayward pass that allowed Dirk Kuyt to open the scoring for Holland in Amsterdam in August. The vice-captain&apos;s team-mates have rallied round him in recent days. &quot;Rio is a very confident character anyway,&quot; Lampard said. &quot;He and John Terry have been the most consistent central defenders in Europe over the last five years. That is the universal view. Rio would be the first to stand up and say he made a mistake the other day. Without a doubt you need the big players and he is certainly a big player. I&apos;d much rather make a mistake against Ukraine than when the big games start. And more often than not, when the big games have come along, Rio has done well. He&apos;s played in two World Cups and been outstanding in both of them. That says it all. &quot;Any defensive mistakes are always a concern. But everyone makes them. You can make them in midfield or up front and get away with them sometimes. It is something that you want to eradicate. There will always be mistakes in football \u2013 that is why teams score goals \u2013 but the fewer you make, especially against the big teams at the big moments, will be the difference between winning something and not.&quot; Michael Owen has accepted his invitation to watch the game against Belarus and, according to his agent, Rhodri Burgess, will &quot;100%&quot; be at the game.", "sentences": ["Likewise, the wayward pass that allowed Dirk Kuyt to open the scoring for Holland in Amsterdam in August."], "title": "Frank Lampard: Golden generation tag has been a burden", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/12/england-frank-lampard-rio-ferdinand", "tags": ["England", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "Frank Lampard", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-12T23:05:10Z", "article": "Do you remember Freshers&apos; Week?

Blogposts for all five seasons will feature \u2013 as well as many, many of your comments, which have made this blog the great forum it is. Series three, episode nine     Bunny Colvin and Dennis Mello search for a location for Hamsterdam in The Wire. Photograph: public domain    Hamsterdam is probably The Wire&apos;s bravest and most radical storyline. Elsewhere the programme confines itself to describing problems \u2013 under-resourced and irrelevant schooling, sluggish bureaucracy, political corruption \u2013 but on the subject of the war on drugs it examines a possible solution. Over the course of this series, police chief Bunny Colvin establishes three drugs-tolerance &quot;free zones&quot; in derelict areas of Baltimore, and the programme carefully and even-handedly analyses how these would work and what the eventual political, media and public reaction would be. Quickly nicknamed Hamsterdam \u2013 a corruption of Amsterdam, &quot;one of those countries where drugs are legal&quot; \u2013 the experiment is successful in clearing drug dealing off residential street corners that had been blighted by the dealing and its attendant violence for years. We see peaceful corners presented like a dream or a fantasy, or a trip to the past, with neighbours hanging up their clothes, the radio trilling softly, kids rushing past to play games. In interviews, Simon has put his cards on the table, calling the war on drugs &quot;a venal war on our underclass&quot; and promising to vote to acquit any drug suspect if ever called up for jury service. &quot;Since declaring war on drugs nearly 40 years ago, we&apos;ve been demonising our most desperate citizens, isolating and incarcerating them and otherwise denying them a role in the American collective. All to no purpose. The prison population doubles and doubles again; the drugs remain,&quot; he and his fellow Wire writers wrote in Time magazine. But The Wire does not present Hamsterdam as a simple answer. The free zones themselves, while largely violence-free, are shown encouraging addiction and promoting disease and prostitution. (Colvin eventually invites public-health charity workers and harm-reduction experts into Hamsterdam to deal with these problems \u2013 an impressively undramatic, realistic touch.) Young children formerly employed by dealers as look-outs are laid off, leaving them idle and in poverty. The viewer is also invited to sympathise with the one person who lives in the derelict area, an elderly woman who tells Colvin: &quot;You say you&apos;ve got a programme that can place me somewhere else, but you ain&apos;t got a programme for what&apos;s outside my door.&quot; The writers are not afraid to point out flaws in the plan. In this week&apos;s episode Colvin&apos;s informal adviser, the Deacon \u2013 who has been harsh on Hamsterdam before \u2013 criticises Bunny for choosing to retire before seeing his experiment through. &quot;You managed a truce,&quot; he tells him. &quot;And making the game street legal takes the heart out of it. Keep it going, we&apos;re gonna reach some of those people chasing dope and coke, and maybe even some hoppers too.&quot; There has been some criticism from readers that the Hamsterdam storyline is unrealistic, with some even comparing it to McNulty&apos;s antics with the homeless in series five for breaking the show&apos;s informal rule that &quot;nothing should happen on screen that hasn&apos;t in some fashion happened on the streets&quot;. I concede it&apos;s unrealistic that the police bureaucracy wouldn&apos;t quickly get to hear of what was happening, but the policy itself echoes experiments tried by various governments and police forces, from Portugal to Brixton, as they struggle with the problems arising from the fact that so many people want to take drugs. As Steve Busfield has mentioned, Kurt Schmoke, the mayor of Baltimore from 1988 to 1999, was a vocal advocate of drug legalisation, which may have had some influence on the storyline.  David Simon and Ed Burns&apos;s basic point is this: the prohibition of drugs makes the situation worse, just as prohibition of alcohol ramped up the problems caused by alcohol in the 1930s. It criminalises swaths of society, fills prisons with non-violent offenders, facilitates the creation and enrichment of violent gangs, forces those who use drugs to use adulterated, dangerous products, brings the law into disrepute, and costs vast amounts of money that could be put to better uses. In their book The Corner, Simon and Burns describe &quot;the absolute futility of trying to police a culture with an economy founded on lawbreaking&quot;. Talking of lawbreaking, last week&apos;s episode ended with a very tense scene between drug kingpin Avon Barksdale and his No 2, Stringer Bell, where Bell revealed he&apos;d had Barksdale&apos;s nephew D&apos;Angelo killed. Yet, curiously, everything seems to be fine between them when we see them back together this week, Avon even saying encouragingly of their business woes: &quot;We gonna be back where we was, String.&quot; It&apos;s as if all has been forgiven \u2013 and it serves to dissipate a lot of the tension that had built up at this point. In a later scene in this episode, when Barksdale&apos;s sister, Brianna, confronts them both, Avon seems more explicably upset and conflicted, brooding, failing to make eye contact, taking his anger out on his sister instead of String. But in that earlier scene he seemed to be more annoyed about Bell&apos;s allowing Omar&apos;s grandmother to be shot at on a Sunday. This shooting is a rather baroque outrage, and stretches the credibility of The Wire&apos;s gripping themes of honour and respect almost to breaking point. Slim Charles yells: &quot;I&apos;m standing holding a torn-up church crown of a bona fide coloured lady&quot; as a funeral service echoes behind him, while Omar himself seems to believe he could safely take his grandma to church every month because &quot;ain&apos;t nobody in this city that low down to disrespect a Sunday morning&quot;. It&apos;s entertaining, but none of it really rings true.            Quote of the week: an indignant Omar on his blissfully ignorant grandma: &quot;That woman think I work in a cafeteria \u2013 at the airport!&quot; Running totals Murders: still on 50, but Prez does accidently kills another policeman \u2013 a distractingly overdramatic subplot for this point in the series?

Nestled by a canal, its suitably poky interior plays host to a vast array of strange and wonderful DVDs for rent and sale, two floors of the kind of old-school marginalia its name implies, its place in movie culture legend further secured by being the spot where Quentin Tarantino reputedly ran up (and ran out on) $150 in late fees while writing Pulp Fiction in the Dutch capital.  It was, through British eyes, all a bit of a time warp. Not only did standing in a video shop feel anachronistic, not only were most of the shelves given over to the kind of vintage nuggets that corrupted my youth, but the very notion of the cult movie itself felt out-of-time. For me, the mention of &quot;cult&quot; induces a soft-focus glow of nostalgia, it&apos;s a relic from the same era as the much-mourned late-night double bill \u2013 one that in its broadest and most fun definition took in everything from Warhol&apos;s Factory films to the proto-splatter of Herschell Gordon Lewis, from Japan&apos;s Toho monster movies to Hal Ashby&apos;s Harold and Maude, from Herk Harvey&apos;s Carnival of Souls to the early work of David Cronenberg.  Now though, cult seems to have been wiped from the film world&apos;s vocabulary. The term is rarely heard. More importantly, the sense of a secret history of cinema outside the mainstream has all but withered away. Did the audience exit of their own accord, or because of a lack of new blood among the movies? After all, many of the staples of cultdom have either fallen back into the realms of the unwatched, or ascended into respectability: John Waters is these days a beloved cultural institution; David Lynch an elder statesman; even Alejandro Jodorowsky is applauded with earnest admiration. And in their place? Well, Tommy Wiseau&apos;s The Room is cherished by people who like to feel superior to their entertainment, but the essence of cult cinema was always more interesting than just sniggering at films that are so-bad-they&apos;re (allegedy) good. More promisingly, you could certainly make a case for the films of Harmony Korine (Lord knows his next project, Trash Humpers, sounds note-perfect), while Richard Kelly&apos;s triumphant Donnie Darko and doomed Southland Tales pushed many of the right buttons. By all means throw in the Scando-deadpan of Roy Andersson and the brilliantly demented visions of Bong Joon-Ho, director of The Host. But as appealing as that collection of talents are, it&apos;s hard to imagine them being rounded up into an idea as user-friendly as cult cinema. If we are looking for suspects in the death of cult, one of the likelier candidates can be found under discussion on the blog circuit this week: Paul Verhoeven. His film Showgirls, the violently inept tale of lap-dancing and dog food consumption in 1990s Las Vegas, also marked the defining career moment of monstrously grizzled scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas, and is now apparently being furnished with a sequel.  Showgirls was not so much abject as flaccid, and the executives realised that its best hope of winning an audience was to be parcelled up as deliberate high camp, the lowest form of cult. They half-succeeded. The obligatory disastrous opening arrived on cue (I went to see it in a group of three just after its release \u2013 the only other audience member was a vocal masturbator), but the later band of ardent devotees only turned up once the video was out. What it did undeniably achieve, however, was cheapening the idea of cult into a marketing tool. By the end of the 90s and start of the 00s, the concept was dealt a further blow by the arrival of DVD and the internet. The world in which cult film could thrive as an arcane, word-of-mouth affair with half the things you wanted to see only available on dodgy, fifth-generation VHS changed into one where every lost classic had its own tribute site and remastered two-disc set. Aside from Esztherhas and Verhoeven, of course, the other person who did the most to end the era of cult \u2013 who, in fact, may have triggered its demise in the first place \u2013 was Quentin Tarantino. That&apos;s the same Tarantino who racked up all those endless rentals in Amsterdam between writing sessions at the Betty Boop Coffee House. What Reservoir Dogs began and Pulp Fiction made into a phenomenon was the pillaging of decades&apos; worth of cult influence \u2013 stripping out an entire generation of movies for shots, lines and soundtrack ideas. And the problem was never the plagiarism, it was that in becoming a one-stop shop for the history of cult, Tarantino didn&apos;t persuade people to investigate further, he became the filmic equivalent of a giant Tesco putting every smaller shop for miles out of business.

The centre-half is to retain his place in an experimental line-up against Belarus tomorrow night as the Italian seeks to implement &quot;plans B and C&quot; with sterner tests lying ahead. Gabriel Agbonlahor will make his first competitive start for his country, the Aston Villa striker beginning alongside the recalled Peter Crouch in the absence of Wayne Rooney. Ben Foster, who missed the defeat in Ukraine with a chest injury, will also be a competitive debutant with David James still suffering discomfort in the knee upon which he underwent surgery at the end of last season and Rob Green suspended, while Wayne Bridge could also start at left-back. Steven Gerrard, stricken with a groin injury in Dnipropetrovsk on Saturday, lasted only 10 minutes of today&apos;s training session at London Colney and has since returned to Liverpool for treatment. Yet, while there will be disruption caused by the flurry of injuries and the switch to a conventional 4-4-2 system, Ferdinand will line up alongside John Terry hoping to impress where his errors have proved so costly in recent internationals. It was the vice-captain&apos;s mistake which presented Dirk Kuyt with the opening goal in Amsterdam in August&apos;s friendly, and his misjudgment that caused Green&apos;s dismissal at the Dnipro Arena, prompting Capello to seek an explanation from a player about to gain a 76th cap. &quot;I spoke with Rio, on Monday and this morning, and I will do so again on the day of the match,&quot; said Capello. &quot;I asked him what happened [in the build-up to the sending-off]. I spoke with him about the moment, and about different things. But just about that last game. He&apos;s a good man, a big man, and an important player for England and United. He will play tomorrow. He needs to play. The experience Rio has will be very important for us, and I have big confidence in him.&quot; At the root of Ferdinand&apos;s recent toils, with club and country, appears to have been ring rustiness after a series of niggling injuries restricted him to playing 15 of the last 41 competitive games for England and United. Capello has scrutinised the DVD of Saturday&apos;s 1-0 loss with the players and analysed the errors made, with this evening&apos;s final qualifier an opportunity to prove lessons are being learned. Crouch and Agbonlahor will lead the line, supplied by Aaron Lennon and, most likely, Shaun Wright-Phillips, with the onus on pace and width to stretch Belarus. &quot;I want to see Agbonlahor and the other players,&quot; said Capello. &quot;I will do a lot of &apos;experiments&apos;. We need a different plan, and a different style sometimes. We have played more or less the same style in all the games we&apos;ve played. Sometimes, during the friendly games, we&apos;ve changed it but we need to practise other styles. I want to see some players in this game playing in a different set-up. We will need to play other styles, to have a plan A, a plan B and a plan C. The games before the World Cup will be very important for me to learn about the players and the different styles we can use.&quot; Asked whether his current squad boasted the capacity to implement a plan\u00a0C, the Italian replied: &quot;Yes. When I decide upon a squad, I am thinking always about different styles that I can play with the players who will be with me. Always. Why wouldn&apos;t they have the capacity? Are you surprised? It&apos;s not a problem.&quot; David Beckham, omitted from the matchday squad on Saturday, is expected to be among the substitutes at Wembley with Gerrard now unavailable. The Liverpool captain tweaked his groin while attempting a crossfield pass on Saturday and did not re-emerge for the second half, only for a scan undertaken upon the team&apos;s return to Hertfordshire to indicate no real damage. He opted to stay with the squad, only to depart today&apos;s training session suffering yet more discomfort. Gerrard is, however, expected at the national stadium tomorrow night with Capello having invited 55 players \u2013 including his current squad \u2013 to attend the final qualifier. &quot;We spoke after the game against Ukraine and he thought he&apos;d be fit, perhaps for this game,&quot; said Capello. &quot;He practised with us but, after 10 minutes, he felt it.&quot; The manager said that Gerrard would be fit in &quot;two or three days&quot; but Liverpool are less certain that their captain will be ready to play at Sunderland on Saturday and continue to monitor the injury.", "sentences": ["It was the vice-captain&apos;s mistake which presented Dirk Kuyt with the opening goal in Amsterdam in August&apos;s friendly, and his misjudgment that caused Green&apos;s dismissal at the Dnipro Arena, prompting Capello to seek an explanation from a player about to gain a 76th cap."], "title": "Fabio Capello takes rusty Rio Ferdinand to task over defensive errors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/13/fabio-capello-rio-ferdinand-england", "tags": ["England", "Fabio Capello", "Rio Ferdinand", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-16T09:30:41Z", "article": "From the sky I could see man&apos;s harvest of destruction.

We wound through streets that long ago became inadequate for the teeming traffic that ebbs and flows, on wheels and feet, through a narrow corridor of shopfronts and market stalls \u2013 everyone has something to sell. We crawled behind motorcyclists and minibuses, pedestrians balancing giant bags or cardboard boxes on their heads, and ancient taxis whose drivers are known to carry petrol inside plastic water bottles and to glide downhill with the engine off to save every drop. We were on a hillside and occasionally we could look down into the basin and see farmers wading through lush paddy fields. On the horizon loomed a gigantic and unattractive hotel. It was built by the Chinese, we were told, to be ready for an African Union summit, but when Madagascar experienced a bloody coup earlier this year, the summit was cancelled and the hotel became a monstrous white elephant. I can&apos;t remember seeing a city before that is such a wild architectural hybrid. Through the bus window I surveyed stalls and shacks that could be in India, cramped concrete shabeens that could be in a South African township, two-storey townhouses and winding cobbled streets that could be in Europe, and gleaming corporate buildings for the likes of Coca-Cola and Orange that could be anywhere. All are jammed together without rhyme or reason. The old houses are particularly striking. Their roofs have curved red-brown slates on a sharply sloping wooden frame, often with window turrets. Many have ornate wrought-iron balconies and wood shutters. It&apos;s like glimpsing medieval London, or maybe Amsterdam, but now there&apos;s a layer of grime and a nagging sense of decay. I noticed one shop where hunks of meat and strings of sausages hung in the window while big sacks of grain sat on the floor. Above were square windows with lopsided shutters. I wouldn&apos;t have been surprised to see Sir John Falstaff leaning out to empty a bucket on the street below. The French colonial legacy is palpable too. The language is widely spoken, in the city at least. The white typeface on deep blue street signs evokes Paris. We saw a group of young men playing p\u00e9tanque, throwing metallic balls at a target ball on a dirt surface. We drove on past churches, electronics shops, hotels, karaoke bars, massage parlours, pharmacies, familiar names such as Black &amp; Decker and Toyota and a newly restored grand railway station. Below spaghetti-like electricity cables, street traders presided over stalls of fruit and vegetables, or clothes and shoes, or had pegged the day&apos;s newspapers to a clothes line to attract a small crowd. We crossed a bridge between the rubbish-strewn banks of a creek. A solemn column of people, many of them mothers with children, had embarked on what looked like a long walk home along a railway line. A hungry dog was burying its head in a rubbish skip. Women were queueing with jerry cans to collect water. Children in dirty clothes played in the dust. Madagascar, the world&apos;s fourth biggest island, is 300 miles east of mainland Africa. But Indonesian sailors were the first to land there and the centuries of Asian influence are written in the people&apos;s faces. Culturally, it is said, Madagascar has an Asian sense of reserve, respect and orderliness. Yet it was only seven months ago that political violence left more than a hundred people dead. The president, Marc Ravalomanana, was ousted by his rival Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of Antananarivo and a former DJ, with the backing of the army. The country has since been mired in political stalemate which has seen environmental gains go into reverse. That evening, I went to a drinks reception at a big colonial-style mansion in a walled compound. Waiters in immaculate white delivered plates of canapes, including caviar, on a veranda overlooking palm plants and a manicured lawn where the evening air was heavy with the sound of chirping crickets. Among the guests were representatives of non-government organisations and foreign diplomats, including a British official, although the country shut its embassy here several years ago due to lack of funds. Only a handful of intrepid British tourists make it this far each year. I asked what it was like to be here during the coup, when there was widespread destruction and looting. &quot;Frightening,&quot; one woman said. &quot;There was a mob on the rampage and no police or army to intervene. Anything could have happened.&quot; Someone else chipped in: &quot;I don&apos;t really know. I was in the pub.&quot; Another said: &quot;Everything moves slowly here. Even the coup took three months.&quot; As the conversation flowed over beer and wine, it was asserted that Ravalomanana, the former president, was backed by America, whereas the new president, Rajoelina, is sponsored by France. Apparently France was upset at Ravalomanana for failing to support its business interests and, perhaps, for making English the country&apos;s third official language. Ravalomanana also overplayed his hand by planning to lease huge tracts of land to Daewoo, in effect turning much of Madagascar into a breadbasket to feed South Korea instead of its own hungry people. With Chinese interests here also growing, the talk inevitably turned to land-grabbing. I thought about past empires and colonial great games. But just when it was all sounding too familiar, I met a lady who has trouble with her cat. &quot;It preys on the chameleons in my garden,&quot; she said. &quot;I put a bell around its neck, which warns the birds, but the chameleons are too slow. I tell you, that cat is a killer.&quot;", "sentences": ["It&apos;s like glimpsing medieval London, or maybe Amsterdam, but now there&apos;s a layer of grime and a nagging sense of decay."], "title": "Madagascar's capital is like a glimpse of medieval London, with a layer of grime", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/16/madagascar-capital-coup", "tags": ["Madagascar", "World news", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-16T10:08:00Z", "article": "The controversy over Geert Wilders&apos;s visit to Britain has thrust the lanky Dutch maverick back where he loves to be \u2013 at the centre of attention. The Roman Catholic rightwinger from the southern Netherlands sees himself as the heir to other recent Dutch iconoclasts such as Pim Fortuyn, the politician who was murdered after he campaigned for an end to traditional Dutch multiculturalism, and Theo van Gogh, the film-maker stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street after making a documentary that denounced alleged Islamic repression. Wilders has been living under round-the-clock police protection for most of the past four years for fear that his outspoken attacks on Islam could see him assassinated. Wilders revels in baiting the Dutch establishment, calling the government of the Christian Democrat Jan-Peter Balkenende cowards and accusing Queen Beatrix of spouting &quot;multicultural rubbish&quot;. Wilders thrived in the past five years as a backlash followed decades of Dutch openness and tolerance of immigration and other cultures. Initially an MP for the conservative-liberal VVD party, he broke away and sat alone in the parliament as an independent. But in the past two years his new Freedom party has taken nine of the 150 seats in the second chamber in The Hague and he has seen his support soar. A little more than a year ago, Wilders was voted the most effective politician in the Netherlands. The source of the controversy surrounding him is his extreme views on Islam, which he pronounces on with glee. Islam, he told the Guardian last year in an interview, &quot;is not a religion, it&apos;s the ideology of a retarded culture&quot;. He likened the Qur&apos;an to Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf and demanded the Islamic holy book be banned. &quot;Not all Muslims are terrorists, but almost all terrorists are Muslims,&quot; he told me. &quot;Islam is something we can&apos;t afford any more in the Netherlands. I want the fascist Qur&apos;an banned. We need to stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands. That means no more mosques, no more Islamic schools, no more imams.&quot; While he claims that he is exercising his right to free speech, he is being prosecuted in the Netherlands for hate speech. Wilders says he is a libertarian rightwinger and an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, and evinces contempt for European neofascism and racist parties or the anti-immigrant parties such as France&apos;s National Front, Belgium&apos;s Flemish nationalists, or the post-fascists in Italy.", "sentences": ["The Roman Catholic rightwinger from the southern Netherlands sees himself as the heir to other recent Dutch iconoclasts such as Pim Fortuyn, the politician who was murdered after he campaigned for an end to traditional Dutch multiculturalism, and Theo van Gogh, the film-maker stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street after making a documentary that denounced alleged Islamic repression."], "title": "Profile: Geert Wilders", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/12/profile-geert-wilders", "tags": ["The far right", "Islam", "Netherlands", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "Geert Wilders", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-16T19:11:01Z", "article": "Amid a storm of publicity and accompanied by predictably vocal protest, Geert Wilders, the far-right Dutch politician, landed in Britain today , having overturned a Home Office ban on entering the country imposed eight months ago. Wilders, who leads his own Freedom party in the Netherlands, was prevented from entering Britain in February by Jacqui Smith, then home secretary, who argued his presence was likely to incite racial hatred. Wilders is an outspoken critic of Islam, having called it &quot;the ideology of a retarded culture&quot; and compared the Qur&apos;an to Mein Kampf. Having overturned the ban this week at an immigration tribunal, Wilders claimed a victory for freedom of speech at a hastily relocated press conference close to the House of Commons. An original plan to address the media on College Green, outside parliament, had to be abandoned after a group shouting Islamist slogans threatened to disrupt the gathering. &quot;It was of course ridiculous that the UK government thought my presence would in any way lead to violence,&quot; Wilders told a scrum of TV cameras and reporters, admitted to a building owned by Westminster Abbey only after being searched by his personal security men. &quot;I am a democratically elected politician. My main message is that I have a problem with the Islamicisation of our societies ... I believe the more Islam we get in our free societies the less freedom we will get.&quot; He was fighting, he said, for &quot;what Muslims call kaffirs, all those non-Muslims, all those women, those apostates, those renegades, those homosexuals, [who] will pay a high price if Islam became more dominant in our society&quot;. Asked about the millions of peaceable Muslims who felt profoundly insulted by his views, he said: &quot;My aim is not to insult anybody. If somebody does get insulted in the process, this is not my problem.&quot; It was not his wish, he said, &quot;to extradite Muslims who are adhering to the law. This is not my cup of tea.&quot; The government&apos;s attempt to ban Wilders, after lobbying from Lord Ahmed and some Muslim organisations, was provoked by a film he planned to screen at the House of Lords that shows the aftermath of Islamist terror atrocities, including 9/11 and the 7/7 bombings, intercut with selective verses from the Qur&apos;an. The film, called Fitna (Arabic for strife), denounces Islam as a &quot;fascist&quot; religion and is disturbing and almost laughably crude. Wilders, who was invited by the Ukip peer Lord Pearson, said he planned to screen the film in the Lords at a later date. Pearson said he did not agree with Wilders that the Qur&apos;an should be banned, but called today&apos;s event a &quot;celebration&quot; for free speech. He called on &quot;the 98% of the Muslim community who are mild, peace-loving people&quot; to &quot;get up off their bottoms and take on their violent co-religionists who do base their violent actions on the Qur&apos;an&quot;. Not unhelpfully for Wilders&apos; case, a group of about 20 young men unveiled placards as he was due to arrive with slogans such as: Islam will dominate the world: freedom can go to hell. One of them, Abu Muaz, said they represented an organisation called Islam for UK, which he said was linked to the extremist sect al-Muhajiroun, which is banned under the Terrorism Act 2003. But Wilders denied that it had been his intention to provoke either protest or publicity, even if today&apos;s flying visit left time for little more than the press conference and lunch before he flew back to Amsterdam. &quot;This is not my responsibility. If I had had my way I would have been allowed to come into the UK in February. It was the UK government who unfortunately decided in a very cowardly way to trample on freedom of speech... It was their decision not mine. So if anyone is responsible for all this publicity it is the UK government and not Geert Wilders.&quot; Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadhan Foundation said Wilders had a right to be in Britain, &quot;because we believe in freedom of speech in this country, no matter how abhorrent someone&apos;s views are&quot;.

I shouldn&apos;t be flying. We all know that. Which would explain why, recently, the British media has enthusiastically bought into the idea of international train travel as a realistic and relaxing alternative.  All you need is a laptop, a credit card, The Man In Seat 61 and, a few days later, you too can be waking, refreshed, as your night-train pulls into Berlin; or enjoying splendid Alpine views as you make your way to Milan. Or so the Sunday supplement version goes.  To an extent, I&apos;m on board with all this. Four years ago, I decided to limit the number of times I would fly each year to one transatlantic flight, or two within Europe. Admittedly, this was driven as much by fear as a desire to live greenly. At the time, I hated getting on the big metal death bird in the sky. The idea of the train as a far more authentic and civilised - not to mention non-lethal - mode of travel was seductive. The reality, however, is more complex. You see more of the world, for sure, but that is a mixed blessing. I now know that the Hamburg-Copenhagen rail-ferry is a splendid way to travel between the two, but also that Belgian train stations are some of the bleakest in Europe. Similarly, whilst I smiled at one American&apos;s startled reaction to Prague&apos;s dated but perfectly adequate main station - &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she howled, &quot;It&apos;s like a third world country.&quot; - sat, later, in a cramped, stuffy compartment, on a rackety old bit of rolling stock, I had to admit that this was no way to reach Munich in style. This year, particularly, has brought the excitement and limitations of train travel into sharp contrast. A planned trip to America, with no internal flights, was nixed after discovering it would take three days (!) to travel from New York to San Francisco. Then there was a nine-hour odyssey from Manchester to Amsterdam which - booking, admittedly, two rather than three months in advance - ended up costing \u00a3150pp, plus the cost of a return ticket to London. I could have flown from Liverpool for 30 quid.  A recent trip taking in Lisbon, Madrid and Barcelona was similarly ridiculous. Booking online was a non-starter. There is an English language version, but after much swearing at a laptop, I had to abandon Renfe&apos;s website (notoriously user-unfriendly according to a Spanish contact), and book through their London office. In the meantime, I&apos;d missed the discounted advance and e-ticket deals, which meant a cabin on the Lisbon-Madrid night-train cost \u00a3170 for two.  Night-train: it&apos;s an evocative phrase, isn&apos;t it? Less so stood on Lisbon&apos;s dull, modern Santa Apolonia station at 10pm on a Friday night. No-one is ever going to set Brief Encounter here, nor mistake a Renfe Trenhotel for the Orient Express.  Sure, the welcome is warm and efficient in that easy, multilingual way so alien to the British, and the cabin, if a little faded, was spick and span, and a feat of capsule engineering allows you to stow two hefty suitcases more easily than you might think. You even get a little complimentary bag of Renfe toiletries. However, stood in the empty, lifeless bar, nursing a Super Bock, enveloped in the inky blackness of the surrounding countryside at night, it would be a perverse traveller indeed who saw this as a highpoint of a holiday.      Dream on ... a sleeper carriage in a Renfe Trenhotel    Not that you&apos;re here to party, of course, you&apos;re here to sleep, or try to. I managed about two hours in a nine-hour journey. Hard bed, noisy train, multiple stops, the bizarre sensation of waking to find yourself spiralling down Spanish mountainsides. Oddly, none of it lulled me to sleep. You wake to a (reasonably good) breakfast, bleary and unshowered, passing municipal dumps, shanty towns and fantastically ugly apartments. Welcome to Madrid! It was an experience, alright. One I&apos;ll never repeat. Particularly as, later that week, I glimpsed The Future. Not only does the AVE high-speed link between Madrid and Barcelona cover the same 600km as the Lisbon-Madrid leg in under three hours, but it&apos;s supremely comfortable; relatively cheap (I got it for \u20ac42.65pp, one-way); there&apos;s leg and luggage room to spare; you get free headphones to enjoy the onboard radio and films; and, in the lively bar, they do a creditable cafe solo. The commuters may look bored by it all, but, for the first timer, the novelty of doing a silky smooth 300kmph through Spain&apos;s awesome spaghetti western interior, is quite something. The fact remains, however, that this not the age of the train ... yet. In my experience, Europe is decades away from the kind of integrated rail network that would make people think twice about flying. Do you agree? Am I being too harsh? How have you found Europe-by-rail? Moreover, what practical steps could operators take to make European train travel more appealing: is it a matter of price, centralised booking, speed or comfort?", "sentences": ["Then there was a nine-hour odyssey from Manchester to Amsterdam which - booking, admittedly, two rather than three months in advance - ended up costing \u00a3150pp, plus the cost of a return ticket to London."], "title": "The age of the train: myth or reality?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2009/oct/21/train-travel-myth-reality", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Green travel", "Travel", "Europe holidays", "Spain holidays", "Environment", "Travel and transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-23T08:09:24Z", "article": "The Rumour Mill loves a good protest march. We&apos;d go through you to participate in one. Just this morning, we protested at having to drag ourselves out of bed at 6am for the third time this week, by marching to the Tube* station, marching on to a northbound train, sitting down for a rest and a read of the paper while it conveyed us to Kings Cross station, then marching into the office, all the while grumbling under our breath about the injustice of it all. And then starting work. That&apos;ll show them - never let it be said that the Rumour Mill doesn&apos;t know how to stick it to the man. Of course it&apos;s probably fair to argue that your average march loses some of it&apos;s impact if those participating in it set off from somewhere they were going to be anyway, then stride purposefully to a destination they were all heading for anyway, but if it&apos;s a good enough tactic for Liverpool fans, it&apos;s good enough for us. According to today&apos;s Daily Mail, thousands of Koppites, who are unhappy with their club&apos;s American co-owners, George Gillett and the other one, are planning to convene at a pub near Anfield on Saturday afternoon before marching en masse to the stadium for their team&apos;s Premier League match against Manchester United. Quite how anyone will be able to tell the difference between this and the build-up to any other Liverpool home match remains to be seen, but we wish Spirit of Shankly (the organisers of the march, seen here enjoying a bawdy end-of-season singalong) all the best in their attempts to persuade Liverpool&apos;s co-owners to leave the club. And if the build-up to Liverpool&apos;s defeat at the hands of Manchester United wasn&apos;t surreal enough already, the Mail also reports that Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina has been assured by referees&apos; chief Keith Hackett that security staff at Anfield will &quot;react swiftly if they see any balloons or beach balls being inflated inside the stadium&quot;. Has it really come to this? Meanwhile in the world of more traditional rumourmongering, assorted reports from last night&apos;s 638 different Europa League and the sensational revelation that Frank Lampard thinks Manchester City might finish in the top four of the Premier League this season (really Frank?) mean that transfer speculation is mercifully thin on the ground in today&apos;s papers. However, we can confirm that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who turned 60 yesterday, may treat himself to a belated birthday present by signing Internazionale&apos;s \u00a320m-rated 19-year-old striker Mario Balotelli and \u00a38m-rated Ajax right-back Gregory van der Wiel. The young Dutchman caused controversy in his homeland just over a week ago by Tweeting a photograph of himself posing backstage with American rapper Lil Wayne at a gig in Amsterdam, shortly after pulling out of a Holland friendly against Australia in Sydney due to concussion. Some considered Van der Wiel&apos;s presence at the gig to be an act of disrespect towards the national team, while the more sentient among the outraged were appalled by his terrible taste in music. And finally, in a nugget of speculation that sounds so unlikely there must be some grain of truth to it, today&apos;s Mirror reports that Leeds United striker Jermaine Beckford has become a target for Portuguese league leaders Sporting Braga, while the Daily Star reports that Sophie from Southport is 26, BNP leader Nick Griffin &quot;is a nutter&quot; and Aston Villa and Birmingham are both interested in signing 18 year old Cheltenham Town striker Theo Lewis.

I&apos;m not sure what his plans are, but then I don&apos;t expect to be involved in them these days, at least not in a non-pecuniary way. In any case he is now safely back at university in Southampton after spending the summer here in &quot;boring&quot; Hertfordshire, eating us out of house and home in between roaring off to festivals and whooping it up in Brighton and London and elsewhere, with the vast diaspora of friends that young people have on their computers these days. But has he earned the key of the door now that he doesn&apos;t need it so often? There are faint signs of him growing up. He did manage to get to Amsterdam and back this year without incident (in contrast to his first trip abroad in 2007 when he rang us from a Greek police cell requesting \u20ac200 to pay a &quot;fine&quot; for not leaving his hotel bed as intact as he found it), and I&apos;m delighted that he has worked so hard in his first year at university that he has been invited back for a second. He can cook, in a scattergun kind of way, and can play a number of Johnny Cash songs on the ukulele. When not being a drain on one&apos;s emotional and financial resources, he is excellent company. Our youngest two boys are attracted to his natural daring and untameable sense of inappropriate fun, though Ryan \u2013 almost 19 and less given to displays of unnecessary jabber \u2013 has learnt to regard him with a wary eye. A few Sundays ago, we all went out to lunch en famille \u2013 to mark our last time all together for a while and to raise a glass to our evolving circumstances: Ryan, too, was about to go off (and has now gone) to university, at Warwick; Jackson, 16, has started in the Lower Sixth, and Cameron, 12, is safely into Year 8. Everything is changing. With the house a little emptier, it seems like the beginning of an end. Not a real end, of course \u2013 I didn&apos;t get my perma-frown by not realising that fatherhood is a job you can only get out of by going into a care home \u2013 but things have assumed a less frenzied rhythm. Having two children at home is easier than four, if not quite as easy as none. Recent holidays with our younger pair have been relaxed to the point of fun. It has always been a slight source of disappointment to my wife that I couldn&apos;t &quot;enjoy&quot; the children as much as she does and now, admittedly rather late in the game (and with no disrespect to our eldest two, who should by no means take this personally), I&apos;m beginning to see how that might be possible. It does help that they are all old enough to make their own fun. Even though I have almost done my first 21 years, I regret never having quite got the hang of being the father I would have ideally wanted for the little chaps. It goes without saying that I love them and cherish them and would happily jump into a lake of burning lava to protect them (though I can&apos;t imagine the exact circumstances in which this might be necessary), but watching other dads building sandcastles or Lego spaceships or putting up tents or being the life and soul of children&apos;s birthday parties or whipping up excitement on theme park rides, I always felt the sting of inauthenticity in my own paltry efforts. But what grown man could actually enjoy Lego? Or children&apos;s books? I hated Harry Potter. I played Buckaroo through clenched teeth. I&apos;m not one for getting wet or being turned upside down on a rollercoaster. The truth is, I have no inner child \u2013 a tragedy, you might say, for a man with so many outer ones. But I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve been a complete failure. It&apos;s not as if I haven&apos;t been any fun ever since 1988. I could always manage the more passive activities \u2013 encouraging the children to watch football on TV with me or taking them to the cinema, with its reliable promise of a short nap. And never let it be said that any of them has ever gone short of hugs (father-and-son hugging is, of course, the new wrestling). It&apos;s easy to forget, too \u2013 with today&apos;s lifestyle supplements packed with gurning fathers in striped aprons teaching their tousled kids how to ice cakes \u2013 that the male parent has not always been so fully alive to the pleasures of child-rearing. At least I was up there with the &quot;new&quot; men of 1988, attending antenatal classes and helping to choose a buggy (the new word for pushchair) at Mothercare. We found ourselves bandying terms like &quot;amniocentesis&quot; and &quot;dilation&quot;. We learnt that a pregnant woman might dine on liver and Guinness (I&apos;m not sure if this is still the advice of doctors) and worked at the secrets of controlled breathing and lumbar massage. We were given our lists of things to take to the hospital \u2013 sandwiches, a drink, a crossword \u2013 to help pass the hours while our wives or girlfriends rehearsed the primal groaning that would grow more and more unearthly towards the final push. Baxter was born after 14 hours of labour followed by a frantic emergency caesarean that forged a lasting sense of what he thinks parents are for \u2013 waiting, worrying, cleaning up the mess. I got the first look at him \u2013 his mallet head and tuft of hair, his indented jaw where his foot had been, his little crispy-bacon ears \u2013 and took him in my arms, wandering up and down the hospital corridor, cooing at him like the happiest fool, until my wife woke up and took over. Walking back home down a deserted Tottenham High Road as that bright October dawn broke seemed just the best thing. On 26 March 1955 my father delivered me at home with his own bare hands in the time it took (as my mum tells it) for the kettle to boil. He had run down to the public phone box to call the midwife and when he got back he carried my mother upstairs like the hero in a black-and-white film. But this drama was over in seconds. &quot;You popped out straight into his arms,&quot; she says. &quot;He was laughing and crying at the same time.&quot; It was 30 years before men were routinely turning up and affecting to &quot;help&quot; at the births of their children. In 1986 a black-and-white poster of a half-naked man holding a newborn child appeared in Athena stores, and went on to sell 5m copies. Men are sensitive too, it seemed to say, though the model hired to take his shirt off for the picture reputedly slept with 3,000 women on the back of it. Couldn&apos;t they tell he wasn&apos;t real? Did they care? Not everyone was up to speed with the latest thinking. I remember being jeered at by builders one morning as I hurried along to the childminder&apos;s with Baxter in his sling. And it was 1990 before GQ magazine plucked up the courage to ask: &quot;Are You Man Enough to Change a Nappy?&quot; Underneath, it read: &quot;The great challenge for modern man is to get to know his children better.&quot; Our time had come, whether we liked it or not. It is one of the great marvels of evolution, of course, that the worst thing a man can be hard-wired to imagine about parenthood is changing a nappy. In fact, in the annals of known hells, not getting a proper night&apos;s sleep for months on end is indescribably worse. Certainly there are moments when you would trade a lifetime of faecal matter up your fingernails for just five minutes in the land of nod. But even this is missing the point. What no one tells you is that parenthood isn&apos;t about babies at all. Well, yes, you have babies, but the moment you start thinking you know babies they&apos;re already mutating into something else \u2013 into toddlers, three-year-olds, 10-year-olds, teenagers, entire new genres of children that need knowing all over again. I realise that this isn&apos;t an exact analogy, but if you imagine your first 10-year-old as bird flu, the second, on reaching that age, might easily materialise as rabies, the third amoebic dysentery, and so on \u2013 and here&apos;s you thinking you can treat them all with the same old medicine. Who says God has no sense of humour? It&apos;s that realisation, as a father, that you&apos;re really just making it up as you go along that runs through the column I started to write for the Observer magazine in the autumn of 1996, a few weeks after my vasectomy and six months before the birth of our fourth son. I remember my editor at the time describing it as &quot;a woman&apos;s column written by a man&quot; \u2013 though that had ceased to be a novelty by the time I stopped writing it a decade later. By then home and family wasn&apos;t exclusively a woman&apos;s province, just as going out and drinking yourself insensible was no longer purely a job for a man. And didn&apos;t there come a point in all this when children started to be hailed as fashionable accessories? Women, far from disguising their pregnancies in dungarees or a traditional small marquee, followed such starry exemplars of the day as Demi Moore and Geri Halliwell and the girl who married Liam Gallagher, baring their maternal bumps with shameless pride. New dads \u2013 whose new daddism sat oddly with the new laddism of the Loaded generation \u2013 watched open-mouthed as David Beckham had the names of his children tattooed into his suntan. Chelsea&apos;s John Terry took to raising his son to the heavens \u2013 surely the ultimate trophy child \u2013 at cup final victories. Smart metropolitan couples loaded their kids in front-facing rucksacks and took them out to restaurants, to swish private views, to the office. How Mediterranean we were \u2013 how enlightened and relaxed! One wonders, had men not been required to take an interest in children, whether we would have seen such a groundswell of kiddie-based enthusiasm \u2013 the &quot;What to do with your brood in the hols&quot; spreads, the mother-and-child parking, the baby-changing facilities in the gents, family-friendly pubs, the way the vocabulary and imagery of IVF and adoption and &quot;biological clocks&quot; infiltrated the common consciousness. Paternity leave was deemed crucial to men&apos;s new central role in parenting. Aggrieved excluded fathers in Batman costumes scaled public buildings to draw attention to their pain, while elsewhere sperm donors were told they now needed to stand up and be counted. Children became a national anxiety: what they ate, who they talked to online, whether mobile phones and video games were frying their young brains. While feral teens roamed inner-city estates, TV gave us Supernanny and Honey We&apos;re Killing the Kids. I doubt many people bringing up children particularly felt they were riding the zeitgeist. Flicking through those old columns (or rather those old columns collected into one convenient volume to keep with your contraceptives, Parenting Made Difficult \u2013 now unaccountably out of print), I was struck by how much of our lives was taken up by dismal rain-swept excursions in the car \u2013 to farms, museums, bird sanctuaries, &quot;historic&quot; towns, flower shows, agricultural fairs, the Millennium Dome. But I suppose that&apos;s what we did. Driving our small herd round those places was not only a way of escaping the chaos and fatigue of being trapped in the house with four under-nines but it gave us the illusion of being in control. A typical piece begins: &quot;It seems ages since we last made the children despise us by forcing them to do something gratuitously uninteresting\u2026&quot; And although all that stuff \u2013 the outings, the struggles with putting up curtain rails and light fittings, and being hopeless at cracking eggs, and failing to deal with algebra or diarrhoea or Lara Croft \u2013 was magnified for comic intent, it still holds a sort of cumulative reality. Notwithstanding the great times we had (and I realise I may have given the impression that there weren&apos;t any), bringing up kids \u2013 for all its profounder pleasures \u2013 can be a hard, wearying business. It&apos;s a long haul. But just as those early years often seemed unending, the last few have rather whizzed by. Teenagers bring a more extreme set of challenges, but at least their unreasonable behaviour is functional, in that it hastens the inevitable break and makes their departure an occasion that everyone appreciates must happen. Yes, one chooses family life and finds joy in this warm bosom of one&apos;s own making, but (and I hate to get all Charles Darwin here) isn&apos;t the point of having babies to provide fresh new adults to man the coalmines and universities? And if, at the end of the process, one is never sure of one&apos;s exact part in their accomplishments or otherwise, it seems natural \u2013 salutary \u2013 to kiss them, say goodbye, good luck and see you when you bring your laundry home at half-term. Job done. Or very nearly. I have come to this understanding more easily than my wife, who though our nest is still half full has begun to imagine it empty. Her gaze falls sadly on our 12-year-old, seeing the next six years whizzing by, too. But think of the freedom, I say, mentally dusting off our old priorities involving just the two of us \u2013 swanning off to the pub at the drop of a hat, seeing friends, attending art exhibitions, having sex on the stairs. Weekends in Rome or Paris! Yes, says my wife, who has been \u2013 and still is \u2013 the best mother a child could wish for, even though it has meant sacrificing a life that she might have selflessly devoted to me alone. Of course I will miss them too. But she senses we are not fully united in this. Perhaps it&apos;s a man-woman thing. I put my arm round her (recalling how tearful she was last week, loading Ryan and his baggage and DVDs and guitars and newly bought wok into his student accommodation) and say that everything will be fine.

In 1928, when the Fifa congress in Amsterdam announced its plans to host a World Cup tournament in Uruguay, the FA member Charles Sutcliffe gave them the shortest of shrift: &quot;I don&apos;t care a brass farthing about the improvement of the game in France, Belgium, Austria or Germany. The Fifa does not appeal to me. An organisation where such football associations as those of Uruguay and Paraguay, Brazil and Egypt, Bohemia and Pan Russia are co-equal with England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland seems to me to be a case of magnifying the midgets.&quot; Anti-Europe, Fifa-phobic and believing that pretty much anyone who is not indigenous to these islands is a midget \u2013 these are the kind of views that one thankfully only hears these days on Question\u00a0Time. Similarly blinkered thinking was on display at the creation of the European Cup. In 1954, Wolves beat Honved 3-2 in a televised friendly and manager Stan Cullis promptly announced that this result, obviously, made them &quot;champions of the world&quot;. The French disagreed and, to prove their point, set up the European Cup. Chelsea, as English champions, were invited to take part, but declined having consulted Alan Hardaker, a man who explained to Brian Glanville that he didn&apos;t like dealing with football in Europe on account of there being &quot;too many wogs and dagoes&quot;. And, of course, magnified midgets. It might, therefore, be considered a step forward that Somerset and Sussex showed up for the Twenty20 Champions League. And, if either of them had progressed to the final, the latter stages of a tournament that, in conception, is half Indian, a third Australian and a sixth South African might have received coverage. But, no, the parochialism continues \u2013 and, in the process, a heart-warming story has slid by. At the start, Trinidad &amp; Tobago were among the outsiders. But they played outstandingly, being the only unbeaten team going into the final. The spin bowler of the tournament was Dave Mohammed. The Bravo brothers were top of the bill. The hitting and fielding of Kieron Pollard was astonishing (his non-catch, when he kept the ball in play with a hammer-thrower&apos;s spin and, then, launched a long-distance belly flop to nearly catch it, was astounding). And in charge of the controlled mayhem was the cool and urbane Daren Ganga. On Friday evening, they faced arch Aussies New South Wales. It was, as Sunil Gavaskar is fond of saying, one side&apos;s Gods against the other side&apos;s Gods. And, for a good while, it seemed as if the Caribbean Gods would prevail over their Australian counterparts, as NSW struggled to 83 for six. But, not for the first time, the Gods had overlooked Brett Lee. He chipped in with a five-six 48 and two for 10, and that was pretty much that. On the upside, the T&amp;T team received a prize equivalent to a dollar for every inhabitant of the island and, for many, their scintillating performances make them the stars of the first global club-cricket format, a mix of World Cup and Champions League that football has yet to invent.

So imagine my surprise and sense of endless possibility when friends, colleagues and even complete strangers started emailing to tell me that Westword, an alternative weekly newspaper in Denver, Colorado, had just placed an ad seeking a highly qualified medical marijuana critic. My dream job just became a dream reality! Let me be clear: I&apos;ve already got something of a dream job. For the last 35 years, High Times magazine has been the world&apos;s most trusted name when it comes to getting stoned. As an editor, my journalistic travels in search of Mary Jane have led me to the most interesting people and places in the world, to share sessions with growers, artists, dealers, lawyers, professors, scientists, smugglers, prisoners, politicians and philosophers. And yes, in my official capacity as an employee, I&apos;ve several times been called upon to serve as a judge at the magazine&apos;s annual Cannabis Cup, held each November in Amsterdam. But this is different. By hiring someone to objectively critique the offerings at Denver&apos;s cannabis healing centres, Westword will provide an important \u2013 and long overdue \u2013 service to the medical marijuana community. For too long, our nation literally treated those afflicted with cancer, MS and countless other ailments as criminals, simply because they chose to treat themselves with an all-natural remedy that&apos;s incredibly effective and completely non-toxic. If it just so happens to make the Grateful Dead sound a whole lot better, I&apos;ve never understood the problem. On 19 October, the Obama administration formally announced their previously stated policy of not applying the federal laws against marijuana to patients and providers following state law in the 14 states with laws to protect them. To understand the dream-come-true nature of allowing safe, legal access to medical marijuana \u2013 recommended by a licensed physician and supplied by state-sanctioned non-profits \u2013 let&apos;s remember that back in 2005, the Bush administration went all the way to the US supreme court to affirm their right to arrest Angel Raich, a woman suffering from fibromyalgia, endometriosis, scoliosis, asthma and an inoperable brain tumour, all because she grew her own marijuana, on her own property and consumed it entirely herself \u2013 on the recommendation of her doctor and in complete compliance with California state law. Raich and countless patients like her not only need medical cannabis \u2013 they need someone to tell the wheat from the chaff, to use a wildly mixed botanical metaphor. So how, exactly, does one critique cannabis? Like a wine critic, you&apos;ll need a solid background in all the popular and even obscure varietals, a task made exceedingly more difficult by the underground nature of marijuana breeding and genetics. Cultivation methods also come into play, particularly for patients who require organically-grown ganja, free from potentially harmful pesticides and fertilisers.  Next, determine if the buds were harvested at their peak by using a microscope to examine the oil-filled sacks on the surface called trichomes, which contain marijuana&apos;s supply of THC and the myriad other cannabinoids that combine to produce the plant&apos;s psychotropic effects. Also, examine the interior of the bud to ensure it&apos;s free of mould, fungus and insect infestation. Finally, check the texture for excessive moisture or dryness. Medicinal-grade buds should feel like cotton candy \u2013 sticky and squishy. Once you find a choice little nugget, grind it up, assessing the aroma that&apos;s released. From there, it&apos;s a short trip to the vaporiser, where taste and effect come into play. Does Purple Kush make you extremely relaxed, even sluggish? Sounds like a good fit for anxiety, insomnia or back pain. Does G-13 produce feelings of giddiness and a major attack of the munchies? That should work for loss of appetite or mild depression. Unfortunately, upon carefully reading of the Westword job listing, I&apos;m not sure they get it. Here&apos;s a troubling passage: &quot;Keep in mind this isn&apos;t about assessing the quality of the medicine on site; it&apos;s about evaluating the quality of the establishment. After all, we can&apos;t have our reviewer be stoned all the time.&quot; Overlooking the bit of snide, patronising humour at the end, I&apos;d still have to say that&apos;s like reviewing restaurants based solely on d\u00e9cor, or choosing your doctor based on the selection of magazines in the waiting room.

Not, some might say, the most innocent victim in this city&apos;s eventful history, nor the wickedest; not by a long shot. But like all of the 136 men and women who fell as a consequence of that great grey slab of concrete standing just outside, he did not deserve to die when he did, doing what he was trying to do. So here we are, then, 50 or so of us, well-upholstered, middle-aged tourists from Frankfurt and Cologne and Amsterdam and Copenhagen, a retired couple from Cheshire, a shuffling bunch of schoolchildren from Bielefeld. We sit on wooden chairs in an unadorned oval chapel, and an avuncular man in one of those felted German cardigans takes a book lying on the altar and reads from it about Werner Probst. He was born on 18 June 1936 in the working-class district of Friedrichshain in what became east Berlin. He left school early, with no qualifications and barely able to write. He was in constant trouble with the police for a string of petty thefts. At the time of his death, in October 1961, he was a driver for a truck firm in west Berlin, living with his parents. Because he worked in the west, Werner interested the East German security service, the Stasi. Because he had a police record, he was a cinch to recruit: help us, and we&apos;ll wipe your slate clean. So, since 1959 Werner had been a Stasi informant, codename Harry, providing a valued picture of the lowlife he supposedly frequented in the bars of west Berlin. But what mattered most to Probst was the freedom to go where he wanted, when he wanted, and once the wall was up, in August 1961, he no longer had that. First he was arrested at Friedrichstrasse station, drunk, trying to cross the border. Then at 10.30pm on 14 October, he jumped into the river Spree at the Schillingbr\u00fccke and started swimming. Wounded by machine-gun fire on the way across, he was fatally shot in the back as he hauled himself out on the other bank. &quot;One name stands for many,&quot; says the man in the felted cardigan, &quot;and yet each name stands for one.&quot; Two of the schoolgirls sniff; a couple of the boys take a sudden interest in their shoes. An elderly gentleman from Frankfurt blows his nose. &quot;He was the same age as my brother,&quot; he says, outside. &quot;Would have been 73 this year. I&apos;m glad those kids are here.&quot; There is a ceremony like this most days at the Chapel of Reconciliation on Berlin&apos;s Bernauer Strasse. Amid all the perverse enormity of the Berlin Wall \u2013 the brutality, the ugliness, the absurdity, the tainted lives, the weight of all that it represented (&quot;The wall&quot;, as they&apos;re fond of saying in Berlin, &quot;was a symbol not just for a divided city, but a divided country, a divided continent&quot;) \u2013 it is perhaps good to begin here, in a bare and chilly chapel with a bunch of strangers moved to tears by the story of a man none of us had heard of 15 minutes ago. Good also because, to be perfectly frank, if you&apos;re hoping for an idea of what the Berlin Wall was actually like, you are going to be disappointed. For something that loomed so large, physically and in the minds of a generation, there is amazingly little of it left. Along with the border &quot;death strip&quot; and the patrol paths, watchtowers, guard posts, signal fencing, telephone lines, spotlights, road blocks and all the rest of the sinister paraphernalia that went with it, the 184km of concrete wall \u2013 all 45,000, 3.6m-high, 1.2m-wide, 2.75-tonne segments of it \u2013 and 154km of border fence have, basically, vanished. &quot;You have to understand,&quot; says Pastor Manfred Fischer in his study across the road from the chapel, &quot;the thought in everybody&apos;s mind was, let&apos;s get shot of it. Nobody wanted to see it any more, not the least trace of it. Nobody. Die Mauer muss weg \u2013 the wall must go: that was the cry before it came down, and for months afterwards too. We couldn&apos;t get rid of it fast enough.&quot; Within 12 months of that mad night of 9 November 1989, the soon-to-be-disbanded National People&apos;s Army had dismantled pretty much the whole of the Berlin Wall, with much the same efficiency as they had erected, maintained, improved and defended it over the previous 28 years. Most of it went to resurface east German roads, although 360 particularly colourful segments were sold at auction in Berlin, Paris and Monte Carlo. In many places, too, Mauerspechte, or wallpeckers, got there before the soldiers, chipping away at the wall with hammers and chisels out of historical, ideological or plain commercial conviction. A canny West German entrepreneur, Volker Pawlowski, snapped some 300m and set himself up for life; he now supplies rather more than 90% of the booming wall memento market. A piece of genuine, authenticated cold war history the size of your fist, tastefully re-sprayed and fixed to an acrylic mount? Yours for a modest \u20ac12. A smaller fragment attached, for example, to a keyring, will set you back a mere \u20ac6. Slight, wiry and still alarmingly energetic, Pastor Fischer arrived on Bernauer Strasse, which separates the former West German district of Wedding to the north from the former East German district of Mitte to the south (confusing, I know, but with the wall no longer around it is often hard to tell what was where these days) in 1975. He was pastor of the Church of Reconciliation, in the middle of the border strip, but never set foot in it because it was on the wrong side of the wall, and, anyway, in 1985 the East German authorities blew it up. Fischer was one of the few to fight, as early as 1990, for at least a small part of the wall to be preserved. &quot;I&apos;d go outside and beg them to stop destroying it,&quot; he says. &quot;I knew we had to keep something, a small part of it. The wall was a crime, and we had to have the evidence. There had to be a mark: something that said this is where we&apos;ve come from, that left no room for discussion. Because we are quite good at looking back on our past in a certain way. I know this; I used to have enormous rows with my own father when he&apos;d say, &apos;Ach, Hitler wasn&apos;t that bad.&apos; I was sure one day people would say, &apos;Ach, the GDR wasn&apos;t all that bad.&apos;&quot; He is right about that, of course. Ostalgie \u2013 nostalgia for life in the former East Germany \u2013 is now a widely documented phenomenon, particularly among the older citizens of the former German Democratic Republic, who miss the old certainties. Later in the day, on a bleak stretch of the former border guard patrol strip beside a railway line north of the city centre, I meet Katherina walking her two labradors. At 58, she fiercely resents having to pay for her dentures and her reading glasses, and gets cross at the choice she is confronted with at the baker&apos;s. &quot;A loaf of bread,&quot; she says, &quot;used to be a loaf of bread. It would cost the same, always, and it would be fine. Nowadays they&apos;ll sell you any rubbish, and you never know how much it will cost you.&quot; Katherina isn&apos;t, it seems, alone; a survey this summer for Stern magazine found 15% of Germans still pining for the two Germanies \u2013 easterners because unemployment rates are higher and incomes lower than west German levels, westerners because of \u20ac1.2trn they have paid in taxes to fund reunification. Another recent poll found 41% of east Germans denying the GDR was ever unjust. The wall may have fallen; the divide, while narrowing, remains. And that, 20 years after it fell, makes the question of how best to commemorate Berlin&apos;s now-absent wall a delicate one. Pastor Fischer&apos;s determination to preserve some evidence did at least pay off. Opposite his parish office adjoining the Berlin Wall Documentation Centre stands a rebuilt 70m stretch of the wall, the only one left in the city to give at least some idea of the scale of the former fortifications. For the wall was, of course, actually two \u2013 the concrete slats of the Hinterland or rear wall facing eastwards; and, looking westward, the altogether more daunting bulk of the Vorderland or front wall, topped with that unclimbable concrete pipe. Between the two walls, East Germany&apos;s laughably named &quot;anti-fascist rampart&quot;, was the sand-covered strip (for footprints) complete with patrol path, alarm fences, spiked mats, floodlights, guard dogs and watchtowers. Today on Bernauer Strasse, you can climb the stairs of an observation tower and look down on a short stretch of the walls and strip, albeit shorn of their more chilling accessories. To the south, however, in what was east Berlin, rise sumptuous, immaculately restored pre-war apartment buildings that ooze Germanic solidity. To the north, in what was the west, are equally stylish big-windowed, ochre-painted modern blocks. And even with an imposing chunk of memorial masonry right there in front of you, in a pale late-autumn sunshine, surrounded by unimpressed teenagers, it is hard to grasp the monstrosity of the thing. &quot;You just can&apos;t really see it as real, somehow,&quot; says Anna, 17, from Koblenz. &quot;It&apos;s like a stage set, you know? Or a video game. Reunification was great, of course. It&apos;s good that we&apos;re all one Germany again. But what&apos;s here, I think, for us it&apos;s impossible to really make sense of it. It could be ancient history.&quot; So is there anywhere left in Berlin where you really can make sense of it? I set off to see. It&apos;s not an immediately enlightening journey. Just across town is Potsdamer Platz, once Europe&apos;s busiest square, teeming with traffic and heaving with hotels and stores and coffeeshops. It was wrecked by the second world war, but is now a gleaming high-rise 21st-century vision: banks, management consultancies, a consumer electronics giant. Stranded incongruously in the middle are a few frankly risible segments of obviously relocated wall. A group of Dutch schoolchildren cycle up, dismount, stamp their frozen feet through the guide&apos;s inevitable &quot;divided city, divided country&quot; routine and, giggling, plaster a few more pieces of chewing gum on the already liberally spattered concrete. A double line of cobblestones traces the route of the Vorderland wall across the square and up Ebertstrasse towards the Brandenburg Gate. Even that slim reminder is easy to lose: Volkswagens and Mercedes roar ceaselessly over it, white road markings obscure it. Part of the problem, of course, is that there is just so much history in Berlin. On Niederkirchnerstrasse, by the Prussian parliament building and the Nazi aviation ministry, is the longest bit of wall left in the city centre \u2013 160 metres of knackered grey, graffiti-strewn concrete, its steel reinforcement rods peering out like bones where the wallpeckers got busy. Across the road, a small portable building advertises 20-minute Trabi safaris in the authentic two-stroke East German motor car. Round the corner, assuming you decline to join the Berliners drinking coffee in the cafes of uber-chic Friedrichstrasse, Checkpoint Charlie, a heavily fortified and thoroughly terrifying 10-lane border crossing barely two decades ago, now offers a kind of cold war cabaret. Fast-food joints compete for custom with stalls flogging Russian Red Army fur hats (made in China) and a desk where you can get your passport stamped with an East German visa. For \u20ac1, you can be photographed with an actor in the uniform of an allied border guard, holding aloft a tricolore, Union flag or Stars and Stripes outside a replica wooden control hut. The museum at Checkpoint Charlie is, of course, part of cold war history itself, recounting spine-chilling tales of derring-do, displaying some of the cunningly modified cars, hot-air balloons, microlights and diving gear that helped carry thousands of desperate east Berliners westwards \u2013 and railing, with zero attempt at objectivity, against the manifold evils of communist dictatorships in general, and East Germany in particular. Checkpoint Charlie doesn&apos;t really do it for me; a number of German politicians have also denounced a &quot;falsification of history&quot;. It is, if you have read Stasiland or seen The Lives of Others, all a bit tasteless. I take the U-bahn to Warschauer Strasse to see if the longest stretch of wall still standing is any better. There are 1.3km of the East Side Gallery, but in a way it too is fake: this was actually part of the rear wall, built to look like the front wall because it lay on the route that carried VIP visitors into east Berlin from Sch\u00f6nefeld airport. The idea was to spare those sensitive Soviet and other eastern bloc diplomats a view of the real border strip. Fulvio Pinna, a pony-tailed Italian, is busy redoing the exuberant piece of art he (and more than 100 others from around the world) painted on the wall in 1990; the whole lot is due to be restored by early November. Pinna had been in Berlin a couple of years when the wall fell, he says: &quot;It was a unique moment. The best, ever.&quot; Of course, the world has changed, and this stretch of wall is more museum than gallery, he reckons. Still, what artist isn&apos;t happy to see his work in a museum? An hour or so&apos;s hike north-west, in the Invaliden cemetery north of the central station and bordering the Spandauer ship canal, a few more fragments have been preserved. I arrive as daylight is fading, to find another bike group being lectured on the two men who died here: G\u00fcnter Litfin, shot by border police on 24 August 1961, and Peter G\u00f6ring, an East German border guard killed by the covering fire his counterparts in the west were giving to a 14-year-old escapee. Just past the cemetery, surrounded by spanking new flats with sun-kissed balconies and canal views, a grey-haired man called J\u00fcrgen Litfin opens the door to the ugly concrete watchtower he maintains as part-museum, part-shrine to his brother&apos;s memory. He is in between two tour groups, and not in the best of moods. &quot;The wall?&quot; he says. &quot;Gah. I&apos;m not going to talk to you about the wall. It cost my brother his life and I&apos;ve talked about it enough to last two lifetimes.&quot; A strange thing happens, though, when you go looking for the Berlin Wall. You begin, eventually, to realise that because there is so very little of it left, and because those few remaining fragments can invariably be located by the presence in front of them of a guided bike group or a tour bus or six, it&apos;s when you stumble across some small, untrumpeted and all but unremembered trace of its former existence that you feel its weight most keenly. Along Bernauer Strasse, for example, a handful of scattered, unadvertised flagstones recall the fates of the half-dozen men and women \u2013 Ernst Mundt, Ida Siekmann, Olga Segler, Rudolf Urban, Bernd L\u00fcnser \u2013 who were shot or died jumping from the windows of now long-demolished apartment buildings here; the wall initially consisted simply of bricked-up facades. There&apos;s a plaque marking one of several tunnels dug beneath the street; this one, at Strelitzer Strasse 55, a remarkable 140m long \u2013 57 people fled through it. Much else is hard, if not impossible, to spot without a specialist guide (I recommend Klausmeier and Schmidt&apos;s Wall Remnants, Wall Traces). But beyond the confines of the centre \u2013 north, say, of Bornholmer Strasse, or south maybe of Sonnenallee \u2013 and along much of the recently laid-out Mauerweg (the Wall Path, a cycle and walking route that follows, approximately and with many deviations, the path of the former guard road), innumerable tiny traces of the border system remain. In their neglected banality, they become oddly moving. Here there is an outsize street lamp, there a rusting lightmast. Elsewhere a junction box, a length of railing, window grilles, a wire fence. Sometimes a painted marker post rears up through a patch of weeds. A few painted road markings persist, and some heavy concrete boxes that were once roadblocks and now serve as municipal flowerbeds. On street corners, even when buildings have been renovated, you can still see where and how the Hinterland wall was attached, sealing off all access. In plenty of spots in the suburbs, where it hasn&apos;t generally been built on, what was once the border death strip is now a pleasant enough path, a &quot;green band&quot; prized for the flora and fauna it has conserved and appreciated by local joggers, cyclists and walkers. I take a taxi to the end of the line: the boundary between Brandenburg and the city of Berlin outside the small village of L\u00fcbars; the northernmost point of the Berlin Wall proper. It is cold and raining, heavily, and finding the wall&apos;s route is not easy; we eventually track it down where it crosses the Blankenfelderchaussee, at the site of an odd little memorial to the &quot;courageous&quot; firemen of L\u00fcbars who, in June 1990, got round to pulling down the wall and opening up the road. A wet ribbon of asphalt stretches into the distance on both sides, between green fields and allotments. This was the East German border guards&apos; patrol path, in the middle of the border strip. Twenty years ago, a concrete wall and a tall wire fence ran parallel to it, rendering the Blankenfelderchaussee impassable. Today, the strip is empty save for the trees that have sprung unconcernedly up along it. Nobody, not even a dedicated Germanic jogger, is out. According to Klausmeier and Schmidt, there are traces of the foundations of a watchtower to be observed here, as well as a handful of metal posts designating the start of the restricted area, a bit of wire fencing and a few lamps. They don&apos;t really seem worth getting wet for. &quot;Must be nice,&quot; says the taxi driver, who is Turkish, &quot;in summer. I might bring the family. Very rural. Wouldn&apos;t think you were in Berlin.&quot; We head back into town, the rain slowly easing. I walk along Norwegerstrasse and Schwedter Strasse, squeezed between railway tracks and yet-to-be-renovated buildings. The wall was once here, too. This whole zone \u2013 28 big apartment blocks, 1,500 adult inhabitants \u2013 was considered especially sensitive and subject to special security measures: access by special pass only, regular police checks of cellars and attics, a quarter of the flats occupied by reliable Stasi or army officers and their families. &quot;Yuppies fuck off&quot; says the graffiti now, and &quot;Abolish reality&quot;. And that&apos;s about it. Bar all those poignant but, for the non-expert, pretty much unrecognisable relics, the Berlin Wall is, truly, history. But wait \u2013 near Bernauer Strasse are the offices of the city&apos;s department for cultural affairs. Its spokesman, Torsten W\u00f6hlert, \u00ad explains the department&apos;s ambitious &quot;Wall Concept&quot;, a plan already underway to unify Berlin&apos;s scattered and disparate cold war remnants into a somewhat more coherent memorial framework, giving visitors and future generations of Berliners alike a better feel for what the wall really meant. The Bernauer Strasse site is being substantially extended to become the &quot;central commemorative landscape&quot;, W\u00f6hlert declares; the visitor&apos;s experience there will be significantly broadened and deepened. New exhibitions on the geopolitics of the period and the way the wall affected Berliners&apos; lives are planned at Checkpoint Charlie and at Friedrichstrasse station. There is a basic introduction to the whole subject beneath the Brandenburg Gate, and an all-singing, all-dancing &quot;virtual wall&quot; on the internet. &quot;It&apos;s true it is all a bit confused, a bit unfocused,&quot; W\u00f6hlert admits. &quot;People come, and they ask, &apos;Where&apos;s the wall?&apos; Our teenagers ask the same thing. But I think it really needed a generation to pass before we could act. We got rid of the wall and that, for everyone, was what mattered. Now we have to find the right way to remember it when it&apos;s no longer there. We have to inform, document and remember; to summon up the emotion, but remain rooted in the facts. It&apos;s history. It&apos;s a delicate business.&quot; Werner Probst, one hopes, will approve.", "sentences": ["So here we are, then, 50 or so of us, well-upholstered, middle-aged tourists from Frankfurt and Cologne and Amsterdam and Copenhagen, a retired couple from Cheshire, a shuffling bunch of schoolchildren from Bielefeld."], "title": "The Berlin Wall: where are the remains?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/27/berlin-wall-last-remnants", "tags": ["Berlin Wall", "Germany", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-10-27T00:05:39Z", "article": "I flourished at primary school, but when I was 11, everything changed. I moved to an independent school. Most of the boys knew each other from the prep school and there were firmly established groups and cliques. As a scholarship boy, I felt different. I came from a modest background, but many of the children were rich and seemed stuck-up. With no one to hang around with, I&apos;d take myself to the library to study, but it was difficult to focus. At the new school, I didn&apos;t feel like one of the brightest students. And suddenly I wasn&apos;t popular any more. People hardly seemed to notice me. Even the teachers didn&apos;t notice how isolated I was. A year on, I&apos;d made some friends, but the downward spiral had begun. I found it difficult to concentrate. I couldn&apos;t be bothered to study for exams. Looking back, I was probably depressed, but I didn&apos;t recognise it. I didn&apos;t like to ask for help. I knew my parents were making sacrifices to keep me at the school. I didn&apos;t want to disappoint them. By year 11, I&apos;d completely lost interest in school. One morning I decided not to go to school any more. The school tried everything, even getting my tutor to pick me up for school, but I refused. I cut myself off from friends and family. I also had addiction problems. I was only 16, but I felt like a failure. I was unsure of my future, or even whether I had one. The turning point came the following year at a rehab centre in Amsterdam. Six months later, I was on the road to recovery. I enrolled on a two-year access course at Lewisham College, aimed at students looking for an alternative route to university. I got the opportunity to try subjects like psychology, law and sociology, which I may not have at school. I felt comfortable in college and made friends easily. I passed the course well and am now doing a geography degree at University College London. Looking back, I wonder if things would have been different if I&apos;d had the courage to ask for help at school, or tell my teachers I was struggling. During my second year at Lewisham, I became a &quot;study buddy&quot;, a paid position, supporting a first-year student on my course. Going to college has given me the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds and walks of life. It has really boosted my confidence.

Arsenal have not won the League Cup since 1993, when it was sponsored by Cavity Creater, yet they are the Carling darlings, the No1 reason to follow a competition that is actually more interesting than the FA Cup these days. Quite right too. Every year Arsenal&apos;s kids, with their unfettered talent, charm us on their way to Inevitable Defeat At The Feet Of Bigger Boys In The Later Rounds. We may have to suspend belief to presume that a decent percentage of these foetuses really will go all the way in the game \u2013 look what happened to most of the side that spanked a strong Everton team in 2004-05 \u2013 but we are happy to do so, because this is football directed by John Hughes, a starburst of mischief and teenage hope in an otherwise cynical, soulless world. It keeps us young. That sounded desperately pretentious, didn&apos;t it? Come on, this is the Guardian.  Win win win! We have tickets for Arsenal v AZ Alkmaar  and you plebs can&apos;t have th  and, as we are feeling generous, we are offering you the chance to win them.  Team news Rafa Benitez commits the cardinal sin of changing a winning side. In fact there are 10 changes from the team that beat 11 traffic cones on Sunday, but Alberto Aquilani isn&apos;t one of them. He&apos;s on the bench. Arsene Wenger makes 11 changes from the side that drew at West Ham. Nonetheless, it&apos;s a disappointingly experienced Arsenal side, including Samir Nasri, who is back after knack. Jack Wilshere is presumably injured.

Liverpool (4-2-3-1) Cavalieri; Degen, Skrtel, Kyrgiakos, Insua; Spearing, Plessis; Kuyt, Voronin, Babel; Ngog.Subs: Reina, Aquilani, Benayoun, Darby, Dossena, Eccleston, Ayala. Referee Alan Wiley (Staffordshire)  Pre-match emails &quot;Does this match set a record for the number of non-English players involving two English teams?&quot; - Barry Walsh. &quot;Don&apos;t you think it&apos;s time for the media in general and fans alike, to boycott games where teams do not field their best line-ups?&quot; - Michael Philip. (No) &quot;I read an interesting interview with Danny Karbassiyoon (who was in that 2004 team), that talks about being one of the Arsenal kids and not making it&quot; - David Leech. &quot;By my reckoning, eight of the 14 players that played for Arsenal in the Everton match you mentioned are now actually playing Premiership-standard football. Not too shabby, is it?&quot; - Alex Vougioukas. (Yes, but I said go all the way. Only van Persie might be argued to have done that.)  1 min Arsenal kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in black.  2 min &quot;Is there anyone who looks harder than Skrtel?&quot; asks David Netherwood. &quot;I mean really, if you bumped into someone who resembles him in an alley... I challenge anyone to find me a footballer who looks harder than Skrtel.&quot; Me. Next.  3 min Ngog gets free on the right and swings over a half-decent cross. Kuyt, arriving late 15 yards out, gets his body into a very awkward position \u2013 he looked a Rik Mayall character dry-humping fresh air \u2013 and sidefoots a volley wide of the far post.  5 min &quot;Surely this is\u00a0the oldest Arsenal Carling Cup side in a while?&quot; says Tim Bailey. &quot;The likes of creaky 32-year-old Silvestre and the ancient 26-year-old Eduardo have pushed the average age of the starting line-up\u00a0up to a staggering 22.4 years. Wasn&apos;t last year&apos;s side full of 16-year-olds and random schoolchildren that happened to be hanging around the Emirates at the time?&quot; Aye, and to be fair I reckon it would have been today had they not drawn a Big Five Side. Arsene Wenger has to balance the desire to give the kids crucial experience with the need to not expose them to the scars of a potential thrashing.  7 min Arsenal are passing the ball round pretty well, although without Wilshere and Vela there is less excitement about the game. There&apos;s always Aaron Ramsey I suppose. Good old Aaron Ramsey.  8 min &quot;I&apos;m not sure how you can write off the careers of Edu, Pennant, and Flamini quite so easily,&quot; says Paul Martinovic. &quot;Unless &apos;go all the way&apos; is an off-colour reference to [snip - imaginary legal ed].&quot; Are Edu, Pennant and Flamini great of potential greats of the game? No. The definition was pretty clear.  9 min Pass the corset: somebody is punching a beach ball around the terraces. AHAHAHJAHAHAHAHA.  10 min Degen misses a great chance for Liverpool. Ngog&apos;s fine backheel bisected Gibbs and Senderos and put the right-back Degen through on goal, 15 yards out. He tried to arrow it into the far corner with the outside of the right foot, but got no bend on it and just stabbed it wide.  11 min Skrtel bodychecks Nasri right on the edge of the box, a few yards left of centre. Nasri lifts the free-kick over the wall and wide of the near post with Cavalieri motionless, pondering it all.  13 min It&apos;s a pretty open game so far. Arsenal are shading it in terms of ball-retention, but Liverpool look the more penetrative. Those observations aren&apos;t worth a vigorous one, in truth, as we&apos;ve only had 13 minutes.  15 min Voronin charges down Fabianski&apos;s clearance, but the ball flies safely for a throw-in. Voronin, amusingly, had injured himself in the unusual act of doing something and will probably need to go off.  16 min &quot;I can&apos;t help suspecting you&apos;ve made up the names on the Arsenal bench,&quot; says Hugh Barker. &quot;Coquelin? Frimpong? Really??&quot; Oh there&apos;s nobody called &apos;Really&apos; on the bench. And yes \u2013 yes \u2013 I am here all week. Or at least till security bundle me out the door.  17 min Almost a gorgeous goal from Arsenal. Gibbs clipped the ball into Bendtner, 25 yards out, and he played a wonderfully penetrative one-two with Eduardo. That put Bendtner through on Cavalieri, but he couldn&apos;t decide whether to shoot for goal or pass it to Ramsey, who was square and had an open goal. He did neither, and looked a bit of an arse as he ran beyond the ball while Cavalieri picked it up. A shame, as the build-up was exquisite.  GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Liverpool (Merida 19) Fran Merida scores his first goal for Arsenal, and it&apos;s a scorcher. Voronin&apos;s dismal lay-off to Babel was intercepted by the right-back Gilbert, and as the ball broke loose 20 yards out, on the right corner of the box, the left-winger Merida spanked it first time past Cavalieri and in off the top of the near post. Fabulous goal.  20 min &quot;Edu,&quot; says Michael Scallon. &quot;Now there was a lovely Nonsense Game Only player. He only ever seemed to play in cup ties (deflected free kick at Old Trafford in 2003), the end of season league games that nobody cares about (he was wonderful in 7-0 against Everton in 2004-05), or in an injury crisis. Wenger could have got more out of him.&quot; I liked Edu a lot. Are you doing him a disservice? I recall him playing a lot in the Invincibles season, though I might be wrong.  21 min So, when did Liverpool last lose five out of six?  23 min Babel does extremely well to cushion a long, angled pass on the corner of the six-yard box. He then lays it back to Voronin, whose first touch is Dawson&apos;s-Creek-conversation-heavy and allows Senderos to clear easily. Voronin, sadly for Liverpool, looks okay to carry on now.  25 min Why are goals that go in off the woodwork so much more rewarding? It&apos;s like the best foreplay ever.  GOAL! Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool (Insua 26) Another absolute peach. A filthy hoof from Skrtel was knocked back by Babel on the edge of the box and Insua, who had run beyond Bendtner, knocked it into the space and then let it bounce before cutting across a beautiful strike that swooshed and dipped over the head of Fabianski and into the net. It&apos;s his first goal for Liverpool. Some might blame Fabianski, because it was so central, but it was a fantastic strike and it was moving all over the place.  27 min &quot;I can confirm that Edu has played in more meaningless games than Edu-ardo,&quot; says Toss. &quot;Though Edu-ardo might be aspiring to close the gap.&quot;  28 min &quot;Which approach does the consensus favour as most effective?&quot; begins Ethan Dean-Richards. &quot;Man Utd&apos;s loaning out of young players, Arsenal&apos;s using them in the cup competitions, or Liverpool&apos;s complete apathy towards them?&quot; I quite like West Ham&apos;s actually using them in the league, even if it isn&apos;t especially effective just now.  31 min &quot;Evening Rob,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;&apos;Arsene Wenger has to balance the desire to give the kids crucial experience with the need to not expose them to the scars of a potential thrashing&apos;? (5 min). Presumably you&apos;re saying that thrashing Liverpool this early in their careers might give them inflated ideas of their own ability?&quot; I&apos;ve said it before and I&apos;ll say it again: honk!  32 min Liverpool are having a decent spell and win a corner. They don&apos;t score from it, though, so I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;m typing all this. Sorry.  33 min &quot;Johan Cruyff used to say he enjoyed hitting the post as much as scoring,&quot; says Mike Shallcross. &quot;He loved the sound. This might be why he is the greatest player of all time but doesn&apos;t have a World Cup winner&apos;s medal.&quot; It is a fiercely erotic sound.  34 min &quot;I believe the &apos;best foreplay ever&apos; involves woodwork, a stick of butter and the smooth sounds of Kenny G,&quot; says Colin Greer.  35 min Bendtner dives risibly over a challenge from Insua. Three-match ban please!  36 min &quot;He was a bit unlucky in his time, if memory serves,&quot; says Michael Scallon. &quot;When he came to Arsenal, it was Parlour-Vieira, and then once The Romford Pele got old, he bought Gilberto, so when everyone was fit he didn&apos;t often get a game. And he scored a lot of own-goals too, I think, which doesn&apos;t help. If I was picking the team, instead of someone infinitely more qualified and able, I&apos;d have picked him every week. He was really good.&quot; He was a poor man&apos;s Petit, which is pretty high praise in Arsenal circles.  37 min A gloriously aware pass from Ramsey, opening up the Liverpool defence like someone whisking away a towel in a locker room, puts Merida clear on the left side of the box. Cavalieri comes to meet him so Merida has to take it first time, but his on-target effort is headed away by Skrtel for a corner. From it, the ball breaks to Bendtner beyond the far post, and his shot from a tight angle is smothered by Cavalieri. That was bigger-picture football at its best from Ramsey.  39 min Voronin is utter garbage.  41 min See 39 min.  43 min After a ridiculous scramble, sparked by Cavalieri dropping a corner from the left, Liverpool escape twice. First Plessis blocked a close-range shot and a few seconds later, with Cavalieri now back in his goal, Bendtner&apos;s shot on the turn from six yards was straight at the keeper.  44 min &quot;Colin Greer is either clinically disturbed, or in prison,&quot; says Richard Marshall. &quot;Or both.&quot;  45 min &quot;Dossena or Voronin,&quot; says Jeff Woodman. &quot;Pick one and defend your decision.&quot; Can I phone a friend?  Half time: Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool An open half, two fine goals and a fair scoreline. What more could you want? Oh. See you in 10 minutes.  Half-time emails &quot;The thing about Voronin is that he looks like he&apos;d be good in Europe. Not the Champions League obviously, I mean the 1980s cock-rock band&quot; - David Jones. &quot;I&apos;d have to go with Dossena over Voronin. He may be a rubbish defender but at least he scores once in a while&quot; - John Powers.  &quot;The relentless conveyor belt of Arsenal potential that subsequently goes largely unrealised - even Little Cesc, in his sixth season at Arsenal (nearly 250 games!) has just an FA Cup to show for it - calls into question exactly what it is that Arsene knows. Spotting a player? Yes. Developing a player fully? Not in my less than humble opinion&quot; - Gary Naylor. &quot;Why oh why do so many footy players seem to be doing their knackers in these days? Bring back the old days of metatarsals&quot; - Paul Hughes. &quot;Btw, Fran Merida is a Barca youth product. Just giving credit wherecredit is due. I&apos;m confused about the Premier League and managers though. So, there are these teams with Life Term Managers it seems (Benitez, Wenger, etc.) who don&apos;t really win things despite massive outlays of money and exceptional players. Why?&quot; - Melissa F. &quot;Your last line at half-time got me thinking. How can you see me in 10 minutes? You aren&apos;t even talking to me, let alone seeing me across the digital gulch. Shouldn&apos;t you (write) &apos;write back at you in 10 mins&apos;?&quot; - Drew Blair.  46 min Liverpool kick off from left to right. No substitutions.  47 min &quot;Talking about the sound of the ball hitting the post, I&apos;ve always enjoyed that metallic sound that the net at the Amsterdam ArenA makes when someone scores,&quot; pants James Collins, wearing out his DVD of Ajax&apos;s last 5-0 home win.  48 min I didn&apos;t mention young Eastmond in the first half, but that&apos;s only because holding midfielders never really draw much attention in MBMs, such is the generally unobtrusive nature of their work. He looked very composed and mature, though, and helped Gilbert rob Babel in the build-up to Merina&apos;s goal.  49 min &quot;How has Nasri been playing?&quot; says Robert Wade. Alright I suppose. His run for the early free-kick on the edge of the area was lovely. I&apos;m not convinced the central role suits him, though; he&apos;s a touch too deep.l  GOAL! Arsenal 2-1 Liverpool (Bendtner 50) Arsenal are back in front. The move started with a snappy first-time pass from Eastmond to Merida on the left wing. He played the ball across the face of the area towards Bendtner and Eduardo. They almost got in each other&apos;s way, but Bendtner took the initiative, shifted the ball to the side of Skrtel and crunched it above Cavalieri from the left corner of the six-yard box.  51 min &quot;Own goals aside, doesn&apos;t Edu&apos;s reputation suffer because of the sort of player he was?&quot; asks Adrian Cooper. &quot;The vicious enforcers, such as Makelele, stand out as do the runaround-like-a-headless-chicken types, like Gerard will always stand out but, in my mind, Edu&apos;s talent lay in an ability to influence the pace of the game. Not to speed things up and charge at the opposition but as someone that knows when to slow things down and ease off. Pedro Mendes was similar - also underrated but with able to take charge and dictate the pace when players around him were getting a bit too carried away.&quot;  53 min After a lovely run from Nasri on the right, Merida&apos;s toepoked low cross just eludes Eduardo, six yards out.  54 min &quot;Just been in the garden to test out the sound of ball on post,&quot; says Paul Hughes. &quot;Perfect shot hit my jumper on the ground. Just made a PHHHHHHUT sound. Didn&apos;t turn me on. Maybe I need some butter.&quot;  55 min After some very fine one-touch play between Voronin and Degen, Voronin&apos;s low cross shot from the right side of the box goes just wide of the far post.  58 min &quot;The ping of dimpled rubber Tuftex balls embedding their maker&apos;s name into the frozen thigh of the school spanner,&quot; reminisces Ben Dunn. &quot;That&apos;s the sound of true football.&quot;  60 min Liverpool are having a lot of the ball now, but they aren&apos;t creating much. Their most purposeful attacking threat is probably the right-back Degen.  63 min I&apos;ve just realised that Dirk Kuyt is on the pitch. Gibbs has had him in his pocket.  64 min Aquilani will surely be on soon, though there are no signs that his arrival is imminent.  65 min &quot;Degen is useful in the Carling Cup,&quot; says Mark Kyburz. &quot;No more, no less.&quot;  66 min Liverpool win a free-kick 35 yards out. Voronin touches it off for Babel, whose fierce low shot forces a decent sprawling catch from Fabianski. That one came right off Babel&apos;s sweet spot.  67 min &quot;Mr Cooper (51 mins) has a point about who gets noticed on a football field,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;I love players who win the ball ten yards or so inside their own half, then advance ten yards into the opposition half before playing a pass forward to a man wearing the same shirt. Ray Wilkins got 80-odd England caps for a lot less than that. Peter Reid and Paul Bracewell, both of whom did that simple task repeatedly for Everton&apos;s great team of the mid-80s, got 16 caps between them.&quot;  68 min Arsenal have become sloppy in possession, subconsciously sitting on the 2-1 scoreline. Meanwhile, Skrtel is getting treatment after accidentally ramming his chin into Eduardo&apos;s head. Yeah, Skrtel&apos;s hard.  69 min &quot;Anyone remember Edu&apos;s goal against Celta Vigo in the Big Cup circa 2004 I think?&quot; asks David Hunt. &quot;Stunning. I was a huge fan of his, reckon he could have been a really top player if it wasn&apos;t for all the injuries. His ability to read a situation and intercept passes was uncanny.&quot; He had a rare combination of elegance and genuine toughness.  71 min Merida&apos;s devastating, dipping free-kick from the right was about to be touched home by Eduardo, six yards out, when the ever diligent Kuyt put it past his own post for a corner. Fine defending.  72 min &quot;Voronin touched it off and helped Babel find his sweet spot?&quot; pants Adrian Cooper. &quot;Is it time to get the butter out, or have we moved past that stage already?&quot;  74 min A Liverpool substitution: Yossi Benayoun replaces David Ngog, who started brightly but faded. Babel will go up front.  75 min Arsenal bring on Mark Randall and Sanchez Watt for Craig Eastmond, who should be extremely proud of a startlingly mature Arsenal debut in the most important position on the pitch, and Nicklas Bendtner, who should be extremely proud of... er, we&apos;ll get back to you on that one.  77 min Here comes Alberto Aquilani, on for Damien Plessis.  78 min Watt receives possession in a farcical amount of space in the box, but instead of shooting he tries to go round Skrtel, who drapes an arm across Watt&apos;s chest to allow the ball to run through to Cavalieri. Is that a foul? I don&apos;t know anymore. Nobody appealed.  79 min &quot;Is Aquilani injured yet?&quot; honks Bruce Gow.  80 min Babel misses a sitter. Voronin played a good one-two with Babel 20 yards out and slipped it inside Gibbs for Kuyt, who sidefooted such an inviting cross along the six-yard box. Babel only had to touch it past Fabianski, but he completely missed it.  81 min Eduardo squirms away from Skrtel and then toebungs across goal and a few yards wide from a tight angle on the left of the box.  82 min Liverpool are really pressing, and Voronin&apos;s beautifully struck 25-yard shot goes straight at Fabianski. A few yards either side, etc.  83 min &quot;Yeah, Edu had a bit of the Gustavo Poyet about him; nothing violently tough, just &apos;take no shit&apos; tough,&quot; says Michael Scallon. &quot;Whereas Thomas Gravesen was actually scary, Edu, Poyet, Nobby Solano and Pedro Mendes were mentally tough enough to mix it without looking like a scared bunny (Laurent Robert never quite managed this, bless him, he was moderately good but seemed a bit too wimpy).&quot;  84 min Aquilani watch: just one high-class, driven crossfield pass to Degen a few minutes back.  86 min Liverpool are running out of time. Apart from a few minutes around the 80-minute mark, they have struggled to get momentum because of substitutions and injury stoppages.  87 min And here&apos;s another of those stoppages: Fran Merida is replaced by Francis Coquelin.  88 min An appalling pass from Ramsey finds Babel, and his first-time pass puts Voronin through on goal - but he is wrongly flagged offside. He wasn&apos;t central, but he was miles clear of the defenders and bearing down on Fabianski, so Liverpool will feel aggrieved about that.  89 min Philipp Degen is replaced by a debutant striker, Nathan Eccleston.  90 min There will be a minimum of four minutes of added time.  90+1 min Arsenal are keeping the ball pretty effectively at the moment.  90+2 min Liverpool have six men in the box and appeal for handball when Aquilani&apos;s scissor-kick is blocked. It did hit both Senderos&apos;s arms, but he was only a few yards from Aquilani. It&apos;s the sort of penalty a home side gets.  Full time: Arsenal 2-1 Liverpool Well done Arsenal. They just about deserved to win an enjoyably open game, and go through to the quarter-finals of this competition yet again. Cheers for your emails.

Until a few years ago, it was the home of Anne Rice, high priestess of popular vampiric fiction and author of Interview with the Vampire, who, more than anyone, is responsible for making the Crescent City a tourist mecca for willingly gullible devotees of spookiness and the supernatural. Rice assumed the role of Queen of the Night with brio: she would turn up to book signings in a quilted coffin, and once staged her own mock funeral at Lafayette Cemetery No 1, complete with horse-drawn hearse and a brass band playing dirges. She opened her elegant home to the public every Monday, and adoring fans clad in black would queue around the block to see the macabre artefacts it was stuffed with, including a lemur skeleton and a collection of evil-looking antique dolls, set out in rooms painted mauve and fuschia. Guides offering tours to &quot;Haunted New Orleans&quot;, who built their itineraries around a visit to Rice&apos;s mansion, were decidedly glum when the writer left the city five years ago, just before Katrina hit. She is, after all, one of the world&apos;s bestselling authors, and her feverish page-turners brought in hordes of visitors eager to experience the city&apos;s gothic atmospherics, along with its celebrated Creole food and jazz. This year, First Street offered rather more pedestrian fare in the run-up to Halloween: when I walked around the Garden District \u2013 it&apos;s an unmissable part of the city \u2013 a fortnight ago, I saw only pumpkins, plastic skulls hanging from porches, and the odd Frankenstein&apos;s monster tied to a tree. Of course, the gothic atmospherics long antedated Rice, and she looked to them for inspiration. Interview with the Vampire begins with the story of one of the Louisiana indigo plantations not far from the city, characterised by humid swamp lands and gnarled oaks dripping with Spanish moss. But the action soon moves to the old city \u2013 the French Quarter, still largely preserved \u2013 and its streets of Creole cottages and colonial villas, with their battered shutters and secluded courtyards. A port historically charged with voodoo magic (thanks to the slave trade) and heavy with Catholic mysticism (from generations of European immigrants), suggested all too obviously blood-spilling of a vampiric kind. And a city long identified with sexual permissiveness was a plausible home for dashing, irresistible throat-piercers. Rice&apos;s revenant heroes roam the extraordinary St Louis and Lafayette cemeteries, which, however many sightseers crowd them, still resemble Hammer horror film sets. The crumbling, sun-bleached tombs are, unusually, above ground (the water table is so high, bodies buried in the normal way always floated back to the surface). So the Spanish-style vaults in these &quot;cities of the dead&quot; are reusable, and house many sets of remains within them. There&apos;s lots of rusting decorative ironwork; the pathways between the crypts are narrow and twisting; crosses and statues on top of the tombs cast odd shadows across the necropolis; and votive candles add the final touch. Rice lovingly traded on the evocative architecture and sexy Southern exoticism of one of the oldest cities in America. &quot;This was New Orleans,&quot; begins a passage in her most famous novel, &quot;a magical and magnificent place to live. In which a vampire, richly dressed and gracefully walking through the pools of light of one gas lamp after another might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures . . .&quot; Now a new set of Louisiana vampires has come along to entice bloodsucking devotees to the New Orleans area. True Blood, the hit TV series which has attracted five million viewers in the States (it&apos;s currently showing on Channel 4 in the UK), is based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels of Charlaine Harris, which has as its premise the entering of the vamps into mainstream society \u2013 thanks to the availability of Japanese-made synthetic blood they have &quot;come out of the casket&quot;. In the opening paragraph of the first Sookie book, Dead Until Dark, we hear of the exciting arrival of the first revenants in the fictional backwoods town of Bon Temps, Louisiana. New Orleans, meanwhile, is &quot;a real centre&quot; for vampires with &quot;the whole Anne Rice thing, right?&quot; Alan Ball, the creator of True Blood, whose previous work includes Six Feet Under, has described his new show as &quot;bubblegum TV&quot; (anyone talking of it in the same terms as other HBO shows such as The Sopranos or The Wire has let the bayou humidity go to their head). But it is fun and raunchy and knowing: we see a newspaper headline that announces &quot;Angelina adopts Vampire Baby&quot;. The fanged hero, civil war veteran Bill Compton, seduces Sookie, another reworking of Bram Stoker&apos;s virginal Mina Harker \u2013 on the night she succumbs she wears a white nightgown with flowing sleeves. Ball plays around with vampires as metaphor \u2013 his seductive revenants are clearly stand-ins for gay people (the opening credit sequence features a sign that reads &quot;God Hates Fangs&quot;, a play on the Kansas City-based Westboro Baptist Church slogan &quot;God Hates Fags&quot;), and those who enjoy being bitten by a vampire during sex are castigated as &quot;fang-bangers&quot;. The vampires are a persecuted minority fighting for integration and civil rights \u2013 they are outsiders, the staple of teenage fiction. In True Blood, it has become illegal to &quot;drain&quot; vampires of their blood which, when drunk by ordinary mortals, is a potent hallucinogen and aphrodisiac, nicknamed &quot;V&quot;. Such is the show&apos;s success, it won&apos;t be long before there are &quot;fangtastic&quot; tours to Clinton, the small Louisiana town around 50 miles from New Orleans where much of True Blood is filmed (I drove there, and there&apos;s little to see at present). This Halloween weekend, New Orleans plays host to a Vampire film festival, and the bloodsuckers aren&apos;t likely to disappear any time soon. There&apos;s intense rivalry between businesses selling haunted history trips and &quot;spooktaculars&quot; in the city, and the locals are understandably keen, following Katrina, to do all they can to attract visitors: better fictional horrors than real ones, and better ghost stories than actual memories of a ghost town. Over the years such stories have been told, retold and blithely fabricated to feed the public&apos;s appetite for escapism with a ghoulish theme. The legend most excitedly recycled by my guide at the St Louis cemetery, for instance, is of Marie Laveau, the Creole &quot;voodoo queen&quot;, whose crypt there is, reportedly, the second-most visited grave in the US (after Elvis&apos;s but ahead of JFK&apos;s). The tomb is covered in sets of three &quot;X&quot;s, drawn or scratched on by visitors to represent wishes they hope the famed sorceress will grant. The story goes that Laveau, who was alive in the 1800s and worked as a hairdresser to rich, white families, would stage ceremonies in which the participants would be possessed by spirits and dance naked. She told fortunes and healed the sick, dispensing charms and potions called gris-gris. When she finally died in 1881, aged almost 80, legend has it she turned herself into a huge black crow that still flies over the cemetery (though, in truth, it&apos;s doubtful she&apos;s buried there at all). There are, naturally, voodoo shops in the French Quarter that sell gris-gris, statues, fetishes, incense and masks. And all over the city, the supernatural is a selling point. Ghosts bring in dollars as surely as Mardi Gras and every hotel seems to have a ghost. The Monteleone, an august establishment on Royal Street, boasts a number of spectres and poltergeists \u2013 not least one that keeps opening a locked door. Sure enough, on my first morning there, the story was doing the rounds that a ghostly boy had been sighted the\u00a0previous night, sitting on some steps on the 14th floor. When a guest tried to take his photo, all that was captured by her camera was a black, formless shape. Guides stopping outside the three-storey LaLaurie mansion further down Royal tell a grisly tale of cruelty to slaves in the mid-19th century. Madame LaLaurie was a prominent figure in the town and hosted many parties in her lavish residence. But rumours began to spread about the unhealthy appearance and the disappearance of her household servants and slaves. A young girl was chased on to the roof and fell to her death; she was buried underneath the cypress tree in the courtyard. Then a fire broke out in the mansion and rescuers discovered evidence that servants had been chained up and maltreated. Madame LaLaurie fled the city. Even more lurid details, which add spice to this story of &quot;the most haunted house in New Orleans&quot; \u2013 women nailed to floors, makeshift sex-change operations, and so on \u2013 turn out to have been the invention of the owner of one of the local ghost-tour businesses. And the house with &quot;the most ghosts in America&quot;? Two hours outside the city, in St Francisville, beyond Baton Rouge, is the Myrtles Plantation house, built in 1796. An engaging guide, Robi, makes the most of shlocky legends of vanishing jewellery, footsteps on the stairs and trapped spirits in a mirror: see the handprints, see the streaks of ... what? Blood? Mississippi river water? The bed and breakfasters who lodge upstairs, we&apos;re assured, rarely make it through the night. It&apos;s all down to the cruelty of an antebellum owner of the house, Clark Woodruff, who forced a slave, Chloe, to become his mistress then put her to death as a punishment for eavesdropping. In revenge, she is said to have killed off Woodruff&apos;s wife and daughters. That there&apos;s no record of Woodruff owning any slaves, and that his family, in fact, died of yellow fever is of no consequence \u2013 the phantoms provide the frisson. I was expecting a certain frisson myself when I sank into the plush red cushions of the darkened s\u00e9ance lounge of Muriel&apos;s Jackson Square, in the French Quarter, for my first ever tarot reading. Behind heavy, tassled curtains, a couple of Egyptian mummies looked on. In hindsight, I realise I was expecting too much \u2013 Jane Seymour&apos;s Solitaire in Live and Let Die, to be specific. Instead, my psychic had the benign and tingle-free demeanour of a National Trust volunteer. I drew three initial cards, Knight in Cups, Emperor and Happiness, and listened as my Louisiana Mystic Meg gently, and extremely vaguely, explained their many possible meanings. So, disappointingly, no ghosts or vampires made themselves known to me in New Orleans, though \u2013 in keeping with local tradition \u2013 I became pleasantly familiar with spirits of another kind (special mention goes to the brandy milk punch at Brennan&apos;s). In truth, the long history of the city is fascinating enough without it being haunted and without a vampire lurking in every shadow; there&apos;s plenty of genuine gothic to go around. And a bowl of gumbo ya ya, followed by a night of music on Frenchman Street, is intoxication enough for me \u2013 at least, that is, until I can get hold of some &quot;V&quot;.

Did Mr Brown, in his encomium, mention Mr Blair&apos;s command of the tennis court? Did Mr Miliband remind waverers of Blair&apos;s scrupulously maintained tan, balanced diet and faultless body mass index? Have his promoters produced, by way of clinching the question of physical superiority, photographs of Mr Blair in his underpants? By his own account, this costume shows the charismatic leader to traffic-stopping advantage. In one of many allusions to Mr Blair&apos;s appearance, the diaries of his fellow Adonis, Alastair Campbell, record a meeting on the day of the Queen Mother&apos;s lying in state. Mr Blair \u2013 as often seemed to be his habit when the two men were together \u2013 was almost naked. &quot;Yellow/green underpants and that was it. I said what a prat he looked. He said I was just jealous \u2013 how many prime ministers have got a body like this?&quot; Should not Blair&apos;s current rivals for the EU presidency be able to say the same? Even member states that put the more prosaic duties of this job before its iconic requirements must surely recognise the need for a superlatively fit president whose hard body will command respect from every corner of Europe. How would it look, for example, if the new European figurehead were flabbier than jogger and French president Nicolas Sarkozy, whose spartan regime now boasts some of the thinnest ministers in the developed world? In the UK, David Cameron is sufficiently confident in his shorts to tell fat people to show more self-control. As for Signor Berlusconi, what he lacks in core strength he has made up for in appearance: his artful deployment of hair transplants, make-up and cosmetic work now invites comparisons with one of Europe&apos;s greatest-ever poseurs, Benito Mussolini. Unsurprisingly, the image-conscious Berlusconi has proved one of Blair&apos;s most faithful supporters. It seems fair to ask, in this era of political body consciousness, how well Blair&apos;s so-called rival, Jean-Claude Juncker, would stand up to close scrutiny. Not necessarily in his underpants. A close-fitting swimsuit would do. Or even tight jeans, like the ones Mr Blair wore, to dazzling effect, at Camp David. Anything that indicated what kind of physical specimen presumes to challenge Mr Blair&apos;s bodily authority. There are similar doubts, unresolved so long as they cling to their grey suits, about the comparative fitness for the presidency of Jan Peter Balkenende and Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel. That there can be any hesitation about Blair&apos;s qualifications suggests that European leaders need to be reminded of a key moment in the history of the EU. In Amsterdam for a summit, Mr Blair, urged on by Campbell, defeated all the other European leaders in a keenly contested bicycle race. &quot;The others looked on incredibly jealous, including Kohl,&quot; Campbell recorded. &quot;Kohl didn&apos;t go on the bike and looked incredibly pissed off.&quot; Some will think it demeaning for distinguished national leaders to be subjected to this kind of assessment. In what other non-sporting line of work are there similar expectations of physical prowess? No one expects a senior economist \u2013 Mervyn King, for instance \u2013 to jog, like Boris, or do judo, like William Hague, or, least of all, to boast about his feats, like Campbell. But retired politicians point out that it would now be unthinkable for a man with a build along the lines of, say, Aneurin Bevan, to find work at the top of politics. Even for superior physical specimens, the price of political success is now perpetual exercise. In the defiant figure of Gordon Brown, still unashamed to be photographed with his proud bulge of a stomach, some see a backlash against the impossible &quot;size zero&quot; fixation that, models worry, is forcing the current generation of politicians to the edge of exercise addiction and burn-out. But most voters seem to view it differently: Brown is expected to lose the next election to a man whose principal political accessory is a bicycle. Whether Blair haters like it or not, the new European president will have to compete on a world stage that is dominated by two obsessive exercisers, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, both of whom have also appeared half-naked in public. Of the two, President Putin was the first to revive a cult of the body that seems to have last flourished at this level around 2,000 years ago, when Augustus Caesar had the good luck to be sculpted in a breastplate rather than photographed in a sweat-soaked T-shirt. True, President Clinton made some attempt to advertise his physical allure a few years back, with some jogging around Washington, but images of his puce-faced excursions only confirm Putin&apos;s improbable mastery of the sporting-political scene. Photographs in which he fishes, practises judo and strikes a variety of absurd, he-man poses have inspired not ridicule, but newspaper features such as &quot;Get a body like Putin&apos;s&quot; and, currently, the commission of a bronze bust by Russia&apos;s Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation, a thoughtful gift for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Obama&apos;s advertisement of his fitness is, as expected, a more subtle and appealing affair, in which any tendency towards macho excess is tempered by the presence of his partner in sport, Michelle. So far, in fact, there appear to have been more &quot;Get arms like Michelle&apos;s&quot; features than &quot;Get pecs like Obama&apos;s&quot;, and the first lady&apos;s austere health and fitness routines had, until last week, come to eclipse the president&apos;s achievements in basketball. Only the disclosure that Obama now spends more time playing golf than did George W Bush has awakened suspicions that there are more ways than one of being a macho, boring, women-excluding jock. But given that unsporting men are also excluded from the presidential fun and games, these tedious displays of health and fitness may be more sportist than they are sexist. An ambitious toady of either sex might feign interest in the Olympics or in the fortunes of Burnley FC. And Condi Rice showed it could be done, with the help of a 4.30am gym routine. But what of the political but utterly unsporting of both sexes? Other than flicking with wet towels? If blubber purges on the scale of Sarkozy&apos;s are still something of a rarity, modern politics looks like an increasingly inhospitable place for the underexercised or sport-phobic. In an age of image-obsessed personality politics, ostentatiously exercised bodies will continue to be accepted at their owners&apos; estimation as charismatic indicators of control and strength. When they should, rather, be dismissed as irrelevant \u2013 when they are not evidence of terrifying narcissism and hours of wasted time. The last time Blair appeared in the Commons, his glorious sheen of well-toned health was widely and flatteringly contrasted with Brown&apos;s neglected physique and pasty skin. But surely the most appealing thing about our prime minister is that no one has ever written an article called &quot;Get a body like Gordon&apos;s&quot;.", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam for a summit, Mr Blair, urged on by Campbell, defeated all the other European leaders in a keenly contested bicycle race."], "title": "Sorry, Gordon, but your body politic doesn't match Putin's | Catherine Bennett", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/01/catherine-bennett-blair-putin-brown", "tags": ["Gordon Brown", "Tony Blair", "Politics", "World news", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Vladimir Putin", "Fitness", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-01T00:06:31Z", "article": "The mother of Mikhail Khodorkovsky \u2013 the billionaire oligarch locked up for defying Vladimir Putin \u2013 has appealed to the foreign secretary, David Miliband, to raise her son&apos;s case during his high-profile visit to Russia tomorrow Monday. In an interview with the Observer, Khodorkovsky&apos;s mother, Marina Filipovna, 74, said she was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the US administration&apos;s new hands-off approach to Russia \u2013 and said it was essential that Britain kept human rights at the forefront of its dialogue with the Kremlin. &quot;It&apos;s very important that western leaders keep raising my son&apos;s case,&quot; she said. Asked whether the Russian government was likely to heed criticism from Miliband, given London and Moscow&apos;s recent fraught relations, she replied: &quot;Foreign governments have enough levers that they can use.&quot; Miliband is arriving in Moscow tomorrow on his first visit to Russia as foreign secretary. The date coincides with the third anniversary of the poisoning in London of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, which thrust British-Russian relations into a period of turmoil from which they have not yet fully recovered. Speaking from a boarding school for orphans funded by Khodorkovsky outside Moscow, Filipovna said she was &quot;alarmed&quot; by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s recent visit to Russia and the apparent downgrading of human rights issues by President Barack Obama. &quot;During a radio interview Clinton was twice asked about my son&apos;s case. She refused to comment. This is very worrying,&quot; she said. Once Russia&apos;s richest man, and chief executive of the country&apos;s biggest oil company Yukos, Khodorkovsky was dramatically arrested in October 2003 on the runway of a Siberian airport. The criminal case against him was widely seen as punishment for his decision to fund opposition parties and to challenge the might of then-president Putin. Khodorkovsky was later jailed for nine years, reduced to eight, for fraud and other offences. In 2007, prosecutors filed fresh charges against Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev. For the past seven months both defendants have appeared in court in Moscow, sitting in a heavily-guarded bulletproof glass cage dubbed the &quot;aquarium&quot;. Supporters say this second trial is groundless, contradictory and increasingly surreal. This second case \u2013 on charges suspiciously similar to the original ones \u2013 has caused consternation in the European Union, with the Council of Europe&apos;s rapporteur, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, recently declaring she was &quot;perplexed&quot; by the Russian government&apos;s decision to launch fresh proceedings at the moment when Khodorkovsky was coming close to parole. The European Court of Human Rights will soon rule on the question of whether the Russian state was entitled to grab Yukos&apos;s assets. Asked why the Kremlin had singled out her son for punishment, Filipovna said: &quot;Obviously there was some sort of political motivation behind it, even though my son never harboured any political ambitions. But more importantly, people were trying to get hold of his property and steal his money.&quot; Khodorkovsky was surviving his ordeal surprisingly well, she said. &quot;His spirits are always good. He&apos;s never complained to me.&quot; She conceded he looked &quot;extremely pale&quot;, but added: &quot;This isn&apos;t really surprising, given the fact he&apos;s spent the last six years in jail and never gets any fresh air.&quot; Khodorkovsky recently described how he spends four hours every day travelling to court by truck through Moscow&apos;s notorious traffic, sitting in a cramped &quot;metal booth&quot;. Once the world&apos;s 16th richest man, the tycoon has porridge and coffee for breakfast. He gets a shower once a week. When not attending court he spends 23 hours a day locked up in his cell. He is allowed just one hour&apos;s recreation in an &quot;outdoor&quot; cell covered with metal netting. Russia&apos;s president Dmitry Medvedev has repeatedly called for an end to his country&apos;s &quot;legal nihilism&quot;. Some optimists believe he is sincere in his stated desire to reform the country. Khodorkovsky&apos;s second trial is widely seen as emblematic: observers ask if Russia wants to re-engage with other countries or continue its Putin-era slide towards autocracy and contempt for the rule of law. Last week Khodorkovsky responded to a much-discussed blog by Medvedev, entitled &quot;Go Russia!&quot;, which called for the country&apos;s modernisation. Writing in the Russian daily Vedomosti, Khodorkovsky dismissed Medvedev&apos;s article as &quot;dispiriting&quot; and said it was impossible to modernise Russia without first dismantling its authoritarian system. &quot;The issue here isn&apos;t just that Russia doesn&apos;t meet many of the customary humanitarian requirements for any country that wishes to consider itself modern and European\u2026 but rather that the infamous &apos;vertical of power&apos; is spectacularly inefficient,&quot; he wrote. Robert Amsterdam, Khodorkovsky&apos;s international lawyer, said: &quot;For Russia this second trial is a grotesque embarrassment.&quot; Asked if \u2013 as seems likely \u2013 his client would be jailed again at the end of the trial, he said: &quot;I see beyond the verdict. The trial isn&apos;t real any more. It&apos;s a political case. Ultimately there will be a political solution.&quot; Striking a positive note, Amsterdam said: &quot;Medvedev is reading what Khodorkovsky is writing. This is a sea change. Rather than receding into the fog of history, Khodorkovsky is continuing to be part of the daily fabric of Moscow.&quot; If convicted on the latest charges of fraud and money laundering, Khodorkovsky faces up to 22 years in jail. Marina, who is 74, said the family was allowed only two visits to see him a month. &quot;The judge is not stupid. He understands what&apos;s going on,&quot; Marina said. &apos;The big question is whether he&apos;s going to be able to decide things for himself.&apos;", "sentences": ["Robert Amsterdam, Khodorkovsky&apos;s international lawyer, said: &quot;For Russia this second trial is a grotesque embarrassment.&quot; Asked if \u2013 as seems likely \u2013 his client would be jailed again at the end of the trial, he said: &quot;I see beyond the verdict.", "Ultimately there will be a political solution.&quot; Striking a positive note, Amsterdam said: &quot;Medvedev is reading what Khodorkovsky is writing."], "title": "Mother of jailed Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky calls for UK help", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/01/mikhail-khodorkovsky-mother-appeal-miliband", "tags": ["Russia", "Vladimir Putin", "David Miliband", "Human rights", "Politics", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Law", "Mikhail Khodorkovsky", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-02T15:17:26Z", "article": "A woman who accidentally dropped a computer memory stick containing &quot;a mini-encyclopaedia of weapons-making&quot; from beneath her burka while she was being interviewed at an airport admitted two terror charges today when she appeared in court.

The memory stick, which had been concealed in her clothing, contained more than 7,000 files including an explosives manual for &quot;The Brothers of the Mujahadeen&quot;. The device had been tied to an inner sleeve of her burka, but fell out as she reached down to scratch her leg, prosecutor Simon Denison told the court. The following day she was arrested at her home in Longsight. A search of the rented property unearthed a handwritten note in which she said she and her children would be &quot;bombs for the sake of this religion&quot;. Another document contained information about the military use of electronics, the court heard. Evidence was also uncovered from internet chatroom sites which indicated her support for those seeking martyrdom. Chentouf, who is a Moroccan national, has previously lived in The Hague, Netherlands, for more than 20 years. She was sentenced to two years in prison but was freed from court having served 382 days on remand since her arrest. Judge Michael Henshell told Chentouf she had &quot;developed an obsessive interest in jihad and the more extreme forms of Islam&quot;. He said: &quot;Offences of this sort must be sentenced to immediate custody to deter others from behaving as you have.&quot; Although a huge amount of material was found on the memory stick the judge told Chentouf there was &quot;no evidence you intended to pass it on to anybody&quot;. He said the crown accepted there was no intention of putting it to practical use. The court heard that Chentouf suffered from a mental illness, triggered by the death of a family member, and had previously self-harmed. Her behaviour may have been affected by this and her culpability was at the lower end of the scale for this offence, the judge added.", "sentences": ["The court heard she accidentally dropped a memory stick containing the documents when she was being questioned at Liverpool John Lennon airport on October 16 last year after arriving on a flight from Amsterdam."], "title": "Woman who dropped memory stick at airport admits terror charges", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/02/woman-admits-terror-charges", "tags": ["UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Liverpool"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-03T22:38:48Z", "article": "The Czech Republic&apos;s decision to ratify the Lisbon treaty yesterday presented an immediate challenge to David Cameron and the Conservatives, who have long pledged to hold a referendum on the measure as long as it remained unratified by all member states. Within hours of the Czech ratification, William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, announced that the Tories would abandon their campaign to hold a referendum, triggering claims on the Eurosceptic right of a U-turn after Cameron offered a &quot;cast-iron guarantee&quot; to the Sun in September 2007 that he would hold a referendum. Tory sources said Cameron had not performed a U-turn because he has always made clear that he would only hold a referendum if the treaty remained unratified by all EU member states. This qualification did not appear in the Sun article, which was designed to set out Tory thinking before an expected general election in the autumn of 2007. Cameron will attempt to reach out to the Eurosceptics today when he makes clear it would be pointless and legally impossible to hold a referendum on the treaty now that it has entered EU law. &quot;You can&apos;t separate orange concentrate from the rest of a glass of orange juice,&quot; a shadow cabinet minister said. Cameron will make clear that he is prepared for a bruising battle with the EU when he says that European integration has gone too far. The Tory leader will pledge to repatriate social and employment powers and he may demand greater powers over justice and home affairs. Under the Lisbon treaty no member state has a veto in this area, though Britain has a right to &quot;opt-in&quot; in this area. Shadow cabinet ministers say Cameron will be careful not to allow his tough stance with the EU to distract him from the most important business facing his government if he wins the election \u2013 taking Britain out of the recession. There was also some comfort that only diehard Eurosceptics accused Cameron of performing a U-turn last night, though they are expected to be disappointed if the Tory leader fails to indicate that he is prepared to have a referendum on Britain&apos;s future relations with the EU. Labour says Cameron is bound to trigger a major battle with the EU because all his demands will require treaty change. Chris Bryant, the Europe minister, said: &quot;The Foreign Office has given me official legal advice that it will be impossible to repatriate powers without changing the treaty. Cameron&apos;s difficulty about treaty negotiations is that it will first require the unanimous agreement of the council of ministers, then there has to be an inter-governmental agreement that also has to come to an unanimous view, and then under a new provision of the Lisbon treaty the European parliament can summon a convention that can take years. &quot;Cameron has not got many friends in the European parliament because he has walked away from them, and signed up with a bunch of rightwing extremists.&quot; Ratification of the treaty by the Czech Republic, after months of stalling by President V\u00e1clav Klaus, also threw open the race to secure the plum posts of European president and foreign minister. Klaus&apos;s signature on the treaty, which will reform how the EU is run, meant that the 27\u00a0countries of the union have ratified it, ending an eight-year quest to put the governance of Europe on a new footing. The treaty is likely to come into force at the end of the month and EU leaders are expected to summon an emergency summit in Brussels next week to grapple over the two big jobs for which Tony Blair and David Miliband, the foreign secretary have been named as leading contenders. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, said: &quot;The road is now open for the consultations on the appointment of the president of the European council and high representative [foreign minister] to begin.&quot; The president of the European council, appointed for up to five years, will be the first such post, chairing European summits and travelling the world as Europe&apos;s president. Blair&apos;s chances of securing the job suffered a severe setback last week when he failed to generate support at an EU summit. The sense of political stitch-up that emerged suggested the job would go to someone on the centre-right from a small EU country. Under the apparent deal, Europe&apos;s social democrats are to get the foreign minister post, raising speculation that Miliband was the frontrunner. However, sources in Brussels said Miliband was either out of the running or slipping from favourite and that Massimo D&apos;Alema, the Italian former prime minister and foreign minister, had emerged as frontrunner. Senior British government officials, from Gordon Brown down, have been campaigning assertively for Blair. They maintain the Blair campaign may have lost last week&apos;s battle, but not yet the war. Arguments over the new rule book have consumed the EU elites for so long that the Lisbon treaty is certain to be the last such big reform of the way the union works for a long time. It is aimed at streamlining EU decision-taking, through a new system of voting that enhances Germany&apos;s muscle as the EU&apos;s biggest country and the abolition of national vetoes in many policy areas. The treaty: Shaping the new rulebook What is the Lisbon treaty? An unreadable, indigestible potpourri of amendments to previous EU treaties which amounts to a rewrite of the EU rulebook. Any good career prospects? A couple of nice jobs. It creates the union&apos;s first sitting council president, where 27 EU heads of government appoint one of their peers to chair their summits and globetrot on their behalf for a maximum of two 30-month terms. They also appoint, for five years, a high representative for common foreign and security policy, otherwise known as European foreign minister. He or she gets to run an external action service, the EU&apos;s first global diplomatic service, chair monthly meetings of EU foreign ministers, and try to forge single European foreign policies. How did we get here? Very slowly and grumpily. The idea kicked off in 2001 with plans for a European constitution. The French and Dutch killed that idea in 2005. In 2007 Angela Merkel led the campaign to revive the constitution. The Irish finally said yes to that last month. At which point the Czech president, V\u00e1clav Klaus, dug in his heels until he signed yesterday. What does it change? It abolishes the &quot;pillar&quot; system under which large areas of European policy, such as justice, immigration, home affairs, were decided between governments rather than by Brussels legislation. The system of qualified majority voting is also changed, for the first time giving Germany, the biggest country, more votes than anyone else. So have we heard the last of this infernal treaty? Soonish, yes. A couple of big jobs to sort out first. And then it will be consigned to the files reserved for the Nice, Amsterdam, Maastricht and Rome treaties. The effort entailed in getting to Klaus&apos;s signature has been chastening and exhausting. No one wants another European treaty for a very, very long time.

Lord Mandelson likely reckons that part-selling this state-owned public service will not only help plug the giant hole that has appeared in the state&apos;s finances, but will also improve postal workers&apos; productivity and efficiency by imposing a new private-sector managerial and work ethos on the service. Mandy&apos;s suitor of choice is TNT NV, the Dutch former state-owned postal service. The company was created in 1998, when the then PTT Post was spun off from Koninklijke PTT Nederland. It subsequently bought the Australian firm Thomas Nationwide Transport, an international package delivery service from which it gets its current name. Today, TNT is active in over 200 countries, is listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange and is the biggest private-sector employer in the Netherlands. Funny name changes aside, Britain&apos;s Royal Mail remains a wholly state-owned behemoth. It has lost market share since the government permitted other firms to deliver packages in 2006. But although Royal Mail has suffered, evidence suggests that customers have benefited from the UK&apos;s new postal regime; Postcomm, the independent postal service regulator, believes that there has been some improvement for customers in terms of choice and price. TNT is one of the new entrants that have brought about the improvements described by Postcomm. It has made significant inroads into Royal Mail&apos;s formerly exclusive market for packages and business post. It is now a poster child for New Labour&apos;s ongoing plans to marketise anything and everything formerly understood as a public provision. And the new Conservative administration that is likely to take over from Gordon and Co in May are likely set to continue Mandelson&apos;s good work. While selling off Royal Mail will no doubt help the Baron of Foy and Hartlepool and/or Kenneth Clarke reduce some of our public debt, they are mistaken to think that TNT will solve Royal Mail&apos;s efficiency and productivity problems. I am not being nostalgic for days of old Labour big government; my reasons for arguing this are based solely on economic logic and evidence from numerous previously attempted public-private partnerships (PPPs). TNT has been a success on our side of the North Sea only because it is a niche player with low overheads. Crucially, and unlike Royal Mail, it does not have a universal service obligation in the UK. Good private-sector management may help improve Royal Mail in certain ways, but short of charging people to send post by the mile, or charging people in remote areas to receive theirs, the lion&apos;s share of Royal Mail&apos;s business \u2013 its universal service part \u2013 cannot be improved much by part-privatisation. Indeed, the addition of dividend-demanding private shareholders will probably make things worse. Proof of the limits of privatisation comes from TNT&apos;s home market. The firm is currently suffering very similar problems with competition from new entrants there as Royal Mail is over here. And trade unions in the Low Lands are not best pleased with the mass job cuts announced by TNT in July. Dutch unions have not yet come to industrial action and past success of the Dutch collective bargaining model means they are probably less likely to. But things are tense and anything could still happen. Royal Mail and TNT&apos;s problem is that voters like the fact that it costs the same to send a letter from Bristol to Bath as from Bristol to Belfast. Urban dwellers don&apos;t appear to mind cross-subsidising those living in more remote ones. To change the charging regime would be political suicide, even for a party that is highly unlikely to be in power in seven months&apos; time. Imposing a PPP on the service (in all but name) is Mandy&apos;s apparent expedient solution, to take any politically difficult decisions on staffing costs and levels out of the hands of elected politicians. PPPs, however, have time and again proven not to work. The past record of London&apos;s tubes, the Channel tunnel, city academies and other schemes has conclusively demonstrated that the private partner is never willing to bear any downside risk. The reason is simple: a government would never let a public service fail, and so all PPPs suffer from severe cases of moral hazard. Good management is obviously a good idea. But as long as we value Royal Mail&apos;s universal delivery obligation, getting such management through part-privitisation is not the answer. If the government decides to sell only Royal Mail&apos;s profitable Parcelforce international package delivery arm to the Dutch, then this will leave the taxpayer with just the unwanted scraps. The alternative solution is for the government to employ private sector managers in parts of the business that would benefit from them, to impose on them a good incentive-related pay structure and to show postal workers that the British people value their public service by caving into their pay demands before TNT and others compete away the entirety of Royal Mail&apos;s Christmas market share.", "sentences": ["Today, TNT is active in over 200 countries, is listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange and is the biggest private-sector employer in the Netherlands."], "title": "Don't send Royal Mail to highest bidder | Chris Colvin", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/04/royal-mail-tnt", "tags": ["Royal Mail", "Postal service", "Trade unions", "Peter Mandelson", "Politics", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-08T00:05:43Z", "article": "Nancy Kienholz&apos;s house is in an obscure neck of the woods, to say the least. After a long drive to her hometown, Hope, Idaho, the man at the Ellisport Bay marina directs us to &quot;follow the signs to Beyond Hope and then take a left&quot;. A postwoman escorts us the last few hundred metres, through a nature reservation where beagles chase after young deer and wild turkeys wander through the trees and points us to the sculpture of a fighter jet bearing a toothy grin which is parked in the front garden of her log-cabin home on the shores of Lake Pend Oreille. Nancy Reddin Kienholz, the fifth (and final) wife of the Californian sculptor Ed Kienholz who died of a heart attack 14 years ago, emerges from behind the screen door of her home and studio. In 1979, Ed Kienholz, always something of a loner, declared that everything he had made from 1972 onwards was a collaboration with Nancy, a photojournalist whom he had met that year at a party in LA.     Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz    &quot;I knew who he was \u2013 you could not not have known who Ed Kienholz was,&quot; she says, referring to the controversy that had followed the premiere at the LA County Museum of Art in 1964 of his Back Seat Dodge &apos;38, which showed an impassioned couple in the back seat of an old Dodge. The Kienholzes established studios in Berlin and Houston as well as the one in Idaho which heaves with the energy and profusion of their brash and bold works. Ed Kienholz was a pioneer of assemblage, or &quot;funk&quot; art, in the 1950s and 60s, a movement dedicated to collecting society&apos;s debris from flea markets and junk shops to make artworks that provoked our social conscience. He expanded the form to installation scale and many works \u2013 State Hospital, for example, which showed two abandoned inmates on a bed in a psychiatric unit and was inspired by his time as a hospital attendant \u2013 were based on his own experiences. His contemporaries were Claes Oldenburg, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and Robert Irwin. Although not perhaps widely acknowledged as such, Kienholz&apos;s work is a major reference point for contemporary British artists such as Damien Hirst, Mike Nelson and Paul McCarthy. &quot;Ed taught me everything I know about art and we worked together for 24 hours a day,&quot; says Nancy. It was an intense collaboration, friendship and marriage which worked, she said, because she quickly recognised, &quot;that art was more important for him than he or I or our children, and once that was clear, it became our focus and it was fun&quot;. Right now, she is quietly seething because the builders who were constructing a new gallery for their artworks have disappeared. &quot;They&apos;ve gone off to hunt elk for two weeks, leaving me with a building site,&quot; she says, rolling her deep green eyes. These are busy days for Nancy Kienholz, 66, who is preparing for one of the most important moments in her life as an artist, a date at the National Gallery in London, with an exhibition that curators hope will introduce a new generation to the couple. Their last London show was at the ICA in 1971, their last UK show at the Baltic in Gateshead in 2005. Nancy and Ed&apos;s biggest environmental sculpture, The Hoerengracht (Whores&apos; Canal) \u2013 a garish, life-size depiction made over five years in their Berlin studio of a 1980s Amsterdam brothel district \u2013 will stand alongside paintings from the gallery&apos;s permanent collection of Dutch masters depicting prostitution scenes from the 17th century. It will be the first time that the gallery has exhibited a modern installation. &quot;It&apos;s as good as it gets,&quot; says Nancy. When the letter from Nicholas Penny, the director of the National Gallery, arrived earlier this year inviting her to exhibit The Hoerengracht \u2013 whose name is a pun on the elegant street Herengracht or &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Canal&quot; \u2013 because he wanted to compare it to the Dutch old masters such as Vermeer and De Hooch, Nancy thought it must be a joke. &quot;I was incredulous,&quot; she says. &quot;Such a thing was beyond my imagination and then I had to laugh when they said they were interested in drawing this comparison. I thought it must be Ed up where he is, thinking, &apos;Nancy&apos;s getting complacent, she needs something else to do.&apos;&quot; Simultaneously, a work she calls the &quot;precursor&quot; to The Hoerengracht, Roxy&apos;s, based on a whorehouse in Nevada Ed visited in the 1940s and which had shocked him to the core, is going on show in a Berlin gallery. Another piece, The Beanery \u2013 a reconstruction of a seedy and famous LA bar where Ed used to hang out with the likes of David Hockney and Dennis Hopper in the 60s, to the extent that it became known as &quot;Ed&apos;s living room&quot; \u2013 is also expected to be shown again in 2010. There are also moves afoot to exhibit Kienholz&apos;s newly restored 1972 installation Five Car Stud \u2013 a tableau of a black man being castrated by white racists \u2013 in the United States where it has always been considered too controversial to be shown. &quot;Something of a Kienholz revival is going on and it&apos;s about time too,&quot; says Colin Wiggins, who is curating the Hoerengracht exhibition at the National Gallery. Back in Hope, in the gymnasium of the bat-infested former schoolhouse, a team of workers is making the final preparations before packing the huge Hoerengracht. The work is to be put into 40 wooden crates and loaded on to flatbed, air-ride trucks, taken to New Jersey, transported across the Atlantic, then driven to the National Gallery where it will be reassembled. Some of the mannequins in the tableau, which were cast from the bodies of friends in Berlin, have been freed from their cell-like rooms as they wait to be packed. They stand in the corridor of the school, drawing on cigarettes and looking bored or wasted. Others are still encased behind glowing doors and windows in this chunk of a neighbourhood which is reproduced in detail from the brick walls to the bike stands, the street signs, the leaves and detritus of city life, and in the interiors of the women&apos;s working spaces, complete with their knick-knacks, alarm clocks, snow-shakers, mascaras and lipsticks, exposed plumbing and dirty radiators. Radio music blares from their rooms as bulbs of different hues flash. The viewer walks down the boldly lit street and gazes into the rooms. Translucent resin covers every surface: it runs down the window panes and the women&apos;s faces, suggesting a plastic and artificial atmosphere, not to mention unpleasant, oozing substances that cannot be controlled or cleaned up. The women wear &quot;cookie boxes&quot; (glass cases) around their heads to convey the message that although their bodies are for sale, they remain the mistresses of their emotions and kisses. Daryl Witcraft, a fibreglass expert, handyman and old friend of the Kienholzes, leads a repair team that includes his wife, Sherry. The crew is busy fitting new light bulbs, touching up the resin on the prostitutes, trying to fix the moth-eaten lapdog and repainting the bricks of the houses. &quot;We&apos;ve put this up and taken it down dozens of times over the years, most recently in Sydney in 2006,&quot; says Daryl, as he crawls through a small door at pavement level from the control centre of The Hoerengracht. This is where all the light switches, sound effects, window and door hatches, as well as copious supplies of Dr Pepper, steel wool and replacement light bulbs, are concealed. &quot;Let&apos;s make more of the dog,&quot; suggests Nancy, pointing to the lapdog that sits at the feet of prostitute Maryann and, like much of the tableau, is now reminiscent of times past. Nancy and Ed started making the installation in 1983. They paid the sex workers 50 guilders a head to be allowed to enter and photograph their rooms to gather information. She is tickled that their work is now being seen as a historical document of the red light district of the 1970s and 80s. The Amsterdam city authorities have been trying, and succeeding, for several years to reduce the number of window prostitutes, replacing them in many cases with jewellery and fashion designers as they struggle to find a balance between sex tourism and gentrification. New laws mean brothels have had to change beyond recognition \u2013 the wallpaper and carpets seen in The Hoerengracht have been replaced by white tiles which can be hosed down after each session. &quot;As a result,&quot; says Annemarie de Wildt, curator at Amsterdam&apos;s Historical Museum, to which the artwork will transfer after London, &quot;The Hoerengracht captures the spirit of a particular moment in time which has all but disappeared.&quot; Pets are certainly out. So, too, are the &quot;puff hunds&quot; (literally &quot;brothel dogs&quot;), the kitsch porcelain lapdogs that used to sit in the windows and, if their backs faced the street, indicated that the prostitute was unavailable. &quot;In the Second World War, soldiers were not allowed to visit the brothels, so they&apos;d buy the dogs, saying they&apos;d gone in to buy a present for their mothers,&quot; says Nancy. &quot;Ed reckoned that&apos;s where the song &apos;How Much Is That Doggy in the Window?&apos; came from.&quot; Bald-headed eagles and turkey vultures soar above us as we take a trip in Nancy&apos;s motorboat around the majestic Lake Pend Oreille. Nancy points out Ed&apos;s burial spot in the mountains she part-owns. Ed died of a heart attack one morning following an evening of revelry in the Billy Bar above their studio. Daryl and friends dug a big hole in the mountainside. Ed&apos;s rotund, embalmed body was placed in the passenger seat of his brown 1940 Packard coupe \u2013 in his pocket a deck of cards and a dollar, on the seat beside him a bottle of 1931 Chianti, on the back seat the cremated remains of his dog, Smash, who had died days earlier \u2013 and the car was pushed into the hole to the strains of Glenn Miller. Nancy&apos;s place is like visiting planet Kienholz. The man&apos;s spirit infuses everything, starting with the huge, life-size fibreglass cast of him, with a lacquered, flat, sepia-coloured head and eyes that follow you everywhere. It&apos;s in the colourful Billy Bar above the studio, which they decided to build, says Nancy, mixing me one of her specialities, a Dirty Vodka Martini, because &quot;going to bars in Idaho can be complicated and confrontational&quot;. It is also where Ed spent the evening before he died, playing pool with friends and listening to Al Jolson on the tape deck. Look into a mirror, open a door or turn a corner and the artworks or parts of them \u2013 loose limbs, dolls&apos; legs, boars&apos; heads, crucifixes, resuscitation dolls \u2013 are there, all around you. Countless drawers and cupboards are full of Kienholz finds from flea markets across the world. Rubber knees, whetstones, strips of fur, screw eye-hooks, doilies, Nancy&apos;s Brushes (Keep Out!) \u2013 it&apos;s all here and all neatly labelled. Colin Wiggins, the National Gallery curator who fell in love with Ed Kienholz&apos;s work after seeing what he describes as his &quot;totemic&quot; 1971 ICA show, sees the exhibition as a chance to put Kienholz back on the map. &quot;I believe it&apos;s the piece with which I can subvert the whole National Gallery collection,&quot; he admits, hinting that it was not an uncontroversial decision. &quot;It took a while to crank through the National Gallery system when I first proposed it.&quot; When he saw The Hoerengracht at the Baltic in 2005, Wiggins was &quot;struck by the similarities with Vermeer&quot;, particularly by the &quot;same fascination of looking into spaces and doorways into spaces beyond. It connects so magically and powerfully with the form and light and voyeurism of Dutch paintings of the 17th century&quot;. The Hoerengracht is going to be shown alongside paintings by Steen, Van Hoogstraten, De Hooch and Vermeer, pictures which at first glance appear to show gentle Dutch townscapes or serene Delft interiors, but on closer inspection depict tableaux of prostitution and sensual pleasure. &quot;It does not take much to interpret the message behind the man who offers an oyster shell as a come-on to a woman who feigns shock at the same time as she makes a gesture by putting a knife into a glass,&quot; says Wiggins, referring to De Hooch&apos;s 1677 painting Musical Party in a Courtyard which will appear in the exhibition. While the Kienholzes made no conscious effort to refer to the Dutch masters there are some striking similarities. In The Hoerengracht, a furtive-looking man in a raincoat wandering the street looking for sex mirrors the young boy standing in a shadowy archway in De Hooch&apos;s Musical Party, for example; and there is a striking compositional similarity between the woman at her keyboard in Vermeer&apos;s Young Woman Seated at a Virginal, who is turned towards the viewer, and Jutta in Hoerengracht, who stands next to her telephone, looking at us in a confrontational pose as she waits for the next customer to call. &quot;I love the contrast,&quot; says Nancy, seated on a stool in the Billy Bar. &quot;Unlike the old masters, The Hoerengracht has nothing to do with good taste. It&apos;s a sleazy piece of art with dirty surfaces and tacky artefacts.&quot; After some heated discussion, the word &quot;blow job&quot; was removed from the draft of the exhibition catalogue, but still Nancy says: &quot;I think there will be some complaints.&quot; She pauses to add with a mischievous smile: &quot;But as Ed would have said, it&apos;s always so much more fun when there are scandalised patrons.&quot; Kienholz: The Hoerengracht opens at the National Gallery, London WC1 on 18 November", "sentences": ["Nancy and Ed&apos;s biggest environmental sculpture, The Hoerengracht (Whores&apos; Canal) \u2013 a garish, life-size depiction made over five years in their Berlin studio of a 1980s Amsterdam brothel district \u2013 will stand alongside paintings from the gallery&apos;s permanent collection of Dutch masters depicting prostitution scenes from the 17th century.", "The Amsterdam city authorities have been trying, and succeeding, for several years to reduce the number of window prostitutes, replacing them in many cases with jewellery and fashion designers as they struggle to find a balance between sex tourism and gentrification.", "&quot;As a result,&quot; says Annemarie de Wildt, curator at Amsterdam&apos;s Historical Museum, to which the artwork will transfer after London, &quot;The Hoerengracht captures the spirit of a particular moment in time which has all but disappeared.&quot; Pets are certainly out."], "title": "Ed and Nancy Kienholz, The Hoerengracht, the National Gallery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/08/kienholz-hoerengracht-national-gallery-interview", "tags": ["National Gallery", "Art and design", "Art", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-09T11:51:47Z", "article": "A recent survey of property experts has confirmed that the days are gone \u2013 well more or less \u2013 when the redevelopment of city centres was an adversarial soap opera with the hard-pressed local authority defending the beloved but fleabitten fabric of the city from the clutches of the wicked property developer, hell-bent on flinging up concrete to make a quick buck. Nowadays there is much greater acknowledgement that collaboration has far more to offer than confrontation. For one thing, the &quot;wicked&quot; property developer is quite likely to be the development arm of a pension fund manager or a substantial listed property company keen to create an investment in which it will have a long-term interest. Also, in a political context, there is a much greater recognition among those who run today&apos;s towns and cities that the places in their care are competing for investment, shoppers and residents. In these times of recession the need for cities to be competitive is in an imperative one. But of course, each has something the other wants. While the developer \u2013 in normal circumstances at least \u2013 has access to funds as well as expertise, the local authority probably has control over the land or at least what can be built on it. According to a survey of the 2,300 European members of the Urban Land Institute (ULI) - which describes itself as &quot;a global research and education institute dedicated to responsible land use&quot; and whose members fall on both sides of the public-private divide - joint ventures between the public and private sectors will be the way forward for the next 10 to 20 years. Naturally, most of the survey respondents thought that Europe&apos;s cities will be &quot;very important&quot; for the future of the European economy as a whole over the next decade or two.  In particular, ULI members believe that investment in infrastructure and public facilities will be the fastest growing areas of investment over the next three years with investment in housing, offices, shops and leisure facilities trailing in their wake. However, apart from lack of capital and lack of confidence, the main obstacles to investment will be &quot;lack of good partnership between city governments and investors&quot; rather than a lack of good projects to invest in or lack of demand for facilities. It comes as no surprise then that co-investment with investors and developers, and more flexible planning are felt to be the chief instruments that will enable &quot;good city government&quot; to encourage investment. More than 60% of respondents said that investors and developers will need to forge joint ventures with the public sector in order to make urban investment work in the next 10 to 20 years. The ULI announced the results of the survey in Barcelona at the first summit of its urban investment network. The network was founded a year ago to promote investment in urban development and brings together a mix of cities, European institutions and private sector organisations. By the end of 2011 the ULI hopes to have 100 cities and metropolitan areas and 100 investors and developers in the network. The network already includes Amsterdam, Barcelona, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Istanbul along with Germany-based Allianz Real Estate, Deutsche Bank, ECE Projektmanagement and Eurohypo AG, and Netherlands-headquartered ING Real Estate Development as well as the OECD.  Menno Maas, chief executive of ING Real Estate Development, says that the network brings together key decision makers to share their experiences of collaboration and examine how well it works in each case.

Black to move. Books from Botvinnik, Bronstein and Lipnitsky, along with Kasparov&apos;s latest addition to his series on world championship chess, gave our shortlist for the fourth Guardian chess book of the year award a distinct Soviet-era flavour. (By the way, an apology here to publishers Quality Chess for the mistaken suggestion that there had been an earlier English language edition of Lipnitsky&apos;s 1956 Ukrainian classic Questions of Modern Chess Theory.) There were also, of course, contemporary works in contention, from John Nunn, Ivan Sokolov, and Herman Grooten. Each of the shortlisted titles deserves a place in any chess player&apos;s library: they are well produced, clearly presented, and the quality of instruction and analysis is extremely high. Our winner is the revised and expanded version of The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice by David Bronstein and Tom F\u00fcrstenberg (New in Chess, \u00a329.95). This is an unusual, personal, inspirational and endearing book, a mix of anecdote, musing and insight. Bronstein, who drew his 1951 world championship match with Botvinnik 12-12 (Botvinnik, as holder, retained the title), was one of the most original players of all time. The position in the diagram is characteristic of his highly individual approach to chess. In his notes to the game he explains that he had played two five-minute games against Spassky during a visit to a junior chess club some years before. Although Spassky lost both games, Bronstein was impressed by the youngster&apos;s concentration and logic. Reflecting on his overall record against the future world champion, he said: &quot;We have played many fine games but I never managed to win and I know why. I always tried to disrupt his logical play right from the opening. This worked against others such as Botvinnik but it failed against Spassky!&quot; The opening of this game certainly has the &quot;disruptive&quot; quality Bronstein speaks of \u2013 it could also be fairly described as unorthodox. The retreat 1...Qe7 looks sensible, but Bronstein, true to his exhortation to play with fantasy and energy, opted for 1...Nxg3. After 2 Qf2 Nxf1 3 Qxh4 Nxe3 4 Kf2 Nxc4, Black has two bishops and a couple of pawns for the queen. The idea is bold and original, and you will find many more in this wonderful book. chess@guardian.co.uk", "sentences": ["Spassky-Bronstein, Amsterdam 1956."], "title": "Chess book of the year: the winner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/10/ronan-bennett-daniel-king", "tags": ["Chess", "Sport", "Books", "Sport and leisure"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-10T13:34:24Z", "article": "The cast is made up of 25 women. They dance and sing in styles that blend African tribal and American gospel. They perform monologues about their lives. The audience, including 200 schoolchildren, goes wild with cheers and applause. This is no ordinary piece of theatre. It&apos;s Saturday morning at Johannesburg&apos;s Sun City prison. I&apos;m here to watch a performance by convicted murderers, armed robbers, drug smugglers and fraudsters. Kgomotso Maine stands up and says: &quot;I&apos;m serving 15 years for murder.&quot; There is an audible gasp in the recreation hall. Maine stabbed her boyfriend to death in a fit of rage after finding him with another woman. She goes on: &quot;I didn&apos;t mean to hurt anyone. But I regret what I&apos;ve done in the past. Now I&apos;m focusing on the future. I want to turn that old scar to shining stars.&quot; This is the second year that the Medea project: Theatre for Incarcerated Women has come to South Africa. It&apos;s the brainchild of Rhodessa Jones, a US actor, singer, teacher and writer who runs a theatre company in San Francisco. She and her co-director, Idris Ackamoor, work with female prisoners around the world. Jones, 60, said: &quot;Theatre saved my life. I was a 16-year-old girl with a baby. As a black girl in America, I could have gone either way. It was my brother who said I want you to meet these people, and they were theatre people, and I could bring my baby. &quot;All of a sudden I was making theatre and I felt needed. I understood something about what else could be possible in the world. I didn&apos;t have to end up a junkie, I didn&apos;t have to end up an alcoholic, I didn&apos;t even have to end up in an abusive relationship. I could find my voice in the spaces of theatre.&quot; She and Ackamoor had to work hard at first to bring the women here out of their shells, but their outgoing, can-do spirit evidently rubbed off. The medium-security inmates performing Serious Fun II at Sun City are self-confident, poised and keen to be taken seriously. They wear white face paint, white T-shirts and \u2011 a reminder of where we are \u2011 regulation orange trousers that have the word &quot;Corrections&quot; printed in circles. Tandeka Mkwanazi, 34, is draped in a blue flag of Swaziland and has a feather in her hair. She says she used to travel the world in her job in group sales and marketing for SABC, the public broadcaster. She blames a Nigerian boyfriend for the discovery of 10kg of ecstasy in a bag she brought from Amsterdam. She was jailed in 2005 and hopes to be out in 2011. The mother of two sons takes centre stage while the rest of the cast sing a lullaby and mime the cradling of children in their arms. &quot;Mummy is here,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m dedicating this lullaby song to you boys. I remember the days when you were still babies. &quot;When I look at this front row here, I just see my boys. Let me tell you something. Life is about choices. The choices that you make today are the choices that are going to tell you exactly where you will be in five years&apos; time. Ask yourself, where will you be in five years from now?&quot; Ellen Dingaan, 34, is a beautician and hairdresser, which makes her popular with the prison wardens. The 1.5kg of cocaine she swallowed before flying from Sao Paolo showed up in an X-ray. She finds it suspicious that her contact was a friend of the policewoman who stopped her at customs. She says she was charged with possession of 80g of cocaine and doesn&apos;t know what happened to the rest. &quot;I took the risk because at the time I had a serious problem,&quot; she said. &quot;I was living with somebody and he just dumped me and left me my three kids and all the responsibilities of rent, school fees, everything, and I couldn&apos;t keep up with it. I was promised R50,000 (\u00a34,000) and got R20,000 to pay off some of my bills and buy some Christmas presents for my kids.&quot; Dingaan has been in jail for nearly five years and is due for parole in 2011. She misses her children most of all. &quot;It&apos;s very painful for me to know I haven&apos;t been there for my kids. I haven&apos;t even seen them wearing their uniforms on the first day of school. That really kills me, because I always promised myself I&apos;d be a better mother to my children.&quot; There are songs of repentance and remorse. Joyce Chauke, 34, serving seven and a half years for armed robbery, says: &quot;Some people are scared of us. What I ask from the community is to accept us and give us a second chance to show them we have learned from our mistakes. We are ready to face the community. Please accept us.&quot; Another woman says: &quot;I am here to apologise for what I did to the community. When I was dealing drugs, I was thinking of only myself, I was self-centred and I&apos;ve learned. I think justice was done to save me before I jeopardised more people. I pray to God that you will find it your heart to forgive me and accept me as one of your own.&quot; The show finishes, the audience rises and there is a cascade of applause. Then the inmates answer questions and urge the children not to follow the same path. A woman from the Market Theatre Laboratory says: &quot;I came here today expecting hardcore criminals and I found women, beautiful women, and that made me cry. It makes me so happy. Thank you.&quot; A lunch is served, but prison guards gather around the stage to ensure the performers stay where they are. I say goodbye to Rhodessa Jones and drive through the prison grounds, passing a sign that says &quot;Place of new beginnings&quot;. At the exit gate my car boot is opened and checked, and then I head back to the city.

It&apos;s a nightmarish place and yet utterly compelling; a seductive hell, a vision of the grotesque that is somehow more fascinating than beauty.  The second time, you can&apos;t wait. It is the highlight of a holiday in Amsterdam. I&apos;m talking about The Beanery by Ed Kienholz, one of the most compelling installations ever made, and one of the most memorable works of late 20th-century art. It belongs to the Stedelijk Museum, which is due to reopen after an architectural overhaul. I hope it will now be kept on permanent display there \u2013 it drove me nuts to visit Amsterdam a few years ago and find The Beanery had been taken off view in some kind of half-baked sub-Tate rehang. This is one of the masterpieces of modern times and it needs to be on permanent view in the same way the Rothko paintings at Tate Modern do, or the Richard Serra installation at the Guggenheim Bilbao. The Beanery is a recreation of a horrible, yet stickily unforgettable American diner. It creates a world of stinking, clinging horror that you can&apos;t get out of your mind. There&apos;s an anger, satire and pungency to this tableau that really leaves most art behind. Kienholz was a cross between Claes Oldenburg, Robert Crumb and the Coen brothers. His art is theatrical in the best way imaginable. It is also deeply, obviously humane and honest. Now it is coming to London. It&apos;s a coincidence that, while the greatest work by Kienholz is in a museum in Amsterdam, the National Gallery here is shortly to open his recreation of Amsterdam&apos;s most insalubrious social space \u2013 its red light district, called The Hoerengracht.  The National Gallery has a poor history of exhibiting contemporary art. Its understandable desire to link living artists with its collection has often led to some clunking exhibits by artists whose comments on historical art are obvious enough \u2013 Tom Hunter anyone? \u2013 but whose work doesn&apos;t really add anything, and certainly hasn&apos;t enabled the NG to look especially cool compared with the opposition. This show is different. Kienholz is a great artist, but also one who hasn&apos;t been shown that much in London, so the National Gallery is doing something different, and rivalling Tate Modern on its own turf. Great. It will definitely bring in a new crowd. It will make a change from the lamentable advertising for a Renoir show a couple of years ago that consciously seemed to appeal to the old with its images of gardening.  But what matters is quallity. Kienholz had that.

Fevered Sleep&apos;s new show for children, The Forest, is at Lincoln Performing Arts Centre before heading for Brighton and the Young Vic over Christmas. If it&apos;s half as good as Brilliant, it will be terrific.  After the Accident, at the Alma Tavern in Bristol, is Julian Armistead Amnesty prize-winning play about restorative justice. Joel Horwood&apos;s Is Everybody OK? goes to the Drum at Plymouth. The hard-hitting Roy Willams play Days of Significance is at the Sherman in Cardiff. In Scotland, there&apos;s a revival of Philip Ridley&apos;s extraordinary Mercury Fur at the Ramshorn,\u00a0 Paddy Cunneen&apos;s The Waltz of the Cold Wind is at the Tron and the Traverse Autumn festival kicks off with new work from Music Theatre Wales, Nigel Charnock and David Hughes among others.

Pacing its crawlspace in the eaves of New Guardian Towers, trailed by its tattered and greying bridal gown, a raised hand shooing the rats from the remains of its unopened antique Asda value wedding buffet for 46, the Fiver knows what it is to have dreamed of something more, to have dressed up in a wedding gown for no apparent reason, and to have been taunted by youths on BMXs outside Londis. With this in mind, the Fiver could only sympathise with England&apos;s Dependable One-Paced Gareth Barry this morning when, goaded by a stuffy room full of sweating, fag-reeking-safari-suit-clad football hacks he admitted it would be &quot;one of the proudest days of my life&quot; if he was allowed to captain England in tomorrow&apos;s disappointing 2-0 friendly defeat by Brazil (Fabiano 23 (pen), Kaka 62) in Doha. Never mind that England are playing in a city that sounds less like a vibrant hub of the global game and more like the noise Homer Simpson makes while dropping his doughnut only to dramatically retrieve the situation by catching it with his shoe. Never mind that David James, Glen Johnson, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard, Theo Walcott, Aaron Lennon, Emile Heskey and Frank Lampard have all been ruled out with various feelings of physical pain. And never mind that this would also require England&apos;s Brave John Terry to be ruled out with the ankle-knack he picked up &quot;running by himself&quot;. &quot;It is a disappointment the amount of injuries we have had,&quot; England&apos;s Dependable One-Paced Gareth Barry mouthed into his full-length hotel room mirror, black armband stapled to his chest, Terry Butcher mask in place and a glittering paperclip crown balanced on his head. &quot;But at least it will give other people the opportunity to prove what they can do at this level,&quot; he added, doing a hip-thrusting dance and crushing a small tangerine with his fist. But wait. What&apos;s this? Fast forward an hour and according to Fabio Capello England do have a stand-in captain lined up. &quot;If [EBJT] doesn&apos;t play, it will be Wayne Rooney. He is fit and he is ready to be a captain,&quot; Capello said in real actual English that still, with the addition of the indefinite article before &quot;captain&quot;, manages to sound a bit like a line from the Sopranos. Even worse Don Fabio is also &quot;confident [EBJT] will be fit for tomorrow&quot;. And so ends the strange episode of the historically overblown captaincy debate ahead of the ludicrously overblown Doha dollar friendly played out between two under-strength teams, one of them featuring a mildly disappointed Gareth Barry. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;When I am 60 years old, I won&apos;t be going to a disco until six in the morning, but I am now.

We eat and drink a lot, play games and go hunting. I had a fantastic time hunting for rabbits and deer. The guys are amazing, though. They&apos;re like snipers. One of my wife&apos;s cousins took aim from 40m and this bird just dropped out of the sky.&quot; Has it come to this? Is France&apos;s primary tactic to casually mention the fact that they are related to lethal sharp-shooters? Is this not the clearest verbal threat of violence to hit football since Kenny Dalglish heard Vinny Jones offer to &quot;rip your ear off and spit in the hole&quot;? It&apos;s no surprise, then, that Ireland assistant boss Liam Brady says &quot;the focus is on the referees&quot; for the two-legged ding-dong, with the men in the middle tasked with deciding, among other things, when to allow coroners on to the pitch to clear up the scattered remains of Gignac&apos;s cousin-in-law&apos;s latest victim. Tomorrow&apos;s official is Germany&apos;s Felix Brych, while the second leg will be supervised by Sweden&apos;s Martin Hansson, who you may remember for incorrectly ruling out Konstantin Zyryanov&apos;s 19th-minute equaliser for Russia against England in September 2007. &quot;It&apos;s a pity because at that moment they were panicking,&quot; said Guus Hiddink. &quot;It was a key moment.&quot; You may also remember him for the 95th-minute penalty he awarded Liverpool against Atletico Madrid a year ago \u2013 a decision so bad that Steven Gerrard, having performed a ludicrous collapse under almost no provocation, admitted &quot;if it happened at the other end we would be livid&quot;. Hansson said, by way of explanation, that he had found the atmosphere at Anfield &quot;dizzying&quot;, and retreated to Sweden where he received so many death threats he had to change his phone number.

The in-form 26-year-old, who has scored eight goals in his past 11 matches for his club, was substituted after 15 minutes of the bad-tempered 0-0 friendly draw with Italy in Pescara yesterday. He flew back with the Holland squad to Amsterdam, where he remained under the supervision of the Dutch football federation&apos;s medical department, which has liaised closely with its counterparts at Arsenal. &quot;The prognosis is that I will be out for four to six weeks,&quot; Van Persie told Dutch television. It was initially feared that, while there were no fractured bones, the ligament in Van Persie&apos;s right ankle had been severed and he might have faced around three months on the sidelines. But further scans showed only a partial tear, although the news remains a disappointment to him and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, who hopes to lead his team to a first trophy since 2005. Wenger is already without Nicklas Bendtner, who underwent groin surgery and has been ruled out until January, and the loss of Van Persie leaves him with only Eduardo da Silva and Carlos Vela as recognised strikers. Wenger may rue the decision not to secure the signing of Marouane Chamakh from Bordeaux over the summer; he refused to pay over the odds for the striker, who becomes a free agent at the end of this season. Wenger is no friend of the international friendly and his frustration at such fixtures will intensify, particularly as this is not the first time that Van Persie has been injured while playing for Holland. The Frenchman had said, rather ominously, when his players departed for the international break, &quot;let&apos;s see how many come back&quot;. At the start of this month he said: &quot;In England you get the injuries in November every year. You know that in December you can win or lose the championship.&quot; Van Persie was hurt when the Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini challenged him from the side as he shot on goal. Chiellini made a series of robust tackles and, in a stormy encounter which belied the game&apos;s description, some of the Dutch players felt that a red card might have been shown, although not necessarily to Chiellini. Certainly the Dutch were unhappy at Italy&apos;s approach. &quot;It was a rough game with a lot of tackles going in from both sides,&quot; said the Holland midfielder Nigel de Jong. &quot;I am sorry for Robin and the whole team is sorry for Robin because he was doing so well at Arsenal and everybody wanted him to continue in that form.&quot; The Van Persie absolved Chiellini of blame. &quot;There was no intent,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["He flew back with the Holland squad to Amsterdam, where he remained under the supervision of the Dutch football federation&apos;s medical department, which has liaised closely with its counterparts at Arsenal."], "title": "Robin van Persie ruled out for seven weeks with torn ankle ligament", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/15/holland-arsenal", "tags": ["Holland", "Arsenal", "Italy", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-17T20:38:22Z", "article": "The National Gallery&apos;s exhibition of Ed Kienholz and Nancy Reddin Kienholz&apos;s 1983-8 Hoerengracht, or Whore&apos;s Canal, a ramshackle quarter of ill-lit doorways and windows, with the odd lamp-post and bike rack thrown in to give a bit of extra realism, is depressing. The seamy atmosphere of this recreation of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district is made more unpleasant by the sweetly tart smell of fibreglass resin used in much of the installation&apos;s construction. Nor does the Hoerengracht have any of the disturbing strangeness that marked many of Kienholz&apos;s earlier tableaux. It is a late, weak work. The prostitutes who inhabit this seedy street scene are mannequins from central casting. With glass display boxes rammed over their heads, the prostitutes have no more life than rundown automata. They check themselves in mirrors, stand listless on the pavements and in doorways, sit around in bras and panties, but elicit no empathy, desire or compassion. The rooms they inhabit are squalid and depressing, the women themselves drooled over with resinous goo.\u00a0 They&apos;re objects, they&apos;re abused, they&apos;re barely women at all.

AOL sees revenues in local: Its CEO, Tim Armstrong, announced yesterday in New York that it plans to digitize entire towns with the help of Patch, the hyperlocal network it bought last year. Armstrong clearly sees a hole in the market here and plans to cover every aspect of community life from school boards to restaurants and shops. &quot;We&apos;re hiring reporters,&quot; Armstrong said according to the business journal Portfolio.com. &quot;Can you imagine that?&quot; Patch just switched to OpenStreetMap and appears to be busy with building its own map infrastructure, including designing, rendering and hosting its own tiles, according to zdnet. But that is not all. &quot;Patch will go into stores, photograph everything and even tell consumers how many parking spaces there are,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;Even though it will have only 30 local communities outside New York City initially, it will scale substantially.&quot; While AOL invests in local it sheds global, so their new market strategy is to dig deep instead of spreading out wide.

Mine was The Beanery in Amsterdam, a lifesize tableau of three-dimensional figures hunched over their drinks in the yellow fug of an American dive, sweaty, listless, plausibly real right down to the beer gut and drool, except that each face was a stopped clock reading 10 past 10: large as life, but vastly more melodramatic. In the 60s, when the work was made, you could enter the swing doors of this little hell and pass among the lifelike effigies. People say the detail was stupendous. Even when I saw it, decades later with conservators&apos; cordons now in place, a damp warmth exuded from within and the stench of beer was so powerful it felt as if real drink had been spilled. The opaque glint on the fried eggs indicated how long they had been waiting for trade. True to life? Indubitably so, but no matter how realistic The Beanery seemed, you were clearly not to think it was all about ingenious facsimile. Unlike his fellow American Duane Hanson, Kienholz was by no means a hyper-realist sculptor. And unlike Hanson, he did not express complex feelings about the inner lives of his blue-collar figures. Each Beanery face told you time was slipping away by the glass. The whole scene appeared to be oozing sticky fluids, as if the drinkers were pickling themselves. Even if you didn&apos;t notice the horrifying Vietnam headlines on the newspaper hoarding outside, it was obvious that shock, horror, disgust, a sense of urgency \u2013 perhaps even shame \u2013 were the prescribed response. This was the melodrama of a militant moralist. And so it is at the National Gallery, where Kienholz&apos;s immense street scene of 80s Amsterdam by night has been installed among the old master art, a juxtaposition that could hardly be more advantageous to his enterprise. For even those familiar with his work will surely get a jolt passing from the careful conditions of the main galleries, with their still, silent paintings, to the garish, noisy, cruddy, lifesize shocker of a peepshow that is The Hoerengracht. The title is a blunt pun, turning the real Herengracht (gentlemen&apos;s canal) into a whores&apos; canal with the addition of a single letter. But the street conjured here is really an entire district compressed into a couple of corners and some alleys. All is highly realistic to the point of actual reality \u2013 real dead leaves, silted litter, gum stains on the pavements, real china dogs on window sills and bicycles chained to racks. And in the pitch dark, red lights pullulate around doorways and glow inside the prostitutes&apos; windows, enticing you to peer in and see the half-naked women themselves waiting for another client. But here the realism ends, for although the figures looking back at you are cast from the bodies of real women, and clad in actual underwear, they each have a mannequin head. The faces are highly painted, resin streaks the cheeks like still-wet tears, the eyes are wide and imploring. And if that makes you think of the sacred statues in the tremendous show of Spanish art simultaneously running in the Sainsbury Wing, then the artists (Kienholz died in 1994, but his collaborator, Nancy Reddin Kienholz, continues their work) would no doubt be pleased. For whatever else these women may be \u2013 a hybrid of waxwork, statue, dummy and doll \u2013 they are undoubtedly presented as martyrs. The middle-aged prostitute in her ratty coat and headscarf who has to go out into the streets to scratch up some trade; the girl in her tiny cell, back turned but looking anxiously out at the world through a strategically angled mirror; the final face jammed up at the grille of her door as if imprisoned. Each is suffering, abused, entombed, and the wallpaper in one bedsit sings a song of lament to these women. &quot;Darling&quot; runs the refrain, over and again, in snow-white letters on a blood-red ground. In short, The Hoerengracht is a highly sententious work, and not just because it puts you in the position of a client \u2013 an intention, in fact, that is effectively thwarted. Certainly, the tableau presents the women as spectacle and you as the viewer, but only in the sense of a tourist doing the Amsterdam sights. If you could walk in among them, see the world as they see it, then the effect might be different. But as it is, there is no sense of tension and whatever outrage or grief the expressions, poses, props and decor should prompt is stifled by the fairground-cum-Hammer-Horror closed shop. This is a pity because it is so good to see Ed Kienholz in the National Gallery. Not only is he the forefather of an important generation of contemporary artists \u2013 Americans like Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy, Europeans such as Gregor Schneider, Sarah Lucas and Mike Nelson \u2013 he is one of the great political artists of the 20th century, raging against everything from Vietnam to backstreet abortions, state asylums, police brutality, the cant of the art world itself. But even the Dutch paintings displayed alongside The Hoerengracht in this show offer a more complex view of prostitution as a business, with its own degrees of supply and demand, volition, control and necessity. For Kienholz, the women viewed through the Amsterdam windows are no more individual than the dummies he displays: not-quite-living dolls in fragile glass boxes.", "sentences": ["Mine was The Beanery in Amsterdam, a lifesize tableau of three-dimensional figures hunched over their drinks in the yellow fug of an American dive, sweaty, listless, plausibly real right down to the beer gut and drool, except that each face was a stopped clock reading 10 past 10: large as life, but vastly more melodramatic.", "And so it is at the National Gallery, where Kienholz&apos;s immense street scene of 80s Amsterdam by night has been installed among the old master art, a juxtaposition that could hardly be more advantageous to his enterprise.", "Certainly, the tableau presents the women as spectacle and you as the viewer, but only in the sense of a tourist doing the Amsterdam sights.", "For Kienholz, the women viewed through the Amsterdam windows are no more individual than the dummies he displays: not-quite-living dolls in fragile glass boxes."], "title": "The Hoerengracht by Ed and Nancy Kienholz | Art review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/22/hoerengracht-ed-kienholz-review", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "National Gallery", "Culture", "Installation"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-23T16:56:30Z", "article": "What is it with art and sex? Is it like buses, you wait for ages then two shows come along at once? A few weeks ago I complained about Jeff Koons&apos;s gigantic silkscreens and fibreglass sculpture of him having sex with his then wife. Now Ed and Nancy Kienholz&apos;s The Hoerengracht has landed at the National Gallery: a 3D installation piece that takes as its subject the red-light district of Amsterdam in the late 1970s and 1980s. This is not, like the Koons silkscreens, an all-too-photographic reproduction: the sculptures are visibly sculptures, with resin streaks artfully built up over not-hugely-realistic figures, whose faces are furthermore symbolically covered with glass vitrines, all intermixed with black-and-white photography. No mistaking this for reality. So why do the critics seem to have done exactly that? Colin Wiggins, the National Gallery&apos;s head of education and the curator of the show, set the tone by announcing that &quot;The British are so prissy, so safe and tame and tasteful&quot; \u2013 an aggressive pre-empt for viewers not liking what they see. And at least two men writing about the piece have felt the need to share personal stories of interactions with the Amsterdam red-light district, or with prostitutes. Richard Dorment opened his Telegraph review with a paragraph on his schoolboy adventures in Amsterdam (supervised by a Jesuit; what a shame I went to a Church of England school). It is &quot;not irrelevant to the exhibition&quot;, he adds. Then Tom Lubbock in the Independent tells us &quot;I have never paid for sex. But off the top of my head I can think of three male friends who have, and perhaps still do.&quot; Too much information. WAY too much. What next, a link to their Facebook pages? I don&apos;t remember that after the first showing of Damien Hirst&apos;s shark in formaldehyde, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, any of the critics shared their views on shark-fin soup, or revealed whether they shop from the Marine Conservancy endangered-species list. And, when other art forms deal with sex, this sort of thing doesn&apos;t seem to happen. When Michael Haneke&apos;s The Pianist opened, reviewers didn&apos;t share their own memories of intimate pedalwork with their piano teachers; reviews of Philip Roth&apos;s The Humbling, with its lurid old-man sexual fantasies, didn&apos;t begin, &quot;Well, when I was last in bed with two lesbians ...&quot; All the reviews discussed the sex, but discussed it as part of the film or the novel, not as an insight into the reviewers&apos; lives. Somehow this only happens with contemporary art. Nancy Kienholz was interviewed in a film running next to the installation, and she says that her husband insisted that the piece was &quot;all about the light&quot; \u2013 he saw it as no different from the Dutch genre paintings which (stresses unprissy Colin Wiggins) were also about sex. So they were. But no one has felt the need to look at them and then share their own sexual histories, thank God.

The remains of the plane&apos;s skeleton, smouldering on a remote airstrip in the Sahara desert, revealed few clues. Even now, more than two weeks after the Boeing 727 was found in Mali, west Africa, the cause of the plane&apos;s demise has yet to be revealed, triggering questions about whether it really crashed or was torched to destroy evidence. The one thing on which investigators agree is that the cargo plane had been used to transport cocaine into Africa from Latin America, probably Venezuela, that was bound for the streets of Europe. The find is being seen as significant by US and European intelligence agencies, which believe the traffickers are using a corridor running through several central-north African states controlled by terrorist networks to channel drugs to western Europe. From west African coastal states such as Guinea-Bissau the drugs pass through Mauritania, Mali and Niger before ending up in Libya or Egypt. From there, law enforcement officials suspect the drugs are hidden in containers on board cargo ships, which are less likely to be searched than those from Latin America. An increasing concern is that the west African coastal states are now becoming more than simply import hubs. In the past few months several laboratories used to produce cocaine hydrochloride, the finished product, from cocaine paste have been discovered in Guinea-Bissau&apos;s neighbour, Guinea, along with machines that can be used to make ecstasy pills. &quot;The fear is no longer just about trafficking,&quot; said Alan Campbell, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Home Office, who has just returned from a fact-finding mission to west Africa. &quot;The Latin American drugs gangs may be looking at the possibility of producing cocaine in west Africa. There is even the suggestion they are trying to grow coca plants there because it is on the same line of latitude.&quot; Until the discovery of the plane, it had been assumed that most of the cocaine transported from west Africa was in small planes or boats. But, as Alexandre Schmidt from the UN drugs agency acknowledged, the size of the destroyed plane was &quot;a complete surprise&quot;. Sources suggest the Boeing was likely to have been carrying between two and three tonnes of cocaine \u2013 a huge amount given that the UN estimates that 250 tonnes of cocaine enters western Europe annually. Intelligence agencies are studying claims that the airstrip in Mali is under the control of one of al-Qaida&apos;s most powerful franchises, raising concerns that Africa&apos;s burgeoning role in the cocaine trade is now funding terrorism. Professor Stephen Ellis of Amsterdam&apos;s Free University, an expert on west Africa&apos;s drugs trade, said that several reports suggested that the airstrip was in a region controlled by the group known as &quot;al-Qaida in the land of the Islamic Maghreb&quot;. Previously known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, it was responsible for a spate of car bombings in Algeria in 2007 that left dozens dead, including at least 11 UN staff. &quot;Until now, there is no evidence they have had a direct interest in the drug trade,&quot; said Ellis. &quot;But if the airstrip was controlled by al-Qaida, it suggests there is direct contact between them and Latin American drug interests.&quot; The Home Office estimates that 50% of the cocaine that enters the UK comes from west Africa. Two years ago the government put the figure at under 30%. Like manufacturers taking advantage of cheaper labour by moving their plants abroad, the major Colombian drugs gangs have exploited west Africa&apos;s political instability, poorly funded law enforcement agencies, endemic corruption and porous borders. But a link with terrorist networks would add a new dimension. It is not only al-Qaida that may be involved. A briefing prepared for the US Congress speculated that west Africa&apos;s substantial Lebanese trading community \u2013 strong supporters of Hezbollah \u2013 have been buying the drug from the paramilitary group Farc, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. &quot;When we talked to the UN, it became clear that part of the problem [of the cocaine trade] was not just its impact on coastal states like Guinea-Bissau, but the fact that those involved now had the confidence to fly to inland areas,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;They are getting perilously close to that area [of Africa] where you&apos;ve got concerns about how it could play into the hands of terrorist organisations. Are we getting to the point where we can see links between terrorist groups and drugs gangs?&quot; The UK government has recently launched several initiatives such as Operation Westbridge, which involves Border Agency officials working in west African countries like Ghana and Nigeria to weed out drug smugglers. Officials from the Serious Organised Crime Agency also operate in the region. But the drugs gangs controlling the cocaine washing up on Britain&apos;s shores are now established and entrenched in west Africa. As Campbell put it: &quot;There is growing recognition that our frontline is there, not Portugal or Spain.&quot;", "sentences": ["Professor Stephen Ellis of Amsterdam&apos;s Free University, an expert on west Africa&apos;s drugs trade, said that several reports suggested that the airstrip was in a region controlled by the group known as &quot;al-Qaida in the land of the Islamic Maghreb&quot;."], "title": "Drug seizures in west Africa prompt fears of terrorist links", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/drugs-cocaine-africa-al-qaida", "tags": ["Drugs trade", "Al-Qaida", "Guinea-Bissau", "Mali", "Guinea", "Niger", "UK news", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-11-29T00:06:21Z", "article": "It is not often that the first number of the night brings some of its biggest applause, but when that song is &quot;Child&apos;s Christmas in Wales&quot; sung by John Cale at a homecoming gig in Cardiff&apos;s Coal Exchange, it will. It was coincidence, not kitsch, that made a song inspired by Dylan Thomas the opener, for that was sealed into the running order by the project in hand, one that people have been begging him to do for 15 years: the first orchestrated performance of his 1973 album, Paris 1919. The concert featured Cale&apos;s excellent young band from Los Angeles, with a chamber orchestra under the baton of Welsh film composer John Rea, performing a score by Cale and American theatre composer Randall Woolf. It was inevitable that the event would be charmed by the magic of an audience aged 10 to 80 come to welcome back its local boy made good with the Velvet Underground. And the Coal Exchange itself is a poignant venue, its hallways lined with boards listing the companies once based here, a monument to lost industries. The colouration of the sound on occasion deepened and darkened these songs from Paris 1919 \u2013 written to capture the doom-laden ennui of a Europe signing the fateful Treaty of Versailles \u2013 but for the most part, the orchestration and performance were lightened with ironic humour. &quot;You&apos;re a ghost! \u2013 La la la&quot; in the title track had a clownish bounciness to it. &quot;Graham Greene&quot; felt like an exploration of George Martin&apos;s work with the Beatles \u2013 the vernacular, psychedelic suburbia \u2013 with dissonant, chromatic rip-tides churning beneath the outward joviality of references to &quot;Chipping and Sodbury&quot; or the Queen. When the orchestra left the stage, Cale sang &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, from an earlier solo album, with a restraint that was even more unsettling than its sparse studio account. Afterwards, the extended family gathered for a proud reunion, and Cale was saluted by the Arch-Druid of Wales. It is interesting that 45 years after leaving the land of song, Cale is now more engaged in his homeland than ever; he performs there regularly, works with a drug rehabilitation project near Swansea and created the installations for the Welsh pavilion at this year&apos;s Venice Biennale. Most interesting of all, though, is Cale&apos;s incessant and impetuous innovation. While others of his vintage strut the same old stuff, he is experimenting more ambitiously than ever. He has declined to join the other members of the Velvet Underground \u2013 Lou Reed, &quot;Moe&quot; Tucker and Doug Yule \u2013 in a discussion of the band&apos;s legacy at the New York Public Library on December 8.

The result looks likely to cause strife where there was relative peace, sully the country&apos;s image abroad, damage investment and trade with the Muslim world, and set back efforts to integrate a population of some 400,000 Muslims, most of whom are European Muslims \u2013 and non-mosque-goers \u2013 from the Balkans. The campaign to ban minarets was described by the country&apos;s justice minister as a &quot;proxy war&quot; for drumming up conflict between ethnic Swiss and Muslim immigrants. But the ban was supported by a majority of 57.5%, 20 percentage points more than predicted in opinion polls in the run-up to the vote. &quot;The federal council [the body that constitutes the federal government] respects this decision,&quot; said a government statement tonight . &quot;The construction of new minarets in Switzerland is no longer permitted.&quot; While surprising, the verdict raised the question of whether such curbs on Muslims would be replicated across Europe were voters given their say. If Switzerland is the only country in Europe to embark on such a ban, that may be because its system of plebiscitary democracy compels single-issue referendums if petitions amass enough signatures. Across Europe, far-right parties have been scoring gains in recent years on anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant platforms. The result represented a triumph for the far-right populist Swiss People&apos;s party, which organised the petition paving the way for the referendum. In opposition, the SPP became the strongest party in Switzerland two years ago largely by running a robust campaign, denounced as racist by the UN, against immigrants. The result also represented an act of mass defiance of the national establishment. The government, mainstream political parties, the churches, the main newspapers, the national president, the powerful business lobby, and the Vatican all opposed the ban, but it was backed by 22 of the country&apos;s 26 cantons on a national turnout of more than 53% . As a result, the article of the national constitution regulating relations between the state and religion will be amended to include the bald statement: &quot;The construction of minarets is forbidden.&quot; &quot;The result is unworthy of Switzerland&apos;s tradition and history,&quot; said Farhad Afshar, a leading Swiss Muslim and Berne University sociologist. &quot;Muslims are well-integrated here compared with France or Germany. This result has nothing to do with the Muslims living in Switzerland.&quot; The SPP said the minaret ban would &quot;be implemented to the letter&quot; and denounced senior church figures for the &quot;alarming role&quot; they played in the campaign. Opponents of the move in the government, churches and human rights organisations had argued a ban on minarets would infringe fundamental liberties and freedom of religion. Green Party leaders warned tonightthat the ban could be unconstitutional and threatened to try to overturn the verdict at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Ulrich Schl\u00fcer, an SPP MP who led the ban campaign, pointed out that the Strasbourg court had recently ruled against crucifixes in classrooms in Italy. &quot;It now appears that Christian towns are not supposed to use Christian symbols,&quot; he said. &quot;But we&apos;re supposed to have Muslim symbols.&quot; The SPP said that going to the European court would breach the popular sovereignty that underpins the Swiss democratic model and tradition. It dismissed the arguments about freedom or religion, asserting that minarets were not a religious but a political symbol, and the thin end of a wedge that would bring sharia law to the country, with forced marriages, &quot;honour&quot; killings, female genital mutilation and oppression of women. A handful of recent applications for building permits for minarets in Switzerland, the no campaigners said, was proof to many Swiss &quot;of the next step in the strategy of Islamification of our country. The fear is great that the minarets will be followed by the calls to prayer of the muezzin \u2026 sharia is gaining in importance in Switzerland and in Europe. That means honour killings, forced marriages, circumcision, wearing the burka, ignoring school rules, and even stoning.&quot; The prohibition also found substantial support on the left and among secularists worried about the status of women in Islamic cultures. Prominent feminists attacked minarets as male power symbols, deplored the oppression of Muslim women, and urged a vote for the ban. The justice minister, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, a strong opponent of the ban, said the result reflected fears about Islamic fundamentalist tendencies. &quot;The Federal Council [government] takes the view that a ban on the construction of new minarets is not a feasible means of countering extremist tendencies.&quot; She had previously criticised the prohibition campaign as a violation of human rights and as a &quot;proxy war&quot; for those seeking to stir up religious friction. Corine Mauch, the mayor of Zurich, who also opposed the ban, said the vote was &quot;a fateful signal to the Muslim community&quot;. Swiss business is worried that the anti-Muslim vote could have a serious impact on trade with the Arab world. More immediately, there is concern for two Swiss businessmen abducted in Libya last year after Colonel Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s son and daughter-in-law were arrested in a Geneva hotel on suspicion of mistreating their staff.

Danish cartoons The country was plunged into crisis with the Arab and Islamic world in 2005 after a Copenhagen newspaper published a set of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad regarded as sacrilegious and offensive to Muslims. The episode triggered intense debate over freedom of expression and its limits, and hate speech. French burkas Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to ban the burka, arguing this month that it breaches rigorous French\u00a0adherence to public secularism.

Never mind the kangaroo testicles and witchetty grubs pushed before jungle-strewn celebrities: earlier this year I met a man who has tasted a substance that seems to trigger the gag reflex in most people. Willem van Eelen is an 86-year-old Dutchman who survived five years of near-starvation as a PoW in Japan to become the self-proclaimed &quot;Godfather of In Vitro Meat&quot;. He now holds the patent to a food technology that repulses and excites people in equal measure. In his Amsterdam apartment he admitted to me, with a mischievous smile, that he once placed a small quantity of in vitro meat \u2013 muscle cells grown artificially, rather than in a living animal \u2013 in his mouth: &quot;I once put a few cells on the tip of my tongue. I couldn&apos;t resist it. It tasted a little like chicken.&quot; In vitro meat \u2013 also known as cultured or fake meat \u2013 is becoming a holy grail for anyone concerned about the environmental and ethical impacts of rearing millions of animals around the world each year for human consumption. Where today we use animals to turn grass into edible protein, in the future we might bypass this inefficient process and grow edible protein in an algae solution in factories instead. The animal rights group Peta has gone as far as offering a $1m prize to the first scientists to bring the meat to market. In what is an encouraging breakthrough, a team of Dutch scientists, with Van Eelen as their figurehead, say they have now grown in vitro meat successfully for the first time in the laboratory. When I visited Mark Post, one of the team&apos;s lead scientists, at his lab at the University of Technology in Eindhoven earlier this year, he showed me the plastic dishes in which the meat cells, originally taken from a pig foetus, were being grown. Inside was a pink liquid he described as having the texture of &quot;an undercooked egg&quot;. It had yet to be &quot;exercised&quot; via electrical stimulation into a muscle-type texture. Not exactly a pork chop with herb butter, but I said I was willing to taste the future. Alas, he declined. Wait a few years, he said, and he should have got to the stage where long strips of it can be grown and rolled up into frankfurter-like sausages. It will probably be 30 years before we see in vitro pork chops, or anything more sophisticated than the processed meat found in cheap burgers and sausages. On paper, the science sounds compelling, but it will take a superhuman effort on the part of the world&apos;s advertising agencies to convince us to swallow it. After living through various food scares \u2013 many involving meat \u2013 you can understand the hesitancy. The scientists admit all this, saying they&apos;ve even thought of alternative names for it. (&quot;Krea&quot;, the Greek word for meat, was one of their favourite suggestions.) But I for one don&apos;t see a problem with placing a forkful of the stuff in my mouth. OK, it&apos;s never going to be a gourmet experience, but as a substitute for real meat \u2013 one that could boast environmental and animal-welfare positives \u2013 it seems too good to leave off the menu.

They had come to hear him account for his past. But Demjanjuk stubbornly sat in silence, his waxy face showing no emotion, his head tipped back and eyes closed, throughout the first day of his court case in Munich today. The 89-year-old stands accused of being an accomplice in the murder of 27,900 Jews in the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, who was extradited to the southern German city from his home in Cleveland, Ohio, in May after a 30-year attempt to bring him to justice, is accused of helping to murder Jews when he worked at Sobibor in 1943 by pushing them into carbon monoxide-filled gas chambers. Demjanjuk&apos;s lawyer shocked the courtroom by claiming that his client was just as much a victim as those imprisoned in the camp. Gasps came from the public gallery when Ulrich Busch compared Demjanjuk&apos;s situation, as a Red Army soldier who was taken prisoner by the Germans, to the victims of Sobibor. Busch listed camp guards more senior than Demjanjuk, some of them members of the SS, who had been tried in the 1970s for their roles at Sobibor, or at the guards&apos; training camp, Trawniki, but who had either received minimal sentences or been exonerated of any wrongdoing. How, Busch asked, was it possible that a &quot;subordinate&quot;, who had been forced to work for the Nazis as a prisoner of war, was standing trial? &quot;He is as much a victim as those people who were imprisoned in the camp but he is being treated as if he was a mass murderer,&quot; he said. Later, Cornelius Nestler, a lawyer for some of the co-plaintiffs said: &quot;My clients were flabbergasted by his statement, they were so shocked they were speechless.&quot; Nestler told the court that while Demjanjuk would have had the choice to leave the camp \u2014 as 30% of guards did \u2014 the Jews had no exit. &quot;In some Nazi jails or concentration camps, guards were mere guards, ensuring that no one escaped,&quot; said Thomas Blatt, 82, a Sobibor survivor and co-plaintiff who lives in Amsterdam. &quot;But at a death camp like Sobibor, a guard was always part of the murder machinery.&quot; Demjanjuk denies he was at Sobibor. But prosecutors will produce an identity card which they say proves he was there, and will argue that everyone who worked at Sobibor, however small their role, was part of its death machine. They will also call about 30 co-plaintiffs as witnesses. Hans Joachim Lutz, a state prosecutor and historical expert, said that if sentences on Nazi war criminals had been too lenient in the past, it was because of &quot;mistakes of the German judicial system&quot;, and &quot;[this] should not be repeated here and now&quot;. From the end of the second world war until the 1980s, many of the few Nazi trials that took place in Germany were thrown out or deemed insignificant by much of the judiciary \u2014 which had itself undergone only a cursory de-nazification process. Doctors who examined Demjanjuk said mentally he was in a good state. Despite complaints such as a rare but treatable bone marrow illness, gout, a trapped nerve in his back and shrapnel that was still embedded in his spine, they said he was fit to stand trial, albeit only for two sessions of 90 minutes a day. But soon after the afternoon session had begun, Demjanjuk started complaining to his translator of a headache, and his limbs jerked violently under the blanket as if he was having a fit. He was taken out, given medication, and brought back in again several minutes later, lying flat on an elevated orange stretcher that dominated the courtroom from then on. Demjanjuk continued to keep his eyes closed. He occasionally rubbed his temples, but mostly clasped his hands over his stomach. It was impossible to tell whether he was following the trial. The two front rows of the public gallery were full of mostly Dutch co-plaintiffs, whose relatives died in Sobibor and who will be able to question Demjanjuk. &quot;My father was killed within an hour of arriving there by train, gassed with engine fumes,&quot; said Paul Hellmann, 74, a retired journalist. Sobibor is in a forest on the borders of Ukraine, Belarus and Poland. &quot;You cannot find it on the map, there&apos;s not even a sign to it,&quot; Hellmann said. &quot;But I felt very close to my father when I was there. We hope that at the very least this case will now make people aware of it.&quot; Helen Hyde, whose aunt, Helene Neuhaus, was murdered at Sobibor along with her son and husband, queued for four hours outside the courtroom in the hope of securing a seat. Hyde, 62, a Watford headmistress, said: &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to piece together her story for years.&quot; Hyde described how before being transported to the camp, Helene had left a baby daughter with a neighbour. The daughter now lives in Switzerland. &quot;She couldn&apos;t face the psychological trauma of being here, so I am here and will tell her about it,&quot; Hyde said.", "sentences": ["&quot;In some Nazi jails or concentration camps, guards were mere guards, ensuring that no one escaped,&quot; said Thomas Blatt, 82, a Sobibor survivor and co-plaintiff who lives in Amsterdam."], "title": "Nazi death camp accused was a victim, lawyer tells trial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/01/nazi-death-camp-accused-trial", "tags": ["Second world war", "Germany", "War crimes", "Ukraine", "US news", "World news", "Law", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-01T22:18:53Z", "article": "  Rudolf Salomon Cortissos reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a letter in a yellow envelope. He unfolded the small piece of paper once, and then again, to reveal the neatly slanting handwriting of his mother, Emmy. &quot;We&apos;re with 2,500 people, and we&apos;re going to work,&quot; it read. &quot;I promise you I&apos;ll be tough and I will definitely survive&quot;. It ends with the words: &quot;Thanks a lot for everything, hope to see you again.&quot; The letter was dated 17 May 1943. Four days later, according to Red Cross records, she was dead, aged 31, gassed by lorry exhaust fumes at Sobibor in Nazi-occupied eastern Poland. Today her son broke down as he tried to describe how Emmy had thrown the letter out of a train on her way to Sobibor death camp in the hope that someone would find it and send it to her family. Cortissos, now 70 years old, was one of five relatives of some of the 250,000 Jews who perished in the death camp to deliver witness statements in the trial of John Demjanjuk, who is accused of acting as an accomplice in the murder of at least 27,900 who died at the camp during the five months he worked there in 1943. &quot;People were told they were going to labour camps,&quot; said David van Huiden,78, who lost his stepfather, his mother and his sister at Sobibor after they were rounded up by the Gestapo. &quot;They were told to pack warm clothes and decent shoes. But it was the biggest lie ever \u2014 You know what it was? A perfect door to door service. They picked you up at your home address, took you by tram to the train station and then to Sobibor. Once you arrived there, it was all over within four to five hours.&quot; His family was murdered on 2 July, 1943. &quot;It also happens to be my birthday,&quot; he told the court. Many were in tears. Just metres from the witness box Demjanjuk, 89, who was deported from Cleveland, Ohio, in May to stand trial in Munich, lay passively on a stretcher, clad in a leather jacket and with blankets covering his body. A blue baseball cap concealed his entire face because of a ceiling light. He has exercised his right to remain silent. Once, during the morning session the judge Ralph Alt, interrupted a lawyer to say: &quot;Herr Demjanjuk wants to say something,&quot; when the retired carworker was heard to mumble. &quot;No, he&apos;s just praying,&quot; said his Ukrainian translator who leant over his bed throughout the day, whispering a continuous interpretation of proceedings into his ear. Demjanjuk then appeared to cross himself. Another of five co-plaintiffs to deliver harrowing witness statements to the court said he did not discover what had happened to his mother, sister and brother until 10 years ago. &quot;Part of me didn&apos;t want to know,&quot; said Martin Haas, 73. Now a professor of biology and oncology in San Diego, Haas was sent to live with a foster family in the Dutch countryside when his family was rounded up. After the war when nobody came to pick him up he was sent to families around the country who were looking to adopt. &quot;I hated them all, until my father&apos;s second cousin found me, and he and his wife have been my parents ever since.&quot; Mary Richheimer-Leyden van Amstel, 70, was the only survivor of her family. She was just two when strangers agreed to hide her before her parents were herded to Sobibor. &quot;I have no memories of anyone in my family,&quot; she told the court. &quot;After the war nobody came to pick me up, and I just instinctively understood that my parents would not be coming back.&quot; Demjanjuk&apos;s state of health \u2014 which his defence lawyers have tried hard to argue is not good enough for him to be able to stand trial \u2014 was once again the focus of much of the proceedings today. His condition \u2014 he is suffering from a low-risk bone marrow complaint and other ailments \u2014 has enabled the defence team to present him as a victim, to the growing anger of the survivors of Sobibor as well as relatives of victims, many of whom are also suffering from frailty and poor health. Kurt Gutmann, 82, who lost his mother and brother in Sobibor, was angry at the way that Demjanjuk had turned his illness into a courtroom drama. &quot;This is all made up,&quot; he said. &quot;I myself have had three bypasses, but am I requesting a stretcher?&quot; Earlier in the trial Demjanjuk&apos;s lawyer, Ulrich Busch, elicited shocked gasps from the courtroom when he said the former Red Army soldier was as much a victim as the prisoners of Sobibor. Efraim Zuroff, director of the Jerusalem office of the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Centre, who was present to see the start of a case which he had helped bring to court, said it was in danger of focusing solely on Demjanjuk&apos;s health and not on the victims of Sobibor. The trial continues with more co-plaintiffs due to give evidence tomorrow. &apos;I&apos;ll definitely survive&apos; Emmy Salomon was rounded up by the Gestapo in Amsterdam on 11 May 1943, when she went outside to get some fresh air because she feared an asthma attack was coming on. Her letter was written on 17 May 1943, just before her train left from Westerbork for Sobibor. She threw it out of the train somewhere on Dutch territory. Somebody posted it to the address on the envelope of the woman who was to look after her son, Rudolf. According to Red Cross records, she was gassed in Sobibor on 21 May 1943. Extracts from the letter read: &quot;It is Monday evening, and we&apos;re ready to board the train. I promise you I&apos;ll be strong and I&apos;ll definitely survive \u2026 Nothing can be done about this. &quot;We&apos;re ready to board the train with 2,500 people [and we&apos;re] going to work\u00a0\u2026 &quot;Take care of my husband, take care of my son, wherever he is \u2026 &quot;Thanks a lot for everything.

He directed a dozen features during 70\u00a0years as a film-maker, the first of which, Domenica d&apos;Agosto (Sunday in August), became an international arthouse hit in 1950. He was, however, best known for scores of\u00a0documentaries on\u00a0art. Born in Milan, Emmer spent most of his childhood in Venice, where his father was the city&apos;s municipal engineer. As a boy, he made good use of his father&apos;s free pass to the local cinemas, where his preference was for Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, but he also fell in love with the city&apos;s many art treasures. He completed his education at Milan University, where he studied law. Thanks to their mutual interest in art and cinema, he made friends there with Enrico Gras and Tatiana Granding. Gras was interested in making animated cartoons in colour, but Tatiana, Luciano&apos;s future wife, persuaded them to make art films using a 16mm camera. After a first try at filming Giotto&apos;s frescoes in Padua in 1938, to which they would return much later, they made a short film called Destino d&apos;Amore (Love&apos;s Destiny) about a romance between a chambermaid and a soldier at the front, told ingeniously by filming the picture postcards they exchanged. Submitted for approval by the ministry of popular culture, they were told &quot;it\u00a0ridiculed the love life of\u00a0a heroic fascist soldier&quot;. They were commissioned, however, to make a film about the land of Mussolini&apos;s birth, but when Il Duce saw it, he was horrified that they had shown a shrouded woman in black, carrying a scythe and entering the house where he was born. He ordered all copies to be destroyed, but one survived and was shown in Milan after the second world war. Emmer and Tatiana left Gras in Italy and spent the rest of the war in Switzerland. They later rejoined him in Rome and continued making art films. They were able to experiment more, letting the camerawork and editing give a subtle feeling of movement to the images they filmed. The results, particularly with the films of Giotto&apos;s Life of Christ, Hieronymus Bosch&apos;s The Garden of Earthly Delights and Vittore Carpaccio&apos;s Legend of Saint Ursula, won favour with specialists and screenings were soon organised in Paris and London. In the spring 1947 issue of the British Film Institute&apos;s quarterly Sight and Sound there was an article on Emmer&apos;s work. In the same magazine in 1950, Gavin\u00a0Lambert, reviewing a book published by Unesco, praised Emmer&apos;s films as &quot;the closest to perfection art films have ever reached&quot;.     Luciano Emmer's Domenica d'Agosto starred Pina Malgarini and Salvo Libassi. Photograph: British Film Institute    In 1949, when the Italian neorealist cinema was still winning plaudits abroad but was not popular with Italian filmgoers, Sergio Amidei, the principal scriptwriter of Roberto Rossellini&apos;s Rome, Open City, aware of Emmer&apos;s flair for storytelling, found the finance for him to make a feature about Romans spending a Sunday in August on the beach at Ostia. The script intertwined stories of Romans of different social backgrounds and lifestyles enjoying (or not) their day on the beach. Unpretentious and funny, without being vulgar, and imbued with passion, Emmer cast mostly non-professionals. Among the five professional actors were\u00a0Marcello Mastroianni, playing a\u00a0traffic cop left on duty in Rome, and\u00a0Franco Interlenghi, as the goodlooking, working-class teenager who flirts with a\u00a0girl from a snobbish middle-class family. The film was well received at the Edinburgh film festival in 1950 and had a good run in London, mainland Europe and elsewhere. It set the mood for Emmer&apos;s subsequent features, mostly disarming romantic comedies about young people and their love troubles, dismissed as &quot;rosy neorealism&quot; by most Italian critics. The best were Parigi \u00c8 Sempre Parigi (Paris Is Always Paris, 1951), Le Ragazze di Piazza di Spagna (The Girls of the Spanish Steps, 1952), and Terza Liceo (Third Grade, 1954), a\u00a0sympathetic lampoon on the foibles of\u00a0pupils, teachers and parents. But in between features, he continued to make art films. In 1953 he had spent a month as Pablo Picasso&apos;s guest in Vallauris, south-east France, and made what many consider the best documentary about the artist and his working methods. In 1960 he made his last feature for 30 years, La Ragazza in Vetrina (The Girl in the Window), filmed in Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district, about an Italian immigrant working in a\u00a0coalmine who falls for a prostitute and decides to stay with her. Emmer&apos;s most socially committed feature, shown at the Berlin film festival in 1961, inevitably fell foul of the Italian censors. Emmer later said: &quot;I didn&apos;t abandon the cinema. It was the cinema that abandoned me.&quot; In the following years he worked mostly for television, first with commercials that starred popular actors of the time, including Dario Fo. In 1990 Emmer made a new feature, Basta! Addeso Tocca a Noi (Enough! Now It&apos;s Our Turn), a sort of updated version of his Terza Liceo. Neither of his last features, made in the new century, won much favour, in spite of their highly erotic content, but when L&apos;Acqua \u2026 Il Fuoco (Water \u2026 Fire) was shown at Venice in 2003 he was honoured with a lifetime achievement award by Italian critics.

Curtis Warren, a former Liverpool street dealer who became Interpol&apos;s most wanted man, watched by video link from Belmarsh prison in London as judge Sir Richard Tucker delivered the sentence at the royal court in St Helier. &quot;We do not sentence him because of his record or notoriety,&quot; said Tucker. &quot;Nevertheless he has been shown to be the mastermind behind the planned importation.&quot; Warren, who is the only drug trafficker to make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List, had only been out of prison for five weeks when he was arrested in 2007 by Jersey police. The 46-year-old was accused of being the ringleader of a six-man gang who were trying to import 180kg of cannabis into the island from Holland via boat from France. Prosecutor Howard Sharp said it was the biggest drugs smuggling operation ever attempted on the island. &quot;Warren is a prolific drugs trafficker who has operated at the highest levels of the international drugs trade,&quot; he said. &quot;Warren orchestrated this conspiracy \u2026 He had the necessary clout and influence to direct them. He was the link between the two.&quot; Between 1997 and 2007 Warren had been imprisoned in Holland&apos;s highest security jail after being found guilty of conspiring to import \u00a3100m worth of cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and cannabis, as well as firearms offences. His sentence was lengthened when he killed a fellow prisoner in a fight and was convicted of manslaughter. During the trial the court heard Warren had begun planning the Jersey conspiracy before he left his Dutch cell. British detectives working with the Dutch prison authorities gathered &quot;first-class intelligence material indicating that Warren was still engaged in drug trafficking activity while in prison&quot;. Warren was kept under close surveillance during the five weeks he was a free man, when he made 1,500 phone calls, 112 from public phone boxes, and was secretly recorded talking about what he stood to gain from the Jersey plot. Along with one of his co-accused, Jonathan Welsh, he visited a secluded location on Jersey&apos;s east coast that the pair agreed would be a good drop-off point for the drugs, which they planned to ship from Holland via the Normandy coast. Warren was taped referring to the Jersey plot as &quot;just a little starter&quot;, suggesting that if all went well bigger importations would follow. Sir Richard said: &quot;After being released from prison in Holland it was a very short space of time before you embarked on this drug trafficking enterprise. It was you who provided the contacts in Holland and the source of supply.&quot; Welsh, 43, originally from Liverpool, who was described in the trial as the &quot;willing purchaser&quot; of the drugs, was sentenced to 12 years. He had invested \u00a318,000 in the plot and was already a police target after being jailed on the island for 10 years in 2000 for the largest heroin seizure in the Channel Islands. The judge said: &quot;You made all the arrangements on the ground, you recruited the other defendants in Jersey and you travelled to Amsterdam. If it had not been for you this conspiracy would never have happened in Jersey.&quot; James O&apos;Brien, 45, from Glasgow, received a 10 year sentence for agreeing to pilot the boat which the smugglers planned to use. The hearing was then adjourned for the judge and jurors to further consider the sentences for the remaining defendants.", "sentences": ["The judge said: &quot;You made all the arrangements on the ground, you recruited the other defendants in Jersey and you travelled to Amsterdam."], "title": "Drug baron Curtis Warren jailed for 13 years", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/03/curtis-warren-jailed-jersey-drugs", "tags": ["Crime", "Drugs trade", "Jersey", "UK news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-03T22:35:00Z", "article": "Last Saturday, Camille O&apos;Sullivan stood on stage at London&apos;s Royal Albert Hall in front of 5,000 people. She wore a black strapless dress, fishnet stockings, and red sequinned shoes. She sang five songs, shook her dark hair loose over her shoulders, and told the audience she was so nervous about performing here that she hadn&apos;t eaten for six months. Then a woman&apos;s voice came from the stalls; not unfriendly, but curious. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she shouted. &quot;She was quite sweet,&quot; O&apos;Sullivan says, two days later, perched on a velvet banquette in a London restaurant. &quot;It was perfect timing. My mind was on doing a good show. I thought, &apos;You eejit, Camille, you forgot to say your own name!&apos; But I&apos;ve started to think that it&apos;s a good thing when unusual things happen in gigs. People will remember that night.&quot; The problem of introductions is one that O&apos;Sullivan looks unlikely to face for much longer. The Albert Hall may be the biggest venue she&apos;s played yet, as support for Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra, but most of the ageing blues fans didn&apos;t even know she&apos;d be on the bill. From next week, however, O&apos;Sullivan will have her own venue to fill \u2013 the Apollo theatre in London&apos;s West End, where, after a decade or so of touring around the UK, Ireland and Australia, including several month-long stints at the Edinburgh fringe, she is taking up residence for six weeks with her show, The Dark Angel. It&apos;s a dark-hued blend of chanson, theatre and cabaret, in which the half-Irish, half-French O&apos;Sullivan \u2013 wild-haired, red-lipped, barely contained by her black retro-style corset-dress \u2013 makes a convincing case for being one of the most powerful performers around today, and certainly one of the most unhinged. Her repertoire ranges from Jacques Brel and Kurt Weill to stripped-back versions of songs by Tom Waits, Nick Cave, David Bowie and Radiohead. Some \u2013 such as Brel&apos;s searing Amsterdam, about carousing sailors kissing their &quot;sluts&quot; in the lamplight \u2013 she performs shoeless and unaccompanied, her voice a tearing rasp. Others \u2013 such as Cave&apos;s God Is in the House, and Dillie Keane&apos;s heartbreaking Look Mummy, No Hands, about a woman remembering the mother she has lost \u2013 she performs in a half-whisper, perfectly still, tears rolling down her cheeks. And between songs, she gulps red wine, spits cork from her mouth, ranges among the stalls sitting on laps, and encourages the audience to miaow like cats. &quot;I just love miaowing at people,&quot; O&apos;Sullivan says, &quot;and I like people to miaow at me.&quot; She shifts uncomfortably in her seat. She has, she says, a &quot;weird relationship&quot; with performing \u2013 she suffers from appalling stage fright, and can barely relate to her larger-than-life on-stage persona. In person, she is chatty but cautious, talking constantly of how afraid she is, of pretty much everything. &quot;Over the years of performing, this \u2026 beast came out,&quot; she says quietly, &quot;and the beast is me magnified. I would never do any of that stuff I do on stage in the daytime. I wouldn&apos;t be going off to sit on somebody&apos;s lap in a restaurant. I wouldn&apos;t even sing at a party. I would be terrified.&quot; O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s shyness originates, at least in part, from the fact that she has no formal musical training. Performing is, in fact, her second career \u2013 she studied architecture at University College Dublin, graduating in 1996. Born in London an indeterminate number of years ago (she prefers not to divulge her age), O&apos;Sullivan moved with her parents \u2013 Denis, an Irish racing-driver, and Marie-Jose, a French artist \u2013 to Passage West, a small town near Cork in the south of Ireland, when she was three. She and her sister grew up studying piano and ballet, and listening to their parents&apos; wildly differing music collections \u2013 the Brel, Gainsbourg, Tchaikovsky and Debussy belonged to their mother, while their father was a fan of Deep Purple, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. But the only place she sang was in church. Then, at university, O&apos;Sullivan joined the drama society, and won a role in a production of the musical revue Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris; suddenly, she was raiding her mother&apos;s record collection once more: &quot;When I heard the Brel, a lightbulb came on and I went, &apos;Oh my God, I feel alive, the words are so truthful, so bittersweet; I feel like I&apos;m talking to myself.&apos;&quot; A year working in Berlin followed, during which she discovered the music of Hanns Eisler and Weill; on her return to Dublin, O&apos;Sullivan joined a small group singing Weill and Brel, and became known on the university circuit as the &quot;singing architect&quot;. It was then that she met the cabaret singer Agnes Bernelle, who was then in her 70s. &quot;I was completely blown away,&quot; says O&apos;Sullivan, &quot;by the fact that someone of her age could be a storyteller. We got talking, and I was saying, &apos;I can&apos;t be a singer, I&apos;ve never been trained&apos;. And she was drinking and smoking her head off, going, &apos;Don&apos;t worry, darling, you&apos;re as good an actor as you are a singer.&apos;&quot; But it wasn&apos;t until O&apos;Sullivan was knocked down by a car, aged 26, that she began to think seriously about giving up architecture. She broke her pelvis and fractured her hip and her hand; she was unable to walk or write for months. It was a wake-up call; she told her ex-boyfriend, Feargal Murray (now her musical director), that she needed to sing. He helped her book gigs in cafes around Dublin, she quit her job, and, little by little \u2013 via guest spots with acclaimed cabaret show La Clique; sell-out performances in the travelling vaudeville venue, the Spiegeltent; and a credible turn as a singer in the 2005 film Mrs Henderson Presents \u2013 her career began to take off; a fact that appears to surprise no-one more than O&apos;Sullivan herself: &quot;I think it was just by chance. I haven&apos;t come through it with a record; it&apos;s been purely word of mouth. I&apos;ve been lucky.&quot; Thus far, O&apos;Sullivan has been an interpreter of songs, not a songwriter. Is writing her own material the next step? &quot;I&apos;d like it to be. But I&apos;m really nervous \u2013 I think I might be awful.&quot; Her number-one dream is to write a song with Nick Cave \u2013 she &quot;nearly collapsed&quot; when she first heard his 1997 album The Boatman&apos;s Call, and remains absolutely still when performing his songs, for fear that waving her hands about &quot;will do an injustice to his words&quot;. She&apos;s met him a few times; on one occasion, she says, he thanked her for singing his songs, but she &quot;got a bit scared. I couldn&apos;t talk properly.&quot; But for now, of course, there&apos;s a West End show to prepare for. She likes to bring objects from her own home to decorate her stages, from vintage dresses on hangers to a patchwork blanket. For the Apollo, she&apos;s thinking of festoon lights, and maybe some antique lampshades \u2013 as well as having a pair of mirror-ball shoes made. Anything that makes her, and the audience, feel at home \u2013 because, inevitably, the nerves are kicking in, as they do before every concert. &quot;I&apos;m a terrible doubter,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m my own worst enemy. I&apos;m scared about coming into London. But I&apos;m going to give as a good as I get.&quot;  ", "sentences": ["Some \u2013 such as Brel&apos;s searing Amsterdam, about carousing sailors kissing their &quot;sluts&quot; in the lamplight \u2013 she performs shoeless and unaccompanied, her voice a tearing rasp."], "title": "Camille O'Sullivan: 'I just love miaowing'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/03/camille-o-sullivan-interview", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Camille O'Sullivan"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-07T00:10:07Z", "article": "The government&apos;s approval of a third runway at Heathrow has been endorsed by MPs, ahead of the publication tomorrow of an independent report on aviation&apos;s contribution to climate change. The House of Commons transport committee backs the expansion of Britain&apos;s largest airport in a report published today, adding that airline passengers would be better served by a second runway at Gatwick rather than Stansted. &quot;In view of the economic benefits to the UK, we endorse the government&apos;s January 2009 decision to support a third runway at Heathrow and an additional terminal,&quot; says the report. It states that a second runway at Stansted is unlikely to be completed before 2019 due to planning wrangles and priority should be given instead to Gatwick, where an embargo against expanding Britain&apos;s second largest airport expires in 2019. The endorsement of the Heathrow policy comes as the Committee on Climate Change prepares to publish its own aviation report. Alongside approving a third runway, the government introduced a target of limiting aviation&apos;s carbon dioxide emissions to 2005 levels by 2050. The committee, set up to advise ministers how to reduce carbon emissions, will report on aviation&apos;s progress towards the target tomorrow, including comments on whether a third runway will hinder the industry&apos;s ability to meet the 2050 benchmark. A leading campaigner against Heathrow expansion said the transport committee had &quot;failed to move with the times&quot;. John Stewart, who chairs Hacan (Heathrow Association for the Control of Airport Noise), added: &quot;It trots out the tired, old discredited arguments in favour of Heathrow expansion. The economic case for Heathrow expansion is just no longer accepted by the majority of decision-makers.&quot; Ministers argue that congestion-choked Heathrow needs to expand, otherwise leading businesses including financial services firms will locate their bases in countries with larger, less crowded airports. With a third runway, Heathrow would go from handling 67 million people a year to 135 million. If there is no expansion those passengers will simply go elsewhere, travelling through rival hubs in Paris or Amsterdam at considerable cost to British jobs, the government believes. The Liberal Democrats warn today that an expanded Heathrow will cost the government billions in terms of the price of carbon dioxide generated by 220,000 extra flights a year. &quot;In light of the new government guidance on the cost of CO2 emissions, Heathrow expansion will actually cost us billions,&quot; said Susan Kramer, the party&apos;s Heathrow spokeswoman. &quot;Only this government could dress up a loss of billions of pounds as a reason to have a third runway. We don&apos;t need a bigger Heathrow to keep London competitive.&quot; The Conservatives are also opposed to a third runway. The transport committee also backed high-speed rail as a key feature of Britain&apos;s future transport infrastructure, arguing that it is &quot;imperative&quot; that the new network is linked to airports such as Heathrow.", "sentences": ["If there is no expansion those passengers will simply go elsewhere, travelling through rival hubs in Paris or Amsterdam at considerable cost to British jobs, the government believes."], "title": "MPs back third runway at Heathrow airport", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/07/mps-third-runway-heathrow-report", "tags": ["Heathrow third runway", "Airline industry", "House of Commons", "Transport policy", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Travel", "Business", "UK news", "Travel and transport", "Heathrow airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-07T00:24:00Z", "article": "I have a small financial stake in Ryan Giggs being named Sports Personality of the Year, so I watched the BBC&apos;s Inside Sport special, announcing the shortlist, with particular interest. The focus of my attention until next Sunday will be firmly on the awards \u2013 Tiger Woods, I reckon, has probably blown his chances of taking the overseas gong \u2013 despite ITV&apos;s late bid to divert us with the X-Factor final, The Susan Boyle Story and A Night In With Cheryl Cole. I have been trying to work out whether Giggs&apos;s constituency might be more likely to be on board ITV&apos;s talent show bonanza, and thus not available to vote, without coming to any firm conclusion. These are worrying times for the small investor. My other main concern is that, in the style of The X-Factor, all the candidates have their own backers, and I believe my\u00a0runner has attracted the least popular. Where Jenson Button had the support of Murray Walker and James Corden, and Jessica Ennis was boosted by the popular singing group JLS, Giggsy\u00a0was backed by the comedian Patrick Kielty, whom people might remember from a particularly lame chat show, and Alan Shearer, never the most popular of pundits. I should have liked Giggs&apos;s case to have been presented by two more admired figures, although I take comfort from the fact that viewers may hardly have noticed, distracted by the strange warehouse set, which seems to be BBC Sport&apos;s default setting for &quot;edgy&quot; these days, and the Citizen Kane camera angles which brought us more shots of Gabby Logan&apos;s nostrils than even the most fervent admirer of that feature might desire. While we wait and hope for Giggsy&apos;s triumph, though, there is plenty to distract us, not least Amir Khan&apos;s whirlwind victory over Dmitriy Salita. Sky did not go big on the Muslim v Jew angle, surprisingly. As both boxers claimed to have God on their side, I thought it an interesting exercise in comparative religion, although Khan was a hot 1-6 favourite, so Salita was clearly asking his god to do a little more. Salita only made the 10 stone weight by stripping completely naked for the weigh-in \u2013 thankful, presumably, for the absence of foreskin. Khan said he could see a bit of fear in Salita&apos;s eyes, which turned out not to be anything to do with the skimpy towel preserving his modesty, but an entirely justified wariness of his opponent. The fight was a vivid illustration of what makes boxing the cruellest game of all. Salita had spent months at a training camp in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, running, sparring and working on strategy, only to see the whole project collapse in just 76 seconds. &quot;You feel for him,&quot; said the pundit Glenn McCrory, which were my thoughts exactly. I should have liked to have seen the traditional hug between the boxers, or at least a handshake, but Salita just melted into the background in\u00a0the face of Khan&apos;s triumphalism. And then there was the World Cup draw, hosted by the lovely Charlize Theron (like the lovely Aimi MacDonald, who appeared in comedy shows in the 1970s, one is contractually obliged to append the adjective). The South African actress was the undoubted star of the show. The problem was that her bons mots \u2013 and there were quite a few \u2013 were often drowned out by a welter of stats from the commentator Jonathan Pearce, who was able to inform Gary Lineker that &quot;excitement has reached fever pitch&quot;. When Lineker asked him\u00a0what the mood was like in Cape Town, guess what \u2013 it was &quot;like an enormous party&quot;. Charlize, on the other hand, was a breath of fresh air. She co-presented with a sleek Fifa suit, the general secretary, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, whose pomposity she pricked at every turn. After a meticulously detailed yet still opaque explanation of the draw, he said, &quot;I hope that&apos;s clear,&quot; to which she responded, &quot;Why? There&apos;s going to be a test?&quot; In truth, there is not a great deal to say about a draw, especially in the unforgiving minutes before the balls are drawn, but that did not stop the BBC panel \u2013 Shearer, Lawro, and John Motson \u2013 saying it. Among Shearer&apos;s insights were &quot;If we&apos;re going to win the trophy, we have got to beat a Brazil or a Spain&quot; and &quot;We need a Rooney or a Gerrard to do something special&quot;. Gee thanks, Al. Motty did his Derren Brown act: &quot;I feel something might happen here, we might get France.&quot; He was spot on: they might have, but did not.

Past pieces include ink-and-paper drawings based on photographs from the news, abstract wooden wheels that seem to be half-sunk into the gallery floor, and public interventions, such as the placing of a scorpion and a diamond next to each other on an Amsterdam street, for which she was nominated for the 2003 Becks Futures prize. What unites these disparate works is difficult to say, although &quot;an investigation into the act of looking&quot; is the phrase that the Tate plumps for, and who are we to doubt it? What&apos;s on show: A handful of Skaer&apos;s recent works, which are the first thing you come across after paying your \u00a38 (or \u00a37 with this voucher!) at Tate Britain. Facing the door is a pointed stone loop in front of some kind of book and a fairly ordinary wooden chair. Behind these objects are two paintings that seem to have been made by pressing them against pieces of paper. On the left is another curved paper sheet, this one is half-covered in black ink spirals that come together to make a picture of a whale skeleton. But you won&apos;t look at this for long once you realise there&apos;s a real whale skeleton hidden behind a false wall in the corner. Peer through an aperture and you can see it, and its scaffolding of slings, bands and struts. Walk round this wall and you&apos;ll find 26 copies (I admit, I didn&apos;t count them) of Brancusi&apos;s slender sculpture Bird in Space, made from impacted coal dust. Most stand together in a little spinney, while the rest are piled up neatly on their sides, as if Skaer had left them there as spares. What the wall says: &quot;The life-size outline of a whale skeleton is just visible when viewed from a distance. Up close, however, the image dissolves into abstract marks, forcing the eye to oscillate between the detail and the whole. Similarly, Skaer allows only glimpses of a whale skull through the architectural screens constructed around it.&quot; What the critics say: &quot;Skaer&apos;s whale \u2026 is quite effective. Her other pieces \u2026 are less memorable,&quot; says Martin Gayford of Bloomberg. &quot;Her contribution may feel decidedly bitty, but as you puzzle and ponder and try to put it together, you find yourself focusing on the act of looking itself,&quot; says Rachel Campbell-Johnston in the Times. What the artist says: &quot;I&apos;m interested in a state of between-ness, and that state you find if one thing transforms to another.&quot; Drawing a whale and painting with a chair, we assume, are examples of this. Why you&apos;ll like it: Honestly, the whale is pretty cool. There is a real sense of menace as you notice that it&apos;s there, and then the giant snout looms out at you as you approach the slot. It&apos;s eerie, and fascinating \u2013 albeit more as wildlife than art. Why you won&apos;t: Dare one say that the whale&apos;s viewing slots are actually too wide? Hiding it is a great idea, but when you can stick your head right through the gap and look around \u2013 well, what&apos;s the point? As for all the other pieces, no doubt Skaer can make a case for them, but they just don&apos;t seem to have anything to do with one another. What will middle England say?

Initially unable to speak or move, the Weezer frontman was reportedly trapped in the vehicle after its doors were fused shut. Cuomo is now recovering in hospital, according to Weezer&apos;s friend and webmaster, Karl Koch. In a post to the band&apos;s website, Koch detailed the traumatic early morning crash, his arrival at the scene and seeing Cuomo being extracted from the wreck. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe what was happening in front of me, as Rivers lay so helpless, shivering in the centre of the chaos.&quot; Besides the driver, only Cuomo, his wife, two-year-old daughter, assistant and nanny were in the bus when it crashed. They were on a New York state highway, en route to Boston, when the vehicle hit a patch of black ice. &quot;The driver employed every ounce of skill he had in fighting to keep the bus upright as the vehicle violently fishtailed over the highway,&quot; Koch explained. &quot;While the bus did indeed go off the road, plunging about eight to 10 vertical feet [2.5-3m] into a muddy ravine, it did not flip or roll, despite having plowed right over a guardrail, flattening it.&quot; &quot;Everyone on the bus was either terrified or injured or both,&quot; Koch wrote. As the bus swerved, food and clothing items were thrown everywhere, glass shattered and the refrigerator &quot;flew&quot; off the wall. Cuomo&apos;s wife Sarah and his assistant Kim were thrown from their upper bunks with Kim suffering two fractured ribs and a fractured lower vertebrae. A more terrifying scene took place at the back of the vehicle, where Cuomo was relaxing in the lounge. Heaved into the air, he cracked three ribs upon landing and hurt his lower leg &quot;somehow&quot;. &quot;On top of it the sliding interior doors were fused shut and the electronics were ruined, so no one could get into the back lounge where Rivers lay immobile and unable to speak due to the pain in his ribcage,&quot; Koch said. &quot;To top it off, the front door was jammed shut with five feet of heavy wet mud up pressed against it so there was no way to leave the bus.&quot; Emergency workers managed to free the occupants, taking Kim and Cuomo away on stretchers. Kim has been discharged from St Mary&apos;s hospital in Amsterdam, NY while Cuomo has been transferred to a larger hospital. &quot;He is resting about as comfortably as could be expected now, and we were relieved to hear that surgery is unlikely,&quot; Koch said. The remainder of Weezer&apos;s tour, including Monday night&apos;s concert in Boston, was cancelled.

But this week is all about Copenhagen, the earth, and its imminent demise. Hot Planet (BBC1) is a handy catch-up for anyone who hasn&apos;t been paying attention. Industrialisation, fossil fuels, planes, cars, cows and our homes have all produced greenhouse gases that have made the earth warmer. And that causes all sorts of problems. A one-degree rise is bad but inevitable; two degrees would be worse; three catastrophic. If the permafrost of the frozen north melts, along with the Arctic sea ice and the Greenland icecap, there will be terrifying rises in sea levels. Great cities \u2013 Amsterdam, Venice, New York, King&apos;s Lynn \u2013 will disappear below the waves, and vast quantities of greenhouse gases, trapped under the ice, will be released. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, the dark ground revealed by the melt will then absorb the sunlight and further contribute to warming, so the whole process will accelerate. We&apos;re screwed, in other words. Armageddon, here we come. Got it? To be fair, I think most of us knew a good deal of that, but I suppose it can&apos;t harm to bang it home (while there still is a home). It gets more interesting when attractive TV scientists Iain Stewart and Kathy Sykes start looking at some solutions. Not just renewable-energy sources (yeah, yeah, know it already), but storing carbon dioxide in sandstone beneath the Utah desert \u2013 that&apos;s pretty cool. And growing artificial meat from cells in a laboratory. Heston Blumenthal&apos;s showing an interest in this. He&apos;s got a Christmas show next week; maybe he could do something with artificial turkey. But they&apos;ll need to get a move on with the science, because right now it doesn&apos;t look very appetising \u2013 more like something coughed up by a heavy smoker in the morning than meat. Mmmm. Best of all, though, are these brilliant new artificial trees. Made of special plastic, they&apos;re actually better at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than real trees. And, once captured, the CO2 can then be released, maybe to be stored underground in Utah. They may not look like real trees, but that&apos;s not to say they don&apos;t have their own beauty: they look like giant bedside lights dotted across the countryside. Quite nice, I think. I wonder what a woodpecker would think of them. Probably not a lot. Lumberjacks aren&apos;t going to like them much either, just as the artificial meat will be bad news for cowboys. They&apos;re going to have to be retrained, as stem-cell biologists and carbon- capturers. We&apos;re all going to have to make sacrifices. There&apos;s further trouble ahead in Horizon: How May People Can Live On Planet Earth? (BBC2). Answer: not very many more, says David Attenborough. And he should know, he&apos;s David Attenborough. In 1950, the world&apos;s population was 2.5bn; today, it&apos;s 7bn; and by 2050, it&apos;s going to be 9bn. Beyond that, our poor old planet is going to have serious problems sustaining us all. And when you factor in all the climate-change stuff, you&apos;ve got serious problems. The temperature goes up, resources dwindle, the sea rises, land disappears, and there are more and more of us to cram in. Life on earth is going to feel increasingly like one huge and terrifying game of musical chairs. Right, I think we all need some light relief. Gossip Girl (ITV2) \u2013 perfect. And what a lovely episode. There are lots of gorgeous young people about, which is pleasing, even if they do look as if they, too, are made of special plastic. Then there&apos;s a cameo from Lady GaGa, and I actually know who she is, which is also pleasing. P-P-P-Poker Face, P-P-Poker face. Mum-mum-mum-mum-Ma. (Shut up, Sam, don&apos;t be embarrassing.) Poor Dan is dealing with the fallout from his threesome with girlfriend Olivia and best friend Vanessa. Duh, schoolboy error, Dan. Everyone knows that the third person is supposed to be a stranger. Because a threesome always ends up as a twosome and a onesome . . . Yeah, like I know. But I&apos;m learning. You can learn a lot from Gossip Girl.

Michael Owen may have got through for a hat-trick on Tuesday night, but opportunities are harder to come by when a player tries to search out a place in Fabio Capello&apos;s plans. The Manchester United attacker&apos;s display in Germany was no more than a promising start in the bid to return to the international reckoning. Owen did at least make an advance. As much as the goals, Capello would have taken notice of the player&apos;s condition. In stoppage time Owen still had the energy to make the long run on the break that brought his third goal. There was pleasing devilment, too, as he tricked the goalkeeper Diego Benaglio before finishing. It corroborated Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s claim that Owen had been increasingly to the fore in training. Nonetheless, Capello would be ditching his usual stringency if he suddenly declared that Owen now meets all the criteria. In mid-December, an attacker who turns 30 next week has scored just twice in the Premier League. On each occasion, he did so as a substitute. If he has not made the grade with his club, why should he be treated as the key to England&apos;s hopes at the World Cup? Ferguson could counter by arguing that Owen is coming good at exactly the right time. As always, though, Capello will exercise a vigorous scepticism. There are few spare berths for forwards. The Italian may well take just four attackers to South Africa. He had Emile Heskey forming a productive partnership with Wayne Rooney in the qualifiers. The respective understudies may be Peter Crouch or Carlton Cole and Jermain Defoe. There may be no need for anyone else since Steven Gerrard, for instance, could take over the duties of an absent Rooney. Owen, in effect, could have to displace Defoe. In some ways, that contest is a mismatch. The Tottenham attacker does not have a comparable knack for assessing defenders and exploiting their weaknesses. He also lacks the wealth of experience at the top level that Owen has amassed. Defoe, all the same, is younger, less prone to strains and in the midst of a productive spell. He has scored five goals for England over four appearances this season. They have all not been trivial either, since it was his strikes in August that delivered a 2-2 draw in Amsterdam against a more highly-ranked Holland side. Still, Owen&apos;s ears might have pricked up when he heard the manager qualifying the accolades a little that day. Capello certainly had compliments to pay, but he also added that footballers of Defoe&apos;s build get fit fast and are ready to make an impact early in the season. Owen himself might once, like Defoe, have been naturally sharp, but everything has come harder now that he is older and battle-scarred. The older man does still have his advantages. It is true that he may struggle to be picked for United from the kick-off when Dimitar Berbatov and Rooney are fit, but, conversely, the club, as they did in Wolfsburg, can regularly give Owen the sort of stage that Defoe is yet to tread. If the competition for places is more exacting at Old Trafford than it is at White Hart Lane then so, too, must be the standards that have to be met. With United, there is the prospect of being regarded as one of the elite because major trophies are at stake. While he certainly is in competition with Rooney and Berbatov, there are days, too, when one of them will use his creativity to show the sharpshooter Owen in the best possible light. The schedule for the next few weeks is rather appealing, too, with fixtures that should offer a striker chances to hone his statistics. In truth, of course, we do not know if the wiser Owen can ever be a match for the scintillating opportunist of years gone by, but the switch from St James&apos; Park to Old Trafford did challenge the assumption that he was as much on the slide as Newcastle United. There are factors, of course, that are beyond his control. England have just one friendly before the close of the club season, so it could be that Capello will conclude it is too late to reconsider his options. Owen, for his part, will have to continue being a dependable scorer if Tuesday in Wolfsburg is not to be written off as an illusory flashback to days that are truly gone forever. Peter Beardsley Forward who won 59 caps for England &quot;Michael Owen would always be in my 23 for the World Cup because of his pedigree. He&apos;s been there and done it before. And the thing about Michael, even when he was at Newcastle, is that he very rarely misses chances, which he proved against Wolfsburg. In fact the third goal wasn&apos;t even a chance and he made it into a goal. I don&apos;t think that fitness will be an issue because Michael knows his own body. And he&apos;s not injury-prone. He just had some freakish injuries at Newcastle. All in all, I wouldn&apos;t say he would start for England but I would definitely take him to South Africa.&quot; Peter Taylor Former caretaker England manager &quot;I think Michael needs a very good second half of the season to go to the World Cup. There&apos;s definitely a value in having him there to come off the bench and David Beckham is in the same boat. But as a manager you want different options and if Wayne Rooney is going to start it could come down to a choice between Jermain Defoe and Michael because I&apos;m not sure you would want to take both. Michael is such a good finisher and against Wolfsburg he was brilliant. But I think at the moment he needs to be playing a bit more.&quot; Tony Woodcock Striker who won 42 caps for England &quot;I think with Michael scoring three goals against Wolfsburg that&apos;s got everyone all excited again but I don&apos;t think the hat-trick will change Capello&apos;s mind. He will want to see him playing on a regular basis. I also think the big thing you have to take into consideration is Michael&apos;s style of play. Does he offer an alternative to the other strikers? There are a lot of things in the melting pot and Michael has been there and shown he can do it at the highest level. But I couldn&apos;t make a decision on him now. I would keep him as a candidate for the moment.&quot;", "sentences": ["They have all not been trivial either, since it was his strikes in August that delivered a 2-2 draw in Amsterdam against a more highly-ranked Holland side."], "title": "Michael Owen's hat-trick offers him a glimmer of World Cup hope | Kevin McCarra", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/dec/10/michael-owen-world-cup-chances", "tags": ["Michael Owen", "Manchester United", "Fabio Capello", "England", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-13T00:05:29Z", "article": "All prices are based on a three-night trip departing on 30 December.

In the first of their current pair of concerts, they chose, significantly perhaps, to give us something different, in the form of music by Brahms, Smetana and Martinu. None of it, it should be said, was unfamiliar repertoire. But all three composers haven&apos;t featured prominently in the Concertgebouw&apos;s previous UK appearances, nor do we associate them with their chief conductor Mariss Jansons. Brahms was represented by the Fourth Symphony, a performance prefaced by a flurry of anticipation as to its qualities. Some Brahmsians, I suspect, might not have cared for it, great though some of it was. The playing was sublime, but the smoothness of the Concertgebouw sound precluded any sort of interpretation that could be described in terms of leanness or steeliness. Instead, we were conscious of something beautiful and innately organic, much of which unfolded with a measured, natural flow. The scherzo was a bit unyielding, but Jansons touched the limits of elation and tragedy in the outer movements, and was probably at his best in the andante, which hovered in ambivalent territory between grief and consolation. The first half aroused mixed feelings. Smetana&apos;s Bartered Bride Overture was a charmless exercise in speed.

More than a million passengers face travel misery throughout the festive season if the proposed 12-day cabin crew walkout goes ahead between 22 December and 2 January.  Direct fares to New York departing London on the first day of the strike and returning on 27 December were topping \u00a31,000 this afternoon with Delta and over \u00a31,300 with Virgin Atlantic. Meanwhile flying from London to Glasgow on Christmas eve and returning on Boxing Day will set you back \u00a3370 with bmi. EasyJet said its services between London, Edinburgh and Glasgow and popular European destinations such as Barcelona, Nice and Amsterdam were selling fast. &quot;We have seen additional bookings over the past 24 hours, and we will do whatever we can to accommodate people&apos;s travel needs over the holiday period,&quot; said Paul Simmons, easyJet&apos;s UK general manager. &quot;We still have over 160,000 seats available during the period on the routes that we share with BA.&quot;\u00a0  &quot;As we stand the flights are already over 75% full,&quot; Simmons added.\u00a0  Virgin Atlantic said it would operate larger aircraft on some routes during the strike period, including Newark, Boston, Washington DC and Delhi. Virgin Trains said it was planning to run an additional 25 services on the London to Glasgow via Preston route over the holiday period to help affected BA passengers and that exact timings of the trains would be available soon. British Airways, which faces losses of up to \u00a330m per day of industrial action, today launched legal action in a bid to halt the Unite union&apos;s strike, claiming there had been irregularities in the ballot for strike action, which rendered it invalid. But analysts feared the action would go ahead, with drastic consequences for British Airlines and its passengers. &quot;The strike is going to happen and it&apos;s going to hit BA&apos;s numbers. It will also impact January bookings and for a lot of people, they will think about flying with a low-cost carrier instead in future,&quot; said airline analyst Andrew Fitchie of Collins Stewart. Mr Fitchie said easyJet could be in line for extra revenues of \u00a340m to \u00a360m, and predicted an additional 400,000 passengers could defect to the no-frills carrier, which shares 96 routes with BA.  &quot;This is likely to lead to a significant windfall for easyJet, its closest competitor, as well as other airlines who fly in and out of the UK, including Ryanair, Flybe, Lufthansa and Air France,&quot; added Mr Fitchie.  Price comparison site Skyscanner reported an 11% rise in site traffic since the strike was announced yesterday afternoon. &quot;When BA release the information about which routes will be cancelled we expect to see a large spike,&quot; Skyscanner spokesman Sam Baldwin said.  &quot;People are sitting tight, they don&apos;t know yet if their flights been cancelled or not.&quot; BA chief executive Willie Walsh told passengers his airline would &quot;do everything we can to assist you at what will clearly be a very difficult time if strikes go ahead&quot;. &quot;We are working hard on contingency plans, and will announce them as soon as they are finalised,&quot; he\u00a0said in an online statement: &quot;We are also urging Unite to return to the negotiating table.

Police arrested Judge Mar\u00eda Afiuni, court bailiffs and a defence lawyers after her ruling allowed Eligio Cede\u00f1o, a banker facing corruption charges, to walk free last week. Ch\u00e1vez, who has taken a close interest in the case, responded furiously, suggesting Afiunio had been bribed to facilitate an escape. &quot;A judge who frees a criminal is much, much, much more serious than the criminal himself,&quot; he said in a televised speech. &quot;This judge should get the maximum penalty... 30 years in prison. That judge has to pay for what she has done.&quot; He said he had discussed the affair with the head of the supreme court, and had demanded &quot;firmness&quot;. Venezuela&apos;s independence hero, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, he added, would have had the judge shot. Soon after the president&apos;s intervention, Afiuni was charged with corruption and abuse of power. Legal scholars and opposition politicians said the row showed the judicial system had lost its independence and was suborned to Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s socialist revolution. The Caracas bar association president, Yvett Lugo, said Afiuni&apos;s ruling was in line with the law and that her arrest marked a breakdown of the rule of the law and the principle of separation of powers. Robert Amsterdam, one of Cede\u00f1o&apos;s lawyers, said the case was a blow to democratic freedom. &quot;There was a time that judges who failed to follow Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s instructions risked being removed from the bench. Judicial independence had been on life support, but sadly, it is now officially dead.&quot; The judge is being held at a women&apos;s prison outside Caracas whose inmates could include people she sentenced, said Amsterdam. &quot;Her life is at risk.&quot; The court bailiffs who were arrested have been released, but Jos\u00e9 Rafael Parra, a defence lawyer who was in court when his client was freed, remains in custody. A fresh warrant has been issued for the arrest of Cede\u00f1o, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Once a high-flying banker \u2013 part of a group known as the &quot;boligarchs&quot;, who have grown immensely wealthy under Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 he was jailed in February 2007 and accused of improper currency exchange transactions. Held for almost three years at the headquarters of the investigative police, Disip, with no trial in sight, the 45-year-old became one of Venezuela&apos;s highest-profile prisoners. Afiuni conditionally released him last Thursday in a hearing where prosecutors were absent. She reportedly led Cede\u00f1o through a door and allowed him to take a private lift, avoiding Disip agents. He was last seen on the back of a motorbike. Ch\u00e1vez supporters said the judge had been paid to facilitiate the &quot;escape&quot;, and that this showed much of the judiciary remained in the hands of a corrupt mafia. Cede\u00f1o&apos;s lawyers said the ruling was based primarily on the opinion of a UN-mandated panel of legal experts known as the working group on arbitrary detentions. The opinion, which has yet to be considered by the UN&apos;s human rights council, was submitted to the judge. Ch\u00e1vez has filled the supreme court with supporters and said the separation of powers weakened the state \u2013 but also that the judicial system remained autonomous. Last week the supreme court head, Luisa Estela Morales, said Venezuela had moved from &quot;a rigid separation of powers&quot; toward a system characterised by &quot;intense co-ordination&quot; between government branches.", "sentences": ["Robert Amsterdam, one of Cede\u00f1o&apos;s lawyers, said the case was a blow to democratic freedom.", "Judicial independence had been on life support, but sadly, it is now officially dead.&quot; The judge is being held at a women&apos;s prison outside Caracas whose inmates could include people she sentenced, said Amsterdam."], "title": "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez demands jailing of judge who freed banker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/15/chavez-venezuela-judge-cedeno", "tags": ["Venezuela", "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez", "World news", "Americas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-17T13:55:22Z", "article": "The BBC today made what it presented as a tactical climbdown in its libel battle with the oil trading company Trafigura. After negotiations with Trafigura director Eric de Turckheim this week, the broadcaster agreed to apologise for a Newsnight programme, pay \u00a325,000 to charity, and withdraw any allegation that Trafigura&apos;s toxic waste dumped in Africa had caused deaths. But at the same time, the BBC issued a combative statement, pointing out that the dumping of Trafigura&apos;s hazardous waste had led to the British-based oil trader being forced to pay out \u00a330m in compensation to victims. &quot;The BBC has played a leading role in bringing to the public&apos;s attention the actions of Trafigura in the illegal dumping of 500 tons of hazardous waste&quot; the statement said. &quot;The dumping caused a public health emergency with tens of thousands of people seeking treatment.&quot; Trafigura had only brought the libel action against a single aspect of Newsnight&apos;s reporting, the BBC statement went on: &quot;Experts in the [compensation] case were not able to establish a link between the waste and serious long-term consequences, including deaths.&quot; In a confidential out-of-court settlement earlier this year, an agreed joint statement was issued by Trafigura and lawyers Leigh Day, representing almost 30,000 claimants in the Ivory Coast. It described the consequences of the waste dumping as &quot;low-level&quot; illness, rather than deaths or miscarriages. This left an earlier Newsnight programme exposed to litigation: Trafigura claimed Newsnight had specifically accused them of causing deaths, and that they were therefore entitled to recover damages under British libel law. The BBC&apos;s decision to settle caused dismay among some journalistic staff today. One commented: &quot;This result is very unfair. It is completely outrageous that Trafigura should never yet have been brought to a court verdict on their own behaviour, but the BBC should have been penalised for trying to report on it.&quot; BBC sources said one factor in the management decision to settle was the fear that Carter-Ruck, Trafigura&apos;s libel lawyers, could run up potential bills of as much as \u00a33m if the issue came to a full trial, particularly in the uncertain climate of British libel law. A hearing would have to be conducted before controversial libel judge Mr Justice Eady. In a court statement before Eady at the High Court this morning, it was agreed that &quot;The BBC accepts the conclusions reached by the experts in the personal injury action [and] acknowledges that the evidence does not establish that Trafigura&apos;s &apos;slops&apos; caused any deaths, miscarriages or serious long-term injuries. Accordingly, the BBC has withdrawn those allegations and has agreed to broadcats an appropriate apology on Newsnight.&quot; The outcome represents a partial success on behalf of Trafigura for Carter-Ruck partner Adam Tudor. Trafigura&apos;s attempts to enforce a &quot;super-injunction&quot; against the Guardian, preventing parliamentary reporting, led to political uproar. A reproving statement from the Lord Chief Justice followed, plus a parliamentary inquiry and the eventual collapse of an attempted ban on publication of the contents of a scientific report disclosing that Trafigura&apos;s waste was potentially highly toxic. De Turckheim issued his own statement this morning, repeating the contentious claim that &quot;The slops were... dumped illegally by an independent company called Compagnie Tommy \u2013 a deplorable action which Trafigura did not and could not have foreseen.&quot; Internal emails published by the Guardian show that Trafigura executives were in fact aware of the hazardous nature of their waste, and the need for specialist expensive disposal. Trafigura is currently facing prosecution in Amsterdam, for allegedly lying about the nature of the waste during an earlier attempt to dispose of it cheaply. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

In a statement from Geneva the UN experts criticised the president for branding the judge a crook. &quot;Reprisals for exercising their constitutionally guaranteed functions and creating a climate of fear among the judiciary and lawyers&apos; profession serve no purpose except to undermine the rule of law and obstruct justice.&quot; The panel, comprising El Hadji Malick Sow of Senegal, Gabriela Carina Knaul de Albuquerque e Silva of Brazil and Margaret Sekaggya of Uganda, became involved in the case in September when it described the detention of the banker, Eligio Cede\u00f1o, as arbitrary. The high-flying &quot;boligarch&quot;, the nickname for tycoons who have grown immensely wealthy under Ch\u00e1vez, Cede\u00f1o was jailed in February 2007 and accused of improper currency exchange transactions. After almost three years behind bars no trial was in sight.

The Caracas bar association and opposition politicians said the judge&apos;s arrest showed the judicial system had lost its independence and was suborned to Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s socialist revolution.

When I was still a comedian, and doing stand-up, I would do a lot of benefits for the various foundations she was involved in. And when she started this new foundation, campaigning for the victims of human-rights abuse, she asked me to get involved - so I became chair.  The reason I&apos;ve become particularly involved in this campaign heightening awareness of sex trafficking is that one of the victims spoke to me about her experiences. And I thought that her story would be something that might lend itself to many artistic forms. One of these was an installation which has just come back from New York and which I recently took to Madrid (it opened in Trafalgar Square a few years ago).  And the other was Richard&apos;s film. The Journey is quite abstract, because we felt that a lot of the films made about trafficking don&apos;t necessarily convey the full horror of what these woman go through. So, rather than making it with a traditional narrative, Richard made something that&apos;s about what happens on the inside. With me, floating about, being appalled, on the outside. We wanted to create something that was a visceral experience.  Did you intend the film to be like an installation?Exactly so. Almost like you&apos;re walking inside someone&apos;s body. Did you think it needed to be quite so brutal? Yes, I did. In fact, I particularly suggested that it be that brutal because people just don&apos;t know [about this]. They honestly think most of these women have chosen to come over to work illegally. The brutality that is represented in this film doesn&apos;t even come close. The truth is worse. It&apos;s not pleasant, but we have to look.  You couldn&apos;t make a feature-length film using the language of cinema that Richard is using \u2013 but it is possible if it&apos;s in short pieces, that then live with you. We&apos;ll see. All of these attempts to tell this story, to get this information over, are experimental. The installation proved to be a fantastically effective weapon and tool. And I&apos;m going to be very interested to see how people respond to this \u2013 whether they can manage it.           Have you been surprised by the reaction so far?People like Richard Ashcroft just said: &quot;Right, here you go, you can have my song [for the soundtrack].&quot; People just want to do something, immediately, because [the situation] is so awful.  Why do you think people find it easy to ignore the problem?Because I don&apos;t think women are top of anyone&apos;s agenda. I find now is the time for more militancy than ever before. I feel now, in my 50th year, having been very angry and militant as a young woman, that things are not getting better. They&apos;re getting worse; and the sex trafficking industry is an example. I feel that in most places women don&apos;t have jurisdiction over their own bodies. And that if we don&apos;t start seriously addressing the value and the worth of women in the world, this sort of thing is just going to get worse. And I feel that very strongly, and having lived for long enough, actually, to back it up.  How do you back it up?Because I&apos;ve travelled enough and I&apos;ve spoken enough to hundreds of women around the world. I know what&apos;s going on. I&apos;ve seen it first-hand. And I haven&apos;t even been to many places! But it&apos;s endemic in so many countries and, it turns out, pretty common in ours.  Why do you think today&apos;s generation of young women aren&apos;t very exorcised about the issue? I think they&apos;re wandering around going: &quot;Oh, well everything&apos;s great now.&quot; These women, with the advantages that only the first world can give them, think that somehow there&apos;s nothing left to do.  But I look around and see that women are being used sexually as much as they ever were, to sell absolutely anything and everything. The message gets through to girls - I watch them sexualising their behaviour very early on because of everything they watch and see. And I&apos;m pissed off, I&apos;m really, really pissed off. I&apos;m so angry about it. Because there I was in my 20s thinking that we&apos;d made some progress.  Who are you angry at?Well, there&apos;s so may areas to address that I don&apos;t know quite where to begin. Let&apos;s take advertising; the area of women&apos;s magazines, the representation of women. I would ask people to question the way in which they are selling their products. I would ask the government to question the way in which it&apos;s a normal thing to walk into any newsagents and see very overt sexual pictures of women everywhere. This is what our kids grow up surrounded by. Is it any wonder that we buy and sell women on the street in broad daylight? No, it bloody isn&apos;t.  Why are people more apathetic these days?I don&apos;t know. My own rage can sometimes get in the way of clear thinking \u2013 I understand that \u2013 but it&apos;s also a source of my energy; otherwise I&apos;d just dry up and die. But there&apos;s an awful lot of very clear-thinking, wonderful young women around, full of the most tremendous ideas and the capacity of expressing what&apos;s going on. And we do have some of the greatest feminist writers around to explain to us what is going on. But, as for grassroots movement and action, there&apos;s not enough of that. All that should be going on in schools, particularly this question of girls owning their bodies and not seeing them as things that have to be used. I keep banging on about this. In the African countries I visited it&apos;s simply non-existent. But I think in a very strange subtle ways also it&apos;s very difficult to achieve here. I&apos;m constantly reading stories of girls of 16 or younger, feeling that they have to give themselves sexually in order to be accepted.  Your role in The Journey is a slightly thankless one. How do you cope with the hostility you must encounter campaigning?Well, any kind of reaction I could have to people being hostile towards me pales into insignificance when I consider what&apos;s being done to these women. It&apos;s just irrelevant. I&apos;m fine! And they&apos;re not. And unless one shouts and provokes a reaction nothing will happen.  Does it frustrate you that other people aren&apos;t prepared to put themselves on the line?Luckily, I know a lot of people who do. And because I&apos;m well-known, it&apos;s a slightly different thing. There&apos;s a lot people I know who work far harder than I do, day in day out, helping people through all this kind of stuff, so I don&apos;t feel I require any special treatment.  What do you want people to do, having watched The Journey?There are many, many ways in which you can get active. One is to keep your eyes open because all of this stuff is happening on the streets. If you work in a chemist and there&apos;s lots of foreign girls coming in buying condoms who don&apos;t speak English, they&apos;re probably been trafficked. So learn to recognise them, find out what the story is. Know what trafficking is, for a start, and know that it isn&apos;t people who&apos;ve chosen to come over and work as sex workers. And even if they have come over to work to as sex workers, they&apos;ve had no idea what kind of situation they&apos;re going to be in. That they&apos;re going to be working as slaves is not, in any way, shape or form, the contract that they undertook.  Also, it&apos;s very important that we start a debate about our sex lives. We need another Kinsey report, actually. Because more and more young men are finding it completely acceptable to pay for sex. Now we could look at other countries. Sweden has now made paying for sex illegal, across the board - very interesting. But of course all the traffickers are now taking the women to Germany, where selling sex is legal, and to Amsterdam, where there is a huge problem.  Chances are you&apos;ll know somebody who pays for sex. We have a huge customer base here. And it&apos;s not confined to any particular class or ethnic background. It&apos;s across the board, and it&apos;s mostly white collar.  Do think we&apos;re very in denial?Totally. Men are paying for sex. We can&apos;t demonise that; we&apos;ve got to find out about it. Why are we suddenly doing this so much more than we used to? Why is there no stigma or shame attached to that whatsoever anymore? Because if that&apos;s the result of the sexual revolution, then it&apos;s fucked us up big time. Not that I want to bring back Victorian morality, because of course then it was all underground. But what I do want to do is start a debate. No one&apos;s talking about this.  Why do you think more men are paying for sex?Well, when I talk to young people I know they say it&apos;s often a peer pressure thing. Testimonials from customers are very hard to come by, but there&apos;s a woman called Liz Kelly at the Metropolitan University of London who collects them, and helped us construct the narrative for The Journey. You find that the reasons for paying for sex are as different as human beings are different. It&apos;s not all anger-fuelled, it&apos;s not all violent \u2013 although a lot of it is. Some of it is to do with not being able to arrive at any sort of sexual satisfaction in any other way, and a lot of it is men who have money who want more than what they can get from their partners.  We&apos;ve got to get into a conservation. Because if prostitution is always going be here, we&apos;ve got to make sure that it&apos;s safe. We cannot have it that women are used in this way, as slaves. This is not to be borne in the 21st century. It&apos;s absolutely antediluvian. Everyone needs to be more active and to ask these questions. Why are all these women coming to this country, who&apos;s paying for them? It&apos;s probably someone you know.  How much do you think actors should get involved in activism?I think the whole situation is going to change. It will change as people go: &quot;Oh, gawd, not this again.&quot; I think what people will require - and rightly so - is that whoever they&apos;re listening to, be they a politician or an actor or a journalist, needs to know what they&apos;re talking about and express themselves effectively. I think what is less effective is when people attach themselves to something without properly knowing about it. I think that kind of celebrity activism is on the wane. Because I think people are saying well, yes, but what else apart from your face are you lending to this? Are you giving us some information? People are being more demanding, which is great.", "sentences": ["But of course all the traffickers are now taking the women to Germany, where selling sex is legal, and to Amsterdam, where there is a huge problem."], "title": "Emma Thompson: 'Chances are you'll know somebody who pays for sex'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/18/journey-emma-thompson", "tags": ["Film", "Emma Thompson"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-21T19:03:00Z", "article": "     Eurostar trains between Britain and France will start running again tomorrow, the company confirmed tonight, blaming powdery snow for a series of catastrophic breakdowns. The cross-channel train service has been suspended for three days after a series of breakdowns on Friday night, which left 2,500 people trapped on trains inside the Channel Tunnel for up to 16 hours. Tomorrow trains will depart from 7:30am and run until 6:30pm, the train operator said. Only passengers holding tickets for Saturday or Sunday will be allowed aboard. Customers holding tickets for Monday 21 and Tuesday 22 December will be eligible for travel on Wednesday, while those with reservations for Wednesday 23 or Thursday 24 December can travel on Christmas Eve. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel is still not accepting new cars on its cross-channel service and airlines are also warning of delays and cancellations to flights as severe weather warnings were put in place across parts of the UK. A Eurotunnel spokesman said the Folkestone car shuttle terminal had been shut &quot;for the time being&quot;. The company is not accepting new bookings today, and only people with reservations will be able to use the tunnel. &quot;The weather in France is still very bad, so everyone has to travel with patience and accept that the weather and driving conditions are not good,&quot; the spokesman said. He urged travellers planning to check the company&apos;s website. Bad weather in the south-east meant many Eurotunnel employees could not get to work, resulting in fewer car shuttle services running than usual. This, coupled with the high volume of traffic due to the proximity of Christmas, has resulted in a backlog of traffic waiting to use the tunnel. &quot;There will be extra delays for people, but we are running services and will get people across to the continent today,&quot; the spokesman said. Eurostar train services were suspended while the company tested modifications made to its trains to cope with the severe weather. Eurostar&apos;s chief executive, Richard Brown, said he was &quot;very, very sorry&quot; about what had happened. Speaking at the company&apos;s London terminal at St Pancras station, Brown said the weather that had hit northern France was &quot;unprecedented&quot; in Eurostar&apos;s 15-year history. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is reported to have ordered the head of the French train authority to get Eurostar traffic moving again by Tuesday. The French government said it would launch its own investigation into the problems, which have so far disrupted travel for an estimated 55,000 people. &quot;We cannot imagine that this mode of transport, which is fundamental between France and England, between England and Belgium and the rest of continental Europe doesn&apos;t work because it&apos;s snowing outside,&quot; the French transport minister, Dominique de Bussereau, told Europe-1 radio in Beijing. &quot;Therefore, the government is ...demanding that measures be taken so this does not happen in the future.&quot; The UK transport minister, Sadiq Khan, said he was &quot;angry&quot; that passengers had still not been told what was going on and urged Eurostar to inform the public about its plans. &quot;I hope this will include the resumption of services as soon as possible,&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s important that passengers get absolute clarity of what they can expect over the next few days.&quot; Earlier today, Eurostar announced that it had launched an immediate inquiry into the problems which left people stranded in France, England, Belgium and the Channel tunnel itself. &quot;The review will be led by Christopher Garnett, former chief executive of GNER and formerly commercial director of Eurotunnel, in conjunction with Monsieur Claude Gressier who is inspecteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des ponts et chauss\u00e9es,&quot; a Eurostar statement said. Eurostar Chief Operating Officer Nicolas Petrovic blamed &quot;very light, powdery snow&quot; of a type normally found in mountains rather than in the plains of northern France for the chaos. The company has commissioned an independent inquiry. He said the snow had got into the trains so that when they entered the much warmer tunnel, the snow melted and caused condensation that affected the electrical power systems. &quot;It&apos;s the first time we have these snow conditions in this place in 15 years,&quot; Petrovic told a delayed news conference at the Eurostar terminal at the Gare du Nord station in Paris. Eurostar hopes to run two out of three services on Tuesday after satisfactory tests on modified trains on Monday, but Petrovic encouraged stranded passengers to try to find other ways home if they could, saying Eurostar would cover the cost. Petrovic said the company, which normally carries about 40,000 people a day between Britain and continental Europe, expected services to be back to normal by December 28. Flights to and from Britain have also been hit by delays and cancellations. Easyjet today cancelled more than 80 flights and warned customers they may not be able to transfer onto other flights during the next few days, while many airports reported delays. Some airlines said they were increasing capacity on services between London and Paris to help stranded Eurostar passengers, but flights from Charles de Gaulle airport, in Paris, were facing severe delays and cancellations because of the adverse weather. The cold conditions have disrupted flights from many British airports, with people travelling to and from the US and Europe facing delays. Inverness and Aberdeen airports remain closed until further notice, while flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh airports could also face delays. Easyjet published a list of more than 80 flights it had been forced to cancel. Spokesman Andrew McConnell said passengers should check the airline&apos;s website before travelling to the airport. Affected passengers can request refunds or transfer to other flights, but may struggle to get alternative flights before Christmas. Other airlines, including Flybe, have also cancelled services to and from the UK. Manchester airport has been hit by delays. Only one runway was open this morning, with the airport handling just 12 flights an hour. A spokesman said both runways were now in operation and the airport was back to its normal working capacity of 40 flights an hour. The airport is dealing with a backlog of flights from yesterday, but expected the remaining 10 flights from then to take off today. The spokesman added that many flights to the east coast of the US, Amsterdam and Paris would be delayed due to problems at airports in those areas. Six flights have so far been cancelled at Bristol airport, where many flights faced delays of one to two hours, a spokeswoman said. In London, the majority of flights arriving and departing from Gatwick airport were subject to delays, with most at least an hour behind schedule. A spokesman said the airport was operating a &quot;good service&quot; but warned that airlines were responsible for any delays. Heathrow experienced delays on some inbound flights from the US today, but a spokesman said no delays or cancellations were ongoing. Luton airport, which shut for several hours on Friday, is operating with some slight delays. Passengers have been advised to check with airlines before travel. On Friday, more than 2,000 Eurostar passengers spent the night in the Channel tunnel after trains failed, with Eurostar attributing the breakdown to the sudden change between the freezing temperatures above ground and the heat of the tunnel. The commercial director, Nick Mercer, said the failure had been due to a &quot;strange combination of factors&quot;. &quot;It was the amount of snow, which was higher than we experienced before, it was lighter than normal, fluffier, and the temperature inside the tunnel and the humidity was higher than normal,&quot; he said. Yesterday, Mercer said engineers believed they had found the cause and would work on the trains overnight to try to solve the problem. The ferry operator P&amp;O laid on a fleet of coaches to get passengers across the Channel and on to Paris or Brussels. &quot;At one point, we had 500 Eurostar passengers at Dover and at Calais,&quot; spokesman Chris Laming said. &quot;We&apos;ve spoken to Eurostar about this arrangement and they&apos;ve agreed to pick up the tab \u2011 we&apos;ll certainly send them the bill.&quot; It looks as though there will be no respite from the freezing weather that has triggered much of the transport chaos, with the Met Office warning of more heavy snow over the next two days. It has five flash warnings in place across the Midlands, the east of England, south-east England and south-west England. Forecasters also warned that there were likely to be widespread icy road conditions in Yorkshire and the Humber, London and the south-east, and the east Midlands.", "sentences": ["The spokesman added that many flights to the east coast of the US, Amsterdam and Paris would be delayed due to problems at airports in those areas."], "title": "Eurostar to restart some services after third day of suspensions but travel chaos continues", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/dec/21/eurostar-inquiry-passengers-stranded-trains", "tags": ["Transport", "Channel Tunnel", "Travel", "Weather", "UK news", "Eurostar"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-26T20:56:00Z", "article": "Searches are being carried out at a mansion flat in central London after a man with suspected links to al-Qaida allegedly tried to blow up a transatlantic plane, Scotland Yard said today. The man, a 23-year-old student from Nigeria named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab, is to be charged in a US court on Saturday, officials said.  Mutallab tried to ignite a device as the Northwest Airlines flight prepared to land in Detroit. It is understood he is an engineering student at University College London. He was overpowered by passengers and crew members, who smelled smoke and heard what sounded like firecrackers, federal officials said. Security has been stepped up at UK airports for passengers flying to the US, the Department for Transport said. Gordon Brown said the UK would take &quot;whatever action was necessary&quot; to protect passengers. UK airport operator BAA said searches on flights to the US would increase. A statement on the British Airways website said Washington had revised its security arrangements for all travellers to the US and they would only be allowed one piece of hand luggage. The prime minister said he had been contact with Sir Paul Stephenson, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, because of the &quot;serious potential threat&quot;. He said: &quot;The security of the public must always be our primary concern. We have been working closely with the US authorities investigating this incident since it happened.&quot; One official said the man claimed to have been instructed by al-Qaida to detonate the plane over US soil. A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said: &quot;We are in liaison with the US authorities. Searches are being carried out at addresses in central London.&quot; It is understood from security sources that police and MI5 will want to find out &quot;as a matter of priority&quot; the significance of any time that he spent in the UK. The address being searched is in Mansfield Street, near Harley Street. It is believed that extra staff and resources have been assigned to the investigation as a matter of urgency, and a key priority will be to check whether the arrested man has appeared in any other investigations. University College London said in a statement: &quot;UCL can confirm that a student by the name of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was enrolled on a mechanical engineering course at the institution between September 2005 and June 2008. &quot;However, it must be stressed that the university has no evidence that this is the same person currently being referred to in the media.&quot; Flight 253 with 278 passengers and 11 crew members aboard was about 20 minutes from landing when passengers heard popping noises, witnesses said. At least one person climbed over others and jumped on the man. Shortly afterwards, the arrested man was taken to the front of the plane with his trousers cut off and his legs burned, a passenger said. Police said the burns indicated the explosive had been strapped to his legs. President Barack Obama, who is on holiday in Hawaii, has been informed of the situation and is monitoring events. One US intelligence official said the explosive device was a mix of powder and liquid. It failed when the passenger tried to detonate it. &quot;It sounded like a firecracker in a pillowcase,&quot; said Peter Smith, a traveller from the Netherlands. &quot;First there was a pop, and then [there] was smoke.&quot; Smith said a passenger sitting opposite the man climbed over people, crossed the aisle and tried to restrain the man. Syed Jafri, another passenger, said he saw a glow and smelled smoke. Then, he said, &quot;a young man behind me jumped on him.&quot; &quot;Next thing you know, there was a lot of panic,&quot; said Jafri. The White House said it believed it was attempted terrorist act, and stricter security measures were quickly imposed on airline travel. It did not specify what they were. The incident has echoes of the British &quot;shoe bomber&quot; Richard Reid, who tried to destroy a transatlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes, but was subdued by other passengers. Reid is serving a life sentence. Mutallab was being questioned last night. An intelligence official said he was being held and treated in a hospital. Flight 253 began in Nigeria and went through Amsterdam en route to Detroit. In the UK, a Department for Transport spokeswoman said: &quot;In response to events in Detroit, the US authorities have requested additional measures for US-bound flights. &quot;We are monitoring the situation and will make any assessments as necessary as this develops.&quot; Although general airport security remains the same, with no change to luggage and liquid restrictions, passengers travelling to the US can expect more searches at the gate before boarding. Airport operator BAA said in a statement: &quot;Passengers travelling to the United States should expect their airline to carry out additional security checks prior to boarding. &quot;To support this important process, which will take time, we would advise passengers to leave more time to check in and limit the amount of baggage being taken on board the aircraft. If in any doubt, please contact the relevant airline for further information.&quot; A police spokeswoman at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam declined to comment about security procedures at the airport. Schiphol, one of Europe&apos;s busiest aiports with many transit passengers from Africa and Asia to North America, strictly enforces European security regulations including only allowing small amounts of liquid in hand luggage that must be placed inside clear plastic bags. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the flight until it was on final approach to Detroit, said federal aviation administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory. That is when the pilot declared an emergency, she said. According to the airline, owned by Delta, eight flight attendants and three pilots were on board. The FBI and the homeland security department issued an intelligence note on 20 November about the potential threat for the holiday season. At the time, officials said they had no specific information about plans for an attack by al-Qaida or other terrorist groups. In 2003, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden posted a recording on the internet calling on Muslims in oil-rich Nigeria to rise up against one of the &quot;regimes who are slaves of America&quot;. But links to al-Qaida remained rare, though security forces claimed to break up a linked terror cell in November 2007. Security at Nigeria&apos;s two major international airports in the capital, Abuja, and Lagos remain a point of concern. Uniformed police officers are often kept busy keeping hagglers and taxi drivers out of the airport. Bags quickly pass through x-ray scanners and those watching incoming passengers don&apos;t usually conduct tests for explosive residue on passengers&apos; hand luggage or shoes. At the gate, airline workers often check passengers again with handheld metal detectors.", "sentences": ["Flight 253 began in Nigeria and went through Amsterdam en route to Detroit.", "If in any doubt, please contact the relevant airline for further information.&quot; A police spokeswoman at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam declined to comment about security procedures at the airport."], "title": "Terror attack on US flight to Detroit investigated in London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/26/plane-bomb-plot-detroit", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Nigeria", "Africa", "Detroit"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-27T00:05:06Z", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday January 3 2010  The article below reported that the device used in the attempted bombing of Detroit Flight 253 apparently contained &quot;a variation of the explosive pentaerythritol (Petn) used by [&quot;shoe-bomber&quot; Richard] Reid&quot;. Pentaerythritol is an organic compound used in the preparation of Petn (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) but is harmless on its own.   Terrified passengers yesterday told of the moment when Umar Abdul Mutallab tried to set off a bomb as their plane commenced its descent on Christmas Day. Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit was carrying 290 passengers and crew who heard what was described as a &quot;balloon being popped&quot;. &quot;What we heard in the beginning was a bang... then a minute later there was a lady shouting things like, &apos;What are you doing? What are you doing?&apos;\u2009&quot; said passenger Elias Fawaz. &quot;We looked back and there was a struggle \u2013 and we saw fumes and fire coming out.&quot; Witnesses said Mutallab emerged from a toilet with a pillow over his stomach and a syringe in his hand. He injected the syringe into something held on his stomach, triggering smoke and flames. &quot;It was terrifying,&quot; said Richelle Keepman, another passenger. &quot;We all thought we weren&apos;t going to land, we weren&apos;t going to make it. We were in the back of the plane and all of a sudden heard some screams and some flight attendants ran up and down the aisles. We saw the fear in their eyes and they grabbed the fire extinguishers.&quot; Another passenger, Syed Jafri, said: &quot;Everybody was rushing towards that area and tried to get water, a blanket and fire extinguisher.&quot; The suspected terrorist was said to have been yelling and swearing and &quot;screaming about Afghanistan&quot;. &quot;When [it] went off, everybody panicked,&quot; said Jasper Schuringa, a Dutch film director travelling to the US to visit friends. &quot;Then someone screamed, &apos;Fire! Fire!&apos; I saw smoke rising from a seat... I didn&apos;t hesitate. I just jumped.&quot; Schuringa said he heard a sound similar to a firework going off and looked across the aisle at the suspect who had a blanket on his lap attempting to ignite an object he was holding. &quot;It was smoking and there were flames coming from beneath his legs,&quot; he said. &quot;I searched on his body parts and he had his pants open. He had something strapped to his legs.&quot; Schuringa and the cabin crew then dragged Mutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian, to the front of the plane, where he was restrained until landing. Mutallab reportedly told intelligence agents who began interrogating him after he was taken to hospital strapped to a stretcher that he had an explosive powder strapped to his leg. He was trying to set off the device with a syringe filled with liquid. Mutallab, who had boarded a flight from Lagos, Nigeria, to Amsterdam&apos;s Schipol airport before transferring to the Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit, had burns on his leg. &quot;The only thing I can tell for sure is that he was severely burned,&quot; said Melinda Dennis. &quot;They required a fire extinguisher as well as water to put it out. You could smell the smoke when we landed.&quot; Yesterday details about Mutallab&apos;s background and lifestyle started to emerge. University College London issued a statement saying that a student named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab studied mechanical engineering there between September 2005 and June 2008.His father is Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, a prominent Nigerian businessman who retired as chairman of the country&apos;s First Bank a fortnight ago. Yesterday he was talking to security officials in Nigeria who were liaising with US and British police. It has been suggested that, in the recent past, the father became so concerned about his son&apos;s activities he reported him to the American authorities and Nigerian security agencies . Family friends say Mutallab apparently became radicalised during his time at the British International School in Lome, Togo. At the school, he was known for preaching about Islam. He later grew estranged from his family and relocated to Dubai, before moving to London. Terrorism experts have been quick to draw parallels with the attempt by the British-born &quot;shoe bomber&quot; Richard Reid, a radicalised loner who tried to destroy a transatlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes. Reid was restrained by other passengers and is serving a life sentence in the US. US authorities are unclear as to whether the Christmas Day device failed to detonate or if the suspect was subdued before he had a chance to activate it. It appears that it was put together on the aircraft, using a variation of the explosive pentaerythritol (Petn) used by Reid. When Mutallab changed at Amsterdam for Detroit, he was apparently given additional screening, but not to a level that would have established he was carrying suspicious substances. Terrorism expert Dr Sally Leivesley said the incident suggested that terrorists were changing tack. &quot;This looks as though it is a first attempt of a new way to use the body to conceal explosives,&quot; she said. &quot;In the past it was a can of liquid explosive. Now they may be concealing the explosives on the human body.&quot; Kieran Daly, an aviation expert, said: &quot;The latest incident shows that would-be terrorists are having to resort to trying to get very small devices on board planes. Thanks to increased security, the sort of devices are now not big enough to actually bring down a plane.&quot; A security briefing obtained by ABC News in the US said that, following his arrest, Mutallab, who is under guard at a Michigan hospital, claimed to have been ordered by al-Qaida to blow up a plane over US soil. The briefing note stated: &quot;The subject is claiming to have extremist affiliation and that the device was acquired in Yemen, along with instructions as to when it should be used.&quot; Mutallab had a two-year visa allowing him to stay in the US until next June. According to his entry visa, he was flying from Nigeria to the US for a religious seminar. &quot;I would say we dropped the ball,&quot; said Peter King, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives homeland security committee, who claimed that although Mutallab was not on a &quot;no-fly&quot; list of suspected terrorists he was known to authorities. &quot;My understanding is\u2026 he does have al-Qaida connections, certainly extremist terrorist connections, and his name popped up pretty quickly.&quot; US investigators are focusing on whether the incident was part of a larger plot and are exploring Mutallab&apos;s links to known al-Qaida operatives in Yemen. The latest incident comes after a spate of domestic terrorism cases in the US sparked fears that terrorists linked to al-Qaida were stepping up their campaign on American soil. &quot;The urgency of striking the US homeland has been growing because of the escalation in Afghanistan and now in many other spots, such as Yemen, the Sahel and the predator strikes inside Pakistan,&quot; said a terrorism expert, Professor Walid Phares. &quot;They feel that by striking they will prompt a popular movement to put pressure on the [US] administration to cease the escalation. Some believe that the perception that the current administration is weaker may have also contributed to an al-Qaida higher push. But, regardless, striking America at home is a standing al-Qaida and jihadist strategic goal.&quot; Peter Hoekstra, the senior Republican on the House intelligence committee, said it was examining Mutallab&apos;s links with the radical Yemeni imam, Anwar al-Awlaki, who has inspired a number of terrorists. Awlaki had contacts with Major Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist who is accused of carrying out the massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in November in which 13 people were murdered. According to government officials, Awlaki was also the spiritual adviser to two of the 9/11 hijackers, Khalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, while he was an imam at a mosque in northern Virginia. The FBI investigated him in 1999 and 2000, believing him to be a possible procurement agent for Osama bin Laden. In Toronto, a terror cell watched videos of Awlaki at a makeshift training camp where an attack was planned on the Canadian parliament and prime minister. &quot;He&apos;s a star attraction as a recruiter to young Americans and Canadians,&quot; one former American intelligence official told the US media. This month, in an interview with Al Jazeera, Awlaki expressed surprise that the US military had failed to uncover Hasan&apos;s plan, to which he gave his backing. &quot;My support to the operation was because the operation brother Nidal carried out was a courageous one, and I endeavoured to explain my position regarding what happened because many Islamic organisations and preachers in the west condemned the operation,&quot; he said. Awlaki left the US and moved to Yemen in 2002 where he established an English-language website that has thousands of followers around the world. In January 2009, he published an online essay, 44 Ways to Support Jihad, in which he asserts that all Muslims must participate in jihad, whether in person, by funding mujahideen or by fighting the west. Concerns about his influence in the UK have been expressed by experts on community cohesion. In August, the Observer reported anger that Awlaki was due to speak via a video link at Kensington town hall. The broadcast was dropped after the local council stepped in. He has also been invited to give talks via video link at several London universities. &quot;Mutallab is the latest in a long list of terrorists [Awlaki] has inspired and encouraged,&quot; said Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens of the Centre for Social Cohesion. &quot;The preacher has long been a highly respected figure within a number of British university Islamic societies because, unlike most other radical preachers, Awlaki speaks English as a first language, and being born and raised in America has given him a good understanding of western culture. This makes him very appealing to young western Muslims.&quot; Meleagrou-Hitchens called for British universities to increase their vigilance. &quot;This incident should act as a wake-up call to university authorities,&quot; he said. &quot;It is crucial that they now accept the central role they must play in resisting extremists and preventing student groups from promoting hate preachers.&quot; The US has become increasingly concerned that Yemen is now a major al-Qaida training ground. Bordering Saudi Arabia and near the oil-rich nations of the Gulf, it was the scene of one of al-Qaida&apos;s biggest pre-9/11 attacks, the 2000 suicide bombing of the US destroyer Cole, which killed 17 US sailors. The country&apos;s government has little control outside the capital and has been involved in a fierce war against Shia rebels in the north. Fighters sympathetic to al-Qaida have fled war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan and used Yemen as a safe haven from where they carry out attacks in Saudi Arabia. Concerns that the country will become another Afghanistan has prompted the Pentagon to spend nearly $70m (\u00a344m) on military aid to Yemen this year, compared with none in 2008. Yemeni forces are being trained in counter-terrorism and the US is providing the country&apos;s military with intelligence. The fruits of this policy were on display this month when Yemeni jets carried out a dawn bombing in the province of Shabwa, in which scores of Yemeni and foreign al-Qaida operatives were said to have been killed, including Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the regional al-Qaida leader, and his deputy, Saeed al-Shihri, a former Guant\u00e1namo detainee. Initially it was thought Awlaki had been killed, but this has been denied by his family. Phares said: &quot;Al-Qaida has been operating for years in Yemen, without being confronted seriously by the government. It was only this year that President Ali Abdallah Saleh engaged the organisation in an all-out campaign. Al-Qaida has had many years to organise. That is what happens when governments wait too long before acting.&quot;", "sentences": ["Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit was carrying 290 passengers and crew who heard what was described as a &quot;balloon being popped&quot;.", "Mutallab, who had boarded a flight from Lagos, Nigeria, to Amsterdam&apos;s Schipol airport before transferring to the Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit, had burns on his leg.", "When Mutallab changed at Amsterdam for Detroit, he was apparently given additional screening, but not to a level that would have established he was carrying suspicious substances."], "title": "Passengers relive terror of Flight 253 as new threat emerges from al-Qaida", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/abdul-muttalab-flight-253-terrorist-al-qaida", "tags": ["World news", "Al-Qaida", "September 11 2001"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-27T00:10:01Z", "article": "On the basis that managerial positions only fall vacant because a team is in trouble, remedial work is invariably the first duty of the new appointee. Few teams are as troubled as Scotland at present, but it is encouraging that Craig Levein, nominated as successor to the discredited George Burley last week, has already identified the most pressing problem and formulated an appropriate course of action. In fact, Levein has to confront a situation uncomfortably similar to the one faced by Walter Smith when he followed Berti Vogts in December 2004. Then, as now, the national team under desperately unconvincing management had lost so much credibility that many players considered a call to the colours with the same trepidation they would a summons to court. Like Smith five years ago, Levein now considers his first priority to be the need to recreate a climate in which players once again want to turn up for international duty. Observers could sense that the desire had been all but extinguished among a number of players by the time Burley was dismissed last month, with the abysmal record of three victories from 14 games. While the reluctant Rangers striker Kris Boyd deserves no sympathy - he withdrew his services for no other reason than going into the huff over not being picked - it had become obvious early in Burley&apos;s tenure that he lacked the persuasiveness and authority that draws a positive response from players. Even Gordon Smith, the Scottish FA&apos;s chief executive who championed Burley at the time of his appointment, admitted the other day that the former Ipswich, Hearts and Southampton manager had been something of a worry from the opening match of what proved to be an abortive World Cup qualifying campaign. &quot;I think a lot of damage was done to George&apos;s reputation in that opening defeat by Macedonia in Skopje,&quot; said Smith. &quot;And it wasn&apos;t really undone by our victory in Iceland immediately after. And when that was followed by the scoreless draw against Norway in our first home match, it was clear then that a lot of people weren&apos;t very happy.&quot; The drinking session involving another two Rangers players, the midfielder and captain Barry Ferguson and goalkeeper Allan McGregor, at the team&apos;s hotel on their return from a 3-0 whipping by Holland in Amsterdam in March also undermined Burley&apos;s credibility. There was clearly nothing novel about Scottish players indulging to excess, but it was difficult to understand how a manager on top of his job could fail to know that two of his players, having been up all night, were still at the bar and making attention-grabbing noises as families were arriving for Sunday lunch. Levein immediately confirmed that a general pardon had been issued and that all eligible players would be considered for future selection. He also intimated that friendly matches would be kept to an absolute minimum as he sought to establish co-operation with club managers. &quot;I&apos;m only interested in one thing,&quot; said Levein. &quot;That is, when the big games come around, I&apos;ll have the best players available. I don&apos;t understand what friendlies do for you. It&apos;s different having one or two to prepare you for a tournament, but not at other times. &quot;Whether we win a friendly or lose one isn&apos;t important. My focus has to be on getting the best players to turn up when we play important games. I think Walter recognised the need for that when he started in this job and I think the need to make the national team worth playing for again applies now as well. &quot;I&apos;ll be telling club managers I won&apos;t be taking players away for unnecessary friendly matches where there&apos;s a risk of injury. I&apos;ve been in their position and I didn&apos;t like it when it happened to me. For example, we&apos;ve been offered a trip to Australia and New Zealand just before the World Cup, but we won&apos;t be going, because it would be counter-productive.&quot;", "sentences": ["And when that was followed by the scoreless draw against Norway in our first home match, it was clear then that a lot of people weren&apos;t very happy.&quot; The drinking session involving another two Rangers players, the midfielder and captain Barry Ferguson and goalkeeper Allan McGregor, at the team&apos;s hotel on their return from a 3-0 whipping by Holland in Amsterdam in March also undermined Burley&apos;s credibility."], "title": "Levein dumps friendlies to restore Scottish pride", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/27/scotlandfootballteam", "tags": ["Scotland", "Football", "Sport", "Craig Levein"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-27T00:26:16Z", "article": "It&apos;s already being dubbed &quot;the Amsterdam of the Rockies&quot; and an apr\u00e8s-ski spliff is likely to become almost as common as a beer when cannabis possession is legalised in the hip mountain town of Breckenridge, Colorado, on 1 January. Well known as a laid-back party resort characterised by baggy-trousered snowboarders and a vigorous happy hour, Breckenridge voted last month to relax marijuana laws. From New Year&apos;s Day there will be no criminal or civil penalties imposed on anyone carrying up to an ounce of marijuana \u2013 or the paraphernalia usually associated with it, such as long rolling papers, a small pipe or a bong. That also goes for tourists, in a resort popular with British visitors who flock there for the exciting ski slopes and the exuberant nightlife. &quot;I&apos;m already getting calls from people outside the state asking questions, such as &apos;Can I do it while I&apos;m skiing?&apos;, &apos;Can I bring it to my hotel room?&apos;, that kind of thing,&quot; said Kim Green, spokeswoman for the Breckenridge police department. The answer to the first question is no. The operators of the ski resort have made it clear that, while cannabis use may be decriminalised in the town, they are still able to ban it on the slopes under separate laws, and will come down heavily on anyone skiing while stoned. The answer to the hotel question, though, is potentially a yes, provided guests can get hold of the drug in the first place. And that could be tricky. It will remain illegal to buy, sell or grow cannabis and also to display or use it in public. That means no Amsterdam-style &quot;coffee shops&quot;, but the remaining restrictions in Breckenridge have not stopped campaigners making comparisons between the town and the Dutch capital. &quot;We&apos;re the second town in America after Denver to remove all penalties for marijuana possession and the first in history to remove all penalties for paraphernalia, and that&apos;s cutting-edge on a global basis,&quot; said Brian Vicente. He heads the pressure group Sensible Colorado, which is campaigning to make cannabis legal across the whole state. Pot is illegal in Colorado under state and federal law. In theory, the police could stop someone under state law. But they have given no indication that they will do so.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old from a powerful Nigerian banking family, who studied engineering at University College London, was restrained by other passengers while trying to ignite an explosive device attached to his body on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Last night he was charged with trying to destroy an American plane. A judge read the charges to Abdulmutallab in a conference room at the medical centre where he is receiving treatment for burns. Agents brought him into the room in a wheelchair, a blanket over his lap and wearing a green hospital robe. In an affidavit filed with the charge, passengers said Abdulmutallab had gone to the toilet on the plane for about 20 minutes and then returned to his seat, pulling a blanket over himself and saying that his stomach was upset. The FBI said initial checks showed the device contained pentaerythritol, the same explosive used by British &quot;shoe-bomber&quot; Richard Reid. He tried to blow up an airliner in 2001 using material hidden in his shoes. Yesterday MI5 was trying to establish whether Abdulmutallab had links to known Islamist groups in the UK. In May he was barred from returning to Britain when he attempted to apply for a new course at a bogus college. &quot;He was refused entry on grounds that he was applying to study at an educational establishment that we didn&apos;t consider to be genuine,&quot; said a Whitehall official. Scotland Yard confirmed it was liaising with American authorities as searches were carried out at properties in central London, including a student hall of residence and a flat in Belgravia. America has known for at least two years that Abdulmutallab could have terrorist ties as he is on a &quot;terrorist identities&quot; list of 550,000 names maintained by US authorities. However, he had not been placed on a no-flight list, a US law enforcement source said yesterday. After the incident Barack Obama issued an order for extra security on all planes going to America. US intelligence officials said that Abdulmutallab had claimed al-Qaida instructed him to detonate the device when the plane was over American soil. Officials are investigating the suspect&apos;s links with terrorists based in Yemen, a major stronghold for al-Qaida and home to the extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who regularly addresses British university Islamic societies via video links. Passengers on board Northwest Flight\u00a0253 told how they overpowered Abdulmutallab, who suffered serious burns while trying to ignite his device. The attempt was thwarted by film producer Jasper Schuringa, who hit Abdulmutallab, pulled the explosive device from between his legs, then ripped his clothes off to make sure there were no other bombs. The Dutchman then helped flight attendants restrain Abdulmutallab before returning to his own seat. Fellow passengers gave Schuringa a round of applause. Abdulmutallab &quot;didn&apos;t show any reaction to pain or any feeling of shock&quot; as the flames engulfed him, said another passenger, Melinda Dennis. Abdulmutallab is the son of the recently retired chairman of First Bank of Nigeria, Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, who was due to meet Nigerian security officials late yesterday. He said his son had left London to travel. &quot;I believe he might have been to Yemen, but we are investigating that,&quot; he said. Yesterday Britons travelling to the US were told their hand luggage allowance had been reduced to one item and all passengers were being body-searched. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: &quot;The US authorities have requested additional measures for US-bound flights.&quot; The incident has raised fresh questions about security screening at airports. The Dutch security service, NCTb, said it could not rule out the potential for dangerous items to pass through security, especially objects that &quot;current security technology cannot detect&quot;. &quot;Security is not 100% at airports anywhere,&quot; said aviation expert Chris Yates. &quot;The processes are relatively robust but we can&apos;t head off every single threat.&quot;", "sentences": ["Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old from a powerful Nigerian banking family, who studied engineering at University College London, was restrained by other passengers while trying to ignite an explosive device attached to his body on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit."], "title": "Airports raise global safety levels after terror attack on US jet is foiled", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/26/flight-253-terrorism-al-qaida", "tags": ["Al-Qaida", "Nigeria", "Barack Obama", "World news", "MI5", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-27T10:57:40Z", "article": "A former London student has been charged with attempting to blow up a transatlantic airliner carrying 278 passengers on Christmas Day. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian, was charged in hospital late last night with attempting to destroy the aircraft during its final approach to Detroit airport, the US justice department said. American prosecutors claim that Abdulmutallab, who finished an engineering course at University College London last year, had a device attached to his body when he boarded the plane in Amsterdam on Christmas Eve. He passed through the airport in transit after flying from Lagos. Extra security measures have been brought in for passengers flying from British airports to the US. Travellers can carry only one piece of hand luggage, including duty-free items, face a pat-down body search before boarding planes and will have to remain in their seats for the final hour before arrival in the US. Air Canada said its passengers would not be allowed access to carry-on baggage or to have any items on their laps during the last hour of the flight. British Airways advised passengers flying to the US to arrive at check-in with plenty of time to spare. Travellers to other destinations would not be affected. Abdulmutallab, the son of a wealthy Nigerian banker, is alleged to have set off the device as the flight approached Detroit airport. The device caused a fire that burned Abdulmutallab&apos;s legs. A preliminary FBI investigation found that the device contained an explosive known as PETN, or pentaerythritol. Agents recovered what appeared to be the remnants of a syringe found near Abdulmutallab&apos;s seat, which is thought to have been part of the device. &quot;Had this alleged plot to destroy an airplane been successful, scores of innocent people would have been killed or injured,&quot; said the US attorney general, Eric Holder. &quot;We will continue to investigate this matter vigorously, and we will use all measures available to our government to ensure that anyone responsible for this attempted attack is brought to justice.&quot; Abdulmutallab had been living in a mansion block in Mansfield Road, close to Oxford Street, London, while studying mechanical engineering between 2005 and last year. The block was cordoned off by police today. Abdulmutallab was barred from returning to Britain when he tried to obtain another student visa, this time using a bogus college, Whitehall sources said. But he was not on the US no-fly list. According to an affidavit, interviews with the passengers and crew of Northwest Airlines flight 253 revealed that before the incident Abdulmutallab went to the aircraft&apos;s bathroom for approximately 20 minutes. When he returned to his seat, he said he had an upset stomach and pulled a blanket over himself. Passengers then heard what were described as popping noises similar to the sound of firecrackers. Some reported seeing Abdulmutallab&apos;s trouser leg and the inner wall of the aircraft on fire. He was overpowered by passengers and crew who used blankets and fire extinguishers to put out the flames. The charges were read to Abdulmutallab in hospital, where he appeared in a medical gown and wheelchair. There will be a hearing on Monday at a federal court in Detroit, and bail will not be considered until a separate hearing on 8 January. Citing US officials, the Wall Street Journal said the Nigerian told investigators that al-Qaida operatives in Yemen had given him the device and told him how to detonate it. Nigeria&apos;s This Day newspaper cited family members as saying that the suspect&apos;s father, Umaru Mutallab, the retired chairman of First Bank in Nigeria, has been uncomfortable with his son&apos;s &quot;extreme religious views&quot; and had reported him to the US embassy and Nigerian security agencies six months ago. The US government created a record on Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab last month in the intelligence community&apos;s central repository of information for known and suspected international terrorists, but there was not enough negative data to place him on a no-fly list, a US official said. Jennifer Allen, 41, said passengers boarding the same flight in Amsterdam on Saturday were frisked and that she was asked to remove a ball of tissue from a pocket. &quot;It was a thorough pat-down. It wasn&apos;t a quick rub,&quot; she said. The Dutch counterterrorism agency, NCTb, said Abdulmutallab had boarded a KLM flight from Lagos to Amsterdam, and passed through a security checkpoint while in transit at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Gordon Brown said the British government would take &quot;whatever action was necessary&quot; to protect airline passengers.

And the colourless crystals of the substance, PETN or pentaerythritol trinitrate, are hard to detect if carried in a sealed container. Richard Reid, the &quot;shoe bomber&quot;, tried to set off a PETN device \u2013 on an American Airlines jet to Miami in 2001 \u2013 and this summer a man tried to assassinate a member of the Saudi royal family after evading security detectors by hiding a PETN-based bomb inside his body. &quot;If you can lay your hands on a reliable source, it would be the explosive of choice,&quot; said Hans Michels, an explosives expert at Imperial College, London. A little more than 100g of PETN could destroy a car. The device allegedly used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab involved a syringe and a soft plastic container filled, reportedly, with 80g of PETN. The remnants of the bomb are being analysed in an FBI laboratory. PETN is relatively stable and is detonated either by heat or a shockwave. It is possible that the suspect used a syringe that was converted into an electrical detonator, but more likely the syringe was filled with nitroglycerin. Abdulmutallab was in a window seat, 19A, and allegedly had the device strapped to his left leg, against the body of the plane. The idea was almost certainly to blow a hole at much higher altitude, so that the decompression would tear the aircraft apart. &quot;There was almost certainly a failure between the primary and the main charge that meant the PETN did not fully detonate. If it had, the plane might have limped home because it was already quite low,&quot; Michels said. If the syringe used a liquid detonator, such as nitroglycerin, the device would have been extremely hard to detect through the usual airport security measures. Abdulmutallab cleared security in Lagos and Amsterdam after passing through a metal detector and having had x-rays of his hand-luggage. Michels said that even more advanced security measures, such as machines that &quot;sniff&quot; passengers for explosives or analyse swabs of their clothes and belongings, might not have spotted the device.", "sentences": ["Abdulmutallab cleared security in Lagos and Amsterdam after passing through a metal detector and having had x-rays of his hand-luggage."], "title": "PETN - hard to detect and just 100g can destroy a car", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/petn-pentaerythritol-trinitrate-explosive", "tags": ["US news", "Science", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-28T00:05:25Z", "article": "Ever since 9/11, the west has been haunted by the spectre of a repeat. On Christmas Day, the date surely not chosen at random, that second attack very nearly succeeded. Only the combination of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab&apos;s fumbling and the bravery of the passengers and crew of Northwest 253 foiled the attempt to bring down the Airbus A330 and its 278 passengers on the descent into Detroit. If the bomber had succeeded, he would have achieved the sum of all post-9/11 fears. The consequences would have been prodigious. Those on board NW253 are not the only ones who have had a very narrow escape indeed. Nevertheless, the most striking difference between 9/11 and the Christmas plot is that the former was carried out inside US borders while the latter \u2013 like a succession of other operations since 9/11 \u2013 was not. The inference is that the terrorists, whether &quot;al-Qaida&quot; or not, are currently unable to mount operations within the US and are restricted to attacks on the US launched from abroad. The terrorists&apos; chosen mode of operation thus diminishes their ability to portray themselves as purely anti-American. Increasingly they make clear that they are indiscriminately at war with the world. As it is, the world now faces the still immense question: how did Abdulmutallab get so close? The principal answer is that the physical security measures of the airline industry were not up to it. Abdulmutallab was able to carry sufficient quantities of PETN, a well-known military explosive, on to the plane without security checks revealing what he was up to. Airport security at Lagos and Amsterdam each failed. New restrictions on passengers have already been introduced \u2013 baggage restrictions, more intimate searches, controls over in-flight passenger movement among them. Others are now certain to follow. The December predicament of the struggling airlines and their long-suffering passengers, which was already bad enough due to recession, strikes and bad weather, suddenly got a whole lot worse. Who would fly to America now, if they do not have to? But Abdulmutallab slipped the net of the professional terrorist watchers too. This latest rich-boy terrorist \u2013 echoes of Bin Laden \u2013 had been known to the authorities for two years. He is said to have been on a list of more than half a million people with links to radical Islamist terror groups. Yet none of these authorities had much clue how close Abdulmutallab&apos;s links now were, let alone what he could come within seconds of accomplishing. With hindsight, the watchers were not sharp enough. Their databases were not good enough. This surveillance regime must be improved, where practicable and proportionate. But this is not the first time that a bomber has emerged out of left-field. The same thing happened in the 7/7 attacks in London, in the botched car bombings of 2007, and on 9/11 itself. The latest plot confirms there are more people out there trying to terrorise westerners than the strongest state in a free society can ever entirely predict or control. When he was overpowered, Abdulmutallab was said by witnesses to be &quot;screaming about Afghanistan&quot;. Yet it would be a too convenient simplification to see this attack as some sort of act of revenge for that war. Abdulmutallab&apos;s life history, as it is now emerging, seems to be much more driven by exposure to manichean radical Islamism in Nigeria, Britain and, in particular, Yemen. The explosive chemicals and the syringe which he used on NW253 were sewn into his underclothing in Yemen. The methods used in Friday&apos;s attempted attack have echoes of a failed Yemeni-based suicide attack on Prince Muhammad, the head of Saudi counterterrorism operations, in August. The Christmas airliner bomb plot did not take place because of western policy in Afghanistan.

Scotland Yard and MI5 want to establish how Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was radicalised and by whom, and whether he had accomplices in the UK or the Arabian peninsula. He has told US officials that he met al-Qaida operatives in Yemen who gave him the device which almost brought down Northwest Airlines flight 253 to Detroit and taught him how to use it. Yesterday it emerged that after attending university in London, the 23-year-old had dropped out of a postgraduate business course in Dubai, telling his family he had gone to Yemen to study Islam. He then cut off contact with them. Repercussions from the failed Christmas Day plot continued yesterday, with Barack Obama ordering a review of US security as politicians demanded to know how the British-educated Nigerian was able to get on the plane after his father, a wealthy banker, had been concerned enough to warn US diplomats that his son might be a security risk. Obama&apos;s spokesman said he was seeking answers to why Abdulmutallab was placed on the least urgent of three US watchlists of possible terrorism suspects, rather than a higher category which would have prevented him flying. Robert Gibbs told ABC News: &quot;The president has asked that a review be undertaken to ensure that any information gets to where it needs to go, to the people making the decisions. The president wants to review some of these procedures and see if they need to be updated.&quot; Passengers on transatlantic flights faced delays of several hours at the weekend as extra security checks were rushed through, with people heading for the US being frisked and having hand luggage searched. Some reported having Christmas presents unwrapped. The heightened state of security was underlined last night when the crew of another Amsterdam to Detroit flight, with the same flight number, reported an emergency incident after an &quot;unruly&quot; Nigerian man raised concerns by spending an unusually long time in the plane&apos;s bathroom. He was detained by the FBI after the plane landed, but turned out to have a &quot;legitimate illness,&quot; officials from the department of homeland security said. Some new details about Abdulmutallab became clear yesterday. \u2022 Whitehall officials confirmed that in May they had turned down his application to return to the UK to study, although this was because his chosen college was considered a bogus institution, rather than due to fears that he might be a terrorist. \u2022 They said he did not come to MI5&apos;s attention during his three years studying engineering at University College London, though police were continuing yesterday to search his luxury apartment in a central London mansion block. \u2022 Abdulmutallab&apos;s father, a former government minister who recently retired as chairman of the First Bank group in Nigeria, was yesterday still speaking to investigators. He had been so concerned at his son&apos;s views that several months ago he reported his fears to the Nigerian security services and the US embassy. \u2022 Al-Qaida activists in Yemen referred in a video recorded on 21 December to &quot;a bomb to hit the enemies of God&quot;. It was not known if this was a general warning, or indicated a clear Yemeni link. Abdulmutalab, who has been charged with trying to blow up the Northwest Airlines plane, was transferred to a federal prison near Detroit, his lawyer said. In the US, Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate&apos;s homeland security committee, said he believed that the fact Abdulmutallab was even allowed to board a flight from Lagos to the US, via Amsterdam, amounted to an intelligence failure. &quot;I am troubled by several aspects of this case, including how the suspect escaped the attention of the state department and law enforcers when his father apparently reported concerns about his son&apos;s extremist behaviour to the US embassy in Nigeria, how the suspect managed to retain a US visa after such complaints, and why he was not recognised as someone who reportedly was named in the terrorist database,&quot; he said. The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said: &quot;How does a person on a terrorism watchlist get a US visa? It&apos;s amazing to me that an individual like this, who&apos;s sending out so many signals, could end up getting on a plane going to the US.&quot; The homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said that while Abdulmutallab was on a general watchlist, there had not been sufficient information to move him to a much shorter list of those barred from flying. &quot;The issue [is], was there enough information to move him to the more specific list which would require additional examination, or indeed being on no-fly status?&quot; she said. &quot;You need information that is specific and credible if you&apos;re going to bar someone from air travel. He was on a general list of over half a million people, but there was not the kind of credible information that would move him up that list. Now one of the things we&apos;ll be doing is looking at those watchlist procedures.&quot; Napolitano said there was no indication that Abdulmutallab was &quot;part of anything larger&quot; in terms of impending attacks. More details emerged yesterday about the apparent radicalisation of a young man born into privilege in the Muslim-dominated north of Nigeria. He attended an elite British-curriculum boarding school in the capital of Togo, Lom\u00e9. A former teacher of his recalled the then-teenager expressing sympathy for the Taliban after the September 11 attacks in 2001. However, a friend from that time, James Ticknell, told the Guardian that, while Abdulmutallab had been a devout Muslim, he was not in the least militant. &quot;He was very decent and gentle, in fact a pacifist. His views on religion were very mainstream. When I realised the man on the plane was him, I felt disbelief.&quot; Nigeria&apos;s civil aviation authority said last night that he bought his round-trip ticket from Lagos to Detroit via Amsterdam at a KLM office in Ghana&apos;s capital, Accra, on 16 December, with a planned return of 8 January. He paid the \u00a31,775 fare in cash. Before the flight departed on Thursday, he checked in as normal, taking only a carry-on bag. Security at Lagos had been found adequate by US authorities. Under EU rules, Abdulmutallab would have been checked again as a transfer passenger at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Dutch officials say these checks took place and were &quot;well performed&quot;. Aviation security experts said that scanners designed to pick up explosives rather than metal exist, but are not in widespread use. The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, said last night that he wanted to thank air passengers for their patience. &quot;I am sure they will understand the extra precautions are being taken for their own protection,&quot; he added.

All passengers leaving UK airports for the US were being frisked and their hand luggage manually searched at the gate, leading to typical delays of two to four hours. Security staff were unwrapping Christmas presents found in hand luggage, while passengers were warned they would not be allowed to leave their seats in the final hour before arrival at US airports. The restrictions, which include taking only one piece of hand luggage, were criticised by aviation security experts as of little value, while industry analysts warned that airlines would be unable to sustain the costs if schedules were hit by long-term delays. British Airways was advising passengers to arrive at the gate early, and to check the status of their flights before leaving home. The airline, already reeling from threatened strike action and snow, said it had no idea how long the restrictions would be in place. A spokesman said: &quot;We are experiencing delays due to the secondary screening process, which is time consuming. Passengers should check in at the normal time but arrive at the gate early with only one piece of hand luggage.&quot; Last night the transport minister, Lord Adonis, said: &quot;The latest report I have is that flights are leaving for America, and the delays passengers are experiencing are largely reducing. Passengers should continue to check with their airlines to get the most up to date information.&quot; Aviation analysts said the additional restrictions were of little value. &quot;To tell people they cannot stand up one hour before the end of the flight or have access to their hand luggage is ridiculous. &quot;If you were a real terrorist you&apos;d have done it beforehand anyway, over the sea,&quot; said Philip Baum, an aviation security specialist. &quot;These are short-sighted measures \u2026 They are an attempt to be seen to do something, but they are allowing terrorists a hollow victory by disrupting our lives.&quot; Norman Shanks, a former head of security at BAA, which runs Heathrow, said that the secondary searches simply repeated what should have already been done. &quot;This will be a big concern to the industry and everyone will be wary that the additional searches will do little other than cause delays. &quot;Patting down passengers is very tiring for staff when there are 300 people on a flight. Limiting carry-on bags is simply an attempt to control the amount of baggage that needs to be searched, but is not a long-term option. I am not sure the 60-minute rule achieves anything.&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was able to fly undetected from Lagos in Nigeria to Detroit, via Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, because airport metal detectors do not pick up explosives, Baum said. Two types of technology exist to detect explosives, but they are not in general use. &quot;The technology is out there, but not used, due to capability and cost issues. They can see under people&apos;s clothes, and are seen as being intrusive,&quot; said Baum. &quot;The machines cost 10 times the price of a metal detector. They take longer to scan people, so slow everything down. &quot;I am not saying everyone should be screened, but passengers should be profiled. Abdulmutallab bought his ticket with cash in Ghana for a flight that left from Nigeria. He had a two-week trip, but had no check-in luggage. That should have triggered some alarm.&quot; Many in the industry have long called for profiling of passengers to detect potential terrorists. But others fear that innocent travellers will be selected for enhanced checks based on race, religion and ethnicity, making profiling a controversial issue. Shanks said that Abdulmutallab would have been subject to internationally accepted standards of checks at Lagos, not unlike those at British airports. EU rules mean that as a transfer passenger in Amsterdam he would have undergone the same checks as travellers starting n the Netherlands. Schiphol is seen as having stringent security. &quot;Schiphol is one of the few airports in Europe that has 3mm wave imaging detectors. It has substantial stocks of them but not enough to have them at every gate or check every passenger. So one assumes that he wasn&apos;t picked out,&quot; said Shanks. BA said it was too early to know how much the new security checks could cost, but another analyst, John Strickland, warned the disruption would be expensive if it was long lasting. &quot;Airlines cannot sustain that level of dislocation to their aircraft long term.&quot;", "sentences": ["I am not sure the 60-minute rule achieves anything.&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was able to fly undetected from Lagos in Nigeria to Detroit, via Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, because airport metal detectors do not pick up explosives, Baum said.", "EU rules mean that as a transfer passenger in Amsterdam he would have undergone the same checks as travellers starting n the Netherlands."], "title": "Air passengers face security delays after bomb attempt", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/airport-security-delays", "tags": ["Air transport", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "World news", "UK news", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-28T11:23:02Z", "article": "The US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, conceded today that the aviation security system failed when a young man on a watchlist with a US visa in his pocket and a powerful explosive hidden on his body was allowed to board a fight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The Obama administration has ordered investigations into the two areas of aviation security \u2013 how travellers are placed on watch lists and how passengers are screened \u2013 as critics questioned how the 23-year-old Nigerian man charged in the airliner attack was allowed to board the flight on Christmas Day. President Barack Obama is expected to make a statement later today from Hawaii, where he is on holiday. &quot;Our system did not work in this instance,&quot; Napolitano said on NBC television&apos;s Today show. &quot;No one is happy or satisfied with that. An extensive review is under way.&quot; Yesterday Napolitano said the security system had worked, but she said today that her words had been taken out of context. Billions of dollars have been spent on aviation security since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, much of it on training and equipment that some security experts say could have detected the explosive device that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of hiding on his body as he boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253. Investigators on both sides of the Atlantic are continuing to check Abdulmutallab&apos;s background, with the Dutch military police investigating the possibility that he had an accomplice. Scotland Yard and MI5 want to establish how he was radicalised and by whom, and whether he had accomplices in the UK or the Arabian peninsula. He has told US officials that he met al-Qaida operatives in Yemen who gave him the explosive device and taught him how to use it. Britain&apos;s home secretary, Alan Johnson, said he suspected Abdulmutallab may not have been working alone. &quot;We don&apos;t know yet whether it was a single-handed plot or [there were] other people behind it \u2013 I suspect it&apos;s the latter rather than the former,&quot; he told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme. Johnson also confirmed that Abdulmutallab had been placed on a UK watch list after being refused a student visa in May for a bogus course. &quot;If you are on our watch list then you do not come into this country,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;You can come through this country if you are in transit to another country but you cannot come into this country.&quot; Abdulmutallab was also on a US database of people suspected of terrorist ties in November, but there was not enough information about his activities to place him on a watchlist that could have kept him from flying. Johnson said the issues being studied by British police and security services included &quot;what happened when he was in this country, was he radicalised in this country, was there any association with whoever may have been behind this plot?&quot; Suspected al-Qaida activists in Yemen referred in a video recorded on 21 December to &quot;a bomb to hit the enemies of God&quot;. It was not known if this was a general warning, or indicated a clear Yemeni link. A US couple on Flight 253 said they saw a tall, well-dressed man aged about 50 with Abdulmutallab at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport before he boarded the plane. Kurt and Lori Haskell claimed the man spoke for Abdulmutallab and attempted to get him aboard the flight without a passport, the Reuters news agency reported. A Dutch military police spokesman said: &quot;At this moment we have no information on whether there was another guy. We are checking all clues and information we get.&quot; The spokesman added that the military police and the Dutch counter-terrorism agency NCTb were reviewing CCTV recordings to check out the accomplice story. Abdulmutallab&apos;s family said today that they had contacted international security services to raise concerns that he had been radicalised by Islamist extremists. They said they became concerned after he disappeared about two months ago and cut off contact. In a statement, the family said: &quot;The disappearance and cessation of communication which got his mother and father concerned \u2026 are completely out of character and a very recent development.&quot; Abdulmutallab&apos;s father, Umaru Mutallab, a former Nigerian government minister who recently retired as chairman of the First Bank group, &quot;reported the matter to Nigerian security agencies about two months ago and to some foreign security agencies about a month and a half ago&quot;, the statement said. The family added: &quot;It was while we were waiting for the outcome of their investigation that we arose to the shocking news of that day.&quot; The statement did not say where Abdulmutallab had been, although it emerged yesterday that he had dropped out of a postgraduate business course in Dubai, telling his family he had gone to Yemen to study Islam. It was then that he cut off contact with them, his family said. Abdulmutallab was charged in hospital with trying to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam with almost 300 people on board. The former student, who studied mechanical engineering at University College London between 2005 and 2008, was also charged with placing a destructive device on the plane. Scotland Yard detectives continued to search the former UCL student&apos;s luxury flat in a central London mansion block. Security sources said the police and MI5 were diverting extra staff and resources to the investigation in order to establish the significance of the &quot;London link&quot;. Obama has ordered a fresh review of US security, including airport screening, after it emerged that the American authorities had been warned about Abdulmutallab&apos;s extremist views by Mutallab. Obama&apos;s spokesman said the president was seeking answers to why Abdulmutallab was placed on the least urgent of three US terror watchlists, rather than a higher category which would have prevented the Nigerian national flying. In Britain passengers waiting to fly to America were hit by delays of up to three and a half hours at the weekend because of extra security checks, with people being frisked and having hand luggage searched. Some passengers reported having Christmas presents unwrapped, while others travelling to the US have reportedly also seen bans on the use of electronic equipment, including laptops and MP3 players, and in some cases in-flight entertainment has also been disrupted. People flying to the US were advised to arrive early and carry just one piece of hand luggage. Whitehall officials said Abdulmutallab had not come to MI5&apos;s attention during his three years studying in London. One of his former teachers spoke of his shock, saying the suspect&apos;s nickname was once &quot;the pope&quot;, and the university spoke of its &quot;sadness&quot;. Malcolm Grant, a provost at the university, said: &quot;UCL is deeply saddened by these events. This is a university founded on equality and religious tolerance, and strongly committed today to respect for human rights. We are co-operating fully with the authorities in their further investigations.&quot; The heightened state of security was underlined last night when the crew of another Amsterdam to Detroit plane, with the same flight number, reported an emergency incident after an &quot;unruly&quot; Nigerian man raised concerns by spending an unusually long time in the aircraft&apos;s toilet. He was detained by the FBI after the plane landed but turned out to have a &quot;legitimate illness&quot;, officials from the department of homeland security said. More details emerged yesterday about the apparent radicalisation of Abdulmutallab, a young man born into privilege in the Muslim-dominated north of Nigeria. He attended an elite British-curriculum boarding school in Lom\u00e9, the capital of Togo. A former teacher of his recalled the then teenager expressing sympathy for the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. However, a friend from that time, James Ticknell, told the Guardian that while Abdulmutallab had been a devout Muslim, he was not in the least militant. &quot;He was very decent and gentle, in fact a pacifist. His views on religion were very mainstream. When I realised the man on the plane was him, I felt disbelief,&quot; said Ticknell.", "sentences": ["The US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, conceded today that the aviation security system failed when a young man on a watchlist with a US visa in his pocket and a powerful explosive hidden on his body was allowed to board a fight from Amsterdam to Detroit.", "A US couple on Flight 253 said they saw a tall, well-dressed man aged about 50 with Abdulmutallab at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport before he boarded the plane.", "Abdulmutallab was charged in hospital with trying to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam with almost 300 people on board.", "We are co-operating fully with the authorities in their further investigations.&quot; The heightened state of security was underlined last night when the crew of another Amsterdam to Detroit plane, with the same flight number, reported an emergency incident after an &quot;unruly&quot; Nigerian man raised concerns by spending an unusually long time in the aircraft&apos;s toilet."], "title": "US says aviation security system failed in Flight 253 case", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/28/plane-bomber-family-warning", "tags": ["Al-Qaida", "Air transport", "US news", "Nigeria", "Togo", "Barack Obama", "Airline industry", "Yemen", "World news", "UK news", "Travel", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-28T21:30:56Z", "article": "Barack Obama yesterday said the US would &quot;not rest&quot; until it has called to account those behind the attempted suicide bombing of a transatlantic flight over Detroit on Christmas Day. The president said he has ordered new security measures and a review of the failings that allowed a Nigerian Muslim, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, to carry explosives onto a US-bound flight. But Obama added that America would do more than put up additional defences; he had directed his national security officials to &quot;keep up the pressure on those who would attack our country&quot;. &quot;Those who would slaughter innocent men, women and children must know that the United States will do more than simply strengthen our defences,&quot; he said. &quot;We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle and to defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia; or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the US homeland.&quot; The president, speaking publicly for the first time since the failed attack, said he had ordered enhanced security screening and added more federal air marshalls to international flights. He also ordered a review of the watch list of known and suspected terrorists to review whether it is effective and, more specifically, how it was that Abdulmutallab could board a flight to Detroit even though his own father had reported him to American consular officials in Nigeria as a security risk. Obama&apos;s comments came after Al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula said it was behind the failed bombing. A statement posted on a website said the attack was in retaliation for recent raids on its militants in Yemen which it said had been carried out by US jets and had caused civilian deaths. &quot;We tell the American people that since you support the leaders who kill our women and children ... we have come to slaughter you (and) will strike you with no previous (warning); our vengeance is near,&quot; the statement said. According to ABC news Abdulmutallab has told his interrogators he had been one of many and there were more &quot;just like him&quot; being trained to attack the west. Last night ABC released a picture of Abdulmutallab&apos;s burned underwear, said to contain traces of explosives. British officials expressed fears that a number of Britons had travelled to Yemen to train at secret terrorist camps. Senior UK counter-terrorism officials said MI5 was aware of several nationals and British residents who had trained in Yemen&apos;s &quot;ungoverned spaces&quot; in the past year. The US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, yesterday sought to head off accusations of complacency by acknowledging that security and intelligence failures allowed Abdulmutallab to come close to blowing up the Northwest Airlines flight over Detroit. She conceded that despite billions of dollars spent on aviation security over the past decade, the US system failed to respond to alerts about Abdulmutallab, and failed to stop him getting any further when airport security in Nigeria and Amsterdam did not detect his bomb. &quot;Our system did not work in this instance,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;No one is happy or satisfied with that. An extensive review is under way.&quot; On Sunday, Napolitano had come in for heavy criticism after saying that &quot;the [US side of the] system has worked really very, very smoothly over the course of the past several days&quot;. Republican members of Congress questioned why US officials had failed to follow up warnings from Abdulmutallab&apos;s father, Umaru Mutallab, that his son was potentially dangerous. Peter King, the top Republican on the House of Representatives homeland security committee, said airport security &quot;failed in every respect&quot;. Susan Collins, another senior Republican, demanded to know why the attempted bomber&apos;s US visa was not revoked after the warning from his father. After Mutallab, a banker and former cabinet minister, alerted the US embassy in Abuja about his son&apos;s views, Abdulmutallab&apos;s file was marked for attention should he apply for another visa. But consular officials did not revoke the two-year multiple entry visa issued at the US embassy in London in 2008. He was added to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide) watch list, which contains 550,000 names. But he was not put on the much shorter no-fly list. Abdulmutallab has been charged with attempting to blow up an airliner, a crime with a maximum of 20 years in prison, but is likely to face additional charges. A court hearing on a request to obtain DNA samples from Abdulmutallab was postponed until 8 January. No reason was given. He is now in prison after being released from a hospital near Detroit after treatment for burns to his leg which he suffered when part of his bomb ignited. Although some security measures have been strengthened, the authorities have relaxed orders to prevent passengers from having blankets or personal possessions on their laps during the last hour of a flight to the US, and to disable electronic maps that tracked the flight path on in-seat television screens; these, and some other restrictions, will now be a matter for individual airlines to decide.", "sentences": ["She conceded that despite billions of dollars spent on aviation security over the past decade, the US system failed to respond to alerts about Abdulmutallab, and failed to stop him getting any further when airport security in Nigeria and Amsterdam did not detect his bomb."], "title": "Barack Obama pledges to take fight to terrorists behind jet bomb plot", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/28/us-failure-intelligence-plane-bomber", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "US national security", "Air transport", "US news", "Nigeria", "World news", "Al-Qaida", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-28T23:30:00Z", "article": "Edwin van der Sar has been given compassionate leave by Manchester United to be with his wife after she suffered a brain haemorrhage.

She has been in hospital ever since and United have told Van der Sar to take as long as he needs before returning to play in goal. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has been keeping in regular contact with the former Holland international and the club have explained his absence from their Christmas programme as being because he is still troubled by the knee injury that had kept him out since the 3-0 defeat of Everton on 21 November. In the meantime, Ferguson will choose between Tomasz Kuszczak and Ben Foster to compete for the vacant goalkeeping slot in place of the man Ferguson recently described as rivalling Peter Schmeichel to be recognised as the greatest goalkeeper in the club&apos;s history.

Ferguson prides himself on looking after his players in emergency situations and has stressed to Van der Sar that there is no pressure on him to return before he is ready. The manager said: &quot;Annemarie had a problem when they were over in Holland about a week ago. She was admitted to hospital and that&apos;s the best place to be until they examine her thoroughly to get to the root of it.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. Photograph: US marshals/EPA    The Dutch government today announced that all passengers to the US would have to go through full-body scanners once they have been installed at Schiphol airport in three weeks. The Dutch interior minister, Guusje Ter Horst, said the authorities had wanted to introduce the scanners for passengers travelling to the US before the attempted bombing. However, the devices were not installed because US authorities wanted them to be used on flights to all destinations. Ter Horst said the attempted plane bombing had been prepared professionally but executed amateurishly. &quot;If the detonation had been done in a correct manner, then part of the plane would have exploded and a hole in the plane would have caused a great tragedy,&quot; she said. A preliminary Dutch investigation said all security checks were correctly carried out in Amsterdam before the flight left, and US authorities cleared the passenger list that included Abdulmutallab. Holst said the Dutch authorities did not know that Abdulmutallab \u2013 who was travelling on a Nigerian passport \u2013 was on a US security list. Ter Horst said Abdulmutallab apparently assembled the explosive device, including 80 grams of the military explosive PETN, in the aircraft toilet and had planned to detonate it using a syringe of chemicals. &quot;It is not exaggerating to say the world has escaped a disaster,&quot; Ter Horst said. Meanwhile, officials in Somalia said a Somali tried to board a commercial airliner in Mogadishu last month with powdered chemicals, liquid and a syringe that could have caused an explosion. Abdulahi Hassan Barise, a police spokesman, said the suspect was arrested before the 13 November Daallo Airlines flight left. It was scheduled to travel from Mogadishu to the northern Somali city of Hargeisa, then to Djibouti and Dubai. Two international officials in Nairobi said the incident was similar to the attempted Detroit attack. US officials said they were aware of the incident and were investigating any possible links with the Detroit incident. A senior official told the New York Times Obama had been briefed that the US had information that would have amounted to a clear warning if shared among agencies. This included details on where Abdulmutallab had been and what some of his plans were. &quot;When our government has information on a known extremist and that information is not shared and acted upon as it should have been so that this extremist boards a plane with dangerous explosives that could cost nearly 300 lives, a systemic failure has occurred and I consider that totally unacceptable,&quot; the US president said. The New York Times reported that although US agencies did not have the name of the 23-year-old Nigerian, they could have found it by looking at information about him that was already available. Abdulmutallab has been charged with trying to blow up the flight to Detroit on Christmas Day. &quot;Had this critical information been shared, it could have been compiled with other intelligence and a fuller, clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged,&quot; Obama said. &quot;The warning signs would have triggered red flags and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America.&quot; Senior US officials told the Associated Press that the intelligence authorities were looking at conversations between Abdulmutallab and at least one al-Qaida member. The unnamed officials said the conversations were vague or coded, but US intelligence believed that, in hindsight, they may have been referring to the attempted attack in Detroit. Obama&apos;s homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser, John Brennan, is due to present the president with an early report based on recommendations and summaries from across the government. Yemen, meanwhile, has warned of hundreds more militants on its soil planning to attack the west, and appealed for help to stop them. Yemen&apos;s foreign minister, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, told the BBC that up to 300 extremists, backed by al-Qaida, were waiting to follow the example of Abdulmutallab. &quot;Of course there are a number of al-Qaida operatives in Yemen, and some of their leaders,&quot; he said. &quot;We realise this danger. They may actually plan attacks like the one we have just had in Detroit ... I can&apos;t give you exact figures. There are maybe hundreds of them \u2013 200, 300.&quot; The minister said Britain, the US and other western nations could do &quot;a lot&quot; to improve Yemen&apos;s response to militants on its own soil and it was the &quot;responsibility&quot; of developed countries with strong intelligence capabilities to warn it about the movements of terror suspects. &quot;We have to expand our counter-terrorism units and this means providing them with the necessary training, military equipment, ways of transportation \u2013 we are very short of helicopters,&quot; he said, claiming the US, UK and EU could do more. &quot;There is support, but I must say it is inadequate.&quot; Yemen&apos;s government confirmed that Abdulmutallab had visited the country twice in recent years \u2013 for several months in 2005 and again from August until shortly before his failed attempt to bring down the airliner. He has told FBI interrogators that he was trained in Yemen by al-Qaida. Abdulmutallab described Yemen as &quot;great&quot; in internet postings made after he visited the country for the first time to learn Arabic while he was a boarder at an elite international school in west Africa.", "sentences": ["The US president interrupted a holiday in Hawaii to speak bluntly about the lapses that allowed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to board a Northwest Airlines flight to the US in Amsterdam.", "A preliminary Dutch investigation said all security checks were correctly carried out in Amsterdam before the flight left, and US authorities cleared the passenger list that included Abdulmutallab."], "title": "Obama condemns intelligence failings over Abdulmutallab", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/30/obama-intelligence-abdulmutallab-detroit-plane", "tags": ["US national security", "Al-Qaida", "US news", "Nigeria", "Yemen", "World news", "Africa", "Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab", "Amsterdam Airport Schiphol"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-30T18:22:27Z", "article": "The US blocked Dutch attempts to install full-body scanners for passengers travelling to the US before the failed suicide bombing of a transatlantic flight on Christmas Day, the Dutch interior minister said today.

American officials say intelligence efforts are focused on identifying and tracking down those who plotted to put Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on the plane with enough explosive in his underwear to bring down the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam. But they warn that finding those responsible is unlikely to be swift and say that identifying other &quot;high-value&quot; al-Qaida targets for retaliatory attack would also be a priority. &quot;First we have to find out who put Abdulmutallab on the plane with the bomb,&quot; said a US official working alongside intelligence organisations. &quot;He&apos;s providing some leads and we&apos;re not dealing with an unknown quantity here. We&apos;ve been watching and listening to what goes on in Yemen and we may have pieces of the puzzle already and just need to fit it together. &quot;If and when we identify them then we plan how to deal with them. Who they are is one thing, where they are is another.If they&apos;re still in Yemen and we can get a lock on them then it won&apos;t be too difficult to know what to do. But they know who they are and won&apos;t be standing out. After that we can move with the president&apos;s authorisation. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much doubt that authorisation will be forthcoming, but no one should think all of this is going to happen overnight.&quot; The official acknowledged that there was likely to be political and public pressure on Barack Obama to strike back at al-Qaida, particularly with Republican opponents breaking with the usual solidarity on national security issues to accuse him of weakness and making America vulnerable to attack. &quot;The people we want are the ones who put Abdulmutallab on the plane. Until we can get them there are other high-value targets that will make the point that attacking America does not go unpunished,&quot; said the official. But given the regular attacks against al-Qaida in Yemen, these may have a greater impact on American public opinion than on the extremist group. The US has been conducting a covert assault with drone attacks on al-Qaida bases for about a year, while CIA agents inside the country help direct ground operations. American special forces have been training the Yemeni military and may have been involved in raids. General David Petraeus, the American regional commander, and John Brennan, the president&apos;s counterterrorism adviser, both visited Yemen this year. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate&apos;s homeland security committee, who visited Yemen in August, described the country this week as a focus of the assault on al-Qaida. &quot;Yemen now becomes one of the centres of that fight. We have a growing presence there \u2013 and we have to \u2013 of special operations, Green Berets, intelligence,&quot; he said. Yesterday, Yemeni forces targeted Nasser Ahmed al-Ahdal, a former prisoner released after renouncing violence but believed to have renewed links to al-Qaida. One man was injured and captured but Ahdal and two others escaped. Several al-Qaida members killed in raids by Yemeni forces in the past fortnight had been released or had escaped from prison. Others who have left jail to rejoin the fight include Nasser al-Wahayshi, the Yemeni leader of al-Qaida, who escaped along with 22 others from prison in Yemen in 2006. His deputy, Saeed al-Shihri, joined al-Qaida in Yemen last year after being released to Saudi Arabia from Guant\u00e1namo. While intelligence officials plan how to hit back abroad, they are under pressure at home after Obama blamed intelligence failings for Abdulmutallab being allowed to board a plane to the US. The president has ordered that a preliminary report be delivered to him today tomorrow explaining how the young Nigerian managed to smuggle the explosives on to the flight. The criticism is focused on the CIA and the national counterterrorism centre (NCC) established after 9/11. The CIA is under scrutiny because it picked up intelligence from Yemen that a Nigerian was involved in a forthcoming attack at about the same time that Abdulmutallab&apos;s father told US diplomats in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, that his son had become radicalised in Yemen and was a possible threat. That information was shared with CIA officials in Abuja who passed it on to the NCC, but it was apparently not matched with the intelligence from Yemen. On Tuesday Obama condemned the failure to share information and other intelligence failings as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;.", "sentences": ["American officials say intelligence efforts are focused on identifying and tracking down those who plotted to put Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on the plane with enough explosive in his underwear to bring down the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam."], "title": "US plots retaliatory strikes against al-Qaida in Yemen over plane bomber", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/30/us-plots-retaliatory-strikes-yemen", "tags": ["US national security", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Yemen", "Al-Qaida", "Nigeria", "World news", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2009-12-31T13:20:49Z", "article": "1.

Obama made a point of saying that the meeting in Washington on Tuesday will address &quot;intelligence-sharing improvements in our homeland security and counter-terrorism operations&quot;. His comment came amid criticism of the agencies for failing to pick up the threat posed by the alleged Nigerian plotter, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab contained in a review which blamed human and systemic failures for Abdulmutallab&apos;s failed attack. Republicans broke with the tradition of publicly backing a president during a national security crisis and accused Obama of endangering Americans and being soft on terror over the attempted attack. Democratic party leaders hit back by saying the president&apos;s opponents were seeking to make political gain. Some of the strongest criticism has come from former vice-president Dick Cheney, who accused Obama of weakening US security. &quot;President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war,&quot; Cheney said. &quot;He seems to think if he has a low-key response to an attempt to blow up an airliner and kill hundreds of people we won&apos;t be at war.&quot; One of the main concerns is that the various agencies had bits of the information but no one connected them.      Obama announced the meeting yesterday after receiving a preliminary report on the security failure. Anxious to be seen to be engaged, amid criticism that he is reluctant to break his Hawaii holiday, the president said he been given an update on the security review by his counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan. He had also discussed airport security measures with the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano. The British government is conducting a similar intelligence review. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, in an article published on the Downing Street website today, said the UK security services were working with international agencies &quot;to improve the sharing of information about individuals of concern&quot;. Abdulmutallab is alleged to have tried to set off explosives hidden in his underwear during a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. It emerged yesterday that his journey did not start in Nigeria, as first thought, but in Ghana. A US official told the Politico website that information about Abdulmutallab was &quot;vague but available&quot;. After the 9/11 attacks the Bush administration set up a national intelligence body to oversee the dozen or so US agencies to try to avoid such lapses. But the national counterterrorism centre did not put together the warning from Abdulmutallab&apos;s father, Umaru, about his son&apos;s radicalisation and departure for Yemen, and intercepts of conversations among leaders of al-Qaida in Yemen about a Nigerian man to be used for a terrorist attack. A senior intelligence official told the Washington Post: &quot;The right information did not get to the right people \u2013 there&apos;s no question about that.&quot; Questions raised include why Abdulmutallab did not have his visa for the US revoked after his father&apos;s warning caused him to be placed on the US&apos;s Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment list, along with 550,000 other suspicious people. Brown said: &quot;We all urgently need to work together on how we might further tighten these arrangements \u2013 in particular, at what point suspects are added to the list and when they are deemed too risky to be allowed to fly, or leave or enter the country \u2013 and also into wider airport security.&quot; US intelligence agencies are looking at the role, if any, of US-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Earlier this year, Awlaki was disclosed to have been in contact with the US army psychiatrist who carried out the shooting of troops at the Fort Hood base. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 1 January 2010 to remove text which had been mistakenly added during the web publication process.
