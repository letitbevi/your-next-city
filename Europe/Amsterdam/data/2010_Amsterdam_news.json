The prime minister said he had ordered immediate reviews into security, which will report back within days. In an article on the No 10 website, Brown said the use of full-body scanners would be among the measures discussed with the US and other partners. &quot;The new decade is starting as the last began \u2013 with al-Qaida creating a climate of fear,&quot; Brown said. The government would examine new security techniques beyond traditional measures such as pat-down searches and sniffer dogs &quot;in co-operation with President Obama and the Americans&quot;, he said. &quot;These could include advancing our use of explosive trace technology, full-body scanners and advanced x-ray technology.&quot; Brown said it was &quot;increasingly clear&quot; that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had linked up with al-Qaida in Yemen after leaving the UK, but there was still a need to ensure people in the UK did not become terrorists. &quot;We must continue the struggle to win back those dislocated, discouraged and disaffected individuals by demonstrating not what divides us but what we have in common,&quot; he said. The Dutch government has already announced that the scanners, which take a &quot;naked&quot; image of passengers, will be introduced for flights to the US from Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. BAA, which owns six UK airports, including Heathrow, said yesterday it would await a European ruling on privacy regulations before considering a similar move.", "sentences": ["The Dutch government has already announced that the scanners, which take a &quot;naked&quot; image of passengers, will be introduced for flights to the US from Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport."], "title": "Brown orders review into airport security", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/01/brown-orders-review-airport-security", "tags": ["World news", "Labour", "Air transport", "UK news", "Transport", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-01T18:00:00Z", "article": "At first glance, it seems reasonable to conclude the Obama administration did its best in 2009 to restore the US constitution&apos;s bill of rights when handling suspected terrorists at Guant\u00e1namo Bay imprisoned by the Bush administration. First and most importantly, President Obama made torture once again illegal. The administration then decided to try 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-conspirators in federal court in Manhattan, just streets away from where the World Trade Centre once stood. The Obama administration also announced the transfer of some detainees from Gitmo to a remote Illinois prison to make good his promise to close the controversial prison camps. (When this will actually happen, however, depends on Congress and security upgrades.) And on Saturday, the administration further signaled its confidence in the US justice system by charging the alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as an ordinary criminal in his attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas day. But these controversial and politically unpopular moves only look good from a rule of law standpoint if an observer studiously ignores the darker side of the Obama administration&apos;s approach to the detainees still languishing at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Until these legal inconsistencies are corrected, the Obama administration&apos;s efforts to restore the rule of law will be one giant sleight-of-hand. One more glaring example that &quot;hope&quot; has been drowned in Obama&apos;s political moat this new year. The first misconception about America&apos;s return to the rule of law is bolstered by the Justice Department&apos;s decision to try Mohammed, his co-conspirators, and Abdulmutallab in federal court. While this seems like an improvement, a dangerous contradiction emerges: these defendants will only see the inside of a civilian court because the evidence is so overwhelming the government is assured a conviction. On the other side, &quot;[a] still unknown number of detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo are slated for trial in substandard military commission proceedings governed by a new law that President Obama signed in October,&quot; according to Joanne Mariner of Human Rights Watch. While Mariner says Obama&apos;s Military Commissions Act of 2009 &quot;somewhat improves upon&quot; Bush&apos;s original law of 2006, Daphne Eviatar of The Washington Independent reports the government can use hearsay evidence against detainees without their attorney&apos;s ability to cross examine the witness, violating the constitution&apos;s sixth amendment. The administration therefore hasn&apos;t restored the US&apos;s commitment to the rule of law, it has further eroded it by cherry-picking trial venues to maximize conviction rates. Obama&apos;s deputy secretary of defense, William Lynn, all but admitted to this in a letter after the announcement to try Mohammed and his co-conspirators in a federal court. Responding to a question asking whether a detainee could win his freedom because he was not read his Miranda rights, Lynn&apos;s letter said:  Consistent with longstanding policy regarding criminal prosecutions, the Department of Justice will pursue prosecutions of Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees in Federal court only when admissible evidence or potentially available admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction. The Attorney General has made clear that he would not have decided to purse prosecution of the accused 9/11 co-conspirators in Federal court if he did not believe prosecutors could secure a conviction.  Talk about rigged trials. This demonstrates the United States didn&apos;t just learn torture techniques from its adversaries during the Cold War, it also learned its totalitarian ideas of jurisprudence as well. Another misconception about the Obama administration&apos;s return to the rule of law is its plan to purchase the Thomson Correctional Centre in rural Illinois to shutter Guant\u00e1namo. Certainly the location will change, but the horror-show will continue. As Amnesty International put it, &quot;The only thing that President Obama is doing with this announcement is changing the zip code of Guant\u00e1namo.&quot; That&apos;s because the detainees transferred from Gitmo to Thomson, who have not been charged with any crime, will either face trial before military commissions or will continue to be detained indefinitely. What&apos;s monstrous about this is that it&apos;s reasonable to assume that at least some of the estimated 100 detainees to be transferred have done nothing wrong. Herein lies the last misconception about Guant\u00e1namo: the detainees still held there are hardcore terrorists bent on the US&apos;s destruction. It&apos;s easy to forget that a 2006 study from Seton Hall university, using the government&apos;s own documentation, determined that an overwhelming majority of Gitmo detainees never committed a hostile act against the US or had ties to al-Qaida or the Taliban. Rather, the researchers discovered only 5% of detainees were caught by US forces; while an astounding 86% of detainees were captured by Afghanistan&apos;s Northern Alliance or by Pakistan in return for rewards. Two years later, an eight-month investigation by McClatchy into 66 released Guant\u00e1namo detainees confirmed the Seton Hall study, reporting that the US wrongfully imprisoned dozens, if not hundreds, of men &quot;in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere on the basis of flimsy or fabricated evidence, old personal scores or bounty payments.&quot; These two independent findings have also been corroborated by recent habeas corpus hearings where detainees have been able to challenge their detention in court. Of the 41 habeas petitions since the US Supreme Court guaranteed this right in 2008, habeas courts have ordered the release of 32 detainees. In these hearings, all the government had to prove was that there was &quot;a preponderance of evidence&quot; to continue to hold these detainees. Or as Matthew Waxman, formerly in charge of detainee affairs under the Bush administration, put it: &quot;more probable than not&quot; that the petitioners had ties to al-Qaida or associated movements. Further undermining the US justice system, nine of the defendants ordered released still remain in Guant\u00e1namo, according to The Washington Independent&apos;s Gitmo habeas scorecard. Some because no country will take them or simply because the US government doesn&apos;t believe their home countries, such as Yemen, can stop them from returning to the fight. Let&apos;s be clear here, unless you&apos;re part of the &quot;my country, wrong or right&quot; faction, the US kidnapped these men, held them indefinitely without charge for years, abused them and still won&apos;t release nine of them. So here&apos;s a New Year&apos;s resolution for President Obama if he wants to restore US adherence to the rule of law, respect human rights, and close Guant\u00e1namo for good: either charge the remaining 198 detainees with a crime or release them. Anything less shows that political concerns cynically trump Obama&apos;s own sworn oath to preserve the constitution.", "sentences": ["And on Saturday, the administration further signaled its confidence in the US justice system by charging the alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as an ordinary criminal in his attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas day."], "title": "New Year's resolution for Guant\u00e1namo | Matthew Harwood", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/dec/31/guantanamo-obama-new-year", "tags": ["Guant\u00e1namo Bay", "Obama administration", "US constitution and civil liberties", "US supreme court", "US news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-01T22:09:24Z", "article": "The government could allow hi-tech security searches at British airports that focus on people who fit a particular profile, prompting fears that particular racial and religious groups will face increased scrutiny, it emergedtoday . A Whitehall source told the Guardian passenger profiling was &quot;in the mix&quot; of the review into airport security ordered this week by Gordon Brown after the failed attempt to blow up a transatlantic jet on Christmas Day. The development came as airline industry chiefs warned it would be impossible to screen all travellers with a new generation of body scanners the government now wants introduced at airports. Airport industry executives warn the scanners are currently too big, slow and expensive to make their widespread installation viable. Costing around \u00a3100,000 each, they take up much more space than the arch metal detectors currently in use and require longer to check every passenger. Many in the industry have long called for the profiling of passengers to detect potential terrorists. But while it is claimed spotters would primarily be watching for suspicious behaviour, there are fears travellers will be selected for enhanced checks based on race, religion and ethnicity. &quot;They would be looking for people who are acting differently from regular passengers. However, it is going to appear to target a particular group of people because sadly it is that group of people that is presenting the problem at the moment,&quot; said Norman Shanks, a former head of security at BAA, the UK&apos;s largest airport operator. The Airport Operators Association (AOA) and BAA, the UK&apos;s largest airport operator, support passenger profiling. &quot;We would like to see a combination of technology, intelligence and passenger profiling,&quot; a BAA spokesman said. Shanks said a successful profiling system should train airline check-in staff and other people working at airports how to spot unusual behaviour. The exact criteria used to produce a passenger profile is secret but could also include factors such as how a ticket was bought, whether the passenger had check-in luggage, as well as the person&apos;s behaviour. The director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, warned against an overreaction to the latest security alert. &quot;We all take our security seriously but we need to learn the lessons of the recent past. Any response to terrorism has to be proportionate and respectful of the human rights values of dignity, privacy and liberty that governments on both sides of the Atlantic have been all too easily tempted to ignore.&quot; The Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said he would encourage the Muslim community to accept profiling. &quot;I think people would rather be profiled than blown up. It wouldn&apos;t be victimisation. I think people will understand that it is only through something like profiling that there will be some kind of safety,&quot; he said. &quot;Certainly some people will be aggrieved but the fact is that the majority of people who carry out these terror attacks do happen to be Muslims.&quot; As Brown announced a security summit would be held this month in London, it became clear ministers are ready to authorise the use of full body scanners whatever the conclusion of a European review of such systems next week. The scanners, which can see under people&apos;s clothing, could have spotted explosives strapped to the body of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab when he boarded a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day. Officials at the Department for Transport had said the EU ruling on whether the scanners violated people&apos;s privacy was necessary before they could be used in Britain but now sources have said the government inquiry \u2013 due to wind up in the next few days \u2013 is likely to give the go-ahead for the scanners &quot;with or without European cooperation&quot;. But concerns remain about the cost and practicality of introducing them. &quot;It is all right if you are planning a new terminal but you cannot change the design of an airport [to fit them in]. UK airports are already full to capacity to accommodate passengers at peak times of the year,&quot; said Ed Anderson, AOA executive chairman. Senior BAA staff are understood to have reservations about the readiness of full body scanning technology. Brown said today the security summit would discuss methods of countering radicalisation in Yemen. It will be held on 28 January alongside the conference on the future of Afghanistan.

Muddling what we see and hear, what we&apos;re led to expect is often very different from what actually happens. Actors might come mysteriously costumed in wigs and pointy hats, while hallucination and paranoia are discussed calmly in voiceover. Her first feature-length film, premiering in Exeter, links schizophrenia with capitalism. While its references are an esoteric hotpot mixing up everything from French theorist Deleuze to a 17th-century allegory, the concerns are present-day. Composed largely from stills, it explores how a family and their disturbed child relate through status symbols, with the actors themselves becoming like objects. Spacex Gallery, to 20 Feb Skye Sherwin Donald Judd, London Few artists have so stubbornly gone their own way since Donald Judd began to rethink what art could be in the early-60s. He wanted the impossible: for us to leave any thoughts about illusionary representation and metaphor behind and breathe in nothing but calm, clinical objecthood. This show focuses on his early forays into industrially produced work. The machine-perfect wall pieces are obscure projections in space and come in galvanised iron, brass and aluminium. Coolly reinterpreting their surroundings, the geometric forms try to resist our imaginative embellishment. Simon Lee, W1, to 29 Jan Skye Sherwin Miroslaw Balka, Oxford Running parallel with the artist&apos;s acclaimed Tate Modern Turbine Hall installation, a show of the Polish artist&apos;s little-known video works. &quot;My work is always at the frontier of things,&quot; the artist has said. While the Tate installation tackles some kind of undefined tragic inheritance with a monumental, almost monolithic, sculptural grandeur, the videos tackle unimaginable historical horror from oblique and deceptively calm perspectives. Young deer forage for food amid an enchanting snowy landscape; a pond is held in transfixed focus to accentuate its mesmerising beauty. The site, of course, as with much of Balka&apos;s work, is the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. Elsewhere, in a video titled Flagellare A, B and C (2009), the artist is filmed obsessively beating the earth in hopeless gestures of ritual redemption. Modern Art Oxford, to 7 Mar Robert Clark James McBey, Aberdeen Aberdeen artist James McBey deserves to go down in history as one of the most acutely perceptive and technically sensitive landscape printmakers of the 20th century. While his paintings bear the all-too-recognisable insular mark of so much British art of the time, when McBey got stuck into an etching plate he was obviously in his element. Self-taught as a printmaker and meticulously constructing his first press at the age of 15, he seems to have been born with a feel for the curious ritual of the printmaking studio, the almost alchemical mixture of graphic needles, copper plates and reeking acid. You can sense it in the precise architectural textures, the deep canal-side shadows, the weeds and weather-beaten intricacies, whether they be of Venice, Amsterdam or Edinburgh. Aberdeen Art Gallery, to 23 Jan Robert Clark Rooms Without Walls, London If London is the grown-up art capital of Europe, then Berlin&apos;s the rowdy little sister. Since drawing hordes of artists looking for cheap studio space after the wall came down, it&apos;s evolved into an urbane locale for big-ticket commercial operations. Now some of that original experimental energy has been transplanted to Hayward&apos;s Project Space, where Silberkuppe, one of Berlin&apos;s newest independent galleries, presents work by several established luminaries and recent arrivals. A bamboo sculpture by Germany&apos;s most idiosyncratic artist, Berlin staple Isa Genzken, stands like a shock of hair on the roof. Costumes and a film documenting an orgiastic performance by the collective basso showcase the city&apos;s collaborative spirit, while the 100-year-old French designer Janette Laverri\u00e8re&apos;s curvy modernist seating platform provides the show&apos;s centrepiece. Hayward Gallery Project Space, SE1, to 20 Jan  Skye Sherwin The Sea: LS Lowry &amp; Maggi Hambling, Salford Maggi Hambling&apos;s gushing yet turgidly mannerist paintings of turbulent seas are really up against it here, showing with some of the most haunting seascapes of all time. While LS Lowry is most popularly known for his dark and soot-stained industrial landscapes peopled by hunched mill workers, his stunningly laconic seascapes proved he was far more than an eccentric minor master. With typical wry wit he proclaimed, &quot;It&apos;s the battle of life \u2013 the turbulence of the sea \u2013 and life&apos;s pretty turbulent, isn&apos;t it?&quot; Yet in their remarkable technical restraint, these seemingly modest little paintings of grey sea on grey sky, divided by horizon, are redolent of a barely suppressed moodiness worthy of Mark Rothko&apos;s monumental abstracts. The Lowry, to 31 Jan Robert Clark Martin Boyce, Dundee Martin Boyce&apos;s No Reflections installation, first shown in a 15th-century Palazzo at the 53rd Venice International Biennale, now comes home to the white cube space of Dundee Contemporary Arts in his native Scotland. In Venice the sculptor attempted to &quot;delve into the city&apos;s interior landscape&quot;, creating sculptural interventions that reflected Venice&apos;s labyrinthine charms. Here the installation, with its walk-through of wooden screens and fragmented abstract wall features, seems to bring back some distant echo of Venice. As always with the best of Boyce, a peculiar, almost enigmatic, tension between romantic allusion and formalist structure sparks off a subtle sculptural poetry.

As she fought for her life, she imagined how it would feel to be the one breaking the rules. &quot;Even at the time, I understood what it was like to be him,&quot; she recalls of the night in Highbury when she awoke to find an intruder in her bedroom. &quot;I felt how powerful it is when someone discards all the laws you live by to do the most outrageous things. It wasn&apos;t that it was admirable \u2013 but it was fascinating.&quot; After the attacker was caught, she fictionalised the event in a chilling tale, &quot;You Left the Door Open&quot;. Its narrator is a cabaret artist \u2013 as Melville then was. But the terror of the woman&apos;s prolonged struggle, attempted bargaining, sexual assault and eventual escape through a garden window, is framed by myth and mystical coincidence. She wonders whether she might have opened an &quot;invisible door to some infernal region&quot;, because the &quot;demon&quot;, who names himself after a Victorian murderer, bears an uncanny resemblance to a predatory male persona she had invented for her cabaret act. The imaginative power to inhabit others&apos; lives, and ventriloquise voices, nourished Melville&apos;s early life as an actor and stand-up comic. She began working in theatre in the 1960s, and appeared in films including Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), The Long Good Friday (1980) and Mona Lisa (1987), and in television comedy series such as The Young Ones and Blackadder. &quot;There&apos;s almost nobody in the world I can&apos;t imagine myself being,&quot; she says. It might also have steered her turn to fiction. Her debut collection, Shape-Shifter (1990), was published when she was in her mid-40s. Spanning Britain and Guyana \u2013 her father&apos;s homeland \u2013 its stories follow life&apos;s losers and down-and-outs in shape-shifting, protean prose, its polyphony of characters veering from Creole to cockney, posh to patois. The collection won the Guardian fiction prize, a Commonwealth Writers&apos; prize and the Macmillan Silver Pen award. Penelope Fitzgerald admired her &quot;wonderful ear for living voices&quot;, while Salman Rushdie found it sharp and funny, &quot;part Caribbean magic, part London grime, written in a slippery, chameleon language&quot;. Between that and her second collection, The Migration of Ghosts (1998), came The Ventriloquist&apos;s Tale (1997), a novel set in 19th-century British Guiana. It won the Whitbread first novel award and was shortlisted for the Orange prize. For Rushdie, who was Melville&apos;s next-door neighbour in the mid-1980s and remains a friend, she is a &quot;wildly original and strange writer&quot;. She was then, he says, &quot;full of funny stories about acting&quot;, but he also recalls her &quot;creating, for a stand-up routine, a male persona that she then had to stop doing because he became so evil that he frightened her&quot;. Melville still lives in Highbury, in a flat whose study overlooks a tranquil garden with palms. That long-ago attack, she says, may have been on her mind while writing her second novel, Eating Air, published by Telegram this past autumn. She sees the book as reflecting her fascination with &quot;people who transgress the rules&quot;. The heroine is Ella de Vries, a ballet dancer whose father is from Suriname (formerly Dutch Guiana), and the novel melds autobiographical elements with myth and invention. Moving mainly between the 1970s and the present day, it marshals a wild cast of radical thespians and would-be revolutionaries, urban bombers and Islamists, kidnappers and spies, bankers and philistine patrons of the arts, in a sometimes farcical plot to blow up an Amsterdam bank \u2013 a &quot;popular gesture&quot; in the teeth of bankers&apos; bonuses. Her interest was in exploring &quot;terrorism, or revolutionary action, not from the point of view of left or right, but of extremism \u2013 whether in love, politics or religion; an attraction to danger against a safer, cosier life.&quot; The novel imagines an encounter between Europe&apos;s urban guerrilla movements of the 1970s, such as Italy&apos;s Brigate Rosse or Britain&apos;s Angry Brigade, and present-day Islamism, at a time when some old-style urban bombers are coming out of jail, just as Islamists are going in. She senses a kinship, &quot;not to do with political ideology, but with desire. Whether it&apos;s ETA or the IRA, or Gavrilo Princip \u2013 whose assassination of the archduke in Sarajevo triggered the first world war \u2013 there&apos;s a youthful energy and idealism. I didn&apos;t want to look at the morality of it, just the excitement and passion, the risk and adventurousness. Most assassins are only about 18 years old.&quot; Ella&apos;s husband Donny McLeod, a &quot;gallivanter&quot; and &quot;connoisseur of pure rebellion&quot;, who scorns the notion of dying for an idea, owes something to Melville&apos;s husband Angus, to whom the novel is dedicated. A trawlerman from the Scottish highlands, he was working on a building site when they met in a London pub when she was a teenager. &quot;Angus is still a bit of a mystery to me,&quot; she says. &quot;We don&apos;t always live together \u2013 he&apos;s a nomad, and I&apos;ve always left myself a get-out clause in relationships. But there&apos;s also this bond that doesn&apos;t get broken.&quot; Yet Donny is also Dionysus, and there are echoes of The Bacchae of Euripedes, and Venus and Adonis. She found inspiration in Conrad and Greene, Dostoyevsky&apos;s The Possessed and Granny Made Me an Anarchist, by Stuart Christie, the Briton jailed in Spain for plotting to assassinate General Franco. She also admires the Guyanese-born British novelist Wilson Harris for his &quot;weaving of myth and reality&quot;. The germ of the novel was an image that came to her, soon after September 11, of a &quot;huge catastrophe with a plane in a building, and a woman lying down in the rubble, pretending to be a victim.&quot; Ella&apos;s friend Hetty is an American drama queen with a penchant for emotional blackmail. Melville also takes pot shots at a utopian architect who never built anything; playwright Victor Skynnard, whom she sees as a &quot;conglomerate of fading lefties&quot;; and the mercurial celebrity actor and political activist Vera Scobie, who saves a group of tortured Uzbeks but drops them when her exiled son comes home. Despite the satirical undertow, Melville expresses affection for some of her targets. &quot;I am scathing because a lot of silly things were going on. But I&apos;ll often uphold the ideals.&quot; Her instincts, she says, have always been against big business, possibly mindful of Guyana&apos;s vast Demerara sugar plantations, built on slave and indentured labour. In her view, all the things that people feared would be brought about by communism \u2013 including, the novel notes, &quot;bland uniformity, cloned cities, secret prisoners and omnipresent surveillance&quot; \u2013 are being &quot;brought about by capitalism, and nobody recognises it. People mistake the freedom of the market for democracy.&quot; Both open and elusive, garrulous yet guarded, Melville says this is only the second British press interview she has given in almost two decades (the first was when she won the Guardian fiction prize). &quot;The more you&apos;re in the limelight the less you see, because the gaze is fixed on you.&quot; She prefers to remain inconspicuous, yet hints with mischief that that desire is the &quot;hallmark of the predator who prefers to be watcher, not watched. I hate to feel like a butterfly pinned to a board.&quot; Her pre-school years in the 1940s were spent in the colony of British Guiana. Her father was &quot;mixed-race Guyanese, part South American Indian, African and Scottish&quot;, and her mother came from a &quot;big working-class family&quot; in south London. They had met in Cuba while her mother was on a break from working on the Canadian railways. The family (she has two sisters) moved to south London in the early 1950s, when she was &quot;five or six&quot;. She remembers &quot;the greyness, and somebody shouting, &apos;your father looks like a monkey.&apos;&quot; Her father, who worked for a sugar company, fell ill with tuberculosis, spending long spells in a sanatorium. Melville had TB as a teenager. &quot;I hadn&apos;t known my father had it; in England it was a great disgrace, to do with poverty and immigrants.&quot; In &quot;Mixed&quot;, an early poem, she wrote: &quot;Sometimes, I think / My mother with her blue eyes / And flowered apron / Was exasperated / At having such a sallow child, / And my mulatto daddee / Silenced / By having such an English-looking one.&quot; She finds people can be fazed by her background. While she used to feel she was &quot;passing&quot; for white (&quot;I heard a racist conversation at a dinner party; it made me feel like a spy&quot;), she met resentment in the Caribbean during 1970s black power from those &quot;more worried at my passing myself off as black&quot;. In &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;, an essay for Margaret Busby&apos;s anthology Daughters of Africa (1992), Melville wrote that, with her slave ancestor&apos;s baptism certificate in her drawer, she was well placed for &quot;stirring up doubt, rattling judgments, shifting boundaries, unfixing fixities&quot; \u2013 and surveying the ludicrous. Of the now-faded fad for roots and identity politics, she wrote that, had Bob Marley chosen to pursue his father&apos;s Anglo-Scottish ancestry, &quot;he might have ended up in a kilt in the Highlands, singing &apos;will ye no&apos;come back again?&apos;&quot; Shortly after writing that essay, Melville found out that she had sickle cell trait, which occurs mostly in black people. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a shock to me, but it was to the doctors.&quot; From childhood, she derived a &quot;sense of separateness that may have made me into an observer. I knew I came from something else.&quot; When her father died, &quot;we couldn&apos;t bury him here because he never belonged here.&quot; Yet, &quot;because of my mum, class was more important to me. My grandfather worked in a sawmill, and my mother was the second of 10 children. I&apos;ve always been aware of that; it&apos;s affected my politics.&quot; On leaving school in the early 1960s, she worked at London&apos;s Royal Court theatre. Inspired by a talk given by George Devine and Joan Littlewood, she was taken on as an understudy. &quot;But you did everything then \u2013 assistant director, casting, read new plays, swept the stage.&quot; It was a &quot;short period of innovation and passion, and I met some of the greatest writers and actors. Unfortunately, I was too young and ignorant to know I was in a pub chatting away to Samuel Beckett.&quot; The director Lindsay Anderson &quot;took me under his wing. He took me to Russian films \u2013 things I&apos;d never been exposed to.&quot; She moved to the National Theatre run by Laurence Olivier, in a &quot;golden period&quot;, working as assistant to such directors as Franco Zeffirelli, John Dexter and William Gaskill. Her first film part was as a teenage whore in Ulysses (1967). But feeling &quot;uneducated&quot;, she took a sandwich course in psychology and economics at Brunel university in 1970-74. It was a &quot;great period of political education, endless meetings, activism&quot;. The strikes and protests against Edward Heath&apos;s Conservative government are a backdrop to Eating Air. Looking for a way to &quot;marry art and politics&quot;, she worked with the Joint Stock Theatre Company, and the Scottish theatre company 7:84 \u2013 which &quot;went out to trade unions and factories&quot;. After Guyanese independence in 1966, she became involved in political movements in the region, including in Chile. As a teenager, she felt &quot;very English. I didn&apos;t want to know about Guyana. But gradually, I realised there was another history.&quot; She was flying into the country in 1980 when the Guyanese historian and pan-Africanist Walter Rodney was killed by a car bomb. &quot;There was great horror and fear. I knew his brother, who was blown up with him.&quot; After the assassination, she worked at the Jamaican school of drama, and taught literacy in Maurice Bishop&apos;s New Jewel Movement in Grenada, which was curtailed by the Reagan invasion of 1983. It was in Jamaica that she began to write fiction: &quot;My life in the theatre, though I loved it, was never going to allow me to express my background. I looked English; it was a relief to write stories that expressed the other side.&quot; Her first story, about a pregnant Jamaican shoplifter, drew on teaching experience in Holloway prison. In the Caribbean she wrote about Europe, and in London, about Guyana. Theatre shaped her fiction: she tends to &quot;think in scenes&quot;, and her narrators step in like a chorus. She was drawn to stand-up in the 1980s after joining the Sadista Sisters, a rock cabaret act. &quot;I did it for the hell of it, and because there were things I wanted to mock,&quot; she says. &quot;It was all improvised.&quot; She started alongside Alexei Sayle (with whom she co-wrote a film) and Keith Allen, and &quot;within a month we were running up and down cellars like pit ponies. It became &apos;alternative comedy&apos;. It was wild and savage, but for me it was a political tool, not a career.&quot; She also spent time with relatives in Guyana&apos;s Rupununi savannah, a remote region near the Brazilian border peopled mainly by Wapisiana Indians, where her part-Indian ancestors were well-off cattle ranchers. The Ventriloquist&apos;s Tale was partly a riposte to Evelyn Waugh, whose travels in British Guiana in 1933 fed A Handful of Dust. In an afterword in 2007 to Waugh&apos;s travelogue Ninety-Two Days, Melville recalled her indignation at his scorn for the &quot;nauseating hospitality of savages&quot; \u2013 one of whom saved his life. Waugh mentions a Mr Melville, of white Jamaican-Scottish ancestry, who settled down with two Wapisiana sisters as wives, and had 10 children. Waugh&apos;s diaries also refer to a &quot;dotty bastard nephew, son of John Melville by his three-quarter sister.&quot; That hint of incest among her forebears lies at the heart of the novel. She recently spent years compiling a Wapichan dictionary with a cousin, aware of &quot;how extraordinary the translations are \u2013 the word for snack is &apos;liar&apos;, because it lies to your stomach that you&apos;re full. It&apos;s being overwhelmed by English, and is likely to die out.&quot; Though Melville no longer does stand-up, she senses a &quot;great need for satire. There&apos;s no movement against corporate democracy, just shards of comedy that keep pricking at it.&quot; As she sees it, artists and comedians are restorers of balance. &quot;When society starts going in one direction, they start pulling in the other. When there&apos;s an excess of power, a novelist or comedian will try to correct it.&quot;", "sentences": ["Moving mainly between the 1970s and the present day, it marshals a wild cast of radical thespians and would-be revolutionaries, urban bombers and Islamists, kidnappers and spies, bankers and philistine patrons of the arts, in a sometimes farcical plot to blow up an Amsterdam bank \u2013 a &quot;popular gesture&quot; in the teeth of bankers&apos; bonuses."], "title": "Pauline Melville interview", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/02/pauline-melville-interview", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Poetry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-02T00:08:00Z", "article": "Intelligence test Umar Farouk Abdulmullatab Hey, look, we&apos;ve all been there.

We are sitting in his apartment in Chelsea, New York, drinking tea and looking out on to the building where he helped found the Gay Men&apos;s Health Crisis in the early 1980s \u2013 the moment, he remembers, that marked the end of sex without consequences, the tip of the long shadow cast by the 60s. That variegated shadow is the subject of White&apos;s new memoir, City Boy. It&apos;s an account slanted, as White&apos;s best books are, toward the intimate. With his autobiographical novels (notably the trilogy that began with A Boy&apos;s Own Story and ended with The Farewell Symphony), his memoirs (My Lives), his biographies (Genet, Proust, Rimbaud) and his historical novels (Hotel de Dream, about Stephen Crane, and Fanny: A Fiction, about Fanny Wright and Fanny Trollope), White has become not only a stylist of eminence and influence but perhaps our most imaginative examiner of lives. When I ask White how he has come to mine his own life in different forms, he says that fiction and non-fiction offer different contracts with the reader. &quot;In a memoir, your main contract with the reader is to tell the truth, no matter how bizarre. In a novel, I think you have a contract with the reader to make the character representative \u2013 of a moment in history, a social class\u2026 for instance, I wanted to make the boy in A Boy&apos;s Own Story more like other gay men of my generation in their youth and not like me. I was very precocious, both sexually and intellectually. I mean, I&apos;d had sex with a couple of hundred people by the time I was 16. I was an obsessive-compulsive sex maniac. But I didn&apos;t put that in because I thought: that&apos;s so freaky. There would only be two other people in the world who would identify with me.&quot; In a memoir, no such difficulty. White is fearless in his relaying of carnal details and omnivorous in his reading habits. He tells you about the &quot;trick towel&quot; he used to put under his pillow for wiping up after his one-night stands (&quot;one man or 10&quot;), about how he dated his clap doctor, and almost as much about his platonic communions with Tolstoy and Donald Barthelme. His career, as Alan Hollinghurst put it, has been &quot;dedicated to sexual truth-telling&quot;. Anyone who lived in New York in the 70s knows it was a shambolic, scary, exhilarating, bankrupt and permissive city \u2013 fractured, as some saw it, beyond reclaim. White&apos;s book shows that but also the very particular New York of a gifted, promiscuous, scholarly, sociable young gay writer \u2013 apparently star-crossed yet significantly admired (at one point it seems as though nobody has heard of White except Vladimir Nabokov, who loves his work). White says he&apos;s been accused of name-dropping, but the book is more or less organised around the famous people he knew \u2013 it&apos;s not nearly casual enough a position to be referred to as &quot;dropping&quot; (there are the poets Richard Howard, James Merrill and John Ashbery; Lillian Hellman, Peggy Guggenheim, Harold Brodkey, Robert Mapplethorpe, Jasper Johns). What he does drop are devastating one-liners about people: &quot;Richard [Howard] was from Cleveland, just like Hart Crane, as he always mentioned&quot;; &quot;[Susan Sontag] should have been given the Nobel prize. That would have made her nicer.&quot; Yet to accuse White of gossiping is pointless, since for him the social is the intellectual and there is no sliding scale; he&apos;d just as soon tell you about the time he spotted Ezra Pound in Venice as tell you what his lovers like to do in bed. There&apos;s a beguiling tone, in the book, of accidental history: not bearing witness in a grandstanding way but saying, as if in passing: &quot;I was there, just by chance.&quot; Nowhere is this marginal stance more striking than in his account of the Stonewall riots. He happened to be walking past the now famous bar that night and at first he tried to stop the riots from happening (&quot;Resistance to authority made me nervous&quot;). Then, as he joined in a kicking chorus line of protesters who dubbed themselves the Pink Panthers, he thought: this could be the first funny revolution. White writes about the height of identity politics, a time when to be committed was everything, from a point of view of frank ambivalence. &quot;I tried to make the point that I wasn&apos;t really an habitu\u00e9 of anything,&quot; White suggests as he pours another cup of tea. &quot;I never went to Studio 54. I wasn&apos;t really a scene-maker.&quot; What this leaves out, however, is White&apos;s own effect, if not on any given scene, then on culture over the long haul. From his uncertainty about activism, you&apos;d not necessarily guess that he became the pre-eminent voice in gay literature and that he remains a distinguished writer, full stop. At one point in the book, he recollects an argument with an academic and editor who objects to the label &quot;gay literature&quot;. White, at the time, saw nothing wrong with claiming new ground but adds that he came to see his friend&apos;s point. Might it be a self-made ghetto after all? He offers a benign smile and deadpans: &quot;If you only read gay fiction you certainly would miss a lot of great stuff. I&apos;ve written about an awful lot of different things and I get sometimes dismissed as a &apos;gay&apos; writer. But better to be pigeonholed and read by a small group than to be totally ignored, like most writers. It&apos;s frivolous to complain you&apos;re ghettoised when at least you have people in the ghetto to read you.&quot; Among other things, though, he has noticed that the blue-chip closeted types have had the last laugh. &quot;They got rich and stayed rich,&quot; he says. &quot;And when they die \u2013 in the case of somebody like Susan Sontag \u2013 they&apos;re outed and that only makes them interesting all over again. So staying in the closet while you&apos;re alive, and coming out posthumously, are two good career moves.&quot; Is there something you could do about that? I ask. White grins. &quot;Get married?&quot; Now read extracts from Edmund White&apos;s City Boy: THE GAY &apos;SCENE&apos; IN 1970S NEW YORK In the 1970s in New York everyone slept till noon. It was a grungy, dangerous, bankrupt city without normal services most of the time. The garbage piled up and stank during long strikes by the sanitation workers. A major blackout led to days and days of looting. The city seemed either frightening or risible to the rest of the nation. To us, however, it represented the only free port on the entire continent. Only in New York could we walk hand in hand with a member of the same sex. Back in the mid-60s New York had just one leather bar, and it was inconspicuous and customers would wear their normal clothes and carry a change of costume in a bag, then switch to their chaps and black leather vest in the taxi. They were terrified a friend, even a gay friend, might see them going out in this freaky rig. Sadomasochism still sounded perverted and ever so slightly tacky \u2013 sort of New Jersey. And elderly. As if working-class, old gay men who couldn&apos;t compete in the real bars could look appealing in leather, or at least threatening. By the 70s all that was changing. In 1972 LA Plays Itself, a hardcore porn film starring the charismatic director Fred Halsted, opened on 56th Street and ran briefly before the cops closed it down. The Anvil, a bar with go-go boys, opened in 1974 just south of 14th Street. Boys danced on the bar on the ground floor while men had sex downstairs in the darkened bowels of the building. In 1975 a hardcore S&amp;M monthly magazine, Drummer, started publishing. It had fairly technical information about how to torture and submit to it \u2013 we read it with avidity. The whole look and smell of gay New York culture was changing toward beefier bodies, beards, and the odour of brew, harness, sweat, and Crisco. A boyfriend of mine said that New Yorkers were so pale and unhealthy looking that black leather was the only look that suited them. The leather bars kept pushing farther and farther uptown until they reached 21st Street and 11th Avenue with the Eagle&apos;s Nest. There all the men seemed older and bearded and muscular and over six feet tall. At 5ft 10in I&apos;d never felt short before except in Amsterdam. Now I was a shorty in my own city. To get from the West Village up to the Eagle, gay men had to go past three blocks of projects on Ninth Avenue starting at 16th Street. Gangs who lived in the projects would attack single gay men. We started wearing whistles around our necks to summon other gay men to our defence \u2013 a fairly effective system. I thought back to the 50s when everyone was a sissy boy with straightened hair, cologne, and a baby-blue cashmere sweater and penny loafers. Back then we would have been terrified of gangs. Not any more. Now many of us were taking judo classes. And now the dress code was strict. The Eagle would allow &quot;No hat other than leather cycle caps, western hats, construction hats or uniform hats. No jackets or coats other than leather or western style&quot;. At one time the Mineshaft was New York&apos;s most notorious &quot;members only&quot; club. Membership was granted on the spot if one passed muster \u2013 no designer clothes, no sneakers, no cologne. Located on Washington Street at Little West 12th Street in the heart of the meatpacking district, it was open around the clock from Wednesday night through Monday morning, featuring a clothes check, dungeons, and other amenities. Yes, one was allowed to check all one&apos;s clothes and stroll about naked or in a jockstrap \u2013 undress was encouraged. The Mineshaft opened in 1977 before the Aids era and was finally closed by the city&apos;s Department of Health in 1985, four years after Aids was first diagnosed. Within the nondescript street-level door of the Mineshaft were stairs leading straight up to the doorkeeper, sitting on a barstool, no longer the stogie-smoking Mafia guy of yore in a porkpie hat but rather a bearded and equally heavyset gay man in jeans and workboots. Inside was the big bar area with its low lights and pool tables. Behind a partition was the &quot;action&quot; part of the club on two floors. There was an entire wall of glory holes with people kneeling in front of crotch-high holes and servicing disembodied erections. A whole rabbit warren of small rooms was downstairs, and in one was a bathtub where men would take turns being pissed on. In 1979 I wrote an essay in the left-wing New Times justifying gay S&amp;M. I acknowledged: &quot;As for gay S&amp;M, it is as disturbing for heterosexuals to contemplate as was the thought of fair Celia on the potty for Jonathan Swift.&quot; I was alert to the drama and romanticism of glimpsed scenes at the Mineshaft: &quot;In the basement two stoned men are kissing under black light. Absurdly, touchingly, anachronistically romantic, they are unaware of everyone around them, their fluorescent white shirts gleaming eerily like Baudelaire&apos;s swan bathing its wings in the dust.&quot; In the early 80s the Mineshaft scene turned sour. Not only was the spectre of Aids dogging everyone&apos;s steps but there was also a ghastly ritualistic murder. Apparently a coke-snorting art dealer, Andrew Crispo, while sitting in his apartment, kept dialing the number of the public phone booth just outside the Mineshaft. A handsome Norwegian model answered and agreed to be picked up by Crispo&apos;s passing car and to submit to a night of torture. The fun and games got out of hand, however, and the model, after hours of being tortured, was shot twice through the head by Crispo&apos;s assistant and bodyguard, a renegade rich boy. The body was dumped in a smokehouse on the estate of the bodyguard&apos;s parents&apos; estate on Long Island. When the victim was found much later, the leather mask had burned into his face but most of the body had become unrecognisable. INTELLECTUAL LIFE&apos; IN 1970s NEW YORK I don&apos;t remember how I met Richard Sennett but dozens of roads led to the intellectual and social Rome he represented. Dick was a professor of sociology at New York University and had written several remarkable books, including The Hidden Injuries of Class and The Fall of Public Man. He was a well-known professor and sought-after lecturer and he entertained with charm and tirelessness in his little house on Washington Mews, a brick-paved lane just off Washington Square. Dick mainly liked to entertain, but not just anyone. At his house on the mews you could meet Isaiah Berlin or Michel Foucault or Susan Sontag or J\u00fcrgen Habermas or Alfred Brendel. Some of the younger guests would look in before heading off to the disco of the moment, Studio 54. I&apos;d never gone there but apparently the owner, Steve Rubell, let in both beautiful nobodies and celebrities of any sort. Studio 54 had a giant, smiling man-in-the-moon up above the dancers, slowly shovelling a spoon of cocaine toward his nose, over and over. This was still when many acquaintances assured me that cocaine was harmless and not addictive. People joked that it was the perfect yuppie drug since it made your head clearer and inspired you to want to work even more. Dick Sennett&apos;s salon was far from the Studio though no less exclusive in its way. No one paid much attention to the food or the liberal lashings of plonk. It was all a plush background for the startling mondaine reality in the frame: the good talk and the promise of even better talk. He was wonderfully encouraging as a friend. He hired me to be the executive director of the New York Institute for the Humanities even though I was only marginally an academic and had never been an administrator, except briefly at Saturday Review. The part-time job paid me just $22,000 a year \u2013 and my main duty was getting everyone coffee. In many ways, however, I was a good choice. I liked most people, I wanted to know all about their scholarly pursuits, I was even- tempered, and I had a small reputation as a writer. I was teaching a fiction workshop or two at Columbia and another one at New York University. I had a low rent and few expenses. Dick did everything to encourage me. When I wrote a play, a fairly tedious one, he decided we should give it a reading at the institute. Val Kilmer, at that point a young, unknown actor, agreed to read the young lover. In real life Kilmer&apos;s lover was then reputedly the much older Cher, who would wait for him outside the door in her limo every evening after rehearsals. No fool Cher \u2013 she wasn&apos;t about to let this treasure (a drool-makingly young, masculine heterosexual beauty) escape from her. Maria Tucci, who was married to Bob Gottlieb, head of Knopf, the publishing house, played one of the other parts. The institute gave glamorous parties and lunches where visitors from all over the world presented their latest thoughts and findings in an informal, collegial way, and the question-and-answer periods following the brief talks were as stimulating as any I ever attended. We invited Jorge Luis Borges to come to New York. He and his wife, Maria Kodama, had to fly first-class, of course, from Buenos Aires, and we arranged for them to stay in a beautiful NYU apartment looking down over Washington Square. The only drawback was lack of room service. Maria Kodama called me on a Sunday afternoon and asked, &quot;Who will wash out Borges&apos;s underthings?&quot; I thought to volunteer my own services but I was afraid of embarrassing everyone. Finally I had to hire a maid at $100 an hour to go over there on Sunday evening and wash out the distinguished panties. Borges gave a talk, one of the two talks he gave everywhere all the time with no variation. This talk was his one on how the best metaphors are clich\u00e9s because they&apos;re true: Life Is a Dream and Time Is a River, and any effort to invent newer, fresher images is false and misleading. No one paid much attention to what he was saying. He was iconic because he&apos;d written a half-dozen brain-twisting stories of an admirable lightness in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Now, all these years later, he was invited everywhere because of these few brilliant stories that few people in the audience would have read, much less understood. I suppose I&apos;d never before witnessed up close such a huge career nor noticed how his was based on such a slim oeuvre written four decades previously. ON HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH SUSAN SONTAG&apos;  The biggest star at the New York Institute for the Humanities was Susan Sontag. I think I must have met her at Dick Sennett&apos;s house. At least I imagine I fell into a conversation with her, she who had been my idol for many years. It&apos;s strange that I can&apos;t remember our first meeting since I can remember in vivid detail reading her essay on pornography when it first came out and agreeing and disagreeing with it in such an intense way. I read it because it addressed thoughts I&apos;d had for years but not known how to formulate. Reading the essay on camp was the same gripping experience. To be sure, Isherwood in one of his novels, The World in the Evening, had mentioned camp (high and low), but Sontag thoroughly explored the subject and saw it as a way of rescuing failed glamour \u2013&quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot;\u2013 and putting the world in quotation marks, of aestheticising all experience. Everyone, even Time magazine, grabbed on to &quot;Notes on Camp&quot; as a kind of parlour game, the exploitation of a vogue word, the pinpointing of a new sensibility. What became clear in reading and talking to Sontag was that she wrote best about subjects she was most ambiguous about. Campiness both attracted and repelled her. Indeed her whole personality was based on this same push-pull dynamic. She was also just a bit anti-Semitic and homophobic. She once told the African-American novelist and essayist Darryl Pinckney that he was &quot;reducing&quot; his stature as a writer by calling himself a black writer. She asked me how I could bear to be considered a gay writer. Her questions were meant to guide the people she cared about, Darryl and me among others, away from our own &quot;narrowing&quot; labels. And it&apos;s perfectly true that she maintained world-class status partly by staying in the closet. Soon after I met Susan I started hanging out with her. Other people have described how going out in public with her was like being seen with royalty. By and large New Yorkers were too discreet to bother her but they did recognise her, especially at cultural events \u2013 at the ballet, at movies, at lectures. Phillip Lopate in his Notes on Sontag talks about how she&apos;d stroll about in front of a movie audience before the lights went down, supposedly looking for someone but \u2013 in his opinion \u2013making sure that everyone was aware of her presence. On the other hand, Susan didn&apos;t like people to refer to their friendship with her in print. I remember that the talented, if bitter, writer Gary Indiana, who wrote about heroin in a powerful novel of the period called Horse Crazy, remarked in the Village Voice that Sontag knew all the best Chinese restaurants in Manhattan \u2013 and for that one indiscretion he was banished from court. Susan&apos;s closest friend was her son, David Rieff. For two years he and I were virtually inseparable and I was very, very fond of him. He had grown up with &quot;gay uncles&quot; such as Richard Howard and Jasper Johns, and I seemed to be falling into the familiar mode of the queer avuncular, though in my mind we were something more like cousins. David could be as contemptuous of other people as his mother was, but for the most part he seemed admiring and vulnerable and just a bit of a puppy dog. Jamaica Kincaid was a friend of ours in those exciting days \u2013 a tall black woman with a much smaller husband, the composer Allen Shawn, brother of the actor and playwright Wally Shawn, and they were of course the sons of the longtime New Yorker editor William Shawn. When I ran into Jamaica recently after two decades of not seeing her, I asked timidly, &quot;Do you remember me?&quot; and she overwhelmed me by saying, &quot;Of course I remember you \u2013 those were some of the happiest days of my life!&quot; They were happy days for me, too. David was attachant and dear. Susan could be impossibly vain and imperious, but she was also protective and generous. She wrote a blurb for my breakthrough novel, A Boy&apos;s Own Story, which she did in her usual serious, thorough, time-consuming way. Just to write a few lines she felt she had to re-read all three of my novels as well as States of Desire. She put me up for a $7,000 prize at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which I won, and wrote a letter of recommendation for a $22,000 Guggenheim Fellowship, which I received. After A Boy&apos;s Own Story came out she said, &quot;You&apos;ll never be poor again in your life.&quot; And though I&apos;ve often had to scramble to pay the rent, what she said was true \u2013I was never really desperate again. Years later, after I&apos;d broken with Susan, Marina Warner told me that during a visit to New York she&apos;d met Susan and that I was wrong about her, she was a delight, no one could be warmer or kinder. I was quick to agree with Marina but I astonished her when I said, &quot;But I&apos;ll tell you exactly how you spent your time with her. She invited you to a good Chinese restaurant and ordered for you and paid for it. Then she accompanied you to several bookshops and expressed her scandalised amazement that you&apos;d never read Trelawney&apos;s Adventures of a Younger Son or Aksakov&apos;s Family Chronicle. She bought those books for you and gave them to you in a nice little ceremonious moment. During the unrushed afternoon she talked to you about her struggle with cancer and her love affairs \u2013 five women and four men.&quot; Marina&apos;s jaw dropped and I said, &quot;It&apos;s perfectly sincere, but that&apos;s the day with Susan. Always the same.&quot; Susan seemed to have no old friends. Like all famous people she constantly attracted new people, and she didn&apos;t have to cultivate old friendships, resolve disputes, soothe ruffled feathers. She could just move on. She was a terrible snob. Once I had her to dinner with a beautiful and charming young couple who each eventually went on to write successful novels but who were unknown at the time. Susan said in an embarrassingly loud stage whisper, &quot;Why did you invite them?&quot; I was so vexed that I lied and said, &quot;They&apos;re terribly rich.&quot; Susan nodded sagely, as if that answered all her doubts. In fact, they weren&apos;t rich at all, but later split up and each of them married extremely &quot;well&quot;. Oddly enough, when I invited Susan to dinner in Paris in 1981 with Michel Foucault, he whispered, when she left the room for a moment, &quot;Why did you invite her?&quot; I didn&apos;t realise that he didn&apos;t like to socialise with women. Susan could be sweet and melancholy but she was often &quot;out of it&quot; in social settings, never getting the joke and needing everything to be spelled out. Her laugh was mirthless and heavy. She lacked spontaneity. Elle n&apos;\u00e9tait pas bien dans sa peau, as the French would say. She could be little-girlish and tender at times, though normally she was brusque, lordly, dissatisfied. Someone who might have been trying too hard would walk out of the room and Susan would wrinkle her nose and shake her head dismissively. She should have been given the Nobel Prize. That would have made her nicer. She was friendly with lots of Nobelists, including Nadine Gordimer, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, Czeslaw Milosz, all writers I met through her. Around all these people Susan was wonderfully natural, and they perceived her as their equal, even their superior. After moving to Paris in the early 80s, I wrote a novel, Caracole, that came out in 1985. Although it read like a fable taking place in Venice in the 19th century, it could equally be read as an attack on the institute and on Susan. In all my years of therapy I never got to the bottom of my impulse toward treachery, especially toward people who&apos;d helped me and befriended me. A Boy&apos;s Own Story ends with the boy (me) betraying his teacher, a man with whom he had sex. Oddly enough, I felt Susan would appreciate the aptness of my portrait, that she would learn from my implied admonitions. Of course on another level I knew I was trashing her and that she&apos;d be angry. Susan was so angry that she asked Roger Straus, her editor, to contact all my foreign publishers and request as a courtesy to her and to him that they remove her blurb from the next edition of A Boy&apos;s Own Story in every language. Sixteen years later I moved back to New York, and one day I ran into Susan in a restaurant. I&apos;d rushed over to her table without recognising her because I&apos;d spotted a Parisian friend, the Argentine film director Edgardo Cozarinsky. Suddenly I thought, &quot;Oh, dear, this woman with the short white hair must be Susan Sontag after her chemo.&quot; I hurriedly slunk back to my table. But then, in a flash, there was Susan standing by my side. She said, &quot;Ed, I hope you don&apos;t think I was ignoring you because of our silly little feud.&quot; I stood and she embraced me. We agreed that we&apos;d get together, that all was forgiven, that we&apos;d patch it up. But the next day when I saw her at Cozarinsky&apos;s screening, she was distant. I realised too much time had gone by. That our reconciliation hadn&apos;t really &quot;taken&quot;. That was all right. We&apos;d both become different people. ON AIDS Aids first started to be mentioned in 1981. No one had ever heard of it before then. Larry Kramer, a screenwriter and producer (Women in Love) and novelist (Faggots), convened a meeting of gay men in his Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Washington Square. We were addressed by Dr Alvin Friedman-Kien, who&apos;d studied several cases of Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a rare skin cancer that usually appeared in old men of Jewish or Mediterranean origin. Suddenly it was showing up in young gay men, as was an unusual and virulent form of pneumonia. Soon this new cluster of diseases was being called gay-related immunodeficiency or Grid. Larry invited five or six other men, including me, to discuss forming an offensive against Grid (which a year later was renamed Aids). We decided to call our group the Gay Men&apos;s Health Crisis. We wanted to emphasise that it was a &quot;crisis&quot; and not a permanent condition, since gays were not eager to be equated with yet another medical diagnosis. We were na\u00efve but there was no way to be sophisticated about an unprecedented plague. Nothing like this had ever happened to anyone before. Dr Friedman-Kien said to us that he thought we should give up sex altogether until researchers understood a little more about how the disease was transmitted. We looked at him as if he were mad. Just as the Crash of 1929 ended the Roaring 20s, so the Aids epidemic of 1981 ended the sexy 70s. Susan Sontag once said to me that in all of human history in only one brief period were people free to have sex when and how they wanted \u2013 between 1960, with the introduction of the first birth-control pills, and 1981, with the advent of Aids. For those two decades all sexually transmitted diseases could be treated with antibiotics, unwanted pregnancies were eliminated through the Pill and legalised abortion, and Aids did not yet exist. Religion seemed to be on the wane and promiscuity appeared to be the wave of the future. In 1981 all that came to an end. Gays of my generation were especially unprepared to accept the new reality since for us, as I&apos;ve mentioned before, gay liberation had meant sexual liberation, and gay culture still meant sexual access and abundance. Now we were being told to limit the number of our partners, to know our partners&apos; names, or to abstain from sex altogether. Later we were told to suck not fuck, but even so the definition of safe sex was highly unstable, and to this day, almost four decades into Aids, no one seems certain exactly which practices are safe or unsafe. Sontag followed the developments carefully and soon began to see that the demonising of the gay population because of Aids was not unlike the previous blaming of patients with tuberculosis and syphilis in the 19th century or cancer in our own day. She thought that she might add an appendix about Aids to Illness as Metaphor, her 1978 study. Charles Silverstein and I thought that our influential The Joy of Gay Sex should be revised to include warnings about Aids, but with still so little information about it, no one knew how to frame that cautionary advice. The revision did not come out until several years later. I was the first president of GMHC, though I quickly retired in favour of Paul Popham, an attractive macho businessman who was far more competent. Almost from the beginning Larry Kramer was sharply critical of the other members, and by 1983 he had founded a much more militant group called ACT UP. Certainly we all made lots of mistakes. Instead of instantly enlisting the help of the federal government, we organised a disco fund raiser. We thought small. We thought ghetto. We didn&apos;t understand that we were watching the beginnings of an epidemic that would soon enough infect 40 million people worldwide. New York didn&apos;t change right away but a feeling of dread was now in every embrace. What had seemed innocent revels now felt like the manoeuvres of a death squad. What had felt warm and sticky with life was now the cool syrup of mortality. Those gangs of tall men in leather jackets walking joyfully down the street, their engineer boots ringing sparks off the pavement, now broke up, dissipated into the night, melted into furtive individuals. Whereas in the late 1970s everyone wanted to be bisexual, the height of trendiness, now people were starting to deny they&apos;d ever had experiences with members of the same sex. People who&apos;d been fashionably skinny the year before now were beefing up to prove they weren&apos;t besieged by a wasting disease. I didn&apos;t want the party to stop, and I moved to Paris in the summer of 1983.David Rieff gave me some sartorial advice. He told me that every man in Paris wore a coat and tie and that I&apos;d have to get rid of my dirty, torn jeans. David assumed I was leaving New York because I&apos;d become too famous. &quot;You&apos;d never be allowed to write another book if you stayed here, right?&quot; he asked. My concerns were more sybaritic than professional; in any event he exaggerated my success. I wanted to go on having industrial quantities of sex \u2013 and I thought I could go on in Paris. New York was turning into a morgue. In the end, I didn&apos;t really escape from Aids. Many of my French friends died, including Foucault, just as back in America so did my dearest friend, David Kalstone. Aids killed off most of my circle. Every time I would come back to New York, more and more of my friends would be dying or dead. Gradually I became more and more sombre and my Parisian life became as dark as my New York life. I sat by many bedsides and held many emaciated hands. I didn&apos;t feel the famous survivor guilt only because I was positive myself and expected throughout the 80s to die within a few months. Every time I would come back to New York from Paris in the 80s and 90s, I was shocked by how sleek it had become, how expensive ice cream boutiques had replaced the corner shoe repair shops, how the city neighbourhoods were being gentrified as more and more rich young workers in finance moved into town and drove out the older, poorer ethnic minorities. And the bohemians. New York was no longer a dangerous, run-down ghetto; it had become a chromium, spotlit, palm-festooned singles bar. I was lucky to live in New York when it was dangerous and edgy and cheap enough to play host to young, penniless artists. That was the era of &quot;coffee shops&quot; as they were defined in New York \u2013 cheap restaurants open round the clock where you could eat for less than it would cost to cook at home. That was the era of ripped jeans and dirty T-shirts, when the kind of people who were impressed by material signs of success were not the people you wanted to know. I suppose that finally New York is a Broadway theatre where one play after another, decade after decade, occupies the stage and the dressing rooms \u2013 then clears out. Each play is the biggest possible deal (sets, publicity, opening-night celebrations, stars&apos; names on the marquee), then it vanishes. With every new play the theatre itself is just a bit more dilapidated, the walls scarred, the velvet rubbed bald, the gilt tarnished. Because they are plays and not movies, no one remembers them precisely. The actors are forgotten, the plays are just battered scripts showing coffee stains and missing pages. Nothing lasts in New York. The life that is lived there, however, is as intense as it gets.", "sentences": ["At 5ft 10in I&apos;d never felt short before except in Amsterdam."], "title": "Edmund White | Interview and book extract", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/03/edmund-white-city-boy-extracts", "tags": ["Edmund White", "Books", "Culture", "Biography", "Jasper Johns", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-03T13:14:52Z", "article": "New full-body scanners are already being ordered by the British Airports Authority, the prime minister said this morning as he outlined a new regime of tightened airport security. Speaking on BBC One&apos;s Andrew Marr programme, Gordon Brown pre-empted the findings of his own review by saying future passengers must expect to be scanned by the controversial scanners. The devices have received mixed appraisals on whether they are suitable to detect the new type of explosive that 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of using in an attempt to blow up a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. Since that attempted attack, an urgent review into airport security has begun. The transport secretary, Andrew Adonis, is expected to report its findings to parliament this week. BAA, which operates six British airports, said today it would move quickly to install full-body scanners at London&apos;s Heathrow. &quot;Now that the government has given the go-ahead, we will introduce full-body scanners as soon as practical,&quot; a spokesman for BAA told Reuters. He said BAA was just looking at introducing the scanners at Heathrow \u2013 Europe&apos;s busiest airport by passenger numbers \u2013 at this stage. A government source has told the Guardian that passenger profiling and the purchase of more scanners are highly likely to be among the review&apos;s recommendations and that the government will install the scanners &quot;with or without&quot; the international co-operation it had said it needed in the aftermath of the attempted terror attack. The source pointed to the decision by Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport to install the 17 scanners it first bought two years ago but was unable to activate after receiving EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications. This dictat was used by the Department for Transport to explain why four of the UK&apos;s own scanners lay unused at Heathrow. The prime minister&apos;s eagerness to show that his government is responding to the possibility of terrorists using different types of explosives came as he also had to admit Downing Street may have oversold his hand in moving to tackle the threat posed by Yemen, where the alleged bomber is thought to have been trained by an al-Qaida offshoot. Brown announced on Friday that a conference already planned for 28 January to address Afghanistan will now also address what he believed to be the &quot;failing state&quot; of Yemen. Over the weekend Downing Street went on to say that the prime minister and Obama had agreed in a personal telephone conversation that Britain and the US would jointly fund a counterterrorism police unit in Yemen. Yesterday afternoon the White House said it was a discussion held only at official level. This morning Brown admitted there had been &quot;no direct contact&quot; between the two leaders on the issue and that the US and UK counterterrorism initiatives had been going on &quot;for some time&quot;. The prime minister&apos;s evident decision to support the installation of new \u00a3100,000 body scanners will be criticised since many industry insiders believe the machines are flawed. Ben Wallace, a Tory MP who was involved in a British defence firm&apos;s project to test the scanner&apos;s effect before he entered parliament, told the Independent on Sunday that the kind of low-density materials used in Christmas Day&apos;s attempted attack would not have been detected. Instead the machines were best at detecting shrapnel, heavy wax and metal but not plastics, chemicals and liquids. Wallace said: &quot;Gordon Brown is grasping at headlines if he thinks buying a couple of scanners will make us safer. It is too little, too late.&quot; Instead, he said the time had come for the use of passenger profiling. A government source has said profiling of passengers is now &quot;in the mix&quot; of the government&apos;s review. Downing Street statement&apos;s includes other Brown ideas for clamping down on the threat from Yemen: \u2022 Putting the threat from Yemen and Somalia on the agenda for the EU general affairs council in January. \u2022 The financial action taskforce, an intergovernmental body set up to combat terrorist financing, should turn its attention to Yemen. \u2022 Discuss the UK&apos;s reaction to the suspected bomb plot at a special meeting of the national security, international relations and development committee (NSID).", "sentences": ["The source pointed to the decision by Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport to install the 17 scanners it first bought two years ago but was unable to activate after receiving EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications."], "title": "Full-body scanners being ordered for airports, says Gordon Brown", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/03/gordon-brown-airport-body-scanners", "tags": ["Air transport", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Al-Qaida", "Gordon Brown", "World news", "UK news", "Politics", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-03T22:05:00Z", "article": "Camille O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s appeal isn&apos;t immediately obvious.

Four scanners have lain unused at Heathrow airport after EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications, awaiting approval for use from the European commission, but a government source told the Guardian that these would now be deployed &quot;with or without&quot; the international co-operation that ministers said was needed after the recent bomb bid.

The US currently lists Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism. Along with passengers flying from or through those countries, travellers from Nigeria, Yemen and Pakistan will be patted down and have their carry-on luggage searched under new procedures, according to the US transport department. Yesterday, a BAA spokesman backed profiling. &quot;It is our view that a combination of technology, intelligence and passenger profiling will help build a more robust defence against the unpredictable and changing nature of the terrorist threat to aviation,&quot; the spokesman said. But Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil liberties group Liberty, warned the government against profiling. &quot;Has no one noticed the terrorists&apos; ability to capitalise on discrimination, or the recruits from a range of different backgrounds? Whether on the street or at the terminal, suspicious behaviour is a sensible basis for search by policing professionals; race or religion is not,&quot; she said. It was reported last night that a Virgin Atlantic flight from Kingston, Jamaica, to London was delayed after a DVD with &quot;Islamic content&quot; was found on board. John McFarlane, security chief at the Norman Manley international airport in Kingston, said all passengers on last Thursday&apos;s flight were taken off the plane and re-screened after the DVD was discovered by crew. McFarlane did not say what the disc&apos;s contents were, only that it made the flight crew &quot;uncomfortable.&quot; Brown&apos;s swift response to the possibility that terrorists are using different types of explosive came as he admitted that Downing Street may have oversold its response to tackling the threat posed by Yemen, where the alleged bomber is thought to have been trained by an al-Qaida offshoot.

The US transportation security administration (TSA) todayissued a directive saying that travellers with passports from 14 mostly Muslim countries or travelling from or through those countries would face increased security checks. These travellers will be singled out for full pat-downs and a more thorough search of their carry-on luggage. The directive, introduced in the wake of the alleged plot by a 23-year-old Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, to explode a bomb on an Amsterdam-Detroit flight on Christmas Day, created confusion at airports round the world. Obama, who returned to Washington today from a holiday in Hawaii that was overshadowed by the security threat, is to meet the heads of the CIA, the national counter-terrorism centre, and other agencies who failed to identify the threat. As well as intelligence, Obama is to discuss what further airport security measures can be implemented. The head of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, is sending staff to airports around the world to check on their security measures but also to see if there are lessons that can be adopted by the US. The TSA issued the security measures in a bald, three-paragraph statement, whose lack of detail contributed to the confusion at airports worldwide. It said it &quot;is mandating that every individual flying into the US from anywhere in the world travelling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening&quot;. The US deems four countries to be state sponsors of terrorism: Iran, Syria, Cuba and Sudan. The other 10 countries are: Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and Yemen. Most of the increased security measures have been in place since Christmas Day. The directive shifts them from being temporary measures to permanent. There was criticism in the US at the administration&apos;s move. Nawar Shora, the legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said: &quot;All of a sudden people are labelled as being related to terrorism just because of the nation they are from.&quot; Larry Johnson, a former counter-terrorism official, described the list as senseless, and told the &quot;bad guys&quot; what countries not to fly from. He also questioned why the list did not include countries such as Egypt, Niger and Mali, and noted that some of the 9/11 attackers began their journey in Europe. The US is to tighten security at its own airports by expanding the number of full- body scanners. Only 40 are in place at present and the administration is to add another 450. A measure to introduce even more has been stuck in Congress since early last year.

For several years, piracy groups that run services allowing music, video and software to be illegally shared online have been using legal loopholes across a wide range of countries as a way of escaping prosecution for copyright infringement. In the last year there has been a significant shift, say piracy experts, as the groups have worked to stay beyond the reach of western law enforcement. The change is rooted in the evolution of &quot;bulletproof hosting&quot;, or website provision by companies that make a virtue of being impervious to legal threats and blocks. Not all bulletproof services are linked to illegal activities, but they are popular among criminal groups, spammers and file-sharing services. Rob Holmes, of the Texas law firm IP Cybercrime, which has worked to close down several bulletproof operations, said successful hosts were now starting to get stronger. &quot;Some of the more popular ones have become more strongholds than they were previously,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s an industry and it always will be. When you think about it, bulletproof hosting is just a data version of money laundering.&quot; Late last year a Swedish court found four men guilty of breaking copyright law through their links to the Pirate Bay website, one of the internet&apos;s most notorious gateways for pirated films and television shows. That decision prompted many piracy services to seek jurisdictions beyond the reach of western law. Pirate Bay moved its web servers to Ukraine, while another popular file-sharing service, Demonoid, which started in Serbia, also relocated. &quot;Before going completely dark in October [2009], Demonoid physically moved their servers to Ukraine, and remotely controlled them,&quot; said John Robinson, of BigChampagne, a media tracking service based in Los Angeles. &quot;Ukrainian communications law, as they paraphrase it, says that providers are not responsible for what their customers do. Therefore, they feel no need to speak about or defend what they do.&quot; Not every controversial service has fled beyond traditional jurisdictions, however. Some problematic hosts still exist in the US, such as the infamous host McColo, which was based in San Jose, California, and remained in operation until last year. Pirate Bay, after its brief excursion to Ukraine, is now run out of a Dutch data centre called CyberBunker, which is based in an old nuclear facility of the 1950s, about 120 miles south-west of Amsterdam. Research published last year showed that most bulletproof hosts are located in China, where criminals are able to take advantage of low costs and legal loopholes to avoid prosecution. Despite officials in Beijing talking in tough terms about computer crime \u2013 hacking potentially carries a death sentence in China \u2013 the authorities rarely co-operate with other countries to take action against hi-tech criminals. As a result, just a handful of firms in China are responsible for hosting thousands of criminal enterprises online. A study of online crime conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in the US showed that more than 22,000 websites which sent pharmaceutical spam were hosted by six bulletproof servers in China. Richard Cox of Spamhaus, a British organisation that watches spammers and monitors bulletproof hosts, said it was almost impossible to stop expansion of such services. &quot;At the moment there are a number of individuals who are setting up bulletproof hosting sites in China,&quot; he said. &quot;No matter how big a part of the Chinese network we block, the administrators there just do not care.&quot; Not every controversial service has fled beyond traditional jurisdictions, however. Some problematic hosts still exist in the US, such as \u2013 the infamous host McColo, which was based in San Jose, California, and remained in operation until last year. But the long-term impact of offshore hosting is becoming more problematic as investigators worldwide try to cut the links between criminal groups and protected internet servers. One notorious gang of hackers, known as the Russian Business Network, after disappearing for two years amid scrutiny from the authorities in Moscow, has also reportedly returned to action. The group started as a bulletproof host in St Petersburg but had connections to a wide range of criminal activities online. Widely known in the computer security community, it is being investigated by the FBI. The Russian authorities, meanwhile, have been keen to foster greater communication to stop the spread of criminal activity online. Some are hopeful that greater co-operation between international governments will help prevent the development of new piracy havens, but others suggest that it is unlikely that a complete block on such activities will ever be possible. &quot;There will always be a place to run to,&quot; said Rob Holmes, of IP Cybercrime. &quot;Each time a law passes, or a new country creates some kind of stumbling block for them, they&apos;ll always find another place to do this. It goes back to the speakeasies in the 1920s \u2013 when one place got busted, they would just congregate in another place.&quot;", "sentences": ["Pirate Bay, after its brief excursion to Ukraine, is now run out of a Dutch data centre called CyberBunker, which is based in an old nuclear facility of the 1950s, about 120 miles south-west of Amsterdam."], "title": "Internet pirates find 'bulletproof' havens for illegal file sharing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/05/internet-piracy-bulletproof", "tags": ["Internet", "Piracy", "Filesharing", "Pirate Bay", "China", "Sweden", "Ukraine", "Technology", "World news", "Law", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-05T20:35:00Z", "article": "The most significant changes to British airport security since 2006 will see increased pat-down searches, more sniffer dogs in terminals and a step-up in hand luggage inspections after the government announced its response to the Detroit airline bombing incident. The home secretary, Alan Johnson, warned that flights face delays as airports adapt to the latest tightening of the regime, which will include singling out passengers for additional scrutiny if they behave suspiciously at some of Britain&apos;s biggest airports and the introduction of body scanners at Heathrow within weeks. Announcing the changes , he said &quot;no single technology&quot; could be 100% effective against &quot;innovative and determined&quot; terrorists. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab nearly brought down Northwest Airlines flight 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day when he set off an explosive device in his underwear, having apparently smuggled the bomb through airport security in Amsterdam and Lagos where his journey began. &quot;Air passengers are already used to being searched by hand, and having their baggage tested for traces of explosives,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;The government will direct airports to increase the proportion of passengers searched in this way. There may be some additional delays as airports adapt, but I am sure the travelling public will appreciate the reasons behind this.&quot; A meeting between Department for Transport officials and airport owners about implementing the changes has been scheduled for [Wednesday]tomorrow, amid strong lobbying from airport and airline owners over the extent to which body and bag searches should be increased. One aviation source warned that relying on increased pat-down searches would be &quot;window dressing&quot;, adding: &quot;The government is about to implement measures that will result in long queues at airports but will have no impact on security.&quot; The changes could be replicated across Europe as well, with a meeting of security officials from EU states due to take place on Thursday. BAA, Britain&apos;s largest airport operator and the owner of Heathrow, said it supported the use of scanners but did not refer to the increase in body searches. &quot;Body-scanning and other technology will play an important role in enhancing the security process.&quot; An increase in the ratio of pat-down searches for passengers in security areas was temporarily imposed in August 2006, after the foiling of a plot to blow up airliners flying out of Heathrow with liquid bombs. The rise in searches helped cause significant delays and some of the security changes remain, including limits on liquids in hand luggage. The home secretary tried to allay privacy fears over the introduction of full-body scanners at British airports and side-stepped warnings that their use is illegal under child-protection laws. The first machines will be in use at Heathrow within three weeks, alongside those already in use at Manchester and Glasgow but all airports are now expected to have them by the end of the year. Johnson said they would be used as a &quot;second line of defence&quot; for randomly selected individuals, given there was only a 50% to 60% chance that a full-body scanner would have detected the explosives moulded to Abdulmutallab&apos;s body. He said the technology was not a &quot;magic bullet&quot;, echoing the argument of airport owners that an effective security regime must comprise a range of measures, from passenger profiling to x-raying shoes. Technology that tests swabs taken from hand luggage for traces of explosives will also be made mandatory at all airports by the end of the year. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, suggested that those with deep-felt privacy objections should be given the chance to opt for a body pat-down search and challenged the home secretary over child porn laws making it illegal to scan under-18s. But Johnson thought the concerns misplaced: &quot;Given that all the images are destroyed immediately, given that the person responsible for the scanning is completely in a separate room \u2026 they&apos;re important considerations but I think we can actually ensure that those who do have worries can have those concerns satisfied.&quot; Manchester airport, which is testing body scanner technology, mocked up Abdulmutallab&apos;s device on a volunteer recently and spotted it using a scanner. Airport owners hope terminals with body scanners will be able to scale down the extra body searches, which they claim are time-consuming and exhaust staff. Johnson said BAA, which also owns airports at Stansted, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton, has started training security staff in &quot;behavioural analysis techniques&quot; that allow them to spot passengers who pose a potential threat and subject them to additional searches.", "sentences": ["Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab nearly brought down Northwest Airlines flight 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day when he set off an explosive device in his underwear, having apparently smuggled the bomb through airport security in Amsterdam and Lagos where his journey began."], "title": "More body searches, sniffer dogs and luggage inspections in airport security crackdown", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/05/airport-security-searches-terrorism-uk", "tags": ["Air transport", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Counter-terrorism policy", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-06T10:03:05Z", "article": "Barring legal action, Courtney Love plans to officially resurrect Hole on 17 February, in London.

No one wants to be electronically strip-searched at the start of their holidays. It is an invasion of privacy we would all rather avoid. But the foiled bombing attempt on a Detroit-bound plane over Christmas demonstrates that terrorists still have an unhealthy addiction to air travel, and we have to move with the developing threat. Terrorists do not stand still, and neither can we. The government&apos;s assessment is that there would have been a 60 percent chance of identifying the explosive on Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had he been scanned. I agree that the timing of the government&apos;s announcement is not great. In the aftermath of an attack or an attempted attack, such policies are a visible way for a government to demonstrate that it is taking action. However, four of these \u00a3100,000 machines have lain in storage in Heathrow despite successful trials over the last few years. Seventeen of these machines remain mothballed in Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, where the would-be bomber Abdulmutallab stopped off in transit. The government has been in no rush to introduce what we are now being told is an effective way of detecting would-be bombers. This is not acceptable. If they are effective, tested and available, they should have been rolled out years ago, and not as a knee-jerk reaction to an attempted terrorist attack in the United States. Too often, the immediate response to terror attacks or the threat of terror attacks has been disproportionate. For example, there was the proposal for 90 days detention without charge, the Belmarsh provisions locking people up by ministerial fiat, control orders imposing house arrest, and ID cards. Body scanners are, though, different. They can be an effective tool, but we should properly consider the implications for privacy rather than react on instinct. The government has promised a code of conduct, and assures us (and particularly children&apos;s groups) that images cannot be stored. Moreover, the operator of the scanner will not be able to see the person being scanned. These are all reassuring points, but it might be sensible to make provision for people who refuse to be scanned. Surely there should be some alternative in place for those people \u2013 such as a rigorous pat down. Safeguards must also be put in place to prevent staff members from copying or putting on the internet pictures of children, celebrities or those with strange body shapes. These assurances should be enshrined in a statutory code, rather than a mere code of conduct. If these safeguards are met, body scanners are surely better than allowing would-be bombers to slip through security. Apart from scanners, the government&apos;s review has so far only yielded the proposal for profiling, but this can hide a multitude of sins. The profiling of passengers based purely on race, for example, would be invidious. It would also be deeply counter-productive as it would be likely to alienate the very communities on whom we rely for intelligence about terrorists, and as witnesses if we are to secure convictions. If profiling merely means particularly diligent searches of people with a recent travel itinerary that includes Waziristan, Somalia and the Yemen, there cannot surely be an objection.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, was indicted yesterday on charges including attempted murder and trying to use a weapon of mass destruction to kill nearly 300 people aboard the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. He has reportedly told US intelligence officials that he was trained in Yemen, raising fears about the spread of extremism in the country. &quot;The information provided to us is that Umar Farouk joined al-Qaida in London,&quot; Rashad al-Alimi, Yemen&apos;s deputy prime minister for defence and security, told a news conference. Senior British counterterrorism officials dismissed the claims, saying there was no evidence to back them up. Sources in the UK said Abdulmutallab&apos;s radicalisation began at his school in Togo and peaked in a six-month period in Yemen before the attempted bombing. He came to MI5&apos;s attention during the three years he studied mechanical engineering at University College London, because of his internet activity and contacts with certain websites, security sources said. That information was passed to US agencies but there was nothing to suggest Abdulmutallab was a terrorist threat, they added. &quot;As far as we can see, while in the UK he expressed an interest in radical Islamism and reaching out [to it],&quot; said a well-placed security source. However, MI5 did not consider Abdulmutallab to be a threat to national security by the time he left Britain. Alimi said that during Abdulmutallab&apos;s stay in Yemen, he may have met the radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and al-Qaida leaders. Awlaki gained notoriety last year when it emerged that he exchanged dozens of emails with Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people in a mass shooting at the Fort Hood army post in Texas on 5 November. The cleric is popular among al-Qaida sympathisers for his calls for holy war. Alimi said Yemen had arrested and was interrogating a number of al-Qaida elements who had contacts with Abdulmutallab. Yemen&apos;s foreign minister, Abubakr al-Qirbi, said today that fighting militants was the country&apos;s &quot;priority&quot;, despite facing a Shia revolt in the north and simmering separatist sentiment in the south, but rejected foreign intervention. &quot;I think the US, as well, have learned from Afghanistan and Iraq and other places that direct intervention can be self-defeating,&quot; he told CNN. Barack Obama is due to disclose more information about the failed airline bomb plot today and detail the steps he is taking to prevent future terrorist attacks.

On Tuesday, Obama criticised intelligence agencies, saying the system &quot;has failed in a potentially disastrous way&quot;. But he is not expected to announce any firings as a result of the security failings. Abdulmutallab&apos;s father had warned US officials that Abdulmutallab had drifted into extremism in Yemen, but that threat was never identified fully by intelligence officials. The Los Angeles Times, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, reported last night that US border security officials learned of Abdulmutallab&apos;s alleged extremist links while he was en route to Detroit and had decided to question him when he landed. The Department of Homeland Security had no immediate comment. The president&apos;s comments today will be the sixth time he has spoken publicly on the incident. He is eager to provide the public with reassurances while at the same time moving public attention back to the administration&apos;s efforts to expand healthcare and boost the economy.

The review into the performance of the US intelligence community concluded that there had been three key failures: to take seriously the threat posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; to put all the known pieces together; and to place the alleged bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, on a US terrorist watch list that would have prevented him flying. The six-page review concluded: &quot;The US government had sufficient information to have uncovered and potentially disrupted the December 25 attack \u2013 including by placing Mr Abdulmutallab on the no-fly list \u2013 but analysts within the counter-terrorism community failed to connect the dots that could have identified and warned of the specific threat.&quot; Obama, resisting political and media pressure for sackings, said he was less interested in heads rolling than in fixing the problem. &quot;I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from, and correcting, these mistakes, to make us safer.&quot; As commander in chief, he said, &quot;ultimately, the buck stops with me&quot;. Although he said it was not the fault of a single individual or organisation, the conclusions of the review were harsher. There are a dozen major US intelligence agencies, but the review focused almost exclusively on the CIA and National Counter-Terrorism Centre, which was set up in 2004 as part of a reform of the intelligence services after the September 11 attacks. Much of the implicit criticism was directed at counter-intelligence analysts at headquarters in the US, rather than those gathering information on the ground abroad. Speaking to reporters at the White House, John Brennan, Obama&apos;s counter-terrorism adviser, defended the head of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, Michael Leiter, who left headquarters the day after the bomb attempt to go skiing. Brennan said he had given Leiter permission to go ahead with a planned holiday with his son. As well as announcing the review&apos;s findings, Obama set out a series of limited reforms for the intelligence community, mainly improved co-ordination and expanding the criteria for adding individuals to the US terrorist list. He also promised to introduce more body scanners at America&apos;s airports and to step up research into better screening technology. Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian student who studied in the UK and spent time in Yemen, is due to appear in court in Detroit today, charged with trying to blow up a US plane on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, after a journey that began in Ghana, with a stop in Nigeria. Yemen, Britain and Nigeria were yesterday engaged in a furious bout of buck-passing over their roles in the bomb plot. Yemen&apos;s deputy prime minster and security supremo, Rashad al-Alimi, sought to deflect criticism by insisting that Abdulmutallab was recruited and radicalised in London \u2013 an assessment flatly rejected by the British security service MI5. Alimi also claimed that Abdulmutallab, who hid the explosives in his underwear, had obtained the explosives in Nigeria, not Yemen. Abdulmutallab&apos;s father in Nigeria alerted the CIA to concerns about his son, and there were other warnings that were not acted on. Officials from the department of homeland security admitted yesterday that they became concerned about Abdulmutallab, but only when he was already in the air en route to Detroit. The Yemen move to shift blame elsewhere comes after reports that the US was planning to seek retribution in the country for the failed bomb attempt. But Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, ruled this out, saying there would be no direct military intervention. The US claims its involvement is confined to indirect aid to Yemen&apos;s armed forces in the fight against al-Qaida and other groups regarded as extremist. Yemen insisted yesterday that the fight against al-Qaida must be conducted by its own forces. Senior British counter-terrorism officials dismissed the claim that Abdulmutallab was recruited in London.

They say, &apos;I\u00a0need this, this and this.&apos; What they mean is, &apos;I want this, this and this.&apos; What they need is probably less food, or more sleep.&quot; Such thinking is typical of the Dutchman who forged a reputation as a straight-talking disciplinarian \u2013 he notoriously branded heptathlete Kelly Sotherton a\u00a0&quot;wimp&quot; after she won Olympic bronze in 2004.

Van Commenee refused to panic and lower the medal target of five, and the team returned home with two gold, two silver and two bronze. The difference, though, was not just in the podium places. There was a tangible excitement around the sport for the first time in years, with the public eager to know more about new household names such as the 23-year-old world champion heptathlete Jessica Ennis. Van Commenee says that indicates the new optimism he has injected. He puts his success down to his emphasis on quality in training, and he has replaced UK Athletics&apos; heavily administrative structure with a\u00a0staff of renowned coaches. &quot;I see coaching as the greatest innovation. Today is different than yesterday. The athletes that you work with are different than yesterday so I have to make unique decisions every day; I have to improvise, adjust and be creative. That is the biggest innovation \u2013 it&apos;s not a new spike, or tighter pants, or attaching the bib number to the body with less aerodynamic resistance.

I stand at the end of the long, long line of good Dutch people who did what I did \u2013 and much more.&quot; She was, however, the material from which the truest, most decent, most steadfast heroes are made. She found, and at great personal risk, preserved the diary of Anne Frank for posterity in 1944 after the girl and her family were caught in hiding by Germans. More than that she was, earlier, the friend who looked after the Frank family in their now world-famous Amsterdam annexe. She shopped for them, watched out for them, cheered them up and gave the adolescent Anne her first \u2013 and only \u2013 pair of high-heeled shoes. Without Miep, the family&apos;s two years in hiding would have been impossible. After their capture, she tried to buy the people of the annexe back from Gestapo officers, only to be called &quot;schweinehund&quot; and thrown out. When Anne&apos;s father, Otto, returned from the camps as the Franks&apos; only survivor, he lived as one of her family for some years. In the 1950s, as the diary began to win a reputation, Miep was one of a wide range of people investigated on suspicion that she had betrayed the Franks to the Nazis. Otto stopped the investigation with a sentence: &quot;If you suspect Miep, you suspect me.&quot; She was the last human link with the concealed but intense life in the secret building on the Prinsengracht canal, now known as the Anne Frank House, which attracts about a million visitors a year. Like the Franks, who were German Jews, Gies was not Dutch. She was born Hermine Santruschitz, in Vienna, Austria. But, because her body became wasted through undernourishment during the first world war, she was sent with other Austrian workers&apos; children to be revitalised in the Netherlands. She took to Holland, reached the top of her Dutch language class within months and was happy when her stay was prolonged. By agreement with her natural parents, she was adopted by a middle-class Dutch family, the Nieuwenburgs, while keeping her Austrian citizenship \u2013 it was the Nieuwenburgs who nicknamed her Miep. As an adolescent, she read Baruch Spinoza and Isaac Beeckman, kept a diary and \u2013 like Anne \u2013 had &quot;a deep longing for an understanding of life&quot;. In 1933, she answered a newspaper advert for a job in Otto Frank&apos;s firm, which sold pectin, for home jam-making. After a few weeks on jam-making duties, she was given an office job, dealing with customer complaints. In 1941, after the German occupation of Holland, Miep became a Dutch citizen by marrying Jan Gies, a social worker. The Frank family provided their wedding breakfast and Anne, then 12, gave them a silver plate. In June 1942, Anne&apos;s elder sister, Margot, was sent papers ordering her to report for forced labour in Germany. The Franks, with others, went into hiding in the annexe with a concealed entrance accessible from Otto&apos;s office. Jan, active in the Dutch resistance, got them forged ration cards. Miep, with 10 mouths to feed in a time of increasing scarcity, did so by cultivating relationships with black-market shopkeepers. Her memoir, Anne Frank Remembered (1982), gives a unique glimpse of Anne&apos;s intentness as a writer. Interrupting her at work without meaning to, Miep saw &quot;a look on her face I&apos;d never seen before \u2013 of dark concentration, as if she had a throbbing headache. The look pierced me and I was speechless. She was suddenly another person, writing at the table. It was as if I had interrupted an intimate moment in a very, very private friendship.&quot; On 4 August 1944, the police came. Miep heard the sound of the fugitives&apos; feet as they were led down the annexe staircase like &quot;beaten dogs&quot;. According to her book, the investigating German officer was about to arrest Miep as an accomplice when she noticed his Viennese accent. She mentioned the link, and after some thought he said, &quot;From personal sympathy ... from me personally, you can stay. But God help you if you run away. Then we take your husband.&quot; Later, Miep retrieved Anne&apos;s clothbound diary and shawl. In June 1945, Otto returned alone from Auschwitz. Margot and Anne had died in the Belsen concentration camp of typhoid weeks before the liberation. Each year, on 4 August, Miep and her husband would stay silently at home, marking the day of the family&apos;s arrest. Only when the diary was published in 1947 could Miep bring herself to read it. She realised that if she had known its contents before liberation she would have had to destroy it. It gave too many people away. In 1950, when she had a son, Miep used Anne&apos;s shawl to keep her baby warm. During the Victory in Europe commemoration in 1995, Miep came to London for a joint Jewish and Christian memorial service for Anne Frank mounted at St Paul&apos;s Cathedral by the Anne Frank Educational Trust. She said the diary had done much good, but she still wished daily that the family had survived instead. &quot;A human being is more than a book.&quot; She possessed a straightforward, unshakeable sense of her human duties and carried them out whatever the rigours and the fear. Miep and Jan continued to live in Amsterdam until Jan&apos;s death in 1993. On her 100th birthday she asked that the many &quot;unnamed heroes&quot; who helped Dutch Jews to escape deportation and death should be remembered: &quot;I would like to name one, my husband Jan. He was a resistance man who said nothing but did a lot. People like him existed in thousands but were never heard.&quot; She is survived by her son, Paul, and three grandchildren. \u2022 Miep Gies, secretary and resistance worker, born 15 February 1909; died 11 January 2010", "sentences": ["More than that she was, earlier, the friend who looked after the Frank family in their now world-famous Amsterdam annexe.", "Miep and Jan continued to live in Amsterdam until Jan&apos;s death in 1993."], "title": "Miep Gies obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/12/miep-gies-obituary", "tags": ["Second world war", "Books", "Judaism", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-13T17:54:00Z", "article": "Many classical music lovers will remember the extraordinary sight of\u00a0the white geodesic dome used by the chamber group Domus in the early 1980s. Domus was founded by the American cellist Felix Wurman, who has died of cancer, aged 51. Felix met his Domus colleagues at the International Musicians&apos; Seminars in Cornwall, where he was studying with Johannes Goritzki. The group wanted to find a way of presenting chamber music to new audiences in\u00a0a friendly, informal setting. When someone jokingly advocated a portable concert hall, Felix was inspired to build a geodesic dome which could be assembled in just a few hours by the players themselves. His energy and charisma swept many into his search for a way to make music both meaningful and fun. The dome became a cherished sight at festivals, on hilltops and in city parks. The players (I was the pianist) lived and breathed music. Felix was constantly experimenting with innovations, such as making food for the audience and the filming of concerts at a time when this was still unusual. His search for the perfect cappuccino ran parallel to our travels. Felix was born in Chicago but came to London in 1976 to study for two years with Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9. After eight years in Europe, he returned to the US and was a member of Chicago&apos;s Lyric Opera Orchestra from 1984 to 1988. His interest in period instruments led him to study in Amsterdam with Anner Bylsma, who encouraged him to build a five-string cello, which he used in his recording of the Bach suites. In\u00a01998 he moved to Albuquerque to\u00a0join the New Mexico Symphony. He later founded a series of concerts incorporating music, poetry, silence and free coffee.

There he was in 1973, the world&apos;s most cutting-edge pop star: half the country certain he&apos;s rock&apos;s saviour, the other half terrified, seemingly convinced he actually is some kind of gay alien sex demagogue on Earth to corrupt youth. He has achieved this via stunning records and provocations: telling the press he&apos;s homosexual, pretending to fellate his guitarist on stage, suddenly announcing his retirement. It has all been brilliantly planned and executed, which makes the reappearance of music he made years before devising Ziggy Stardust all the more agonising. Worse, the song his old label has rereleased and seen rise to No 6 in the charts is The Laughing Gnome, a 1967 novelty that has also been covered by crooner Ronnie Hilton. The Laughing Gnome fitted perfectly with Hilton&apos;s oeuvre \u2013 his big hit being that one about a mouse living in a windmill in old Amsterdam \u2013 which obviously makes it profoundly unsuitable material for a terrifying gay alien sex demagogue to be caught singing in public. Perhaps understandably, Bowie long evinced a strained relationship with his 60s work, first ignoring it, then rerecording some of it in 2002, for the unreleased album Toy. Its reputation was further damaged by his former manager Kenneth Pitt&apos;s book The Pitt Report, notable both for a diverting interlude in which Bowie inadvertently sees Pitt&apos;s penis and pretends to measure it while bellowing &quot;ye gods!&quot; and its demented premise that Bowie&apos;s 60s work was unequivocally the artistic highlight of his career. The other bit \u2013 when he became the most important artist since the Beatles and somehow made four of the greatest albums ever while so maddened by cocaine he allegedly stored his own urine in the fridge in case a wizard stole it \u2013 was merely the unasked-for, complimentary After Eight following the creative smorgasbord that was When I&apos;m Five and Ching-a-Ling. It&apos;s so insanely wrong-headed that it reflects badly on the music; anything requiring that much special pleading must be rubbish. Fans&apos; usual reaction to the eponymous debut album and singles contained on this deluxe edition is to note the themes that would inform his later work, then discreetly file them away: She&apos;s Got Medals touches on sexual ambiguity; Uncle Arthur on mental illness; Maid of Bond Street on fame. We Are Hungry Men, meanwhile, features an unexpected impersonation of Kenneth Williams alongside the first flowering of the obsession with dystopias and messianic dictators that would come to an unhappy head with some addled praise for Hitler in interviews circa the piss-in-the-fridge years. Alas, his later dalliances with Nietzschean ubermensch theory passed without further recourse to his Williams impersonation: perhaps if he&apos;d interspersed his remarks about how a fascist leader would be good for Britain with a few cries of &quot;Ooh matron!&quot; and &quot;Stop messin&apos; ABOUT!&quot;, it would have leavened the atmosphere a bit. In fact Bowie spent the 60s doing exactly what he did for the rest of his career: trying on musical styles, from then-voguish mock Edwardiana to big orchestrated ballads. The difference was that not all of them fit. He couldn&apos;t do Kinks-inspired satire, not least because the music he set it to reeked of cosy light entertainment: Join the Gang&apos;s hippy-mocking seems hopelessly square, like something Dick Emery would have sung while wearing a kaftan. Ching-a-Ling suggests trying out Incredible String Band acid-folk whimsy was the most catastrophic career decision he made until he opted to go dancing in the street with Mick Jagger: &quot;I wish I played the doo-dah horn&quot; indeed. And yet Bowie&apos;s 60s work deserves better than the dustbin of history. Let Me Sleep Beside You and In the Heat of the Morning prove he was already a lavishly gifted songwriter. Furthermore, he was already able to do things others could not. Caught up in the 60s&apos; heady whirl, most pop stars were disinclined to write about the era&apos;s darker side. With his nose pressed against the pane of the Swinging London party, Bowie could offer a more clear-headed view of the times, hence The London Boys, a remarkable monochrome drama of poverty, amphetamine psychosis and intimations of homosexuality, set in grimy bedsits and Wardour Street cafes. But you listen even to David Bowie&apos;s highlights knowing that their failure was imperative. Had anything here succeeded commercially, it would have been a disaster, not merely for Bowie, but rock in general: he would have become only briefly famous for his ballads, novelty songs or, worst of all, his doo-dah horn. As it was, necessity proved the mother of the greatest reinvention pop has ever seen.", "sentences": ["The Laughing Gnome fitted perfectly with Hilton&apos;s oeuvre \u2013 his big hit being that one about a mouse living in a windmill in old Amsterdam \u2013 which obviously makes it profoundly unsuitable material for a terrifying gay alien sex demagogue to be caught singing in public."], "title": "David Bowie: David Bowie (Deluxe Edition) | CD review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/14/david-bowie-album-review", "tags": ["David Bowie", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-15T00:05:04Z", "article": "The tough Mediterranean grass jabs your eyes with emerald and sea-green, olive and fire. It is overpowering that anyone can see so much colour, life and mystery in a little patch of ground. When you know more about when and where the canvas that now hangs in London&apos;s National Gallery was glorified with colour, it is still more moving. Vincent van Gogh painted Long Grass with Butterflies in 1890 in the grounds of an asylum, where he was a patient. Whenever he was well enough in the hospital at Saint-R\u00e9my in \u00adProvence he set up his easel in its gardens or went under supervision into the surrounding wheatfields. But he was not always well enough. He came to the asylum after suffering \u00adhallucinations \u2013 and these hallucinations returned. During his bad periods he tried to stuff the paints into his mouth, washed down by turpentine \u2013 to poison himself with colour. Look at this painting in the light of those facts. Picture the mental patient standing there, staring at the ground. Then look at what he sees. He sees grass as firm as flesh. He sees colours as full as the heart. Nature absorbs him. To look at this painting is to look at something heroic. Nothing is braver than to confront illness as Van Gogh did. A troubled soul since his youth in southern Holland, someone whose family fretted that he could not find a place in the world, he ended up by 1890, in his 37th year, in the strangest and most tragic of situations. He was increasingly recognised \u2013 at least among the Paris avant garde \u2013 as a brilliant artist. But he was also unquestionably ill. How did his art and illness interact? Was painting a potential cure, or a symptom? Van Gogh contemplated both possibilities. But what he did not do is give up. He looked with pity on other inmates who sat somnolently while he worked. This was no enlightened modern hospital but an asylum of the Victorian age, where the doctor who admitted Van Gogh inadequately diagnosed &quot;epilepsy&quot;. In that place he painted this rapturous garden. In the last few weeks I have been overwhelmed by the relationship \u00adbetween Van Gogh&apos;s biography and his genius. The curators of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam have worked for years on a new edition of his letters, five volumes of them, with facsimiles, English translations, copious illustrations: in short, such a complete insight into Van Gogh&apos;s life that it redefines him for this century. An exhibition, The Real Van Gogh: The Artist and his Letters, opening at the Royal Academy on 23 January, celebrates this publication. Reading the new edition of Van Gogh&apos;s letters from cover to cover turned out to be a shocking, upsetting, at times frustrating experience that destroyed my previous idea of this great artist. I had previously formed an almost reassuring view of Van Gogh as an intense, troubled, tragic, yet at the same time inspiring man. The sheer mass of peculiarities and sadnesses makes him uttely real and \u2013 for all his genius \u2013 less easy to empathise with. His achievement was not to conquer illness, but to drag something out of its isolating darkness. Long before he became an artist, he was a writer. &quot;Theo, I must recommend that you start smoking a pipe. It does you a lot of good when you&apos;re out of spirits, as I quite often am nowadays.&quot; So writes Van Gogh to his younger brother in one of his very first letters, offering advice on how to fight a melancholy like that which gnaws at him. His earliest surviving letters date from 1872, when he was 19. His very first, dated 29 September 1872, is addressed to Theo \u2013 as is his last, dated 23 July 1890. He wrote to other people too \u2013 including artist friends such as Emile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, and his sister Wilhelmina, who was herself to spend decades in an asylum. Together these letters amount to a literary work of epic proportions. It&apos;s not just that Van Gogh wrote letters. He poured his heart into them. The long epistles he sent Theo, who worked as an art dealer and was the single greatest emotional and financial prop in Vincent&apos;s life, are diaristic \u00adexplorations of every facet of his life. You smell the very tobacco-laden breath and musty clothes of Van Gogh. The shape of the man these massed words slowly reveal is much baggier and saggier and perplexing than any actor in any film could portray. Often the silences say the most. A series of letters from 1880 were destroyed by his family for the embarrassing reason that in these months his father was making active plans to have him incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital. This was nearly a decade before the crisis that led to his eventual hospitalisation. Van Gogh&apos;s family doubted his mental wellbeing all along. Reading these letters it becomes all too clear that this was why his brother Theo \u00adundertook to support him to be an artist. The tensions the letters expose in their relationship \u2013 Vincent accuses Theo of not even trying to sell his paintings \u2013 suggest that until quite late on, Theo saw his brother&apos;s art \u00adessentially as therapy. When it became more than that, it was to kill them both \u2013 for when Vincent succumbed to his visionary extremes, his brother&apos;s health collapsed and he died soon afterwards like a grief-struck spouse. The copiousness, too, is eloquent. The excess of Van Gogh&apos;s need to communicate becomes tragic. It so clearly exceeds what Theo can say in reply, what anyone can say. &quot;Why am I telling you all this? \u2013 not to grumble, not to apologise . . .&quot; &quot;I jotted a few things down in the train and am sending you that, just so you can see how my trip went . . .&quot; &quot;I want answer your letter of this morning straightaway . . .&quot; You start to feel these letters constitute his real life, the pen and paper his own real companions. Sometimes he gets a reply, sometimes he doesn&apos;t. Always he is alone. Art saves him. His letters take on a new joy and conviction when he starts teaching himself to draw. The most uplifting letter he ever wrote was sent from Etten, where his parents were then living, to Theo in September 1881. In it, he describes his efforts to draw the local peasants at work and in their cottages. The reason it is so beautiful is that he includes sketches of what he has been doing. These sketches are marvellous \u2013 even though he has only recently started drawing, and has no formal art education. He is so manifestly gifted. He is, suddenly, on his way. As he says in the letter, &quot;a change has come about in my drawing . . . I&apos;m no longer so powerless in the face of nature as I used to be.&quot; This is such a good new start, you are crushed that it did not lead to a steady improvement. Instead, he fell out with his family (again), set up studio in The Hague, but alienated his friends there \u2013 not to mention Theo, who was paying. His drawing went on getting stronger but there was no parallel conquest of everyday life. Nor did things improve when he migrated to France. Here, he met the avant-garde \u2013 he knew Toulouse-\u00adLautrec and Pissarro, as well as the mercurial, arrogant, uncompromising genius Paul Gauguin, who was already anticipating aspects of abstract art. Then on 20 February 1888 he got off the train in Arles in Provence, where he planned to found a colony for artists, a &quot;studio of the south&quot;. The collapse of that dream is the most infamous chapter in his life. After a lot of cajoling from Theo, Gauguin agreed to stay with Vincent, as potentially the leader of the studio. At first they worked \u00adtogether superbly \u2013 Gauguin explained his abstract understanding of colour to Van Gogh, and both of them painted blazing portraits and landscapes side by side. But they started arguing, Van Gogh got more and more stressed, and suddenly confronted Gauguin with a razor. That same night he cut off part of his own ear and gave the bloody flesh to a horrified prostitute. Incidentally, the expanded letters expose as nonsense the ridiculous idea floated last year that Gauguin cut off Van Gogh&apos;s ear with a sword. No reader can miss the emotional thread of self-violence in them \u2013 and a clear statement of what happened appears in a letter where he actually says, &quot;I . . . wounded myself,&quot; while denying that he is a danger to others. But the letters put this, the central crisis of his life that led to his entering the asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my and from which he never recovered his mental composure, in a deeper perpective. The full correspondence lets you see how spiritually intoxicated he was before Gauguin arrived. Almost as soon as he got to Arles, the red-headed northerner started painting in a new, incomparable way. The sun entered his paints. It got in his head \u2013 &quot;I feel fine working outside in the hottest part of the day. It&apos;s a clean, dry heat . . . Naturally this induces orange \u2013 a face tanned by the sun looks orange . . . my complexion has changed from green-grey pink to grey-orange, and I have a white suit instead of a blue one, and am always dusty . . .&quot; Vast suns blazing above golden fields, sunflowers engorging light like immense yellow giant stars: his paintings from these months are like hot stones lifted up from a Proven\u00e7al field. They are fire. Van Gogh came to believe he was mad when he made them. In letters written after the crisis, he has time for acutely painful self-\u00adanalysis. &quot;It&apos;s funny that every time I try to reason with myself in order to get a clear picture of things \u2013 why I came here . . . a terrible horror and terror seizes me and prevents me from thinking.&quot; Yet fighting this horror, he starts to ascribe his problems to the very heat and excitement of the \u00adregion, rather than to a simple falling out with Gauguin. Moreover, the illness is inseparable from the artistic triumph Provence inspired. This is surely a true insight into these rapturous paintings. Art historians like to claim that Van Gogh&apos;s illness had nothing to do with his art&apos;s greatness. His letters, though, suggest otherwise. Was the sun simply too much for him? This is simplistic and yet the paintings tell of a great \u00adsensual opening up. Van Gogh&apos;s inability to form a long-lasting relationship with a woman torments him in his letters. His religious background was forbidding. He certainly was not sexually inactive \u2013 his letters reveal at least three lovers and regular visits to brothels \u2013 but something deep in him that had never found satisfaction before was released by the Mediterranenan light. It isn&apos;t just a calm, rational love of bright colours that we see in his masterpieces. It is more woozy and more brilliant \u2013 a place in his mind where he thinks, feels, exists, in pure colour. The intoxication of 1888 never left him. In the asylum, his colours become more subtle \u2013 blues and greens displace the vibrant yellows \u2013 but the profundity and insistence of his paintings does not lessen, it grows. His letters make terrible reading as the tragedy unfolds. The better his painting gets, the worse his bouts of total unreason become. At the asylum he has periods of constant work interrupted by complete breakdowns, after which he cannot remember what happened. Meanwhile, Theo writes about Dr Gachet, a friend of Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne whose sympathy for artists might enable him to informally care for Vincent. Theo is married and a new father, but also ill, and worried about his job. When Vincent finally heads north, his meeting with Theo in Paris apparently disturbs him. He feels guilty about the financial burden he has placed on his brother. He seems not to see \u2013 and perhaps Theo doesn&apos;t either \u2013 that he is on the edge of fame, even of making money. In Auvers-sur-Oise, a village near Paris, the good Dr Gachet keeps an eye on him. He goes on painting, painting so well. Deep blues and blacks and vegetable greens. The colours of the north, now \u2013 the colours of rain. He includes a sketch of one of his new paintings, showing the garden of the landscape artist Daubigny, in a letter he sends to Theo on 23 July 1890. In a postcript after the &quot;Yours truly, Vincent&quot; he adds an account of the colours in his painting for Theo to imagine them: &quot;Foreground of green and pink grass, on the left a green and lilac bush and a stem of plants with whitish foliage. In the middle a bed of roses. To the right a hurdle, a wall, and above the wall a hazel tree with violet foliage. &quot;Then a hedge of lilac, a row of rounded yellow lime trees. The house itself in the background, pink with a roof of bluish tiles. A bench and three chairs, a dark figure with a yellow hat, and in the foreground a black cat. Sky pale green.&quot; In French the last words are &quot;Ciel vert p\u00e2le&quot; and then a brown ink full stop. Three days after sending this, his last letter, he shot himself under the pale green sky.", "sentences": ["The curators of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam have worked for years on a new edition of his letters, five volumes of them, with facsimiles, English translations, copious illustrations: in short, such a complete insight into Van Gogh&apos;s life that it redefines him for this century."], "title": "Van Gogh: in his own words", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/15/van-gogh-his-own-words", "tags": ["Van Gogh", "Art and design", "Painting", "Art", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-15T00:37:00Z", "article": "&apos;I don&apos;t get anything out of sex with prostitutes except for a bad feeling,&quot; says Ben. An apparently average, thirtysomething, middle-class man, Ben had taken an extended lunchbreak from his job in advertising to talk about his experiences of buying sex. Shy and slightly nervous, he told me, &quot;I am hoping that talking about it might help me work out why I do it.&quot; I, too, was hoping to understand his motives better. Ben was one of 700 men interviewed for a major international research project seeking to uncover the reality about men who buy sex. The project spanned six countries, and of the 103 customers we spoke to in London \u2013 where I was one of the researchers \u2013 most were surprisingly keen to discuss their experiences. The men didn&apos;t fall into obvious stereotypes. They were aged between 18 and 70 years old; they were white, black, Asian, eastern European; most were employed and many were \u00adeducated beyond school level. In the main they were presentable, polite, with average-to-good social skills. Many were husbands and boyfriends; just over half were either married or in a relationship with a woman. Research published in 2005 found that the numbers of men who pay for sex had doubled in a decade. The \u00adauthors attributed this rise to &quot;a greater acceptability of commercial sexual contact&quot;, yet many of our \u00adinterviewees told us that they felt \u00adintense guilt and shame about paying for sex. &quot;I&apos;m not satisfied in my mind&quot; was how one described his feelings after paying for sex. Another told me that he felt &quot;disappointed \u2013 what a waste of money&quot;, &quot;lonely still&quot; and &quot;guilty about my relationship with my wife&quot;. In fact, many of the men were a mass of contradictions. Despite finding their experiences &quot;unfulfilling, empty, terrible&quot;, they continued to visit prostitutes. I interviewed 12 of the men, and found it a fascinating experience. One told me about his experience of childhood cruelty and neglect and linked this to his inability to form close \u00adrelationships with anyone, particularly women. Alex admitted sex with \u00adprostitutes made him feel empty, but he had no idea how to get to know women &quot;through the usual routes&quot;. When I asked him about his feelings \u00adtowards the women he buys he said that on the one hand, he wants \u00adprostitutes to get to know and like him and, on the other, he is &quot;not under \u00addelusions&quot; that the encounters are anything like a real relationship. &quot;I want my ideal prostitute not to behave like one,&quot; he said, &quot;to role-play to be a pretend girlfriend, a casual date, not business-like or mechanical. To a third person it looks like we&apos;re in love.&quot; I felt compassion for Alex. No one had shown him how to form a bond with another human being and he was searching for something that commercial sex was never going to provide. But another of the interviewees left me feeling concerned. Darren was young, good-looking and bright; I asked him how often he thought the women he paid enjoyed the sex. &quot;I don&apos;t want them to get any pleasure,&quot; he told me. &quot;I am paying for it and it is her job to give me pleasure. If she enjoys it I would feel cheated.&quot; I asked if he felt prostitutes were different to other women. &quot;The fact that they&apos;re prepared to do that job where others won&apos;t, even when they&apos;re skint, means\u00a0there&apos;s some capability inside them that permits them to do it and not be disgusted,&quot; he said. He seemed full of a festering, potentially explosive\u00a0misogyny. When asked what would end \u00adprostitution, one interviewee laughed and said, &quot;Kill all the girls.&quot; Paul told me that it would take &quot;all the men to be locked up&quot;. But most of them told the researchers that they would be \u00adeasily deterred if the current laws were implemented. Fines, public \u00adexposure, employers being informed, being issued with an Asbo or the risk of a criminal record would stop most of the men from continuing to pay for sex. Discovering the women were \u00adtrafficked, pimped or otherwise coerced would appear not to be so \u00adeffective. Almost half said they \u00adbelieved that most women in prostitution are victims of pimps (&quot;the pimp does the \u00adpsychological raping of the woman,&quot; explained one). But they still continued to visit them. An upcoming new law will make it illegal for men to pay for sex with a trafficked or pimped woman \u2013 and a punter&apos;s ignorance of a woman&apos;s \u00adcircumstances will be no defence. Critics have suggested that this is \u00adunfair, that a man can&apos;t possibly know whether a woman is being exploited. Our interviews challenged this \u00adnotion. The men knew, to some extent, about abuse and coercion in prostitution \u2013 they weren&apos;t operating under the \u00adconvenient illusion that women enter the trade because they love sex. More than half admitted that they either knew or believed that a majority of women in prostitution were lured, tricked or trafficked. More than one third said they thought the prostitutes they visited had been trafficked to London from another country, and a small number said they suspected that they had \u00adencountered a trafficking victim based on the woman&apos;s inability to speak the local language or on how young or vulnerable they appeared. &quot;I could tell she was new to the country,&quot; said one man. &quot;To be new in a country and be a prostitute \u2013 it can&apos;t be a choice . . . She looked troubled.&quot; Another said that he had &quot;seen women with bruises, cuts and eastern European accents in locations where lots of trafficked women and girls are&quot;. One man suspected that an African woman he had met was \u00adtrafficked \u00adbecause &quot;she was frightened and \u00adnervous. She told me she had been tricked. I had sex with her and she seemed fine with the sex. She asked me to help her, but I said there was little I could do. She might have been lying to me.&quot; One of the most interesting findings was that many believed men would &quot;need&quot; to rape if they could not pay for sex on demand. One told me, &quot;Sometimes you might rape someone: you can go to a prostitute instead.&quot; Another put it like this: &quot;A desperate man who wants sex so bad, he needs sex to be relieved. He might rape.&quot; I concluded from this that it&apos;s not feminists such as Andrea Dworkin and myself who are responsible for the idea that all men are potential rapists \u2013 it&apos;s sometimes men themselves. Half of the interviewees had bought sex outside of the UK, mostly in Amsterdam, and visiting an area where prostitution is legal or openly advertised had given them a renewed dedication to buying sex when they returned to the UK. Almost half said that they first paid for sex when they were below the age of 21. &quot;Dad took me and my older brother,&quot; said David. &quot;He paid. Maybe he wanted to make sure we weren&apos;t gay. We went to a brothel. Dad didn&apos;t do it, and I don&apos;t think he told my mum.&quot; Another man paid for sex during a stag trip to Thailand with eight of his friends. He was disappointed. &quot;It was a Russian girl, it wasn&apos;t the \u00adescort experience. She didn&apos;t want to talk, just lay on the bed and wanted to do the [sex] act only.&quot; Many men seemed to want a real relationship with a woman and were disappointed when this didn&apos;t develop: &quot;It&apos;s just a sex act, no emotion. Be prepared to accept this or don&apos;t go at all. It&apos;s not a wife or girlfriend.&quot; \u00adOthers were clear that they paid for sex in order to be able to totally control the encounter, including Bob, who said, &quot;Look, men pay for women because he can have whatever and whoever he wants. Lots of men go to prostitutes so they can do things to them that real women would not put up with.&quot; Although some of the men said they thought the women they bought \u00adenjoyed the sex, many others admitted that they thought the women would be feeling &quot;disgusted&quot;, &quot;miserable&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot; and &quot;scared&quot;. Ahmed said he thought the woman might feel &quot;relief that I&apos;m not going to kill her&quot;. Only 6% of the men we spoke to had been arrested for soliciting \u00adprostitutes. &quot;Deterrents would only work if \u00adenforced,&quot; said one. &quot;Any negative would make you reconsider. The law&apos;s not enforced now, but if any negative thing happened as a consequence it would deter me.&quot; Perhaps the new law will make Albert think twice about paying for sex. He told me, &quot;If I&apos;d get in trouble for doing it, I wouldn&apos;t do it. In this country, the police are fine with men visiting prostitutes.&quot; Read the research project&apos;s report here (pdf) All names have been changed. Why do you think men pay for sex?

He will also be remembered for raising the profile of public health and his 1998 Acheson report on health inequalities. The shock of the emergence of a deadly new epidemic, Aids, is only equalled by the shock, in retrospect, of Acheson&apos;s ability to persuade Margaret Thatcher&apos;s Conservative government to adopt a liberal approach to tackling the sexually driven disease. It involved concentrating on massive health education programmes, in parallel with detailed plans to accurately track and combat the spread of the disease. He persuaded ministers to abandon a proposal for the compulsory testing of Aids and avoid making it a compulsory notifiable disease \u2013 on the grounds that it would deter patients from seeking help, as earlier exercises with sexual epidemic campaigns had experienced. The focus was on harm reduction not prohibition. Safe sex rather than no sex. He even obtained Conservative consent to what was, in effect, a scheme which condoned illegal drug use \u2013 needle exchanges for drug addicts, which had demonstrated their success in dramatically reducing the spread of the disease in Amsterdam and Berlin. How did he do it? Acheson, born in Belfast and educated at Merchiston Castle school, Edinburgh, and Brasenose College, Oxford, arrived at the Health Department after spending more than 20 years studying diseases in hospitals or medical research units in London, Oxford and Southampton. Better still, in terms of the impending Aids crisis, he was an epidemiologist: an investigator of the causes and control of epidemics. He brought with him an important epidemiological principle: all actions should be based on scientific evidence and, where evidence is lacking, a precautionary principle should be applied. There were a mere 28 known Aids cases in the UK when he started work as CMO. There was no Aids policy and no known cure. One initial challenge facing the new CMO was the need to integrate two separate medical worlds: biomedicine and public health (screening, education, epidemiology). He also successfully bridged two other groups: the medical world and the gay community, where the disease initially was most prevalent. He set up an informal group of senior medics and public health officials, to which he also invited people from the Terrence Higgins Trust, an HIV charity with its roots in the gay community. From there he moved on to establishing an expert advisory group, which he chaired. As one medical historian has noted: &quot;His passionate conviction that this epidemic must be quashed before it could take hold was one of his main strengths in persuading the government and his colleagues to take the disease seriously.&quot; She added that Acheson &quot;ate and slept Aids from 1985 onwards&quot;. The large, well-funded and sustained education campaign began in 1986 with press and television adverts along with &quot;Aids \u2013 don&apos;t die of ignorance&quot; leaflets circulated to 23m homes. Ministerial press briefings followed. By February 1987, an Aids week involved 19 hours of public service broadcasting across all four existing TV channels. The campaign achieved unstoppable momentum. Acheson went on to \u00adbroker international guidelines within the World Health Organisation, ensuring the dominant ideology remained the British liberal consensus. By the time of his retirement in 1991, Aids in the UK had moved from initial shock through several intermediate phases towards being a manageable chronic condition. Many of the hundreds of hospital beds that had been earmarked were found not necessary. His eight years as CMO ended less happily. First, on the day before he retired, at a press conference on his final annual report, he replied to a journalist who had asked about breast cancer that self-examination was not an effective method of detecting the disease. This was a complete contradiction of government policy and generated a media fuss. Within two weeks of the event, new government guidelines were issued reinforcing the benefits of proper self-examination. More seriously, one ill-advised sentence on BSE 16 months before his retirement ended up with him being censured, long after he had left office, by the committee of inquiry set up to examine the handling of the epidemic. It was a vivid illustration of the perils that CMOs face in their tightrope walk determining risk management. What triggered the furore was the disclosure in May 1990 of a suspected case of BSE in a cat. If there could be a transmission of the disease between animal species, then why not to humans too? Acheson was pressed by the department to make a prompt response. He issued a press statement that the risk posed to human health by BSE was still remote, but he also made a videotape that could be used by television news programmes during which he asserted there was &quot;no risk associated with eating British beef&quot;. It was a much longer explanation, but it was this nugget that was extracted by television news editors. Nearly 10 years later, he told the Phillips committee of inquiry, which criticised him for giving the public &quot;false reassurance&quot;, that &quot;the use of such a phrase must have resulted from a slip of the tongue&quot;. There was a third unhappy part to his final years as CMO: serious attempts to cull his medical staff. Historically within the Department of Health there were two parallel hierarchies: administrative staff who reported to the permanent secretary and medical staff to the CMO. This began in 1919 and by the early 1970s the CMO had a staff of 190. In a world of team medicine, this was questionable, but Acheson argued he could not have achieved his successful Aids campaign without them. He declared: &quot;You cannot be independent if what you have access to is controlled by administrative staff who may have a \u00addifferent agenda.&quot; But Whitehall efficiency reviews in the Thatcher years were unrelenting and merciless. Acheson survived, but only by spending 20% of his time fighting cuts and merger. His successor, Kenneth Calman, declared himself sunk when the 140 staff under him became merged. New Labour repaired some of the damage by the introduction of tsars for several important categories of patients. Of all his achievements \u2013 the founding of the new medical school at Southampton University, his research reports on the health hazards of asbestos and the desperate state of inner-city primary healthcare \u2013 Acheson would probably have been most proud of raising the profile of public health. Both his father, a Northern Ireland doctor, and his older brother Roy, a Cambridge professor, were public health doctors. His last public service, for which he gained widespread respect, was his report on health inequalities in 1998. Recruited by New Labour after the 1997 election, he was given one year to review the current state of inequalities and set out priorities for future policies. True to his reputation, he was on time and in a most thorough manner. He documented the degree to which health inequalities had brutally widened during the Thatcher/Major years and set out 39 recommendations. Many have been implemented \u2013 money for poor families, a restriction on smoking in public places, more money for inner-city schools, better sex education \u2013 but some of the most crucial, such as reducing the incomes gap, remain to be done. Acheson was knighted in 1986. He is survived by his wife Angela and their daughter, and a son and four daughters from his first marriage, to Barbara (another daughter from this marriage predeceased him). \u2022 Ernest Donald Acheson, medical officer, born 17 September 1926; died 10\u00a0January\u00a02010", "sentences": ["He even obtained Conservative consent to what was, in effect, a scheme which condoned illegal drug use \u2013 needle exchanges for drug addicts, which had demonstrated their success in dramatically reducing the spread of the disease in Amsterdam and Berlin."], "title": "Sir Donald Acheson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/15/donald-acheson-obituary", "tags": ["Health", "Health policy", "BSE", "Society", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-16T00:01:00Z", "article": "    A two night break in Amsterdam by high-speed railYou and a partner can win an unforgettable break in fabulous Amsterdam \u2013 the\u00a0vibrant city on the water.\u00a0 Enjoy high-speed rail travel by Eurostar and Thalys \u2013 far less environmentally damaging than travelling by air. www.eurostar.com      A four night break in CornwallWin a luxury break with Beach Retreats, Cornwall&apos;s answer to contemporary self-catering holidays.

There&apos;s a thriving world of academic discussion about gaming but Newsnight Review or The Culture Show hardly ever feature them, and newspapers give them far less coverage than those other pointless-but-fun games played on a field with a ball. It&apos;s curious too that, despite their financial success, it&apos;s so easy to find people who&apos;ve not only never played a videogame but who feel viscerally that they&apos;re a pernicious waste of time. If games are an artform, arts journalism is mostly uninterested. If they&apos;re a sport, they&apos;re not one we treat as admirable. The sale of games is increasing by 20% a year but, outside the gaming press, we&apos;re not really talking about them. Tom Chatfield&apos;s absorbing new book about the gaming industry is therefore to be welcomed. It is cool-headed on issues that can frequently be the subject of overblown hysteria. Chatfield deals thoughtfully with the suggestion that computer games can be &quot;addictive&quot;, pointing out that while troubled people might seek refuge in the imaginary world of a game, an Amsterdam institute set up to treat videogame addiction recently announced that it was abandoning an &quot;addiction style of treatment&quot; because of a lack of evidence that any of its patients really were addicted. He is interesting, too, on the flimsy data connecting videogame violence with real violence and entertainingly demolishes a Sunday Times article purporting to link a German school shooting with the game Far Cry 2. The book is at its best, though, when celebrating the delights and curiosities of videogames. Chatfield introduces the reader to the NeuroSky (&quot;worn like an elaborate pair of headphones, it allows the user to control an electronic device with the power of their mind \u2013 purely by concentrating&quot;) and demonstrates how patterns of infection in an online game are now being used by epidemiologists to study population responses to a pandemic. More importantly, Chatfield&apos;s open-minded approach allows games to be a window to human experience. Did you know, for example, that the amount of time a jump lasts in a game is remarkably consistent across a whole range of titles? A game jump is &quot;around double the duration of the time that an ordinary human can lift themselves off the ground for&quot;. Or that, in online games which could theoretically award millions of (imaginary) gold pieces and mystic swords to every player, &quot;the most successful... emerged as those that imposed brutal regimes of scarcity on their players&quot;? What does it say about us that, given a potential electronic heaven where all our wishes could be granted, we have opted to create starkly unequal worlds, where there&apos;ll never be enough mystic swords for everyone? Fun Inc gives the impression of having been written by someone with a huge amount of absorbing material to present. There are so many anecdotes and byways that the argument can become buried. This isn&apos;t a tremendous problem, however, because the case Chatfield presents is, for all the information he&apos;s compiled, a fairly clear one. Games, he says, have been ignored or fretted over too much. Like television, film, and even reading before them, they&apos;re a victim of our recurring fear that new technologies offer &quot;a perilous, even sinful, amount of ease&quot;. But, Chatfield suggests, our hunger for playfulness is actually a positive sign: in these imaginary worlds we can both escape and strengthen ourselves. The games we create can be both &quot;a critique of what is lacking in many lives&quot;, and &quot;a channel through which those lives might be changed&quot;. For that perspective, this book will make a thought-provoking read for those already won over to the delights of computer games, and an even more important introduction to them for those who remain sceptical.

Despite his minimal contribution to the Mackem cause in recent months, the giant Trinidad &amp; Tobago striker is being touted as a solution to Liverpool&apos;s profligacy in front of goal, with Rafael Ben\u00edtez obviously having spotted something in his return of one goal and one red card in the last 10 games that the rest of us have missed. That&apos;s why he gets paid the big bucks. With just a few coppers and a couple of those 20 drachma coins with the holes bored through the middle that find their way into everyone&apos;s piggy bank to his name, Ben\u00edtez can&apos;t afford a transfer fee and wants to take Jones on loan or trade him in for one used Ryan Babel. The Dutchman&apos;s reluctance to move nearer his native Amsterdam by relocating to Wearside means a loan deal is the more likely option. Elsewhere on the Rumour Mill&apos;s internet machine, we&apos;re unreliably informed that a certain pair of Americans who shall remain nameless have sounded out Mark Hughes about replacing the beleaguered Ben\u00edtez. Whether or not it is true is anyone&apos;s guess, but it certainly wouldn&apos;t be the first time Waldorf and Statler have gone behind their manager&apos;s back with a view to replacing him with somebody with a far less impressive curriculum vitae. Despite insisting over Christmas that he&apos;d be neither buying nor selling, Harry Redknapp will renew his interest in bringing David James to Tottenham in a bid to keep the sweats, shakes and heebie-jeebies of withdrawal at bay. The Portsmouth goalkeeper is just nine appearance away from triggering a clause in his contract that would force Pompey to shell out lots of money they don&apos;t have to somebody-or-other, a state of affairs which should hasten the England No1&apos;s departure from Fratton Park. Harry is also believed to be interested in Joe Cole, who is out of contract at Chelsea come season&apos;s end, but futuristic-sounding Stamford Bridge suit Bruce Buck has declared his intention to keep the midfielder as one of the star attractions at John Terry&apos;s Training Ground Tours. With much-coveted striker Jermaine Beckford having agreed to remain at Leeds until the end of the season, Newcastle United have turned their attention to another up-and-coming young tyro in the hope of keeping the goals coming. Nolberto &quot;Nobby&quot; Solano, 58, a young Peruvian lad whom the Rumour Mill&apos;s spies have described as &quot;a bit special&quot; has been training with Newcastle and has, according to the Mirror, &quot;hugely impressed the coaching staff with his ball skills&quot;. Available for free after winning the Peruvian league with Universitario de Deportes, the trumpet-playing midfielder and dead-ball specialist is already a crowd favourite at Newcastle, won&apos;t cost too much in wages and would help make up the numbers in ranks that will be further depleted when loanee Danny Simpson returns to Manchester United and Geremi is pushed out of a moving car and abandoned in the wake of tonight&apos;s win over West Brom. Having seen his number go up, in the literal sense, at Goodison Park a mere 51 minutes after being brought on as a substitute on Saturday, Robinho&apos;s number would appear to be up, in the metaphorical sense, at Manchester City, despite all the smoke that Roberto Mancini blew up his jacksy when he first took over at the club. West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola has slapped a \u00a315m price-tag Scott Parker. The Mirror claims it&apos;s to scare off potential suitors who have been sniffing around the midfielder, but today&apos;s Rumours reckon it&apos;s because the Italian is enjoying the novelty of not being the shortest person at training every day. Out of contract with Standard Li\u00e8ge this summer and wanted by both Liverpool and Milan, Serbian striker Milan Jovanovic has a big, big decision to make: should he fully immerse himself in Italian culture by moving in to a luxury Milanese city centre apartment or opt for the quiet life and buy a villa on the outskirts of Cassano Magnago, near the Serie A side&apos;s Milanello training ground? Decisions, decisions. Despite rumours linking him with practically every club in the Premier League except the ones who have any chance of winning it, Real Madrid outcast Ruud van Nistelrooy is set to join Turkish outfit Galatasaray, where he would link up with his compatriot Frank Rijkaard. &quot;Frank [Rijkaard] called me and asked &apos;do you want to come to Turkey?&apos;&quot; explained Van Nistelrooy. &quot;I have to think about it \u00adbecause Galatasaray is a great club with a positive \u00adapproach.&quot; The positive approach in question is believed to be a two-and-a-half-year deal worth \u00a38m, not that we&apos;re suggesting for a second that Ruud would be so vulgar as to make money his prime motivation as he mulls over his next move.

Unnerved by terror suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab&apos;s apparent ability to evade detection on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, the US government has pledged to install imaging machines that snap images of passengers&apos; naked bodies to spot hidden objects that can pass through metal detectors unnoticed. Britain, the Netherlands and other nations are following. Investors have been quick to spot a rapid profit. One Californian firm specialising in imaging machines, Rapiscan, has seen its shares in its parent company, OSI Systems, leap by 27% since Christmas. American Science and Engineering, is up by 16% and has deployed its chief executive to have his own body scanned on live television. Analysts say that installing scanners within the US could cost $300m \u2013 paid for, in part, by economic stimulus money. As the US urges other nations to scan passengers on US-bound flights, the outlay could double internationally. Michael Kim, an analyst at Imperial Capital in Los Angeles, said: &quot;We estimate that there are approximately 2,000 security lanes at US airports, each of which would require a body scanning machine if that&apos;s the route the TSA chooses to take. Our information is that the cost of each scanner is around $150,000.&quot; In best position to take advantage is Rapiscan, which has its roots in a long forgotten subsidiary of British Airways. The company, now based in a suburb of Los Angeles, was originally part of International Aeradio, an airport services division of BA that was sold off during the 1980s. Two months before Abdulmutallab&apos;s botched attack on Northwest Airlines flight 253, Rapiscan won a $25m contract to supply 150 imaging machines to the US transportation security administration for trial deployment at various US airports. Success could bring rewards in Britain \u2013 Rapiscan has a hi-tech development centre near Gatwick airport and a factory in Cheshire producing baggage x-ray equipment. Rapiscan is not the only contender. A list of &quot;qualified products&quot; approved by security authorities includes a scanner made by America&apos;s sixth largest defence company, L-3 Communications, which produced 40 devices already in use at US airports. L-3&apos;s model can snap both sides of a subject simultaneously, so passengers do not need to turn around, potentially speeding up queues. American Science and Engineering, is yet to get its devices approved but is anxious to be noticed \u2013 its chief executive, Anthony Fabiano, recently demonstrated his company&apos;s scanner live on the business television network CNBC, proudly displaying an image of his naked body to viewers with the words: &quot;This is me nude, just like my wife would like to see me.&quot; Disliked by privacy campaigners who worry about prurient glimpses of naked bodies, full-body scanners work by firing high-frequency electromagnetic radio waves at travellers, and creating an image based on the way in which radiation scatters off the body. Frequent fliers have expressed health concerns about being constantly bombarded with radiation. But an expert body, the US national council on radiation protection and measurements, calculated that travellers would need to be scanned 2,500 times annually before they risk &quot;negligible&quot; exposure to harmful radioactivity. Manufacturers have installed complex software to blur subjects&apos; private parts and have limited the resolution of screen images to &quot;chalk outlines&quot; of body parts. Under rules being considered by security authorities, operators viewing images will sit in a different room, unable to see their subjects in person. Brian Ruttenbur, a defence industry analyst at stockbroker Morgan Keegan, said privacy concerns were unlikely to prevail: &quot;My view is that it&apos;s not an inalienable right to fly in an aircraft and the public will have to put up with some inconvenience if they want to do so.&quot; He said installation, at least initially, could be patchy: &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll see 100% roll-out until we see a successful attack.&quot; The TSA initially intends to buy 450 full-body scanners \u2013 an outlay of $45m to $65m. Ruttenbur said the layout was merely the latest boom to hit security companies since the terrorist attacks of September 11. Since 2001, spending on homeland security has leapt from $16bn to $55bn annually. For firms specialising in security equipment, this means striking a tricky balance between marketing and being seen to take advantage of a national emergency. American Science and Engineering&apos;s vice-president of marketing, Joe Reiss acknowledged the climate was sensitive \u2013 but argued that companies can play a role in generating public acceptance of tighter security. &quot;Everybody&apos;s grateful that flight 253 was not a successful attack but those of us in the security industry are terribly aware of where a lot of the vulnerabilities remain,&quot; said Reiss. &quot;The reasons this technology hasn&apos;t been deployed have to do with privacy and safety concerns that seem to us like very minor issues when you consider the possible loss of life a terrorist attack can cause.&quot;", "sentences": ["Unnerved by terror suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab&apos;s apparent ability to evade detection on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, the US government has pledged to install imaging machines that snap images of passengers&apos; naked bodies to spot hidden objects that can pass through metal detectors unnoticed."], "title": "Airport scanner companies queue for business after 'underpants bomber'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/18/theairlineindustry-terrorism", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Technology", "UK civil liberties", "UK news", "World news", "US news", "Travel", "Technology sector"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-18T14:35:19Z", "article": "BAA will not take the next step towards building a third runway at Heathrow until after the general election, it has said. BAA secured government approval a year ago for its controversial plans to expand Britain&apos;s largest airport resulting in renewed protests from green groups and local residents. For the last seven years, a loose coalition of Sipson villagers, more seasoned environmental campaigners and celebrities have been battling BAA&apos;s plans to expand northwards. The company says Heathrow \u2013 and Britain \u2013 are greatly hampered by a main airport with only two runways \u2013 Charles de Gaulle in Paris has four, while Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol has six. But now, BAA has confirmed it will not launch a public consultation on a planning application until after a general election. With expansion strongly opposed by the Conservatives, who are ahead in the polls, any planning proposal could be quashed by a Tory administration. The airports operator told the Guardian in a statement that it was still working on its application. However, it admitted that the process will be interrupted by the election: &quot;We expect to be in a position to consult with local residents and all other interested parties in the second half of 2010.&quot; BAA denied that efforts had ceased altogether, saying the delay was caused only by discussions with the government&apos;s new infrastructure planning commission (IPC), set up last year. &quot;The timing of any planning application and its component parts are not influenced by anything other than the requirements of the IPC and the volume of work to put together a compelling application,&quot; a spokesman said. But with only Labour committed to the runway, the statement would nonetheless appear to mean that 700 homes in Sipson \u2013 the village that would have been flattened to build the runway \u2013 along with its handful of pubs, restaurants and other businesses, may be saved. It would seem a moment of celebration for the No Third Runway Action Group, but members remain cautious. Firstly, they say, even if the Conservatives win power they could change their mind in the face of relentless lobbying from BAA and British Airways. The latter&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, called the runway decision the party&apos;s &quot;biggest mistake ever&quot;. Equally pertinent, they stress, is that the fabric of the village is, slowly but surely, collapsing around them. &quot;It&apos;s like a slow death for Sipson,&quot; said Jim Doyle, 47, who has raised a family in what remains a clearly defined \u00advillage \u00adnestled in acres of green belt fields, despite sitting only a few hundred metres from Heathrow&apos;s northern perimeter and not much further south of the M4. &quot;I can&apos;t remember the last time a family bought here. To do what they&apos;ve done to a community, with no timescale, no schedule, is an absolute disgrace.&quot; Sitting in the 400-year-old William IV pub, like the rest of Sipson affected surprisingly little by aircraft noise thanks to the orientation of runways, Doyle describes how the threat hanging over the village means the only home buyers are speculative landlords who install short-term tenants, many from eastern Europe, with no real stake in the community&apos;s future. &quot;It&apos;s a very different place from how it used to be,&quot; he said. BAA has already offered to buy up hundreds of homes in Sipson and an estimated 75 householders have agreed. Such an exodus, believes Sean Walters, the pub&apos;s landlord, would mean the end: &quot;No one wants to be next door to an empty house, so they&apos;ll move on as well. That&apos;s how BAA will get the runway anyway \u2013 who&apos;ll want to live in a ghost village?&quot; Others are hopeful they can extract a long-term commitment from the Conservatives. David Cameron has not only backed their cause but sponsors an apple tree on land in Sipson bought by protesters and planted as an orchard. &quot;If Cameron reneges on his promise, it would be so bad I won&apos;t ever vote again in this country in my life,&quot; said Linda \u00adMcCutcheon, 64, who has lived in \u00adSipson for more than forty years. &quot;He said it, so he needs to take action. We&apos;ll work from there to get a definite no.&quot; Any minister planning to send the bulldozers to Sipson will be aware that within \u00adminutes of their arrival, several sexagenarians would be lying down in their path. Many locals have promised direct action and are supported by younger, more experienced green campaigners through an innovative &quot;adopt a resident&quot; scheme. The seemingly unlikely alliance began in August 2007 when the annual Climate Camp protest based itself around \u00adSipson. &quot;When they came we told them, &apos;Oh, you&apos;ll forget about us, you&apos;ll go on to something else.&apos; But they said they wouldn&apos;t and they&apos;ve kept to their word,&quot; McCutcheon said. Her optimism is tinged by an ever-present sadness at the thought of what is at stake: &quot;My children were born in the village, at the cottage hospital, which has now gone. They were christened in the local church and went to school here. It&apos;s an entire life, and it would all be under concrete.

Such was the experience in London last week when\u00a0the most senior handicappers in the business published figures to suggest that Sea The Stars was not quite the racehorse that everyone liked to think he was. &quot;If people are saying that Sea The Stars is the best they have seen, we are not saying that they are wrong,&quot; Garry O&apos;Gorman, Ireland&apos;s senior handicapper, said, as he tried to explain why a final rating of 136 for John Oxx&apos;s colt \u2013 5lb shy of Dancing Brave in 1986 \u2013 was as high as they could go. One reason for the gap, he suggested, is that Dancing Brave had to perform at close to his peak to beat one of the best Arc fields ever assembled by a clear margin, while Sea The Stars rarely did any more than necessary. Another is that, using modern handicapping procedures, Dancing Brave would have been unlikely to get as high as 141 in any case. Both explanations are fairly plausible, but do beg some questions, the latter one in particular. The implication is that an attempt to compare generations using official figures is optimistic, at best. This in turn suggests that the whole process is an interesting academic exercise for those concerned, but one with little relevance to the wider race\u2011going and punting fraternity. A fresh recruit to the sport, meanwhile \u2013 one of those pulled in, perhaps, by Sea The Stars&apos;s irresistible march through the season \u2013 may well regard an official rating that doesn&apos;t bear comparison with other official ratings with the sort of bafflement than comes over many Americans at the idea of a five-day cricket match that may well end in a draw. What, in other words, is the official classification for? And as racing tries to lower barriers and explain itself to potential new fans, might there be a better way of doing things? In America, for instance, there are the Eclipse Awards, and by the time this column appears, either Zenyatta or Rachel Alexandra will have been announced as the winner of the top accolade of Horse of the Year at a ceremony in Beverley Hills. The Eclipse Awards are decided by a poll among industry figures and the racing media, and the result of this year&apos;s race for the top prize will attract far more attention than the international panel&apos;s verdict, which placed Zenyatta 1lb ahead of Rachel Alexandra. An Eclipse Award is an end in itself for American owners. Whether a particular horse is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; than previous winners in the same category is not an issue. Where numbers are used to judge merit, it tends to be distances \u2013 Secretariat&apos;s 31 lengths in the Belmont, for instance \u2013 or streaks, like Cigar&apos;s 16 straight wins, a mark that the unretired Zenyatta, unbeaten in 14, now has in her sights. But similar exercises in Britain, the Cartier Awards being the most obvious example, have never really captured the imagination of the racing public. What seems to be required, for promotional purposes at least, is a middle way, one that combines the diligence of handicapping with some measure of a horse&apos;s untapped potential and emotional impact. Whether there is any feasible method to create such a scheme is another matter. So for the moment the current system which, rightly or wrongly, suggests that Sea The Stars does not even make the podium over the last quarter of a century, is the one we will have to rub along with.

After Nestl\u00e9&apos;s takeover of Rowntree Mackintosh, the KitKat bar went from being wrapped in foil and paper to covered in plastic, prompting internet campaigns for the foil to be restored. The Swiss food and drinks company also unsettled traditionalists with a hexa\u00adgonal Smarties pack and changes to Quality Street selections. Under its new Indian owners Tata, Jaguar Land Rover announced last year it was ceasing production of its X-Type saloon, or &quot;baby Jaguar&quot;. But it is working on a &quot;green&quot; Range Rover, the long-awaited LRX, and will start selling a new Jaguar XJ later this year. The names Abbey and Bradford &amp; \u00adBingley are disappearing from the high street and the chains will now trade as Santander following their takeover by the Spanish banking group. And it&apos;s not just products that die: slogans have gone too. When mobile phone company Orange launched in the mid-1990s, it introduced such innovations as itemised billing and per-second \u2013 rather than per-minute \u2013 charges, all under its eyecatching brand campaign &quot;The future&apos;s bright, the future&apos;s Orange&quot;. But when France T\u00e9l\u00e9com snapped up the network at the turn of the century it quickly led to an exodus of management talent and an advertising squeeze that saw Orange&apos;s brand fall off the consumer radar for many years. It now hopes to recapture some of its former glory by merging with smaller rival T-Mobile. In the drinks world, Dutch ownership has seen Newcastle Brown Ale leave its homeland after 82 years. Heineken-owned Scottish &amp; Newcastle announced in October that the ale will no longer be brewed on Tyneside and that production would move to Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, prompting claims that it will no longer be &quot;Newcastle&quot; Brown Ale. Job losses  After Jaguar and Land Rover were bought by Tata from Ford for $2.3bn in March 2008, savage cost-cutting \u00adfollowed and 2,000 jobs went. As the recession hit car sales hard, the Indian conglomerate announced plans to close one of the business&apos;s West Midlands factories by the middle of the decade, outsource production overseas and close the final salary pension scheme to new members. The airports operator BAA, bought by the Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial in 2006, quickly saw its final-salary scheme closed to new members and faced widespread job losses. In 2006, Nestl\u00e9 brought to an end 70 years of UK Smarties production, moving it overseas and cutting 645 jobs in the process. Just last month, Tata-owned steelmaker Corus announced it was mothballing operations at a Teesside factory with the loss of 1,700 jobs, having already cut thousands of jobs since the 2007 takeover. Tax  Whenever a British public company is acquired by an overseas business, it disappears, by default, from the taxation radar screen. Without the rigours of regular reporting, the tax affairs of the acquired company are subsumed by the web of complex corporate structures commonplace in the modern transnational enterprise. Tax efficiency is a cornerstone of any international organisation; but the ultimate destination of post-acquisition tax revenues becomes less a function of ownership and more a reflection of the relative determination of taxation authorities to attack artificial planning schemes. Cadbury itself is no stranger to tax efficiency and fought and won an important legal battle in the European courts in 2006 over the tax treatment of overseas subsidiaries. Kraft UK&apos;s most recent accounts set out details of a significant restructuring of its European operations. But the tax accounts of all international companies are littered with details of such activities. Any change to Cadbury&apos;s tax profile may not be immediately visible. Walkers Snack Foods, the crisp maker, was under the ownership of the mighty Pepsico for 10 years before it implemented a big structural change. As for Tata, the Indian owner of Jaguar, Land Rover and Corus indicates in the individual accounts for those three companies that they are awash with losses, making the payment of UK tax a distant prospect. Headquarters  If a foreign takeover results in a change of headquarters, banks, lawyers, consultants and other organisations may lose work they used to get from the acquired company. Once mighty ICI, for example, formerly headquartered in London, was acquired by Akzo\u00adNobel in 2007 and, having been fully integrated, now has its head office in Amsterdam. But steel maker Corus, which includes the former British Steel, still has its London Millbank headquarters despite being part of India&apos;s Tata.

He has been carrying out emergency amputations for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in a makeshift hospital under a tree by a roadside in the devastated capital, Port-au-Prince. Originally from Droitwich, in Worcestershire, he works as a surgical adviser for MSF and is based in Amsterdam. &quot;We got here about 48 hours after the earthquake \u2013 I think we were one of the first emergency response teams to arrive,&quot; he said. &quot;We flew into the Dominican Republic and drove through the night to get to Port-au-Prince. &quot;The devastation here is on a scale I have not seen before. The hospital in Carrefour, one of the very poor areas on the west of the city that has been almost completely destroyed by the quake, was still standing, but it was empty. &quot;The staff were trapped at home ... most had lost relatives. It was completely non-functional. &quot;We had started to establish an emergency trauma centre for the casualties in the hospital on Friday morning when there was a major aftershock, so we had to evacuate. &quot;We moved the surgical emergency operations to an area under a tree outside the hospital, with the patients lying on the road on mattresses. &quot;The tree is the only shelter for the surgeons when they are operating. I don&apos;t know what kind of tree it is \u2013 it drops things on our heads while we are working. &quot;At that stage, Friday and Saturday, we were working with roughly two surgeons and two anaesthetists on three operating tables. &quot;I say operating tables \u2013 in fact, they are three couches next to each other. We worked continuously: we didn&apos;t stop for sleep. But that&apos;s OK. That&apos;s what we are here for. &quot;There are a few tents on the road now where some patients can get a bit of shade. But many are lying in the open, or with just a simple shade cover to try and protect them from the sun. &quot;Under the tree, we have been doing the more major amputations, wound operations, but we&apos;ve also had to perform other kinds of surgery not related to the quake \u2013 we&apos;ve done Caesarean sections, we&apos;ve had women bleeding from abortions coming in. &quot;I am not sure how many cases we have treated surgically, but of course many, many more have been seen in the triage area. Those numbers we cannot begin to count. &quot;Unfortunately, our equipment did not make it to Port-au-Prince with us, so we have had to make do with very little. &quot;On Friday, there was no electricity, and water was a major problem. We were very quickly running out of supplies, particularly anaesthetic. &quot;We&apos;ve run out of plaster of Paris twice in the last 24 hours, and we have now nearly run out of a ketamine drug that we use for anaesthesia. We had no bandages at all on Monday. &quot;We were overwhelmed in the earliest days by the crowds coming for help, and we have had to try to get control. But the number of major surgical cases we are seeing now is dropping rapidly, I&apos;m afraid, because people are dying in the rubble. I don&apos;t think many people with major injuries who have not already been seen by doctors will have survived now. &quot;So we&apos;re moving into a quieter phase surgically \u2013 perhaps 12 to 15 major operations scheduled per day. &quot;The next stage will be treating the open wounds, which are now contaminated. Many of them have maggots in them. I would say that we now have enough doctors and nurses to carry us through the immediate phase, but we are still very short on supplies. &quot;And of course we have only got the emergency surgical team \u2013 there&apos;s almost no other place for people to go to with other medical emergencies. &quot;Psychological care is now being offered to amputees and their families, and the next move will be to establish a mobile clinic to do outreach work into the surrounding community. &quot;People are now trying to leave, to walk out of the city. They are going to the country, even though there will be little food there. &quot;Some have relatives there, but many have not. And yet the people who can get out are leaving.

The Dutch band may have celebrated their 30th birthday recently, but you would try to sum up their sound in two or three words at your peril. This is a \u00adquandary shared by the band members themselves. I meet them in Dublin, where they are playing a one-off date. The cab driver \u00adtaking them to the venue asked them what they sound like. &quot;We had real difficulty,&quot; says Andy Moor, the band&apos;s London-born guitarist, who boasts 15 years&apos; service. &quot;It is really hard!&quot; &quot;We feel a bit stupid as it can sound very \u00adpretentious, &apos;We are very unique, we are not like \u00adanyone else,&apos;&quot; says Terrie Hessels, the only remaining member of the band&apos;s original 1979 lineup. Yet unique is what the Ex are. Take any major musical development of the last 50 years and you can almost guarantee that they have either incorporated it into their sound or played with it and discarded it. Their recent retrospective CD 30 contains a dazzling array of sounds that range from industrial to orchestral. Though the band&apos;s real move forward, and one which brought them to the attention of the jazz world, was their 1991 collaboration with (now sadly deceased) US cellist Tom Cora. This lead to further unions, with the likes of zany Dutch jazz drummer Han Bennink as well as English saxophonist John Butcher. Even now, the kind of phrases used on gig posters and in the music press range from &quot;anarcho-punk&quot; to &quot;improvised jazz&quot; to &quot;afro-punk&quot; and &quot;folk&quot;. The punk part may be fair \u2013 the band certainly formed with that ethos and a staccato approximation of the sound of the Fall or Gang of Four, but they have always been far more experimental than their three-chord forebears. They chose their name for the ease with which it could be sprayed on walls, and drew straws to decide who would play what. There was always an exploratory and political edge to the band, as evidenced by the 1983 concept set of four 7in singles about a closed factory in the Amsterdam suburb of Wormer where the band formed. Since then, the Ex have taken in folk influences from all over Europe. They have dabbled in jazz, improvisation, guitar \u00addestruction, drilling venue walls, dance music, \u00admilitary-band precision, ska, toy instruments, horns, African beats and sampling. I could go on. Yet, surprisingly, none of this comes across as radical departure in style. They still sound like the Ex on every recording and at every gig. The guitars retain a caustic, rhythmic precision and the drumming is tight and complex. &quot;One reason we are hard to describe is that we never had an education at music school, and in that sense we are not \u00adinfluenced by any traditional playing,&quot; says Katherina Bornefeld, neatly sidestepping any attempt to form a soundbite encapsulating the Ex&apos;s sound, despite her 25 years on the drum stool. In order to understand the band you need to see them perform; they work in the opposite manner to most groups. The Ex write songs to perform live, tweaking them as tours progress and then recording the honed versions as documents of their time. Most Ex tours start with an entire batch of new material \u2013 there is no roster of crowd-pleasers to get the audience going. The dedicated fan is as challenged as someone hearing the band for the very first time. This is a band very much about intuition. Moor plays intricate notes on a \u00adbaritone guitar with his eyes closed before dashing at Hessels, both raising their \u00adguitars as the newest member of the band, Arnold de Boer (who last year replaced founder-member GW Sok), ducks beneath them. Meanwhile, Bornefeld seemingly hits every piece of her drumkit, before repeating the rhythm in a slightly different \u00adpattern. Moor aims kicks at the air \u2013 band members even try to put each other off at times. The band have a reputation for addressing serious politics, but they also have a great sense of humour. This is neatly evidenced by the 7in singles club they ran for a year, where the last single was a 12in and thus could not be squeezed into the box that came with the first record in the series. As well as being a drumming original, Bornefeld also possesses a voice made for singing folk music in any language, which has come to the fore on the band&apos;s tours of Ethiopia. Born out of sheer enthusiasm for the music and people of the country, the Ex&apos;s Ethiopian tours \u00adtook loud \u00adguitar music where it has never been before, as well as exchanging ideas and technical know-how with local musicians. They also played with Ethiopian saxophone legend Getatchew Mekurya, and collaborated with him on an album. &quot;There is no tour circuit,&quot; says Hessels. &quot;We even went to places that hardly any Ethiopian \u00admusicians had played.&quot; &quot;One time we were playing in a barn on a farm and another time in the police community hall,&quot; adds Moor. &quot;We would just go to the chief of the town and they decided what we should pay, sometimes it was $20 and sometimes it was free.&quot; The band took generators and \u00adamplifiers with them, and left them behind for local musicians to use. They follow a \u00adsimilar DIY philosophy with all their work. The band has no manager, driver or roadies and they put out all their CDs themselves. Yet they also find time to have countless side projects, such as Bornefeld&apos;s \u00adKatJonBand with the Mekons&apos; Jon Langford, Moor&apos;s solo album and \u00adHessels&apos;s work with Sonic Youth&apos;s Thurston Moore. Their free gigs in Ethiopia, which attracted crowds of 2,000 or more, have also left what could be a strange musical legacy. If \u00adEthiopia starts throwing up scratchy, indefinable guitar bands, you&apos;ll know who to\u00a0blame. &quot;Everyone still uses cassettes there,&quot; says Moor. &quot;We went back to pressing up cassettes, giving them out to taxi drivers all over the place. So at least they know what we sound like.&quot; An initial pressing of 10,000 cassettes, with more to follow and the inevitable home-taping, have made the Ex established favourites in parts of Ethiopia, but in the UK they remain something of a word-of-mouth aural delicacy. Their arrival on these shores for their first tour since 2003 should help to remedy that, especially as they have integrated yet more new sounds in the shape of Brass Unbound, a four-piece horn section of prodigious talents. With this addition to their ranks, the Ex once again deter any attempts at description. But you get the feeling that as soon as anyone nailed their sound, the band would do their damnedest to defy it. The Ex play the Fleece, Bristol on 29 January, then touring.

He&apos;s just \u00adlistened to me do a keyboard solo on Get It On, the old T Rex number, and he\u00a0is not \u00adimpressed. (Neither am I, but that doesn&apos;t seem important.) &quot;Way too timid,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve got to own it, man.&quot; I nod uncertainly. Meat (as everyone calls him) is no longer the shaggy-haired, sweaty ogre of a showman from the Bat Out of Hell era. He hasn&apos;t exactly become a shrinking \u00adviolet \u2013 shyness was never his problem \u2013 but, like just about everyone else in sight, he has attempted to age gracefully. He keeps his hair short and wears an outfit that in Hollywood is commonly known as smart casual: an open-neck yellow silk shirt and a workaday dark brown leather jacket. He and I have the same reason for being here, at a nondescript recording studio somewhere in the wilds of north Hollywood \u2013 an area of Los Angeles that fancies itself as up-and-coming but has never quite upped and came. He is the day&apos;s big attraction at what might be described as the ultimate wish fulfilment for air-guitar and garage-band freaks \u2013 a multi-day jamming session with the stars called Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Fantasy Camp. And I am tagging along as a member of one of the impromptu ensembles that has been thrown together from an assortment of business entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and music business wannabes, as well as a lucky few whose $10,000-odd admission fee has been paid for by someone else. I am behind the electric keyboard, a fill-in for a man named Barry, who makes his living selling kosher chicken. Our drummer, George, can usually be found stapling stomachs at a hospital in Shreveport, \u00adLouisiana, and approaches his drumming with the intensity of a trainee surgeon \u00addissecting corpses. On bass is Bernt, the president of a giant \u00adseafood wholesaler in Seattle, who exudes boundless \u00adconfidence and cool. He is, he says, originally from Norway and he rises from our little stage like some Nordic god with his impeccable blond hair, piercing blue eyes and \u00adspotlessly uncreased open-neck white shirt. Our three guitarists include a stepfather-stepson combo from \u00adConnecticut (more on them in a minute) and another \u00adinterloper, like me, a man called Lee, who is trying out the whole fantasy camp \u00adexperience as a dry run for a possible \u00adtelevision reality show. We&apos;ve been practising Get It On for a couple of hours under the direction of the most colourful man in the entire camp, Meat Loaf included. That would be Mark Hudson, a multitalented instrumentalist, producer and writer who has worked with Aerosmith and Ringo Starr and is probably best known in Britain for his role as a coach on The X Factor. Anyone who has seen the show will know that Hudson cuts a \u00adstriking figure, with his thick glasses, assorted caps, and flowing ginger hair and beard (including some alarming blue and green dyes flecking the area around his mouth). They will also know he has a wicked sense of humour \u2013 which turns out to be several shades bluer when he is not on national television. Today, he is sporting a bright purple corduroy suit that defies words. (As Hudson puts it at one stage: &quot;There&apos;s only one king in this room, and he looks like Barney.&quot;) Our rehearsals have not been going especially well. The band know the song, sort of, but the rhythm is off, the tone veers from uncertain to drop-dead heavy, and one or two people are having trouble with the chord sequences. \u00adHudson begged us at one point not to sound &quot;like Hitler marching through Poland&quot;, which \u00adproduced a laugh. A little later, he threw up his hands and despaired: &quot;There are three chords here, people \u2013 E, A and G. How can we fuck that up?&quot; His main beef with me was that I was trying to make things too complicated. &quot;Keep it nice and dumb,&quot; he told me. &quot;Dumb will get you laid. Hold that high note and keep humping.&quot; Getting laid is not something Hudson foresaw for any of us, not the way we were beating T Rex&apos;s simple riff into the ground. &quot;I picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue,&quot; he moaned. &quot;We are so not a jazz band, and you are not Herbie Hancock.&quot; Not that Hudson is a tough nut, \u00adespecially \u2013 he is never less than \u00adirresistibly likeable, and the jokes keep \u00adcoming thick and fast. As soon as he said the name Herbie Hancock, he paused, smiled, and said: &quot;That&apos;s a double phallic name. Herbie Hancock. Here&apos;s another \u2013 \u00a0Peter O&apos;Toole.&quot; But now we don&apos;t just have Hudson to contend with. We&apos;ve got Meat Loaf listening to our work in progress and he looks vaguely pained. That said, he&apos;s less interested in the wobbly musicianship, ultimately, than he is in rock as \u00adperformance. &quot;You have to be like a fucking tiger,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Pretend you&apos;re not \u00adEnglish. No \u2013 pretend you are English, like\u00a0 Marc Bolan.&quot; He gives the rest of the band a very similar message. &quot;If you are out on stage, you have to be on it, every second. Look at them before you play. Don&apos;t drop your shoulders. Never turn your back to\u00a0the \u00a0audience.&quot; And so he goes, giving what amounts to a lecture on stagecraft that, he says, most bands \u2013 even successful professional bands \u2013 don&apos;t usually get to hear. Meat Loaf may not be the greatest musician on the planet, but he is universally respected as a showman. He once gave advice to \u00adFreddie Mercury \u2013 curing him of his habit of stomping one foot like a horse \u2013 and will happily implore anyone who cares to listen to please, please not sound and look exactly like the band that just played. Hudson agrees with Meat&apos;s verdict on us 100%, except he&apos;s less shy about giving it to us straight. &quot;You were an oil painting, a still life,&quot; Hudson tells us, more than once. And he promptly christens the band The Jerry Lewis Quintet, a name that sticks until the very end of the camp. My fellow campers take the good-humoured humiliation in stride. Some of them assume, probably rightly, that the criticism is not directed at them. Others, like George the drumming weight-loss surgeon, figure that a witheringly honest critique is all part of the price of admission \u2013 and part of the process of learning and improving. &quot;The first day was like the Bataan death march,&quot; George tells me. &quot;Those synapses haven&apos;t fired in a lot of years. You just have to stick with it, because the intensity level creeps up every day.&quot; This camp is a five-day affair: three full days in rehearsal, one day in the Capitol Records recording studio to lay down a track or two and then the grand finale, a live performance at the Whisky a Go Go club on LA&apos;s Sunset Strip. The Whisky was the Doors&apos; stamping ground in the 1960s, and the highlight of the camp is the chance to jam there with Robby Krieger, the Doors&apos; guitarist. Campers aren&apos;t auditioned, exactly. But they do generally have extended \u00adconversations with the camp coordinator, Courtney Clonch, who does her best to make sure they \u00adunderstand that this is about making music, not posing or ogling at the stars. Clonch, who works part-time as a singer and actor, possesses a razor-sharp wit as well as enviable organising skills; she is pretty good at sniffing out the phoneys and gauging people&apos;s skill level so she can pair them with the right \u00adbandmates and the right counsellor. She and her boss, a former music \u00adproducer called David Fischof, who has been holding these camps for the past 13 years, get an extraordinary return rate: 50% of campers come back at least once, if not many times. &quot;You&apos;re not here for the fantasy,&quot; a University of Chicago hospital surgeon called Jeff Matthews told me \u2013 this was his 10th camp, and he considers many of the counsellors and fellow campers his friends. &quot;It&apos;s about the band and the music and fitting it. The people who come back are the ones who get that.&quot; It&apos;s impossible, though, to get away from the hero-worship entirely. One of the most popular camps takes place each year in England \u2013 first at the Abbey Road studios in London and then, for the final performance, at the Cavern in Liverpool. By all accounts, the campers sing Beatles songs on the coach as if it were 1964. Inevitably, too, a few kooks creep in. Hudson told a story about a \u00adBritish camper called Nigel, whose entire \u00admusical \u00adexperience extended to \u00adplaying Guitar Hero. (He wound up on tambourine.) Another counsellor, Teddy Andreadis (who has played with Guns N&apos; Roses, \u00adCarole King and Michael Jackson), \u00adremembered a guy arriving with a snazzy bass guitar that once belonged to Paul McCartney. Andreadis recalls: &quot;I said, &apos;The next one&apos;s in F&apos;. He said, &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; He became my lead singer.&quot; The clear oddball at camp this time was Eric, the older of the stepfather-stepson pair in my band. Eric had long hair and wild eyes, loved to shoot his mouth off, made a pass at just about every young woman assistant at the camp \u2013 there were plenty of them, whatever the organisers had to say about focusing on the music \u2013 and \u00adirritated the hell out of Hudson, who pegged him right away as one of those guys more interested in the sex and drugs than the rock&apos;n&apos;roll. Hudson \u2013 who is very big on nicknames \u2013 called him Fishbug (because of the eyes), Frodo (because he is short), Amsterdam Breath or Junky Brewster. &quot;Play a lick that&apos;ll get you laid,&quot; Hudson implored him. &quot;Pretend you have a penis.&quot; The needling did not displease Eric&apos;s stepson, a preternaturally gifted guitarist resembling a young Richard Thompson, who frequently gave Eric killer glares and even more frequently tried to pretend he wasn&apos;t there at all. The tension built all week, then exploded at the Whisky gig. Eric, by his own admission, was downing tequilas like there was no tomorrow before the Jerry Lewis Quintet even went on. He was also parading backstage and shouting at the top of his lungs that he was the Lizard King. &quot;He thinks he&apos;s fucking Jim \u00adMorrison,&quot; Mike said. &quot;It&apos;s fantasy land.&quot; As Robby Krieger stepped out to join the rest of the band (no longer including me), Eric grabbed a microphone and began doing his best Morrison imitation, beginning the spoken section of the Doors song The Soft Parade: &quot;When I was back there in seminary school, there was a person there who put forward the proposition \u2026&quot; Hudson looked almost apologetic as he addressed the nonplussed crowd: &quot;I&apos;ve had to put up with this dork all week. You only have to put up with him for \u00a0 four songs.&quot; Eric got to sing with Krieger on Love You Madly, and declared the night the greatest of his life. But he wasn&apos;t done yet. Once all the bands had finished their performances, the counsellors jumped up on stage to jam and launched into Light My Fire as their grand finale. Eric, looking distinctly worse for wear, grabbed a pair of maracas and tried to sneak on stage with them, skulking below a pair of speakers to the side in some vain attempt not to get caught. A man with a clipboard came racing out from behind the scenes to yank him back. Mike looked like he wanted to crawl under a rock and die. I asked if he was going to have to drag Eric back to the hotel. &quot;I&apos;m not his fucking babysitter,&quot; he shot back. &quot;I don&apos;t care how he gets home.&quot; Everyone else, it must be said, was \u00adhaving the time of their lives. A guy called Anthony from Fayetteville, Arkansas, who won his camp place in a \u00adcompetition thrown by a local radio station, could not wipe the grin off his face all night. A \u00adcancer survivor called Laura, from San Diego, got to perform one of her own songs and \u00adcirculated a couple of demo CDs to the \u00ad \u00adindustry \u00admovers and shakers in and around the camp. To her shock, they liked what\u00a0 they heard. Then there was Michelle, an occasional session singer from suburban Los \u00adAngeles, who was sporting bleached blond hair, a black leather get-up, five crucifixes \u00adhanging down her front and a foxtail around her neck. She, alone of the lead singers, looked like she owned the stage as Meat Loaf said we should. And she belted out a very creditable rendition of the Doors&apos; Back Door Man. As the song ended and the applause erupted, she took one last glance at the \u00adravaged \u00adfeatures of Robby Krieger and pronounced a single word to sum up her feelings: &quot;Awesomeness.&quot; For more information about the London Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Fantasy Camp from May 25-31, go to rockcamp.com", "sentences": ["Hudson \u2013 who is very big on nicknames \u2013 called him Fishbug (because of the eyes), Frodo (because he is short), Amsterdam Breath or Junky Brewster."], "title": "Meat Loaf is scholastic adviser at the school of rock", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/21/rock-n-roll-fantasy-camp-feature", "tags": ["Meat Loaf", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "The Doors", "The X Factor"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-21T22:05:00Z", "article": "Taken from Amsterdam concerts conducted by George Benjamin and Ingo Metzmacher to mark the centenary of Messiaen&apos;s birth in 2008, performances of two of the French composer&apos;s works are interleaved with recordings of the premieres of three commissions marking the anniversary.

It is snowing buckets, but he still pauses intermittently to point out, on our left, the sculptures of the planet Neptune and, just around the bend, Uranus, that lie along the space-themed trail, and towards the sparkling assortment of Switzerland&apos;s famous &quot;four thousanders&quot; (mountains over 4,000 metres) that loom around us. It may feel like we&apos;re setting off for outer space, but I am in fact about to travel back in time. My destination is the Hotel Weisshorn, a high-Alpine belle-\u00e9poque beauty dating from about 1891. With 30 pine-clad bedrooms, granite stairways, and antique furnishings that recreate the style of the Victorian era, it&apos;s a destination in itself. For snow lovers, it&apos;s also ideally perched above the spectacular and seriously under-populated slopes of the Val d&apos;Anniviers ski area, two hours east of Geneva. As well as having 227km of marked pistes, this is a place for amazing off-piste powder skiing, accessible right from the door of the hotel. The journey to this hard-to-reach hotel is also a real adventure \u2013 the perfect antidote to the usual package-holiday coach transfer. There&apos;s no road access, so many guests arrive by randonn\u00e9e (walking up with skins on their skis); others make the 90-minute journey in good boots or on snowshoes, trudging along a groomed path called Chemin des Plan\u00e8tes (hence the astrological sculptures). Given the late hour and the heavy snow, I hitch a ride on the back of a snowmobile laden with guests&apos; rucksacks, ski bags and a woman with a baby. Frozen, I stagger from the skidoo into the warm entry hall \u2013 and step straight back in time. When it was built, the Hotel Weisshorn favoured le style anglais: guests dressed for dinner and gentlemen smoked only in the fumoir. More than 100 years on, the original decor remains, but heating and modern showers have been added, and sartorial expectations have come down a peg \u2013 jeans and Gore-Tex prevail, with red felt slippers provided by our host. In the traditionally furnished salon sits the original piano \u2013 carried up the mountain on the backs of six men over several days. Beside it is a wood-burning water heater cum shower (no longer in use). There is Wi-Fi now, yet the telegraph machine still hangs on the wall, and wide corridors are dotted with porcelain water pitchers and black-and-white portraits. After a four-course dinner including foie gras mousse, veal chops and excellent Valais wine in the casual wood-lined dining room among a few Swiss families and small groups, I retire to my simple bedroom. The next morning, blinding sunshine cascades through the windows, revealing dozens of peaks \u2013 including the Dent d&apos;H\u00e9rens, the glacier of Les Diablerets and the Dent Blanche, which tops out at 4,358m. Somewhere in another world, far below, skiers are queuing in hire shops, clattering on to buses, and shuffling in lift lines. I have a third coffee, and feel pretty smug about it. I don&apos;t need to worry about anyone else stealing the first tracks of the day up here. There are no groomed pistes from the hotel, but there&apos;s ski touring or snowshoeing from the door, as well as the fantastic and little known off-piste of the Val d&apos;Anniviers. Something of a cult destination for powder, its best known area, Grimentz \u2013 across the valley and connected by a free bus \u2013 is still likely to draw blank stares back home; with only a couple of hotels and cosy restaurants, it&apos;s way off the map compared with big hitters like Verbier. For families and piste skiers, the shared lift pass of the Val d&apos;Anniviers covers a respectable number of slopes across four separate areas \u2013 Vercorin, Grimentz, Zinal and St-Luc Chandolin \u2013 linked by free, clockwork-efficient shuttle buses. But the real appeal is the empty off-piste. To make the most of it, guests can book a local mountain guide in the nearest resort, St Luc, or in Grimentz. Earlier in the week, while staying in Grimentz, I had joined a guided Freshtracks Exploration group holiday, offered by the Ski Club of Great Britain. Local guide Vincent Thaler led us cheerfully down one of the classic powder routes, called Chach\u00e9, a winding descent that starts bang off the lift and curls through widely spaced trees for an hour, spitting you out at the village of St Jean, where a shuttle bus whips you back to base for more. Off-piste routes such as Chach\u00e9 are what Val d&apos;Anniviers is all about. Back at the Weisshorn, a group of ski tourers heads off after breakfast with skins and packs into a trackless mountainscape. Before taking to skis to hit the powder again, I follow two friendly women from Amsterdam on a snowshoe walk, via the now-visible Chemin des Plan\u00e8tes, towards one of two marked snowshoe trails, ringed by peaks. I tramp through the deep snow, pausing by the sculpture of Neptune. According to a tiny plaque, Halley&apos;s Comet is expected back on 28 July 2061 \u2013 by which time I expect, and seriously hope, not a thing will have changed on Planet Weisshorn. \u2022 Doubles in winter at the Hotel Weisshorn (00 41 27 475 11 06; weisshorn.ch) start at 280CHF (\u00a3170) including breakfast and four-course dinner.

Furze tangles in cable-knit patterns, threshed wheat softens the fields with a smoky haze. Whispery specks drift into the distance, growing smaller and smaller until they mimic the effect of dissolving light. And the colours \u2013 parched sandy roads, lilac meadows, the faded rust of a little train with its puff of blue-grey smoke \u2013 well, the colours are all shiningly there. Except that, technically, they are not, being transmitted in pure black and white. Landscape Near Montmajour is a drawing, not a painting. It was made using a sharpened reed pen and ink. The common question applied to painters such as Vel\u00e1zquez, say \u2013 how could they achieve such illusions with a mere brush and paint? \u2013 becomes exceptional and no longer rhetorical in this case. For how did he do it? To stare into this sparkling image is not just to enter the view, but to share the artist&apos;s transforming vitality. It is no exaggeration to say it has a spellbinding aura. Van Gogh and his genius with ink turns out to be the theme of this show. Its occasion is the publication of a new edition of his letters, of which nearly 900 survive, running to a total of 2,000 pages. Extracts appear alongside 90 or so pictures. \u00adOriginals are displayed in vitrines, blown up on gigantic screens and even, with the final letter, presented as if they were art works themselves. And why not, since they are frequently beautiful, and always eloquent, trenchant and impassioned. That last letter, not incidentally, which was found in his jacket after Van Gogh shot himself, is characteristically lucid and composed. The handwriting holds fast in the service of communicating reassurance to his brother, Theo, unlike the nearly illegible scratchings of his contemporary Nietzsche, which, in their every word and mark, express a mind vanishing into the tunnel of insanity. Van Gogh&apos;s last letter is not a suicide note, either. Now you might say that this famous correspondence is just another pretext, or curatorial armature, for a show. And who needs words when faced with such images: the irises, sunflowers and blazing cherry blossom, the auraed suns and starlit haloes, the crisp flakes of sunlight seen through dark leaves and the burning black cypresses? The redoubtable postman Roulin, blue eyed and true, the peasant-apostles bent over the dark earth, the bull-necked zouave: his friends who became ours through art. But the letters are full of insights \u2013 quite literally. Look close and you see, as he writes, how a certain green &quot;saddens&quot; grey, how yellow against cobalt stimulates hope, how a farmer may be shaped by the landscape. Patterned nature, sonic colour, the moods of water, the multiple personalities of black: the letters offer new ways of seeing all the time. And once you have discovered his ambition for a particular work, it tunes your eye to the next. What a revelation when Van Gogh imagines his canvas of Madame Roulin propped in a boat, rocking &quot;even Icelandic fishermen&quot; to easeful sleep: the portrait as melodious lullaby. Van Gogh&apos;s brain speeds, but his writing keeps up, page after page, night after night, words tucked between lines and curling around them. Some letters include incidental sketches \u2013 a cross-section of the actual pencil he is using to show its strange shape, a lifesize portrait of the paintbrush he needs to make another such image. But many climax with what he humbly calls &quot;scratchings&quot; \u2013 fully finished drawings for Theo that show no loss of power because of their size. The first masterpiece here, indeed, is a vision of winter so still the very air seems frozen solid, worked in a chip of black chalk on the outside of a modest envelope. But there comes a point where the letters have done their work, directing the eye so well that the visitor no longer needs them. Which is as it should be, for the images are stupendous, and some rarely displayed in Britain, whereas the correspondence, superb as it is, can be read for nothing day or night on the internet. Stubble, dank furrows, pollarded willows, reedbeds and thatch, the hunched and straitened worker: to begin with, it seems as though Holland was made for Van Gogh or, rather, his drawings. Those bony figures, those monochrome scenes of reaping and sowing in the gloomy fields feel sacramental: a gospel of sorrow and humility inscribed in cross-hatched ink. But very suddenly \u2013 and the shock is mimicked here in the stunning transition between two galleries \u2013 the painting bursts into life. Van Gogh has gone to Paris, seen impressionism, absorbed its lessons. But he turns out to be less interested in the ever-changing effects of light than in the world&apos;s more profound and jubilant truths. There is a table top of oranges in this show so incandescent one takes a dazed step backwards. The white cloth scintillates, racing up towards the brilliant blue aura of a basket formed of twining, dancing willow. The oranges within form a troupe of glowing spheres. The very walls seem to be watching the show, admiring the celluloid crackle of sunshine on peel, the singular beauty of each fruit, the sensational all-together-now performance. Why should oranges not be some kind of miracle? Each painting is a breakthrough and an advanced act of praise. Each feels like the very thing Van Gogh believes he can never achieve, namely the painting of the future. Look at his raging-red crabs rampant against an arsenical green ground, as if protesting their independence: the wildest crustaceans in art, perpetually avant-garde; or the dynamically worked surface of his white roses, incandescent against a pale green wall. The flowers are stunning enough, but the power is in these electrifying brushmarks that channel the flow of sensation, still live with the maker&apos;s touch. It is as trite by now to say that Van Gogh was one of the sanest artists who ever lived, as it is to claim the late paintings as proof of this sanity. In these wheat fields, roses and cerulean skies, we are, moreover, supposed to discover serenity. There may be joy, perhaps, and exultation, but surely not the stasis that serenity implies. Van Gogh looks at the world and forges forward, improvising new notations, bringing back the experiences more immediately than any other artist before or since. In one of the late letters, he rounds on abstraction. There is the whole of life, after all, just waiting to be disentangled. And one of the thrills of this show \u2013 there is no other word \u2013 is watching this happen, from the hunched peasants made when he was teaching himself to draw with manuals to the intricate glory of his Landscape Near Montmajour, all in a mere few years. It is one of the shortest careers in art yet, like the world it represents, its transformations appear inexhaustible. Van Gogh is not the patron saint of martyrs, or madmen, or misunderstood visionaries, but of continuous revolution \u2013 of trying too hard to make the world new every time and, thereby, succeeding.  Five breathtaking moments: masterpieces to look out for in the show The Yellow House at Arles (1888) Treasure loaned by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam: hard to say which glows more \u2013 the yellow house or the pulsing blue sky. Landscape Near Montmajour With a Train (1888) Monumental, teeming, yet perfectly controlled, this is one of the greatest landscapes in all art, made with nothing but a reed pen and ink. Roses (1890) One of the last pictures Van Gogh painted in the asylum at Saint Remy, a cascade of brilliant blossoms over a pale green backdrop irradiated by waves of white light. Reaper (1885) One of six black chalk portraits of labourers on the land, heroic in scale, homages to Dutch miners and peasants.

And so it proved at the EU&apos;s informal meeting of justice and home affairs ministers (from all 27 governments) in Toledo, Spain, last week. As expected, an EU-US joint declaration on aviation security was agreed, which included the use of biometrics, passenger screening and the &quot;identification of illicit materials&quot; through &quot;enhanced technologies&quot; (eg body scanners, which in effect strip people naked). US demands steered the EU to making a change to its planned EU-wide PNR (Passenger Name Record) system and to get a promise that the delayed Swift interim agreement on the transfer of all financial transactions in the EU to the USA would be fast-tracked. The joint declaration followed from the Christmas bombing attempt on the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The exchange of information mechanism is to be urgently examined, which is obviously paramount as not stopping Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab boarding the US-bound plane was an avoidable intelligence failure. US intelligence agencies were told by his father that he had become &quot;extremist&quot; while in Yemen but, as Barack Obama put it, the agencies failed to &quot;connect the dots&quot;. If they had, he would not have been allowed to board the plane in Amsterdam. But would body scanners in the Netherlands \u2013 as now proposed \u2013 have led to denial of boarding? Expert opinion suggests they would be unlikely to detect the 80g of PETN explosives hidden in his underpants, and what if they had been concealed in a body cavity? Non-intrusive technology does exist for detecting most explosive and liquid materials \u2013 for example, by 2014 the EU is to totally remove the ban on liquids with the introduction of new screening equipment. Sound intelligence, if used, can deny boarding to a potential terrorist and the political will to bring in this cutting-edge technology as soon as possible would mean we do not all have to be treated as &quot;suspects&quot;. The EU commissioner for justice Jacques Barrot, the Spanish EU council presidency and the US secretary for homeland security said there was a contradictory situation because although the EU-USA PNR agreement (data on people flying to the USA) was in place, there was nothing covering travel between EU countries. The EU interior ministers said they now want to &quot;urgently&quot; create an EU PNR system. The EU does have a planned EU PNR system, but this only covers travel in and out of the EU. A number of powerful EU states, including the UK, have always wanted this measure to be extended to cover travel in and out of the EU, travel between EU states and travel within each country by air, sea and land \u2013 which would lead to all travel by everyone being monitored. Finally, the US used the meeting to get a promise from EU interior ministers that the delayed interim agreement on Swift (US access to all financial transactions) would be fast-tracked through the European parliament with a view to a final decision early in February. The USA got its way on every issue but it should not be forgotten that, so far, the Obama administration has rolled back few, if any, of the draconian powers given to homeland security agencies by George Bush nor drawn back from the wider transition to a surveillance society.

The teacher told them he hadn&apos;t come in that day. &quot;I put up my hand and said: &apos;But I am here.&apos; Stern, now a retired immunologist, is recalling that fateful moment as dusk gathers outside his sitting room in Leicester. &quot;The poor woman was trying to protect me. I&apos;ll never \u00adforget the look on her face as I was led away.&quot; He was \u00adarrested, aged five, \u00adbecause his father was a Jew. Martin and his one-year-old sister Erica were taken to Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands, where they were housed in wooden huts, each one crammed with as many as 800 people. &quot;The food consisted of vegetables unfit for sale. Old runner beans that hadn&apos;t been stringed were nicknamed &apos;barbed wire&apos; by the boys I was with because they were painful to eat.&quot; Martin&apos;s parents were Germans who had fled to Holland before the war. His non-Jewish mother died in hospital shortly after giving birth to his sister. His father was hidden by courageous farmers near Amsterdam airport after the German invasion of Holland, only to be captured by Nazis after a shoot-out in which he apparently killed two of them. There is a photograph of \u00adMartin&apos;s father on the sitting room wall, taken before he left Germany. It shows a young, smartly dressed man with, you might think, a bright future. &quot;As you can see, he was well-to-do,&quot; says Martin. &quot;He died a skeleton of a man on 25 March 1945 in Buchenwald.&quot; Martin and Erica were looked after by two separate Dutch families for two years before they were arrested. &quot;I lived near the Anne Frank house,&quot; he says. After Martin&apos;s abduction from nursery school, Cathrien and Jo (short for \u00adJohannes) Rademakers, who had looked after Martin, were themselves arrested. For the crime of caring for a five-year-old Jewish orphan, Jo was sent to Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, where he died. All his wife got back were his spectacles. At Westerbork, Martin would each week see trains of cattle trucks being packed with people he knew. &quot;They looked like ordinary railwaymen \u00adcramming people in. Why were they doing that? It was a puzzle for a five-year-old.&quot; There were signs marked Auschwitz or Sobib\u00f3r on the side of the trains but the prisoners did not know the significance. &quot;One day my train came and, \u00adremarkably, it was a passenger train.&quot; He and his sister travelled together and, at a huge German station, were transferred to cattle trucks heading for Theresienstadt, where the Nazis had established a walled ghetto. It was on the three- or four-day journey that Martin saw his first corpse. &quot;I couldn&apos;t travel on trains for years without being reminded of the clickety-clack, clickety-clack of the train going to Theresienstadt. Thanks to modern welded rails I am no longer reminded of that noise every time I go on a train.&quot; A Dutch woman, Catharina Casoeto de Jong, imprisoned in Theresienstadt for the crime of marrying a Jewish market trader, began looking after Martin and Erica on their arrival, bringing them food from the ghetto kitchen where she worked and housing them in a series of overcrowded dormitories. Mrs De Jong daily risked murder for her compassion \u2013 smuggling food from the kitchens was punishable by summary execution. &quot;Theresienstadt had the reputation of being a paradise for captured Jews,&quot; says Martin. &quot;It was better than Auschwitz, but no paradise. &quot;One morning, Mrs De Jong woke me up. The Red Army had liberated the ghetto and I had slept through it all. They had moved on before I got up \u00adbecause typhus was rife in Theres\u00adienstadt and the last thing an army needs is exposure to typhus.&quot; After a harrowing journey home by train and river barge with Mrs De Jong, Martin and Erica were reunited with their adoptive mother in Amsterdam. He lived with Cathrien Rademakers for only a few months and then the two children were both raised by the \u00adBangmas, the couple who had looked after Erica \u00adbefore her arrest. When Mrs Bangma died, Erica and Martin, by then aged 12, went to Manchester to live with his \u00adfather&apos;s sister, who had managed to \u00adescape to Britain before the war, and her husband. &quot;It was not easy starting again with people we didn&apos;t know and a language that was strange to us.&quot; Martin describes his survival this way: &quot;Surviving is like undoing a combination lock by chance.&quot; But he and Erica did more than survive \u2013 they flourished. Martin studied medicine at Oxford, \u00adbecoming an immunologist and an \u00adauthority on asthma. Erica returned to the Netherlands, where she taught at the University of Utrecht. She married but had no children, and died in 2007. Martin now lives in retirement with his wife and has three children and four granddaughters. Now 70, he spends a lot of his time telling his story to children. &quot;The expression &apos;Never again&apos; has become a cruel mockery,&quot; he says. &quot;We won&apos;t solve the problem by UN resolutions on genocide. The only hope is that in the future every child in the world should be educated to immunise it against the tendency to hate others and to regard others as inferior.&quot;", "sentences": ["Two young Dutch men walked into a nursery school in Amsterdam one day in 1944 and asked for Martin Stern.", "His father was hidden by courageous farmers near Amsterdam airport after the German invasion of Holland, only to be captured by Nazis after a shoot-out in which he apparently killed two of them.", "They had moved on before I got up \u00adbecause typhus was rife in Theres\u00adienstadt and the last thing an army needs is exposure to typhus.&quot; After a harrowing journey home by train and river barge with Mrs De Jong, Martin and Erica were reunited with their adoptive mother in Amsterdam."], "title": "Memories of the Holocaust: Martin Stern", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/holocaust-memorial-day-martin-stern", "tags": ["Holocaust", "World news", "Social history", "Society", "Second world war"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-27T10:00:00Z", "article": "Earlier this month, on 11 January, two individuals whose lives were bound up with the story of the Holocaust died. One was male, the other female. The former was born and lived in Estonia but later fled to Finland and Sweden and ultimately found refuge in Venezuela, where he became a multimillionaire. The latter was born in Austria, but lived in Holland throughout the Nazi occupation and remained in Amsterdam for the rest of her life. Both were ostensibly minor figures during the years 1939-1945, but became better-known after the war as news of their deeds was publicised. One was a Nazi collaborator, the other a &quot;Righteous Gentile&quot;. I am referring to Harry Mannil, who served in the dreaded Estonian political police, which carried out the arrest and execution of numerous Jews and communists in Tallinn during the initial year of the Nazi occupation and to Miep Gies, who played a critical role in hiding Anne Frank, her family and four additional Jews from the Nazis in Amsterdam and was the person who saved Anne&apos;s diary. While neither had a prominent position, it would be instructive, as we approach Holocaust Memorial Day to take a closer look at their activities and the decisions they made during the war to focus on the important lessons we can learn from the fate of European Jewry during the Holocaust. In that respect, the most significant fact to keep in mind about the Holocaust is that it was not an unavoidable natural disaster, but a tragedy created by human beings. It did not have to happen and might have been prevented if the right decisions had been made. And that is why there is so much to be learned from its history and why the work of organisations such as the Holocaust Educational Trust are so vital. It was decisions made by human beings at every level that determined the fate of so many people and that is why it is illuminating to contrast two people like Miep Gies and Harry Mannil. They were both relatively young when their countries were invaded by the Nazis (Miep was 31, Harry 22) and probably had no inkling that the war would create situations in which their decisions would influence the fates of numerous Jews. Harry Mannil decided to join the Estonian Nazi collaborators of the notorious political police, which helped implement the Nazis&apos; plan to annihilate all the local Jews and eliminate the communists. He was involved in arrests and interrogated at least seven Jews who were subsequently murdered. In that capacity, he was part of the machinery of destruction that rendered his homeland Judenrein (&quot;free of Jews&quot; in Nazi parlance), as noted in the protocol of the infamous Wannsee Conference at which the Final Solution was officially discussed. In contrast, Miep Gies chose to assist those persecuted by the Nazis and risked her life to try and save the eight Jews in the Frank family hiding place, only one of whom ultimately survived. The events of the second world war and the Nazis&apos; determination to annihilate all of European Jewry put the nations of the world to serious tests of morality and integrity. The manner in which they responded determined the fate of millions. The countries allied with Nazi Germany had to decide whether to turn over their Jews over to the Nazis while those in the free world had decide whether to help save them by admitting them as refugees while emigration was still possible. But there were also much more prosaic dilemmas faced by those in occupied Europe. And it was under those circumstances that individuals could make a difference in saving lives or murdering innocent people. That is why it is essential to remember people such as Miep Gies, a model of humanity and selfless sacrifice, but also never to forget those such as Harry Mannil, who chose to join the killers. Like millions of Europeans, their decisions made a difference in determining the fates of their Jewish neighbours, a lesson which should serve as an important warning to all of us and to future generations.", "sentences": ["The latter was born in Austria, but lived in Holland throughout the Nazi occupation and remained in Amsterdam for the rest of her life.", "I am referring to Harry Mannil, who served in the dreaded Estonian political police, which carried out the arrest and execution of numerous Jews and communists in Tallinn during the initial year of the Nazi occupation and to Miep Gies, who played a critical role in hiding Anne Frank, her family and four additional Jews from the Nazis in Amsterdam and was the person who saved Anne&apos;s diary."], "title": "Two lives and the Holocaust | Efraim Zuroff", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jan/27/holocaust", "tags": ["Holocaust", "Second world war", "The far right", "Judaism", "Estonia", "Netherlands", "World news", "Europe", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-29T12:31:42Z", "article": "     When Bruce Weber released Let&apos;s Get Lost in 1988, his documentary on the trumpeter Chet Baker, it joined the likes of Bertrand Tavernier&apos;s Round Midnight and Clint Eastwood&apos;s Bird in a group of late-1980s films that showed prominent jazz artists on the skids.  A huge improvement from the years in which jazz movies were considered a joke, these documentaries also indicated how deeply attached writers and film-makers of a certain generation were to the tempting symmetry of saxophones, syringes, and stumbling idols kept upright only by music and devoted admirers. Chet Baker was a &quot;doomed youth&quot; who might have been made for Hollywood&apos;s idea of jazz. He perfectly suited the white, postwar myth of the gifted, self-destructive and marginalised artist. Looking like James Dean was the worst thing that ever happened to the trumpeter/singer. A charismatic and talented prince of cool jazz, Baker represented a seductive form of passive rebellion. If he was the romantic ballad-singer who was irresistible to women, and the trumpet lyricist who played by ear, then he was also the shambolic, alienated junkie, who would eventually be found dead on an Amsterdam street, at the age of 58. Back in the early 1950s, however, Baker was a rising star who had been recruited by Charlie Parker to inherit the mantle previously worn by Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. Parker once described Baker as the boy from California who would &quot;eat him up&quot;.  He then went on to join baritone saxophonist and composer Gerry Mulligan, a key contributor to Davis&apos;s groundbreaking Birth of the Cool album. Mulligan played the cumbersome baritone sax as if it were a tenor, or even an alto, preserving its gruff and rugged sound, but giving it a melodic agility that resembled the fluency of Lester Young. But he was also a composer and arranger of harmonic sophistication and theme-weaving contrapuntal skill, who could write illuminatingly for big bands (he was a staff arranger for Stan Kenton) and make small bands sound bigger than they were. Mulligan played The Haig, on Wiltshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, in 1952. The young Chet Baker began sitting in. Because the vibraphonist Red Norvo, a mainstay at the club, took a keyboard-player&apos;s role, the establishment had disposed of its piano. So Mulligan and Baker began thinking of how to work without one. An elegant, intertwining, low-key and ambiguously chord-free jazz evolved, and with it an increasingly enthusiastic audience.  The heyday of this quartet (Mulligan and Baker, plus bass and drums) was in 1952-53, after which Mulligan was sent to prison on narcotics charges, and Baker became a solo star. But at that time, the &quot;pianoless quartet&quot; became one of the most distinctive sounds in jazz; the quintessence of the cool style and a model for innumerable ensembles to this day.

A Hugh Grant vehicle it ain&apos;t. What affected me most was not the film&apos;s ferocity and sexual abuse, but the mother&apos;s constant haranguing, telling the eponymous Precious she would never succeed in anything beyond claiming welfare. She did not just chip away at her self-esteem, she bulldozed it to dust. The mother spits bile at her daughter, accusing her of trying to rise above her by attending college (in a remedial class for teenagers who can barely read and write). We can only guess at the backstory that motivates a mother to denigrate her offspring so, but I fear it is a common one. Precious shows us an extreme example of how many young people have failure drummed into them. Though my upbringing was nothing like that depicted in the film, I felt echoes of a sentiment perhaps never even voiced in my family of origin but which I have inherited. The message said: &quot;Not for the likes of us.&quot; In 2001, I was sitting in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam when an invisible hand tapped me on the shoulder. A voice whispered: &quot;What are you doing here, you oik? These places ain&apos;t for the likes of you.&quot; In other circumstances, I might have run whimpering, my confidence scared off by the ghost of a working-class past, but I had an appointment to keep. I was waiting for a curator to discuss my first solo show in a major museum, a landmark in any artist&apos;s career. This significant moment had provoked the voice I heard in my head. It was a thankfully dying echo of an unconscious attitude I had absorbed through my family and my peers. A voice that nags subliminally that I, a person from a relatively uncultured background, should not enter, let alone exhibit in, a temple of high art. Psychologists have a phrase for this feeling of not belonging; they call it &quot;impostor syndrome&quot; and it is probably familiar to anyone who has risen through the social or cultural hierarchy; a feeling that if I picked up the wrong fork or used the wrong word, humiliation and expulsion would result. Alan Bennett in Dinner at Noon says it was not lack of money or education that kept his parents in their place, but fear of embarrassment. Of course, lack of money and education are the main things that hold a lot of people back, but impostor syndrome has a big part to play. I&apos;ve called my background working class, but we were not particularly poor. It was, though, a house of few books, no paintings and no enthusiastic discussions of culture. Aged nearly 50, I still occasionally find myself overcompensating for my background by using inappropriately long or arcane words, a trait I spot in other class travellers. Stories about the difficulties of class mobility have always felt especially poignant to me. In Dennis Potter&apos;s play Stand Up, Nigel Barton, Nigel, after leaving the mining community he grew up in and going to Oxford University, finds himself feeling not only an alien among the posh students, but increasingly uncomfortable at home when he visits his father. It is a significant move to overtake one&apos;s parents and move into a different socio-economic bracket. It is a move that is at once creative of a better life and also destructive of an old one. It is saying goodbye to being satisfied with one&apos;s lot, being bound together in adversity and putting aside shared values. I have sometimes heard friends from working-class backgrounds mourn that their parents are not equipped, or even willing, to appreciate what they have achieved and how they have struggled in middle-class fields sociologically a million miles away from where they grew up. Often, the voice that says: &quot;Not for the likes of us&quot; manifests itself in people as a pride in hardship and ignorance. Fans of Sarah Palin would say of her: &quot;She&apos;s real.&quot; &quot;Real&quot; I interpret in this case to mean average, sentimental, bitter and anti-intellectual just like them. &quot;Real&quot; is a weapon word in the class war; &quot;get real&quot; they say to mock dreams of a better life. The &quot;real world&quot; is always harder, as if a wealthier, more intellectually stimulating, better-mannered life were only ever a silly fantasy. &quot;Real&quot; does not mean poor and rude and unhappy. Those who do achieve class mobility usually do so through parental support and good education, but they often find that adopting the mores of the dominant culture doesn&apos;t hurt one bit. In his radio programme Mind Your Slanguage, Benjamin Zephaniah found that bright kids instinctively knew when to moderate their patois in order to communicate in a classroom or workplace. Many class travellers have found that a Zelig-like ability to mirror the class of whoever one is dealing with is a very useful social tool. In doing this, though, they can find that they have to ignore that internal voice again, as it whispers that they are class traitors and that articulacy and tact are snobbish and sissy. In the Guardian last summer, Jenni Russell wrote about the often unspoken importance of good, middle-class manners when applying for a job. She suggests that young people from working-class backgrounds need mentoring in middle classness in the way that business people are tutored in the customs of foreign cultures they are about to go and work in. This is not just about polishing high-achievers; class prejudice has far more impact when interviewers are choosing between average candidates. The super-talented usually get on in life despite the way they hold their knife. I imagine salt-of-the-earth types screaming through a mouthful of pie and mushy peas: &quot;Why should we change?&quot; If the middle classes are so tolerant of race and sexuality, why can&apos;t they put up with a bit of bad grammar and a low-slung waistband? It&apos;s harmless. But is it? Good manners are mainly common sense rules about showing respect for others, not barging to the front of a queue, not swearing, not dropping litter. Some of it though is just middle class taste \u2013 how we hold cutlery or how we refer to the midday meal. Taste is the real battleground of the classes. My middle-class wife cringes if I walk round the house naked from the waist up \u2013 to her it is the height of aggressive vulgarity. I think aspirant class travellers need to take the issue of taste seriously. I think it&apos;s fine to trample over polite, middle-class taste as long as you know you are doing it and understand the context. Jackson Pollock probably got away with urinating in Peggy Guggenheim&apos;s fireplace, but we are no longer in the 1950s when a working-class accent was an exotic accessory in the salons of the chattering classes. So chewing gum at a job interview is a no-no. Disadvantaged young people might not have the full set of millstones carried by Precious, but they might well have their own inner voice saying: &quot;Not for the likes of us.&quot; They need to be taught to tell it: &quot;Would you mind awfully and please shut the fuck up.&quot; Grayson Perry is a patron of the National Arts Learning Network, an organisation set up to help young people from diverse backgrounds into art education", "sentences": ["The message said: &quot;Not for the likes of us.&quot; In 2001, I was sitting in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam when an invisible hand tapped me on the shoulder."], "title": "If you have ever felt a class apart, this column is for the likes of you | Grayson Perry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/31/grayson-perry-social-mobility", "tags": ["Society", "Social mobility"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-01-31T00:07:38Z", "article": "Sundance has become a reliable way of taking the pulse of liberal America. Last year, the festival coincided with the inauguration of America&apos;s first black president. People seemed poised between fear and euphoria. Now the ski lodges and posh cafes are filled with sober, uncertain voices. Blue state Americans don&apos;t know what to think about the numerous setbacks of the last months, such as the defeat of healthcare. They want to know how to survive a terrible, seemingly open-ended recession. For its part, the festival has reacted to flagging corporate sponsorship by loudly affirming its desire to return to roots. &quot;THIS IS THE RENEWED REBELLION,&quot; proclaim the slogans at the beginning of each screening. &quot;THE RECHARGED FIGHT AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXPECTED.&quot; But rebellion seems to be the wrong way of characterising what appears to be a tentative groping after style and solutions. People muttered about the merits of Four Lions, Chris Morris&apos;s comedy about blowing yourself up and at the screening I went to I heard ambivalent American titters. This may not be a moment for cultural innovation. Celebrities are few and hard to spot. Bill Gates sent a Twitter message to the effect that the $4,000 he spent at Sundance (the cost of a ticket that gets you to the front of the queue at any screening) was the best bargain of his life. A film about (and also partly by) Banksy was shown semi-clandestinely, in a cheeky attempt to replicate the anti-marketing strategies of its subject. A well-coiffed but near anonymous Elton John was to be glimpsed at a party. Far from renewing rebellion, the best fiction films at Sundance seemed bent on reclaiming the best of the past. Cyrus, directed and written by the Duplass brothers, begins in 1970s mode with John (an underemployed freelance film editor) caught masturbating in a messy apartment. She has come to tell him she&apos;s getting married again. Undeterred, John gets himself going again, bagging Molly at a party. The rest of the film recounts the bizarre, wholly dysfunctional three-way relationship involving Molly and John (crazy about each other) and Molly&apos;s seriously overweight, manipulative, seedy 22-year-old son, who composes music when not wrecking his mother&apos;s life by seeking to expel her lover. Not wholly convincingly, the film has a happy ending. Holy Rollers is 1970s Scorsese in its dark Brooklyn nightclub and warehouses locations and muddied sound. But this is a terrific, wholly contemporary adaptation of the true, only-in-New York story involving Hassidic Jews and the smuggling of ecstasy. Rabbis, wig-wearing mothers and excruciating interpretations of the Torah are rendered respectfully. Action takes place in the dark, disco-filled places where Seriously Bad Jews hang out. They convince Hassidim to go to sinful Amsterdam, secrete ecstasy tablets in their fur hats (they are told that the pills are medicinal and, naively, they believe it) and walk back through customs in Montreal. Shmuel, the film&apos;s gawky, large-hatted and dreadlocked adolescent hero, is straight out of Malamud or early Roth. His struggles to get free are touching because, drug-smuggling notwithstanding, they seem serious, old-fashioned, so totally at odds with the present. And the film is astonishingly sexy, too. Recently, American campaigning documentaries have focused on eco-horrors. This year, they encompassed subjects as diverse as nukes and America&apos;s flagging high school system. An improbable celebrity was Muhammad Yunus, wearing a tan waistcoat and a white shirt amid the assembled anoraks, promoting a film about the import of microcredit from Bangladesh, where it was invented, to Queens. The Nobel prize-winning Yunus is a patient and charismatic revolutionary. For millions, his innovative banking practices have come to be a way out of poverty. He thinks small-scale loans could transform the lives of America&apos;s poor, too. Audiences cheered Freedom Riders, an eloquent account of those who were brave or rash enough to carry the cause of desegregation to the racist heart of the south in 1961, riding Greyhound or Trailways buses. It&apos;s astonishing how well these would-be martyrs have aged and their testimony makes one believe that these exploits happened yesterday rather than representing a now distant, more optimistic America. One might expect such a film to depict the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King as heroes; instead, Stanley Nelson shows them to be caught up by events, looking worse and worse as they attempt to broker compromises until the spirit of the riders sweeps them away. By contrast, audiences were stunned by Alex Gibney&apos;s detailed account of congressional corruption in Casino Jack and the United States of Money. I&apos;m not sure why the exploits of Jack Abramoff, lobbyist extraordinary, aren&apos;t well known in Britain. He was a one-man black hole of the Bush years, taking over Congress, funnelling money and freebies everywhere. Gibney is a tough investigative journalist in the best American tradition. He was at pains to point out that the Abramoff story wasn&apos;t history. &quot;The Supreme Court has just removed limits on campaign funding,&quot; he said, gloomily. &quot;I&apos;m not sure that people realise what this means. You have to realise that the power of money could further dominate American life.&quot; Sundance is at its best when it is most bizarrely unexpected. Danish film The Red Chapel chronicles the official visit of a pair of stand-up comedians to North Korea, and the incomprehension of their minder, Mrs Pac, confronted by whoopee cushions and clog-dancing. This year&apos;s Cinderellas of Sundance were the Australian cane toads depicted by Mark Lewis in glorious 3-D in Cane Toads: The Conquest. After being introduced in the 1930s from Hawaii, they invaded most of Australia, carpeting entire towns. Although locals hunt them, dogs who sniff them experience ecstasy. In recession-era America, these toads seem benign, even lovable.

The universities minister, David Lammy, said a number of institutions had been identified and instructed to work closely with the police. Lammy told the BBC: &quot;We have identified universities for whom the risk is greater, and they have to work closely with Special Branch. So I think it is a partnership between leadership at universities and the police. Speculation that the alleged &quot;underpants bomber&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was radicalised at University College London has raised concerns about campus extremism. Malcolm Grant, the president of UCL, insisted last week: &quot;We must of course ensure that universities are not converted into hotbeds of radicalisation. But this is a long way from reality.&quot; Lammy said: &quot;We recognise that threat levels have been raised and that this is an extremely serious issue and that there are particular institutions \u2013 and those institutions are aware of this because we have brought it to their attention \u2013 where the risk is greater. Those institutions are working very closely with the police, and are working closely with Special Branch, and those institutions are present on campus.&quot; Vice-chancellors announced last month they were establishing a panel to look at how universities can take action to prevent violent extremism while protecting freedom of speech. Abdulmutallab was the focus of a major terror investigation on both sides of the Atlantic after allegedly attempting to detonate a powdery substance on a flight from Amsterdam as it prepared to land in Detroit with 280 people on board on Christmas Day. Lammy declined to name the institutions in question, saying he did not think that would be &quot;helpful&quot; and refused to be drawn on whether university Islamic societies should be monitored more closely.

The greasy textures of grimed windows and glimpses of old cassettes of sensual music wait wanly among the red lights. And people peer, silently absorbed in the installation The Hoerengracht by Nancy and Ed Kienholz that opened last autumn at the National Gallery and will continue there, free, until 21 February. It has been fascinating to observe responses to this exhibition and the relationship it has taken up with the collection of great paintings that surrounds it. The Hoerengracht is a new departure in the National&apos;s presentation of contemporary art. It is not a direct response by an artist to the collection, like the works in the exhibition Encounters a few years ago. Nor is it made in a medium, such as painting, that obviously mirrors the collection. No, this is installation art, and what&apos;s more, it&apos;s outrageous in its scatalogical subject matter, a grotesque portrayal of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district. So why does it fits in so well? Because that is what I have observed. I was expecting a cataclysm, a riot, a confrontation of new and old. Nothing of the kind has taken place. The Hoerengracht has fitted smoothly and unprovocatively into the museum. It seems perfectly natural to look at it, then look at the nearby paintings by the masters. And why? Partly because of the quality of the work \u2013 it has ideas in it, and it has craft in it. Ed Kienholz is a tremendous artist, this is a potent tableau.  But what really slides it into the collection is its theme. Sex is no stranger at the National. Walk a short way from this installation and you can see Caravaggio&apos;s Boy Bitten By a Lizard. In another room is Bronzino&apos;s Venus and Cupid.  It&apos;s simply wrong to think that high European painting - the tradition this museum displays so well \u2013 is always spiritual and lofty. A great painting can be shockingly carnal. It can be pornographic. Oil painting is the greatest come-on ever devised, and that makes the Hoerengracht a telling, intriguing visitor in these hallowed halls.", "sentences": ["No, this is installation art, and what&apos;s more, it&apos;s outrageous in its scatalogical subject matter, a grotesque portrayal of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district."], "title": "Pornographic art?

In many respects he is a stereotypical Dutch interviewee: calm, considered, engaging and with an ability to dissect a tactical master plan more articulately than his managers might appreciate. But he is also a defender who longed for the \u00adpassion and aggression of the English game while at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and who left that club partly on account of the ease he collected yellow cards in Spain. It is, therefore, not entirely surprising that to him the \u00adMerseyside derby represents &quot;a nice game&quot;. Scousers do not consider their derby &quot;nice&quot;; most would recoil at the suggestion, although they have not shared Heitinga&apos;s experience of being abused by opposition fans from the age of seven. Or feeling under siege whenever the Ajax academy graduate and lifelong fan ventured into Rotterdam. He may have been schooled in the beautiful game during almost 18 years with the Amsterdam club but his will to win was forged on ferocious rivalry. Hence, when he lines up opposite Dirk Kuyt, Ryan Babel and his former Atl\u00e9tico captain Maxi Rodr\u00edguez this lunchtime, their friendships will cease the moment Everton and Liverpool emerge from the Anfield tunnel. &quot;We are friends but that doesn&apos;t \u00admatter in football,&quot; says Heitinga, a \u00a36m signing from Madrid last August. &quot;Whether it is in the Dutch league or in Madrid last season, when there were a lot of Dutch players for Atl\u00e9tico and Real, when the game starts I want to win. It doesn&apos;t matter how. If I have to kick someone because he is going through on goal, I will kick him. &quot;After the game I will shake hands and go for a drink with them but, in the game, there is only one winner and for me that is Everton. It is a derby and I think it is a nice game for us, because if you see the way Liverpool are playing it is a time when we have a chance to beat them. It will not be easy but it is better to face them now than when they won the Champions League, for example.&quot; Heitinga and Kuyt are in frequent contact \u2013 although not this week \u2013 and the Everton man is yet to arrange a reunion with Rodr\u00edguez following the \u00adArgentinian&apos;s recent move to Anfield. &quot;It was hard for me in the beginning at Atl\u00e9tico because he doesn&apos;t speak English and I didn&apos;t speak Spanish but if I argue with him on Saturday it will be in Spanish,&quot; the Dutch international admits. &quot;It will be a lot easier for me because there are a lot of Spanish people in the Liverpool team.&quot; Heitinga also has ties with the former Liverpool player Boudewijn Zenden, now at Sunderland, whose sister he will marry in July. &quot;He&apos;s a professional and Liverpool aren&apos;t the only team he&apos;s played for so I hope he&apos;s supporting me on Saturday,&quot; he says. Zenden has warned his future brother-in-law what to expect at Anfield but you suspect that even without the experience of Liverpool&apos;s 2-0 win at Goodison in November Heitinga will be unperturbed. &quot;This is a derby and it is a nice game, whereas Ajax-Feyenoord is more like history and hatred, the fans really hate each other,&quot; he says, obviously unaware that the Merseyside derby is no love-in. &quot;For example, if you go from Ajax to the \u00adFeyenoord stadium there will be a police helicopter above the team coach and police cars outside. You feel like you&apos;re in a movie when you travel to these games with police helicopters overhead. When you reached the city the main roads would be blocked off with police, too, and this was all for a football game. It is not normal. &quot;Here, there is more respect and \u00adnothing should happen inside the stadium. In \u00adHolland there will be a big fight between the fans. Last weekend it was Feyenoord-Ajax and the Ajax supporters were not allowed inside the stadium. There is more hate from the supporters. I played 18 years for Ajax and never lost a game against Feyenoord once I turned professional. I thrived on those games, but it was something I was used to from my youth. I started at Ajax when I was seven and played many times against Feyenoord, and we even had problems at that age level with fanatical supporters who would come to these games and cause problems. Even kids&apos; games. Unbelievable.&quot; It is more than a hardened edge to his game, however, that has earned the 26-year-old 51 caps for Holland, a mosaic tribute at the Amsterdam Arena for his last appearance with Ajax, an \u00a38.8m move to Atl\u00e9tico and a place in David Moyes&apos;s plans to take Everton further than two successive fifth-placed finishes in the Premier League. Heitinga&apos;s assured performances have been instrumental in the side&apos;s recent rise, having overcome a difficult start in which injuries required him to fill several positions and cramp forced a few \u00adpremature substitutions. &quot;That wasn&apos;t me, it was my brother,&quot; he says, joking. &quot;It was the speed of the game. It is harder here, more box to box, and it doesn&apos;t \u00admatter whether you&apos;re playing Chelsea, Stoke or Hull, they&apos;re all hard.&quot; Heitinga finally found respite at centre-half, one of his favoured positions along with defensive midfielder, but in 23 appearances for Everton he has worked with three different defensive partners \u2013 Sylvain Distin, Lucas Neill and Philippe Senderos \u2013 in a disrupted campaign. The rousing reception received from travelling Evertonians at the end of last Saturday&apos;s 1-0 win at Wigan, Everton&apos;s ninth consecutive league game unbeaten, suggests he has coped admirably. &quot;This club has made me happy,&quot; he says, having struggled to adapt as easily to Spanish football. &quot;From the people upstairs to the dressing room, I&apos;ve been one of the team from the start. Maybe I should have come to England straight from Ajax. I had a good year in Spain but I already had the \u00adfeeling in Spain that I wanted to play in the \u00adPremier League.&quot; The hunch he would be better suited to the top flight of English football is \u00adbeginning to pay dividends. &quot;With the strikers Atl\u00e9tico have \u2013 Diego Forl\u00e1n, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and, in the past, Maxi Rodr\u00edguez and Sim\u00e3o \u2013 they are expected to score the goals and everyone else is expected to defend. Here everybody works together. In the last few games you will notice that the defending starts from the front with Louis Saha and Tim Cahill. They play so well for the defenders that it is easier for us defenders to defend against the team we are playing against. &quot;It is always long balls in the \u00adPremier League and with a player like Felli \u00ad[Marouane Fellaini] in front of you he can head and kick all the balls away. It&apos;s good for the team. In Spain it is more about \u00adplaying football from the back, there is more \u00adfootball, while here it is a \u00adcombination of playing football and a lot of passion, fighting.

A site near Birmingham International airport is being considered as a station on a new route that will link Britain&apos;s largest cities by a 50-minute train ride, according to rail industry sources. If the government pushes ahead with the plan it would take no longer to reach Britain&apos;s sixth largest airport from London&apos;s Euston station than it currently takes to get to Heathrow. The route would see the line emerging from Euston before travelling to Old Oak Common in west London where an interchange would link the route to Heathrow airport and Crossrail, a \u00a316bn rail service joining Heathrow to Canary Wharf due to open in 2017. The line would then sweep through Buckinghamshire to the West Midlands where a parkway station, where drivers can park their vehicles and use buses to complete their journey, would be built near Birmingham International and the nearby National Exhibition Centre. The first phase of the line, which the government hopes will become part of a UK-wide network, will terminate at a new station in Birmingham city centre but the main spur would continue up from Birmingham International through Trent Valley to join the west coast line north of Birmingham, where the services would continue at conventional speeds to Manchester and Scotland. Ministers are particularly sensitive about where the route goes once it emerges from London because the line is expected to go through a section of the Chiltern hills in Buckinghamshire \u2013 one of 40 areas of outstanding natural beauty in England and Wales. The Chilterns Conservation Board, the public body responsible for protecting the area, has warned that parts of the countryside could be &quot;trashed&quot; by a high-speed route. A 1,000-page report compiled by High Speed Two, a government-backed company, was delivered last year to the transport secretary, Lord Adonis, including a detailed plan for the first phase placing the tracks within five metres in urban areas and 25 metres in the countryside. It will include three broad proposals for a UK-wide network that would reduce the journey time from London to Edinburgh from four-and-a-half hours to two hours 40 minutes. London to Birmingham is expected to take 50 minutes using a service that will carry 18 trains per hour. Adonis is due to publish the report before the end of March, with construction on the first phase due to begin in 2017 and finish in 2025. A spokesman for Birmingham International said the airport had received no &quot;formal or informal&quot; indications that it will be on the high speed route, but added that a strong case exists for making it part of a new rail network because it will allow the airport to win back Midlands passengers who use Heathrow. Birmingham International airport plans to nearly treble in size from 9.2 million passengers per year to 27 million by 2030 without adding a new runway. Instead, it is building a 400m runway extension that will allow the airport to host planes with heavier fuel loads, opening up destinations such as San Francisco and China. A spokesman said that airports such as Manchester, Newcastle and Glasgow would also benefit. Birmingham International broke ranks with the aviation industry last year to lambast the government&apos;s apparent obsession with Britain&apos;s largest airport. Birmingham International&apos;s chief executive, Paul Kehoe, said it was &quot;preposterous&quot; to let Heathrow develop further. He added: &quot;Heathrow sucks in traffic, we have to support it and if you don&apos;t support it you are made to look like climate change deniers.&quot; A report by the Committee on Climate Change, a government advisory panel, has made the case for a third runway at Heathrow by forecasting that British airports can handle up to 140 million more passengers per year \u2011 which would allow at least four runways at Heathrow \u2011 by 2050. However, connecting Birmingham International to a high-speed rail line would suit the Conservative party, which has pledged to block a third runway and build an ultra-fast rail network instead. The shadow transport secretary, Theresa Villiers, expects regional airports such as Birmingham to soak up the airport growth permitted by the government&apos;s advisory body on climate change. The committee said that UK airports could add 140 million travellers per year, on top of 230 million currently, without breaching the government&apos;s target of limiting aviation&apos;s carbon dioxide emissions to 2005 levels by 2050. BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, said any attempt to transform Birmingham International airport into a serious competitor would not work. Heathrow connects 66 million passengers per year to 181 destinations around the world thanks to its two runways, while an attempt by British Airways to turn single-runway Gatwick airport into an alternative hub was a failure, it said. BAA executives estimate that 1.5 million people per year use Birmingham airport to fly to major European airports such as Frankfurt, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol and believe that establishing a high-speed link between Birmingham and Heathrow would see those travellers come to Heathrow instead. A Department for Transport spokesman said the Birmingham airport station was &quot;complete speculation&quot;. He added: &quot;We have yet to reach a view about specific routes. If the government decides to go ahead with plans for high-speed rail, it will publish a white paper by the end of March.&quot;", "sentences": ["BAA executives estimate that 1.5 million people per year use Birmingham airport to fly to major European airports such as Frankfurt, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol and believe that establishing a high-speed link between Birmingham and Heathrow would see those travellers come to Heathrow instead."], "title": "Heathrow faces threat from plan to link high-speed rail route with Birmingham", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/07/heathrow-threat-high-speed-rail-birmingham", "tags": ["Transport", "Transport policy", "Conservatives", "Heathrow Airports Authority", "Air transport", "UK news", "World news", "Business", "Politics", "Heathrow", "Travel", "Heathrow third runway", "Environment", "Travel and transport", "Rail transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-02-13T00:07:11Z", "article": "1 Breakfast for two LondonRelationships, the gurus tell us, are all about power balance, so where better than a glorious restaurant in a former hydraulic power station?

Start at Alstonefield village, and follow the meandering river Dove towards Lover&apos;s Leap, a 130ft spur from which a jilted girl attempted to throw herself in the 18th century. Bushes broke her fall, however, and she lived to love again.

The Worm&apos;s Head outcrop stretches out to sea, becoming an island when the tide comes in. Stroll out there before enjoying a spectacular sunset over the sweeping, sandy beach, surrounded by towering cliffs.

In August 1967 the Beatles, fried by pop, fame and LSD, were searching for something beyond the &quot;wall of illusion&quot; they sang of in Within You Without You. So they travelled to a weekend retreat in Wales, where a 50-year-old Indian guru with a long grey beard initiated the group into the enlightenment-inducing power of transcendental meditation. The Beatles were transformed. They wrote songs of spiritual depth. They eulogised about meditation on primetime television. And they grew beards. They were sending out a clear message by throwing away their razors: we are hairy now; the days of madcap tomfoolery are over. Although still only in their mid-20s, John, Paul, George and Ringo were making a break from their clean-shaven, Fab Four selves and becoming men. Ever since then, growing a beard has become the thing to do for any pop star wishing to announce to the world that he \u2013 and in a few extreme cases, she \u2013 is no longer concerned with such childish fripperies as promotional meet and greets, being embarrassed by hyperactive presenters on Saturday morning television shows, and having a shave in the morning. The beard is the pop star&apos;s way of telling you he has read Das Kapital, The Tibetan Book Of The Dead, and \u2013 in Robbie Williams&apos;s case \u2013 The David Icke Guide To The Global Conspiracy (And How To End It). &quot;When the Beatles grew beards it was to do with their dedication to a new spiritual path, not a fashion statement,&quot; says Pete Byrne, who as owner of Liverpool&apos;s Parr Street Studios has witnessed the beard phenomenon firsthand, with Coldplay, Elbow and countless others entering his studio as fresh-faced youngsters and emerging as grizzly old men. &quot;These bands are growing beards without realising the reason behind it.&quot; The Beatles set a precedent that was picked up by their peers. Marvin Gaye was transformed from Motown heartthrob to consciousness-raising seeker of truths when he grew a beard for the cover of What&apos;s Going On. The Beach Boys went as far from their surfer dude image as it was possible to get by not only growing beards but also putting on weight, a trick copied by Jim Morrison who went one step further in his lifelong quest to be taken seriously by actually dying. Now you can pretty much predict the arrival of the pop star beard before it happens. It generally follows a band&apos;s breakthrough moment, when the image of impish charm that helped win fans has done its work and the fight is on to stake their claim in the pantheon of greatness. Around the release of Coldplay&apos;s fourth album Viva La Vida, Chris Martin realised that the away-with-the-fairies stare he had previously employed in photo shoots to suggest he was receiving divine inspiration rather than calculating how many units Coldplay needed to shift before they matched U2 wasn&apos;t really cutting it any more. So he drafted in Britain&apos;s premier pop boffin, Brian Eno, and grew something as vague and amorphous as Coldplay&apos;s music on his face: a semi-beard, too thick to be a five o&apos;clock shadow and too wispy to alienate the mainstream, Coldplay-loving, beard-fearing public. He was sitting on the follicle fence. Nobody was fooled. At the last sighting of Chris Martin, the beard was gone. The Killers&apos; beards were part of a calculated shift towards being deep. Their chief rivals the Bravery failed to grow beards and where are they now?     The Killers: not so hot (facial) fuzz Photograph: MJ Kim/Getty Images Europe    The Killers made a similar bid for credibility on their second album. Their radical shift from the 80s synth-pop of Hot Fuss to the Bruce Springsteen-influenced Americana of Sam&apos;s Town would never have worked had they not grown beards along the way. The beards were part of a calculated shift towards being deep. The Killers&apos; chief rivals, appalling 80s-influenced poseurs the Bravery, failed to grow beards, and where are they now? Keane would almost certainly grow beards if they could. As Shakespeare said, &quot;He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.&quot; Facial fuzz can also be a sign that something&apos;s going desperately wrong. The fondly remembered Ol&apos; Dirty Bastard made a stage invasion at the Hammerstein Ballroom while on the run, sporting a thick beard. Similarly, driven to near-insanity after spending months holed up in an LA mansion Googling his own name, Robbie Williams was first spotted with a beard in November 2007, wandering aimlessly around Amsterdam. Then he announced he was going on strike and would be spending his free time searching for UFOs in the Arizona desert. The bushy beard, flecked with grey, appeared to be an outward symbol of inner turmoil. Sure enough, when he returned to the pop life in late-2009, sober and professional, the beard was gone. Across the other side of the facial hair divide is a swathe of alternative musicians for whom the beard is not some self-conscious accessory but a way of life; an object of permanence in a fickle world. The face of hobo bluesman Seasick Steve, nominated for a 2010 Brit award, could well crumble to dust if someone attempted to remove the long grey beard that has held it together for so long. Folk-rock oddball Devendra Banhart&apos;s lustrous facial growth is an integral part of his being, so much so that when he dated Natalie Portman in 2008 New York gossip columnists reported that the actress was helping out a man from a local homeless shelter. And Texas band Midlake, whose new album The Courage Of Others has been championed for taking inspiration from such beard-friendly genres as US country and English folk-rock, seem to have beards sprouting from their very souls. But, for most, so long as youth is held up as a key component of pop, beards will continue to be a mid-career accessory. And they really can work wonders. For example, based on the law of averages, urban-lite trio N-Dubz have only got about six months left. But, should frontman Dappy consider developing that bum fluff on his cheek and upper lip into something resembling a manly beard, we might just get an N-Dubz concept album about a man who uses comical hats to communicate with aliens some time in 2020. SELF-IMPORTANT FACIAL HAIR: WHO&apos;S NEXT?     McElderry: beard pencilled in for 2012 Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA    Joe McElderry How long can the South Shields youngster be expected to do cover versions of Miley Cyrus songs? It&apos;s only a matter of time before McElderry releases an album of self-penned numbers that reveal the man inside and the terrible things Simon Cowell did to him. Ordinary Joe will feature a cover photograph of a grim-faced McElderry with an enormous beard and only a few teeth, clutching a quadruple whisky, crying. La Roux Because looking grumpy and having an asymmetrical haircut can only take you so far in the quest for credibility, and there is a strong tradition of electropop artists going rootsy on their second album (see the Killers). Elly Jackson won&apos;t be the first female pop star to rock a beard, either; that was fellow synthy androgyne Peaches. Muse Their latest album, which is based around the concept of an unnamed totalitarian state crushing the individual, contains a 13-minute symphony about humanity leaving a cursed Earth and starting off again elsewhere. Through what strength of will have they managed to remain so clean-shaven? Kings Of Leon Seemingly born bearded, they started off as a hairy critics&apos; favourite. Then they decided that they wanted to be up there with Bruce Springsteen, who only went stellar after revealing the chiselled good looks hidden under all that fuzz. Now as big as a band can get, the return to beards and the consequent respect of their peers is inevitable.", "sentences": ["Similarly, driven to near-insanity after spending months holed up in an LA mansion Googling his own name, Robbie Williams was first spotted with a beard in November 2007, wandering aimlessly around Amsterdam."], "title": "When Dappy grows a beard, it'll mean N-Dubz are getting serious", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/13/bands-with-beards-guardian", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Midlake", "The Killers", "Coldplay", "The Beatles"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-02-15T07:12:26Z", "article": "     Sports brand Asics is to launch a campaign for its running shoes that aims to highlight their technological superiority.

Are there any other teams out there named after individuals? The Knowledge inbox bulged at the seams this week, with a deluge of men (and a couple of women) who have the privilege of a team named in their honour. We decided to discount teams named after saints (because there are so many of them) and those \u2013 Milton Keynes Dons, for example \u2013 whose reside in towns and cities already named after the great and the good. Here are a few of our favourites: Vasco da Gama Formed out of a rowing club already named after the famous Portuguese explorer. Willem II The Eredivisie side from Tilburg are named after King Willem II of the Netherlands. Tilburg housed his military headquarters. Newell&apos;s Old Boys Isaac Newell came into the world in Strood, Kent, on 24 April 1853. By the time he left it, on 16 October 1907, he had created what would go on to be one of Argentinian football&apos;s most famous clubs. Club Atl\u00e9tico Aldosivi Another side from Argentina. &quot;The name originates from the first two letters of the last names of the four original founders,&quot; writes Russell Yong. &quot;Allard, Dollfus, Sillard and Wiriott \u2013 the W changing to a V due to there being no W key on the telegraph that originally announced the club&apos;s formation.&quot; CD O&apos;Higgins Born in Chile, Bernardo O&apos;Higgins Riquelme was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O&apos;Higgins \u2013 a future governor of Chile and viceroy of Peru, born to Spanish parents in Sligo in Ireland. He grew up to be a leader of the home side in the Chilean War of Independence and is seen as one of the country&apos;s founding fathers. When two clubs in the city of Rancagua merged in 1955 they kept the prefix of one of the clubs, O&apos;Higgins Braden. Club Presidente Hayes One of the few (only?) clubs named after a US president. Hayes was apparently very merciful towards Paraguay after taking charge of peace talks after the War of the Triple Alliance (which sounds like it should be in Star Wars, but was actually an exceptionally bloody affair in the 1860s involving Paraguay, Argentina, \u00adUruguay and Brazil). Hayes&apos;s role led to a number of institutions being named in his honour, including this football club from Asunci\u00f3n. CD Luis Angel Firpo The oldest club in El Salvador. Originally named Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n but changed to CD Luis Angel Firpo in honour of the Argentinian boxer&apos;s epic bout and narrow defeat to the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1923. Renato Curi Angolana &quot;An amalgamation of two clubs: dell&apos;Angolana and Renato Curi,&quot; writes Fergal Hunter. &quot;The latter was created in honour of Renato Curi who played for Perugia in the 1970s. He was a midfielder who joined them when they were in Serie B, helped get them promoted to Serie A and led them to sixth place. He died in October 1977 of a heart attack on the pitch during a Serie A match with Juventus. He was 24. Perugia&apos;s stadium is also named after him.&quot; Club Atl\u00e9tico Douglas Haig Why would a club from Pergamino, just north of Buenos Aires, name itself after a British first world war Field Marshall? According to the club: &quot;On 18 November 1918 after the resounding victory of the Allied forces, a group of British workers on the Argentinian central railroad decided to start a club to participate in the local soccer championship. This required the consent and support of the chief of the railway, Ronald Leslie, who, as a condition, requested that the club take the name of General Douglas Haig.&quot; CD Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba &quot;Named after not one, but two individuals,&quot; writes Tim Dockery. &quot;They are the result of a 1930 compromise when Sportivo Godoy Cruz (named after a signatory of the Argentinian Declaration of Independence, Tom\u00e1s Godoy Cruz) merged with Deportivo Bodega Antonio Tomba (Tomba&apos;s store was a sponsor of that club).&quot; Colo-Colo The only Chilean side to have won the Copa Libertadores were named after Colocolo, a Mapuche chief of the 16th century. The name translates as &apos;mountain cat&apos;. Deportivo Walter Ferretti Ferreti was a Sandinista comandante known as &quot;Chombo&quot; who was killed in a road accident in 1991. The old ministry of the interior team (where he used to work) is named after him. Joe Public FC The Trinidad and Tobago club, once home to Kenwyne Jones and former Dundee and Gillingham defender Brent Sancho, is named after, well, everybody basically. Plenty more of this next week. WHAT&apos;S IN A NUMBER? &quot;While many clubs maintain the rather lame tradition of reserving their No12 for their fans, I noticed that Oldham choose the No40 instead,&quot; noted Robert Winsome last week. &quot;Do any other clubs reserve different numbers for their faithful?&quot; They do indeed. &quot;At Stockport County a few seasons ago, we had darts maestro and County fan Tony &apos;Silverback&apos; O&apos;Shea listed in the programme each week as No180,&quot; writes Dan Levy. The honour was actually bestowed on the Silverback after the Lancashire thrower reached the BDO World Championshhip final in 2009. &quot;Tony is a big friend of the club,&quot; said Des Hinks, Stockport County&apos;s media manager. &quot;We are all extremely proud of him getting to the darts final, and I know the town of Stockport is as well. Tony is always promoting the club because he wears our colours wherever he is competing. So we thought it would be nice to pay our own tribute to him. His name and number will stay on the back of the programme, next to the names of all the other Stockport players, for the remainder of the season.&quot; Panathinaikos in Athens reserve the No13 for their Ultras, who congregate around Gate 13, while Oldham have handed the much-sought No40 shirt to &apos;The Spirit of Oldham&apos;. &quot;This is in recognition of the wonderful support given by fans over what was a very difficult period for the club during the summer of 2003,&quot; say the Latics. At Bournemouth the fans get No32, while the North Stand has No27 (the only example of an entire stand being given a squad number?) while, as Robbie Costelloe points out, Djurg\u00e5rden rather oddly reserve No1 for their fans. &quot;This as a marker of the club how grateful we are for the fans&apos; tremendous support,&quot; say the club, via an online translator. &quot;This means that the No1 jersey is forever reserved for the fans.&quot; SUPER BOWL v CHAMPIONS LEAGUE &quot;How does the worldwide TV audience for the Super Bowl compare to the Champions League final?&quot; wonders Patrick Conneran It&apos;s pretty close for a while, but last year the proper football showpiece has eclipsed its stateside counterpart for the first time. The 2009 Champions League final last May between Manchester United and Barcelona drew an estimated worldwide audience of 109 million. Last February&apos;s gridiron battle between the Cardinals of Arizona and the Steelers of Pittsburgh (\u00a9Eddie Murphy/Coming to America) grabbed the televisual attention of a mere 106 million. Those two sporting events far outstrip every other. Third on the 2009 list, for example, was the season-ending F1 Abu Dhabi grand prix with 54 million viewers and fourth was the men&apos;s 100m final from the World Athletics Championships with 33 million. Whether the Champions League retains its advantage in 2010 remains to be seen ... KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;At a recent and dull St Mirren match, where proceedings were brightened even by substitutions, I noted the fourth official examining the on-coming substitute&apos;s studs especially fastidiously, so much so that I thought he would not be allowed on,&quot; wrote Alistair Meldrum back in 2008. &quot;Has there ever been an example in top-flight football where the referee has stopped a substitution due to illegal boots, or is this just a ritual to brighten up uneventful matches?&quot; Apparently there has, Alistair. Hans van Schijndel emailed with a story from the oft-overlooked world of 1970s Albanian football. In the opening round of the 1970-71 European Cup, Ajax travelled to Albania for a first-leg clash with Nentori Tirana. As kick-off approached, the odds swung firmly in Ajax&apos;s favour when the Austrian referee, Paul Schiller, noticed that the studs of Tirana&apos;s Josif Kazanxhi had been filed. In the absence of suitable alternative footwear \u2013 Kaxanxhi had not brought a spare pair of boots, and neither were any of his team-mates able to help \u2013 Schiller prevented the influential forward from joining the fray until after the interval. Finally equipped with proper boots, Kazanxhi went on to score in a 2-2 draw. But Tirana were beaten 2-0 in Amsterdam and Ajax went on to win the tournament.

Sarah Calascione, 19, Nicole Turner, 18, and Gabriella Haines, 16, were among 41 students and 23 crew aboard the SV Concordia, a 57-metre long sailing ship which capsized in bad weather off the coast of Rio de Janeiro last Wednesday. They scrambled for lifeboats and spent 40 hours in torrential rain and surging waves before being rescued by the Brazilian navy, which has been criticised over the rescue operation. &quot;I didn&apos;t think we were going to be rescued. It was horrible,&quot; said Calascione, who joined the ship, which set sail from Canada last September, two weeks ago. &quot;The radio equipment was damaged so we only had an EPIRB [distress beacon] which sends out a satellite signal, but that wasn&apos;t picked up straight away. It wasn&apos;t until 30 hours later that a spotter plane saw our life raft.&quot; The ship&apos;s operators, the Nova Scotia-based West Island College International, said they were waiting for details of the rescue response. &quot;We really don&apos;t have the answers as to why different decisions were made with the Brazilian rescue or with the navy at various times,&quot; the college president, Nigel McCarthy, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. SV Concordia capsized during a microburst \u2013 a rare and sudden downdraft of air in a small area \u2013 on Wednesday afternoon, about 300 miles off Brazil. A spokeswoman for the Brazilian navy, Maria Padilha, said that naval responders received a distress signal about 10pm local time on Wednesday and tried to make radio contact with the vessel. They also communicated with nearby ships and aircraft to see if they could spot anything wrong in the area, she said. But it was not until late the next day that a spotter aircraft located the life rafts. The sail ship left Recife in north-east Brazil on 8 February and was sailing to Montevideo, Uruguay&apos;s capital, where it was due to arrive on 25 February, as part of a 10-month voyage. The vessel had already visited Ireland, the Mediterranean and north-west Africa. The Canadian college&apos;s class afloat programme offers school and university credits for students embarking on a long voyage, visiting 30 ports in at least 20 countries. The trip costs \u00a325,000 each. Calascione was used to the sea after sailing with her parents from Malta to Australia as a child. She is due to start a history degree at Exeter University in September. &quot;We were told there had been a distress signal and spotter planes and navy boats had been deployed but there was no sign of the Concordia,&quot; her mother, Caroline Calascione, said. &quot;It was a very harrowing and emotional experience. It wasn&apos;t until we received a phone call from Sarah on Saturday that we knew she was safe. The ship&apos;s captain, William Curry, said the Concordia&apos;s crew had prepared a day beforehand for what they anticipated would be rough but not unusual weather. He was below deck when the ship suddenly keeled \u2013 which was normal. But it was when it keeled a second time that he knew the vessel was in great danger. A Brazilian naval ship took about 10 students back to shore on Saturday with the rest arriving on merchant vessels. &quot;We had been in the life raft for about 30 hours when we saw a search plane for the first time,&quot; said 16-year-old Lauren Unsworth, a Dutch-Canadian passenger who lives in Amsterdam. &quot;That&apos;s when we knew we were not alone and that help was on the way.&quot; She added: &quot;The boat started keeling a lot. It came back up, keeled again, was basically lying on its side and all the windows began to break. That&apos;s when we knew it was time to flee.&quot; Edgardo Ybranez, captain of the Philippine flagged cargo ship that rescued 44 people, said everyone from the Concordia was unhurt except for the doctor, who suffered an injury before the rescue &quot;but he is OK now.&quot; Ybranez gave no more details.", "sentences": ["&quot;We had been in the life raft for about 30 hours when we saw a search plane for the first time,&quot; said 16-year-old Lauren Unsworth, a Dutch-Canadian passenger who lives in Amsterdam."], "title": "Teenagers from capsized Concordia sailing ship adrift in Atlantic for two days", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/22/brazil-canada", "tags": ["Brazil", "Canada", "UK news", "World news", "Americas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-02-24T12:47:42Z", "article": "Foals have released the first details of their new LP, Total Life Forever.

Bryars isn&apos;t the first composer to make such a hybrid \u2013 Beethoven&apos;s \u00adChoral \u00adFantasy is a precedent, along with Busoni&apos;s huge piano \u00adconcerto, which enlists a chorus (also all-male) \u2013 but strangely, he hardly makes a feature of it. For the most part, the choral setting remains in the \u00adbackground while the piano and orchestra churn away over it, and is hard to decipher even when following the text; how the texts themselves relate to Bryars&apos;s music is never revealed either. It was often hard to work out who was accompanying whom, for all three elements are remarkable for their lack of striking musical ideas. Van Raat spent most of his time \u00adrippling away prettily enough over a featureless backdrop \u00adprovided by the orchestra. It could be the soundtrack to a cheesy romantic movie or a TV shampoo ad. What it most notably lacks is any sense of the interaction between soloist, orchestra and the chorus that the word concerto implies.", "sentences": ["Van Raat gave the first \u00adperformances in Utrecht and \u00adAmsterdam with the Netherlands Radio Chamber Philharmonic conducted by Otto Tausk, with very different works by Pascal Dusapin and Cornelis de Bondt.", "The \u00adscoring of the piece includes a male chorus (members of Cappella Amsterdam), and embedded in the half-hour single \u00admovement are \u00adsettings of two sonnets by the Scottish poet Edwin Morgan, the first of which provides the title."], "title": "The Solway Canal | Classical review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/24/the-solway-canal-review", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Gavin Bryars"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-02-25T09:30:00Z", "article": "In a newspaper interview last week, former basketball star John Amaechi suggested gay athletes might be better off if they stayed in the closet. This angered some activists, and the Queerty website accused him of trying to turn back the clock. But Amaechi, who three years ago became the first NBA player to come out as gay, was merely stating the cold, unpalatable truth: inside sport, especially football, the level of homophobia makes it too risky to be out, especially for those embarking on their careers. Having been a sporting pro, and being in contact with at least 10 gay professional footballers \u2013 none of whom would dream of coming out \u2013 John knows what he is talking about. Some activists say gay people in the public eye have a responsibility to be out, as young people need role models. But why should sports personalities be lumbered with such a burden any more than, say, gay electricians or doctors? Such celebrity outings do not magically exorcise prejudices festering in dressing rooms and club boardrooms. The lessons learned in just about every other sector of employment are that change has to be driven from the top. However, suspicions that the Football Association is unwilling to take any such initiatives were confirmed by Sue Law, the FA&apos;s new head of diversity, during a debate with Amaechi on Newsnight:  &quot;The FA does not exist to out players or to support players who come out. Why it does exist is to promote inclusion, to make safe environments and to tackle discrimination through things like the respect programme as and when the issues arise.&quot;  The decoupling of coming out from the anti-homophobia campaign is doomed to fail. Fifty years of fighting for gay equality teaches us that being seen and recognised is the first step in achieving acceptance. How can one otherwise know who to &quot;include&quot; and &quot;respect&quot;? This flawed approach by the FA helps to explain why the much-awaited anti-homophobia video was so disappointing. Ogilvy, the PR agency involved, was specifically briefed not to tackle the issue of coming out or prejudice in the community. The result, a 60-second video telling people not to say nasty things at football matches, seemed like a damage limitation exercise to show that most fans aren&apos;t completely like the Taliban. Endorsed by no one, and without a confident, out, gay person in sight, the video challenges no perceptions and presents no vision of how the game should be. Confronting a small but vocal minority of homophobic fans is only part of the problem. Stonewall&apos;s 2009 Leagues Behind report provided strong evidence that the homophobic prejudice which Ogilvy was told not to address is alive and kicking, from the grassroots to the very top. It is destroying the hopes and dreams of gay players who suffer abuse or are even forced out of the game. Consider what it&apos;s like for a budding teenager, trying to impress and bond socially with the trainers, managers and team mates at the local academy or the pub team. The competition is tough enough to get to the top as it is. Prejudice from anyone in that network could snuff out a career in an instant. It&apos;s better to stay in the closet than jeopardise the game you love. But imagine having to come up with an alibi every weekend, never being able to invite your team mates to your home, or being consumed with fear about being exposed by the media or fans at any given moment. Being gay in sport, closeted or not, puts you at a disadvantage. Nobody expects footballers to become human rights activists. But it&apos;s a pity no high-profile player could show some solidarity by endorsing the anti-homophobia message, in the name of sportsmanship if nothing else. Compare that cowardice with the eagerness of internationals such as Pierre van Hooijdonk, Regi Blinker and more than 30 Dutch sporting champions to take part in Amsterdam&apos;s gay pride last August, to promote greater tolerance in sport. At the same time, it is unreasonable of Amaechi to hold the suicide of Justin Fashanu as a valid reference point for the next out gay player. Society has become more open-minded since then. A gay player at the very top of the game today may get a rough ride, but is unlikely to be hounded out. Even so, if the FA is sincere about eradicating homophobia, it must enforce cultural change so it is an equitable place for all people, perhaps using as a good model for success the diversity schemes in the armed forces. First let&apos;s have a clear commitment to help LGBT people thrive and be accepted as they are. The FA must promise gay players there is no need to hide and, moreover, that they will be supported, encouraged and protected, every step of the way. Anything less smacks of deception and perpetuates the isolation felt by gay players. PS: we only get to hear about, or on behalf of, gay people in the game. No communication seems to go to or come from the minority group in question. An anonymous testimony from a gay player about life in football might help us all understand the issue better and help tackle homophobia effectively.", "sentences": ["Compare that cowardice with the eagerness of internationals such as Pierre van Hooijdonk, Regi Blinker and more than 30 Dutch sporting champions to take part in Amsterdam&apos;s gay pride last August, to promote greater tolerance in sport."], "title": "On the pitch and in the closet | Adrian Tippetts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/25/football-fa-homophobia", "tags": ["Equality", "Society", "Football", "The FA", "Sport", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Gender", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-02-25T22:00:01Z", "article": "Ihave been a film and television composer for many years, but have only scored one silent movie: German director Franz Osten&apos;s 1929 epic Prapancha Pash (A Throw of Dice), which was a great experience. So I was delighted when the British Film Institute asked me to work again with the London Symphony Orchestra on a new silent film project. The film in question is a Japanese one. Yogoto No Yume (Every Night Dreams) is a 1933 silent movie directed by Mikio Naruse, a prolific but unappreciated director. The story focuses on the life and struggle of Japanese barmaid, Omitsu. Set against a backdrop of the Great Depression (which also affected Japan, though to a far lesser extent than America and Europe), the plot unravels the trajectory of Omitsu&apos;s struggle to maintain her integrity while fighting to survive in a corrupt, depraved and judgmental world. I like the film because of its social realism and cinematic innovation. It reminds me more of Hitchcock&apos;s noir stylisation than the golden age silent films of Hollywood of the time. With its sense of melodrama and constant motion, Prapancha Pash was a gift to score and orchestrate. Although I attempted to give it its own language and resonance, I found myself employing many references to Bollywood and Indian classical music in the Hindustani tradition. The dark and far more psychologically-based mood of Yogoto No Yume lends itself, in contrast, to a score far more rooted in the traditions of American film noir than Japanese traditional music. While I know and admire much Japanese music, I decided that my allusions to Japanese tradition in this score should be far more indirect than the cultural references of Prapancha Pash. The latter pays homage to the mythological stories of the Mahabharata and its story is firmly embedded in the ancient mores of India. Yogoto No Yume is located in Japan, but it seemed to me that the story, characterisation, psychology and social commentary of the narrative are far more contemporary and universal than culturally specific. I was determined that my score would reflect this. I approached the film much as I approach most film music \u2013 by identifying the independent strands of narrative that take us through the various scenes and give the film its unique appeal. I was particularly interested in developing a leitmotif for the protagonist, Omitsu, the focal point of the film&apos;s drama. It was important to find the rhythm of her walk, her nuances and idiosyncrasies, as well as her anxieties, hopes and sense of isolation through a single melody. Inspirational film composers such as Ennio Morricone and Bernard Herrmann have always been a great influence in their ability to capture the psychological individuality and profile of their central characters through simple themes. Like Morricone, I believe it is very important to orchestrate my own work in order to ensure that the music reflects a film&apos;s evolving mood. Scoring for silent film is a very different experience from conventional film scoring. Then, you need to serve the wishes of the film director and suspend your own ego, to a point. It is the director&apos;s creative vision that the film composer has to fulfil, not his or her own artistic impulses. This can sometimes be hard if the director is too rigid or dogmatic in their pursuit of an idea, which is where the composer has to possess diplomatic and psychological skills without being confrontational. I have scored more than 40 films, from high drama to political documentary, and it&apos;s a real liberation to work with silent film! The responsibility to discover subtext and psychological narrative is a welcome one that allows me to create a world unique to the feeling and empathy that comes from the film itself rather than a director&apos;s second-hand interpretation. But, of course, I also need to enhance the visual grace and lyricism of the film. Such accountability can be quite daunting when you are used to wary-eyed directors looking over your shoulder. I&apos;m lucky enough to have released eight of my own studio albums and toured extensively with my own band \u2013 experiences that have definitely left me more relaxed in the driving seat of any artistic endeavour. Creating a unique musical language aside, the main challenges scoring Yogoto No Yume were to engage and excite the orchestra who&apos;ll be playing my music live on Monday. I had to find the connecting motifs that lend cohesion to the various scenes and strands of development throughout the film and, most of all, to bridge the gap between the audience and a world set in a distant place and time, through the power of sensitive orchestration. Different orchestras have different specialities. Recently I returned from a visit to Prague where The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra superbly demonstrated how years of recording music for film and videogame composers has given them an ability to sight-read, to interpret dynamics and fly through the most demanding of musical phrases at a breathtaking rate. With some orchestras it is wiser to leave passages free for extemporisation. The Dutch &quot;Metropole Orchestra&quot;, for instance, boasts a strong contingent of seasoned jazz musicians who are always keen to flex their improvisatory skills. (Which was a joy to discover when we played through the end credits of Prapancha Pash in Amsterdam.) The main attraction of working with the London Symphony Orchestra is their ability to interpret music with stunning tone reproduction and sonic elegance. For Yogoto No Yume&apos;s score, I have incorporated passages for soloists with whom I have worked previously in order to add an element of spontaneity to the evening. Each soloist has a great ability to not only understand and read proficiently through a score, but also to improvise and play with thematic ideas. Cellist Ian Burdge, Martyn Kane \u2013 on drums and percussion \u2013 and vocalist and melodica player Meiko Shimizu are all seasoned musicians who will add an impulsive drive to the limitations of adhering to notated score. As I write, we&apos;re in the middle of rehearsing with the soloists at my south London studio. Tomorrow we&apos;re going to work with the LSO for the first time, and a revised and restored telecine print of the film. I feel privileged to have my score and hard work interpreted by such great musicians; these next few days will be telling in hearing how the score to this dark drama translates from my head and the written page, and to the Barbican audience. Yogoto No Yume is a film that still has a brave contemporary significance that I believe make it accessible and relevant to today&apos;s audience. As for me, I&apos;ll be playing the piano and celeste. I always prefer playing rather than conducting \u2013 it means I can listen to and enjoy the orchestra without the responsibility and pressure of leading them. The affable and gifted Kristjan Jarvi will be conducting the orchestra and taking us all through 64 uneasy minutes of Omitsu&apos;s woeful life. Nitin Sawhney&apos;s score for Yogoto No Yume, played live by the LSO, is at the Barbican, London EC2, on 1 March.

Yesterday, I checked British Airways for a flight from London to Cape Town on 15 June, and back on 20 June (in time for England v Algeria on Friday 18th) \u2013 and found the cheapest available seat was \u00a35,849.  But there are better options. Throughout the tournament, the cheaper tickets are to Johannesburg, which has far more international flights than Cape Town. On those same dates, British Airways has a return to Johannesburg for \u00a3761, and booking via an online agent, you can get the onward connections to Cape Town on South African Airlines for very little \u2013 the total for the journey is \u00a3832 on expedia.co.uk, \u00a3842 on opodo.co.uk.  On other dates, it&apos;s worth checking out KLM, which has some of the best availability to Johannesburg, and regional connections from British airports to its hub in Amsterdam. Fares typically hover around \u00a3900, but going out on 22 June, back on 3 July (so catching the last 16 matches and the first quarter finals) gives you access to tickets for \u00a3772.  The old trick of flying to a neighbouring country doesn&apos;t help much for this World Cup \u2013 Windhoek in Namibia, Gaborone in Botswana, and Maputo in Mozambique work out just as expensive as flying to Johannesburg, if not more so. But Trailfinders (0845 050 5892, trailfinders.com) has come up with one clever trick. It suggests flying to Mauritius on Air Mauritius, then on to Johannesburg on South African. Availability remains good, the fare is \u00a3819 for departures up until 29 June, and best of all, you can stop in Mauritius for a beach break on the way home.  Hotels Finding beds in the host cities is problematic \u2013 Laterooms.com, for example, says all 28 hotels they offer in the country are now sold out for the duration of the event, while the South African tourist authorities last week announced they are to conduct an immediate investigation into profiteering by hoteliers (though it remains unclear what action they will be able to take).  However it is worth trying STA (0871 230 0040, statravel.co.uk), which has some great packages of flights and accommodation. There are 13 seats left for a package departing 10 June, returning 24 June (so covering England&apos;s first two games), flying direct from Heathrow to Johannesburg, with 12 nights&apos; accommodation in Johannesburg included, and insurance, for \u00a31,372. Another package deal runs from 30 June to 10 July, thus covering the quarters and semi finals, including flights, insurance and accommodation for \u00a31,629. Or how about hiring a campervan? Wicked Campers (wickedafrica.com) is a company that started in Australia but has spread around the world. It takes MPVs and vans, adds beds, mattresses and so on, covers them in graffiti, then rents them out. It still has some availability, from around \u00a370 per day for a camper that sleeps two.  Heading under canvas is another option, but remember it will be winter in South Africa, and in the south of the country, temperatures could drop below freezing at night. Existing campsites are booking up, but new ones are springing up for the tournament. In Johannesburg, a campsite called Tent City will be set up in the Waverley Park neighbourhood, with space for 1,500 people. Have a look at the forums at worldcupfancamp.com for news of more temporary sites.  For more general information on hotels, see southafrica.net/2010 and the Football Suppporters Federation site, worldcup.fsf.org.uk/directory.  Match tickets Tickets for all of England&apos;s group stage matches are now sold out \u2013 unless you buy them as part of an accommodation and flight package \u2013 but you can get tickets for other games. In all there around 700,000 match tickets still unsold globally, and these are only available through Fifa, via its website  fifa.com (there&apos;s also a helpline number: 00 41 445832010).  We are currently in the fourth of five ticketing &quot;phases&quot; during which tranches of tickets are released. This runs until 7 April, followed by the fifth phase, from 15 April to the end of the tournament, when tickets will be available at booths in the host cities. It&apos;s possible that at the start of this fifth stage, tickets to England games may become available again, if they have been returned (for example if the travel partners fail to sell their allocations). Official packages The closer we get to the tournament, and the scarcer accommodation, flights and match tickets, the more sense it makes to use the official Fifa travel partners, of which there are four in Britain: Thomson Sport (thomsonsport.com/Football), Thomas Cook (thomascooksport.com), BAC Sports Limited (bacsport.co.uk) and Keith Prowse (keithprowse.co.uk). Each took allocations of tickets, hotel beds and flights in advance - meaning they can guarantee availability, and if they don&apos;t sell out during the coming months, they may even be forced to offer some last-minute reductions. The relatively favourable draw means that demand from England fans has been spread beyond the group stages to the final 16 and quarter finals, which has helped availability.  \u2022 Thomas Cook has four-night packages for England&apos;s match against the US at Rustenburg from \u00a32,699, including ticket, flights on Virgin and transfers; five-night packages to the Algeria game cost from \u00a32,600; and four-night packages to what they are calling &quot;England&apos;s Quarter Final&quot; cost from \u00a33,550, again including tickets, flights and accommodation.  \u2022 Thomson has a 16-night package at the Camps Bay Resort in Cape Town, including flights, transfers and tickets to all three England group games from \u00a34,188. \u2022 And last week Thomas Cook added a new package for the ultimate fan. The 33-night trip includes accommodation, domestic flights, transfers and tickets to all England&apos;s matches \u2013 right the way to the final. If England get knocked out, you get tickets to the group winner and follow them, or the winner of each match, to the final.

But with hindsight, the real winner to emerge from the process was not an ensemble, but an individual. The Latvian Mariss \u00adJansons found himself in the remarkable position of being the only conductor in charge of two of Gramophone&apos;s top-10 orchestras: Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw orchestra \u2013 which came out on top, narrowly beating the\u00a0Berlin Philharmonic \u2013 and the sixth-ranked Bavarian \u00adRadio Symphony \u00adorchestra. Unsurprisingly, Jansons is reluctant to make distinctions between excellence at this level. &quot;Of course they are both very, very good,&quot; he says, &quot;and in my position, I treat them equally. A \u00adlittle as if they were two sons.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t mean he objects to differentiating between excellence and mediocrity. &quot;Brought up&quot; in the Riga opera house by his singer mother and conductor \u00adfather, he learned his craft as a conductor in Leningrad in the fiercely competitive Soviet music system. He earned a reputation as an orchestra builder in Oslo in the 1980s, when he steered the Oslo Philharmonic from obscurity to international stardom. He then moved to Pittsburgh, where he became a leading figure on the world stage, before his triumphant return to European music-making in Amsterdam and Munich. &quot;You always have to fight for the best,&quot; he says. &quot;That took different forms. In the Soviet Union music was respected, but there were many other problems. In Oslo you had to battle for the art itself.&quot; He spent 23 years in Norway, &quot;fighting first for better players and better salaries. And then for a new concert hall for us to play in.&quot; Jansons revolutionised the orchestra&apos;s sound, but didn&apos;t get his new hall, and when he left there were bad feelings on both sides. &quot;It was a strange thing,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Norway is a very democratic place where everyone must be equal. That is obviously good. But when it means that it is politically impossible to say that one orchestra is better than another, even though it is obvious, that makes things very difficult for art.&quot; Next week he is in London with the Bavarians, who are following Barenboim and his Beethoven concertos in the Southbank Centre&apos;s Shell Classic International series of concerts. In their only UK concert this year they will perform Shostakovich&apos;s 10th symphony, which marks a return to Jansons&apos;s roots. As a child he moved to Leningrad when his father, Arvid, became assistant to the legendary conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky, who had premiered many of Shostakovich&apos;s symphonies, including the 10th immediately after Stalin&apos;s death in 1953. Jansons was not only privy to his father&apos;s discussions with Mravinsky about the music, he later took over his father&apos;s job at the orchestra and met Shostakovich &quot;many times, but only really as an observer. He was a very nice man but also very nervous, and I remember him mostly for being quiet and polite.&quot; In mid-career Jansons consciously began to conduct less Russian work, partly because he was wary of being typecast and also because he wanted to explore new musical worlds. But he always kept conducting Shostakovich. &quot;I first became involved with his music when, even in the Soviet Union, his work was not as admired as it is today. Russian people were the first to understand it and love it because everything about it is so much about Russia. It has been wonderful to see his music embraced all over the world in the years since as it speaks to me in a very particular and important way.&quot; Shostakovich may be a special case, but Jansons&apos;s approach to music generally is as much spiritual as it is professional. &quot;For me the two most important things in this world are art and religion. We must take care in \u00adassessing the value of our life to support these two things. Everyone knows that if you go to the theatre or a concert, or read a great novel or go to a wonderful exhibition, then when you come away, so long as it is good, you are inspired. Great music, and all great art, is food for your soul and your heart. Without it we might as well not exist.&quot; Even watching him rehearse, there appears an almost physical sense of him reaching into himself to tease out slow passages, and in the livelier sections his animated promptings see him leaving the podium to become airborne. In Munich last month, on his 67th birthday, he rehearsed for three hours in the morning, listened to a proposed CD recording in the afternoon, performed a concert in the evening and then attended a dinner in his honour given by Munich&apos;s political and business elite. The next day he took another three-hour rehearsal, gave a two-hour interview over lunch and performed again in the evening. While iron dedication and constitution-\u00adsapping schedules are par for the course for leading conductors, there is a sense that in Jansons&apos;s case, especially in the light of his medical history, the sheer intensity of his drive is elemental. In 1985 his father died of a heart attack in Manchester while working with the Hall\u00e9 orchestra. By coincidence, Jansons was conducting in the UK at the same time, but the show went on. In 1997 Jansons too suffered a heart attack, while conducting the closing scene of La Boh\u00e8me in Oslo. A second followed a few weeks later and he was fitted with a defibrillator. In Oslo, remarkably, even as he fell to the floor his right hand still attempted to keep time. &quot;Or at least that&apos;s what the orchestra said afterwards. I was unconscious so I don&apos;t know. But it didn&apos;t surprise me that much. Music has \u00adalways been so much more than simply what I do.&quot; Jansons was born in 1943 in Nazi-\u00adoccupied Riga, where his Jewish mother had to give birth in hiding. With the war over and the country under Soviet control, his parents returned to the \u00adopera house and Jansons went too. &quot;We didn&apos;t have a babysitter, so I went with them every day and it became part of me.&quot; At home he remembers playing &quot;Opera House&quot;, a game in which he would first pretend to be the conductor taking a rehearsal, &quot;and then I would change into my imaginary tails and I would conduct the performance. I would also sing and dance ballet and would take two pieces of wood and pretend to play the violin. Music absolutely filled my mind.&quot; He began to play the piano and violin seriously at the age of six and at 10 experienced his one and only glimpse of a possible life not utterly devoted to music. One of his neighbours in early-1950s Riga was a leading football coach who had watched him kick a ball about. The coach approached Jansons&apos;s parents to ask whether they might consider sending their son to a specialist sports school. &quot;They didn&apos;t hesitate even for a second,&quot; Jansons laughs. &quot;&apos;Absolutely not,&apos; they said. &apos;He will be a musician.&apos;&quot; And just as he followed his parents, so the Jansons dynastic tradition is continuing down the generations. His daughter from his first marriage is an accompanist at the Maryinsky theatre in St Petersburg \u2013 &quot;she, like me, didn&apos;t have a choice about music because we gave her music lessons when she was young&quot; \u2013 and his &quot;opera-obsessed&quot; granddaughter has just been offered a stage-manager job at the opera house. He now says that if the family had stayed in Riga he might have &quot;pressured my parents into doing something else. But instead we moved to Leningrad and everything changed.&quot; His father took up his conducting post in the city, and Jansons had to learn a new language, join a music school of extremely talented pupils and carry on his ordinary studies. &quot;I learnt how to work very hard. My mentality completely changed and I developed this great sense of responsibility and seriousness about my music. I became a different person.&quot; As his career progressed, he says, he had to overcome accusations of nepotism. &quot;In Russia at that time, if you were the child of a working man and you followed in your father&apos;s footsteps you gained respect,&quot; he explains. &quot;But that was not true if you came from the intelligentsia. There was suspicion.&quot; He began to step out of his father&apos;s shadow in 1968 when he was picked out by Herbert von Karajan from a masterclass of young conductors. Permission to work further with Karajan was refused by the Soviet authorities, but he was soon accepted on an exchange programme that allowed him to shadow the Austrian conductor at three Salzburg festivals. &quot;I was with him from nine in the morning until 11 at night every day. He was a great man with great ideas and because he was Karajan he could fulfil these ideas. He was like a bird flying in the air while the rest of us were on the ground. He seemed to be above it all and he could see everything.&quot; When Jansons won the Karajan \u00adconducting prize in 1970 he was offered a job by Mravinsky, and when his father died Jansons took his place as number two conductor at the Leningrad Philharmonic orchestra. Jansons has maintained his links with the orchestra and the city \u2013 from 1971 to 2000 he served as a part-time professor of conducting at the St Petersburg Conservatory and still maintains a home there, though he rarely has time to stay in it \u2013 and says that, despite the restrictions placed on him, when he looks back at the Soviet system he still sees good as well as bad. &quot;Of course there were injustices which everyone is glad have gone. But among the good things lost was a very high level of music education. I know it was partly political and about showing that the system, just as with sport, was better than the west. But it was nevertheless exemplary. And also, because we had few material goods, there was the compensation of a much higher spiritual value to life. Art was important and valued. Likewise friendship was very important because there were things that united us. Now money dominates everything and is the only measure. I would much prefer to see more of a balance between the material and the spiritual.&quot; When he was approached to take over the Oslo Philharmonic in the late 70s, the Soviet authorities again refused permission. But in one of the accommodations by which the system functioned, he was allowed to take on the responsibilities of the job without actually signing a contract. &quot;It is difficult to explain how it worked,&quot; he says. &quot;It was not the law of the country that you couldn&apos;t travel, it was a party rule. But they wanted foreign income. So while I was in Oslo I gave 90% of my \u00adearnings to the Soviet state. You could say I had received a wonderful education from them for free. But 90% was still a lot.&quot; It wasn&apos;t until Gorbachev and perestroika in the mid-1980s that Jansons&apos;s position was formalised in Oslo, but despite the uncertainty, and the disputes about a new concert hall, he elevated the orchestra to a new level of recognition. The rancour attached to his departure has recently been rekindled by the orchestra releasing a recording of him conducting Mahler&apos;s seventh symphony within months of the Bavarian Radio orchestra&apos;s recording of the same symphony \u2013 &quot;that was very stupid&quot; \u2013 but when he &quot;analyses the years we had together, I had a fantastic time. I was young and the \u00adorchestra was young, and we had a wonderful spirit. It is like first love. Even though it might end badly and you go on to other things, you don&apos;t forget it, and that whole process was something that probably happens only once in a lifetime between an orchestra and a conductor.&quot; In Munich he is again engaged in a campaign for a new concert hall to replace the poor acoustics and municipal drabness of the two halls the Bavarian Radio orchestra currently call home. He rates his chances of success as 50:50, &quot;which is not that good, but I am an optimist by nature. Munich is a rich city with a strong appreciation of music, so I think in this case it is more a matter of getting people to agree how to do it.&quot; If future programme planning is any guide, then the dispute will not result in him leaving Munich as he did Oslo, and it seems likely he will renew his contract when it expires in 2012, so allowing him to continue on the same musical and, by extension, spiritual path. His Lutheran faith has been a natural part of his life since childhood, and he is dismayed at what he sees as the moral decline of the modern world. &quot;I&apos;m not saying you can get rid of drugs or killing or corruption in an instant, but in the 21st century our spiritual life should be on a higher level than it is. I think children in the west should be in serious contact with both religion and the arts as a fundamental part of their education. They both make you think about important questions about the world: why we are here and how we should live.&quot; He says his health is good and his schedule is realistic, although he does complain that he finds it impossible not to keep working, even when supposedly on holiday. &quot;I do have a three-week vacation every year and in the first week I do no work at all but by the second I am studying scores. I know it would be better to have three weeks of no work at all, but it is very difficult for me after all my training. Since I was a child in the Riga opera house I have filled my life with thinking about music.&quot; It was when in a Swiss clinic, after the second heart attack, that despite never having smoked or drunk, he learned that he was a prime candidate for heart disease by dint of his genetic inheritance, diet, age and stress levels. Ostentatiously removing a large dollop of cream from his soup, he explains that his diet is now under control. &quot;But I am stuck with my genes and my age, and as for the stress . . . &quot; Although he has tried to take on less guest conducting, &quot;I know I haven&apos;t really slowed down enough. But I have two wonderful orchestras. I can come to great musical cities such as London and play the music of Shostakovich. If you&apos;re invited to conduct the Berlin or the Vienna Philharmonic, it is difficult to say no. I have long and friendly relationships with London orchestras and I want to play in New York and Vienna and Tokyo. What can you do? In the end, that&apos;s the thing about conductors. They don&apos;t retire.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Latvian Mariss \u00adJansons found himself in the remarkable position of being the only conductor in charge of two of Gramophone&apos;s top-10 orchestras: Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw orchestra \u2013 which came out on top, narrowly beating the\u00a0Berlin Philharmonic \u2013 and the sixth-ranked Bavarian \u00adRadio Symphony \u00adorchestra.", "He then moved to Pittsburgh, where he became a leading figure on the world stage, before his triumphant return to European music-making in Amsterdam and Munich."], "title": "A life in music: Mariss Jansons", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/feb/27/mariss-jansons-interview", "tags": ["Classical music", "Culture", "Mariss Jansons"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-02T19:11:20Z", "article": " Hello and welcome to what is being billed as a Glamour Friendly.  This is perhaps the first recorded use of the word &quot;glamour&quot; to describe an event involving Paul McShane, men in green jester&apos;s hats doing bad dancing and lots of people trudging on and off a football pitch clapping the crowd and putting on tracksuit tops.  As expected, Dunga has promised make &quot;a host of changes&quot; tonight. Let&apos;s hope he doesn&apos;t start too early.  Still, it&apos;s a chance to see the ever-magnificent Brazil, who looked short on fantasy but physically indomitable when they beat England in Dubai. This is a aprt of their World Cup build-up. They have to take it a bit seriously.  And it&apos;s a chance to see some of Ireland&apos;s freshest talent. James McCarthy looks to have recovered from Liam Ridgewell trying to maim him on Saturday (and taking down the linesman instead). He&apos;s a good young player. He has a nice way about him, some inventive subtle touches.  (not Liam Ridgewell. He looks a bit like Mickey Pearce from Only Fools and Horses) Plus it&apos;s an opportunity to enjoy aged hobbling somersault-homunculus Robbie Keane, who hurt his knee in the Old Firm derby but is now unexpectedly available. And maybe also - who knows? - keen to look good on the same field as Brazil/remind everyone outside Scotland he&apos;s still alive and capable of scurrying about shaking his fist at people.  Hugh Collins writes: &quot;Trapp needs these friendlies. He needs new players - the team has depended on Keane, Duff, Dunne, Given for a decade. Good players all, but the team is crying out for new blood. Bloooood!&quot; Steady.  And here are our teams tonight: Rep of Ireland Given, Kelly, St. Ledger, McShane, Kilbane, Lawrence, Whelan, Andrews, Duff, Doyle, Keane. Brazil Julio Cesar, Maicon, Lucio, Juan, Michel Bastos, Ramires, Silva, Felipe Melo, Kaka, Adriano, Robinho. Referee: Mike Dean Keane starts then. So do Kaka and - blimey - Robinho. Bet he&apos;d like to stick one past Shay Given. Brazil also have Dani Alves, Nilmar and Grafite on the bench, plus the perennially weedy Julio &quot;The Alleged Best&quot; Baptista.  Robinho and Adriano are up front for Brazil. It&apos;s like Laurel and Hardy. Or French and Saunders. Or [insert other fat one-thin-one partnership here]. And Kevin Kilbane is winning his record-equalling 103rd cap.  Peter Corway is feeling patriotic: &quot;If I don&apos;t get my visa sorted soon, I will have to return to Ireland having spent the past year in Canada. I got to experience an emphatic winning feeling for the first time in a year (since the 2009 6 Nations) when Canada beat the Yanks to take Ice Hockey Gold. Not even a &quot;glamour&quot; tie against Brazil is enough to make me want to return to Ireland.&quot; Eh? What&apos;s wrong with Ireland?  Anto in Amsterdam growls: &quot;Im sitting in my hotel room here in Amsterdam and the red light district is about 400 yards from the hotel door... As i was on the beer last night i have decided to give it a miss tonight, so here are my options. 1. Walk to the red light and have another look around2. Follow the MBM with you3. Go to the pub and have another hangover tomorrow, which is not so good for work.Help me with this difficult decision&quot;.Er. Pass. Know what I&apos;d be doing.  Ireland have got quite nice old school green tracksuit tops on. The stadium is only half full and there are lots of high pitched school kid cheers about.  Phil Sawyer is really pleased to find Andy Townsend on his telly: &quot;It&apos;s good to see the Republic&apos;s best man on top form, One touch cliches, slick generalisations, quickfire shallow analysis triangles: waxing lyrical about Brazil and THAT handball, Andy Townsend is an example to football punditry everywhere.&quot;  1 min Brazil kick off and Given gets a couple of early touches, hoofing it away once, and then toying with Adriano a bit before hoofing it away again. It&apos;s a bit quiet.  3 mins Brazil look great on the ball in every position. I think we&apos;re going to get lots of them noodling it about tonight. It would be good to get an early goal - ideally an Irish one.  5 mins And there&apos;s a chance for Keane. Doyle nods it down and Keane cuts inside Melo and has a shot from the right that Cesar holds. That was lively. And here&apos;s some more - Doyle beats Juan in the air and almost cuts in on goal but Melo crowds him out. Spiky start from Ireland.  6 mins Odd, apparently Brazil&apos;s left-back Bastos is actually playing as an attacking midfielder for his club. Shades of Leonardo who went from Yank-elbowing wing-back to silky Milanese fantasista. Brazil have just been passing the ball about for ages. It looks very easy.  9 mins Loose ball from Robinho almost lets in Duff but the awesome Lucio tackles him. And moments klater Keane gets in behind Bastos and he&apos;s got the ball by the byeline near the goal, but he&apos;s crowded out for a corner. It bounces behind off the huge, frightening head of McShane. And Hugh Collins notes: &quot;A bold, inventive line-up from Il Trapp, gambling on rising stars like Kevin Kilbane and Glenn Whelan.&quot; But maybe better than having a bunch of 19-year-olds lose 5-0 to Brazil?  11 mins Maicon crosses from near the corner flag but Adriano can&apos;t get near it, depsit being vast. Moments later Kaka shoots from 30 yards but it&apos;s a yard over. Whelan didn&apos;t really close him down there. Phil Sawyer points out: &quot;All Anto in Amsterdam needs to do is insert the word &apos;then&apos; in between each option and he&apos;ll have his itinerary for the night sorted nicely.&quot; You dog.  14 mins This game is quite breezy and lively. Lawrence is violently upended by Juan and Ireland have a useful free kick on the left flank. And Tom Bason is raving about the talent on view here. But not that talent: &quot;just a note on Kevin Doyle tonight- the lad is absolutely quality. As a Wolves fan, I never thought I&apos;d appreciate an Irish striker more than Robbie Keane, but Doyle has been awesome this season. He absolutely terrorised Liverpool&apos;s defence all on his own a few weeks back.&quot;  16 mins Great save by Cesar! Doyle has been listening to Tom Bason and he gets his head to Damien Duff&apos;s cross about six yards out, heads goalwards and the leaping Cesar palms away. Doyle found some space there and maybe should have scored, but it was a top save.  18 mins Why do Brazillian people always looks so cheerful? But still somehow a bit old-fashioned? And also child-like and weirdly clear-skinned? there are loads of them in the ground grinning and looking fresh-faced.  20 mins Great defensive blocking from Kelly and McShane as Brazil bomb forward and Adriano and Robinho both have shots on goal. Brazil broke all the way down the field from an Irish free-kick there. That was slinky.  21 mins and this just in: And this just in: &quot;Two things I feel I should tell you, Barney,&quot; hollers Paul Doyle from the Emirates. &quot;Firstly, there is a simmering subplot to this match - the ball being used has been espeially conceived for the occasion by Nike, and as such stands a rival to the all-new adidas ones that will be deployed at the World Cup. Just as Ireland want to show that they deserve to be at the summer&apos;s showpiece, Nike apparently want to make a similar point about the ball. Secondly, and far more intriguing in my book, a well-known journalist whom I will not name is sufficiently close to me in the press box for me to be able to see that while occassionally looking at this game he is also ... playing Football Manager on his computer.&quot;  22 mins Is it Brian Glanville?  23 mins Brazil are having most of the ball now. They are kind of nice to watch. Maicon is rampaging about pushing Duff backwards down his flank (not literally). And Ethan Dean-Richards, who used to play for Spurs, writes: &quot;Come Hugh, Trap hasn&apos;t played it all safe, he has started Robbie &apos;it&apos;s getting embarrassing now&apos; Keane. On another note, I hope you publish this email because I&apos;m 0 for 7 on recent emails Guardian Towers - is it paranoid to imagine that I&apos;m becoming a laughing stock?&quot; No. Snuffle.  26 mins Some desperate defending by Ireland as Whelan gives the ball away and Brazil break. McShane clogs Kaka. Free kick not too far from goal. Niall Mullen agrees about Kevin doyle: &quot;I agree about Kevin Doyle. He gives a physical presence, holds the ball up and gets more goals than, say, Emile Heskey. Villa should try to do a swap when Wolves go down.&quot;  27 mins Adriano taknes the free-kick, curling it in left-footed and Given palms it over. Phil Sawyer wats clarification: &quot;Is that &quot;you dog&quot; said in the down with the kids bad ass &quot;you the dogg&quot; sense or in the James Cameron p*ssing all over the memory of a brave crew member on the Titanic &quot;I&apos;ll shoot you all like the dogs you are&quot; sense? I ask merely for clarification of my social standing in the morning.&quot; More Terry-Thomas. Corner to Brazil.  29 mins Ireland are being pushed back here by an up-for-it Brazil. Adriano sets up Maicon for a shot but he amusingly punts it miles wide and into the crowd. On the gifted James McCarthy Derek Alexander notes: &quot;One of Scotland freshests young talents, stolen by the FAI whispering sectarian sweet nothings in his ear when he was a young boy.&quot; Surely not.  31 mins Heavy tackle by Duff on Maicon. Brazil are a bit cross. On the video game playing hack, Russell Fraser ponders: &quot;Amusing though that thought is, Brian Glanville has the air of a man who might violently disdain players of video games, while at the same time requiring the help of his grandchildren to use the DVD; the two things perhaps not being unrelated. Surely it&apos;s Johnathan Pearce?&quot;  33 mins Ireland have a spell of possession and they seem a bit happier about that. A long pass from midfield almost finds the scampering Keane trying to run away from Lucio but the ball hits him on the heel and goes off the other way. Keane always look to be trying so hard, but running so slow. No one has ever put so much effort into such a lack of speed. Rick Buur, who sounds cold, says: &quot;A tip for Anto in Amsterdam: Irish Pub Molly Malone (near the Red Light District) has its weekly expat night on the tuesday. It&apos;s not just drinking but you can play Wii as well. Also it&apos;s really networking isn&apos;t it?&quot;  36 mins Free kick as Kaka is fouled. Robinho takes it, but wafts the ball horribly over the bar. So much for the new Nike Super Kick Phenomono Globe or whatever it&apos;s called. And Donal Mullally wonders:&quot;Is that Jasper Carrot refereeing?&quot;  39 mins Ireland have a free-kick of their own, which Duff lifts in towards Kilbane. It&apos;s headed out by Lucio and St Ledger attempts a spectacular gymnastic once-in-a-lifetime overhead kick volley from a Van Basten angle. Not a bad effort. Bounces wide.  41 mins Nice stuff from Kaka, Robinho and Melo puts Maicon in for a cross, a nice one that St Ledger defends well with his head. Phil Sawyer argues: &quot;&quot;No one has ever put so much effort into such a lack of speed.&quot; I realise this is a football MBM, but have you never seen Monty Panesar running after a ball in the field?&quot; Yes. But Keane looks like he really believes he actually is really fast. Monty knows at all times he&apos;s a camel.  43 mins Doyle sprtins on to a long pass close to the edge of the penalty area, nice pass by whelan, but Bastos outpaces him and nudges it away. Moments later another fine pass from Whelan finds Duff who twists and turns and gets a low cross in that&apos;s cleared. Good stuff.  44 mins GOAL FOR BRAZIL!!! Really quick break by Brazil, Maicon sprints into the space where Duff might have been, feeds it to Robinho on the left wing (he might have been just about offside) and his cross into the box is turned into his own goal by Andrews.  45 mins That was a little bit unlucky. Lovely ball in from Robinho and Andrews just couldn&apos;t do anything else with it.  45+1 mins HALF TIME 1-0 to Brazil, who just about deserve it. Let&apos;s hope they don&apos;t just take loads of players off now, although I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing some of the subs too. I&apos;m off for a cup of &quot;tea&quot; from the machine and a Toffee Crisp. Back in five.  On lack of speed/effort Andrew Workman writes: &quot;Dirk Kuyt&quot;  &quot;At least we can say that the first goal of the game was scored by an Irish man,&quot; notes Brian \u00d3 Donnchadha.  Christopher Bannister sniffs: &quot;A Toffee Crisp Barney? I thought you worked for The Guardian, yet here you are munching on the Nestl\u00e9 treats. You&apos;d best hope Polly Toynbee&apos;s not reading this MBM.&quot; Toyners always reads these. She&apos;s bang up for it. Shame she only gets to write all that stuff about the third way and the fourth way and why gordon Brown isn&apos;t really a dufus.  Robin Hazlehurst suggests: &quot;Maybe Keane grew up watching Chariots of Fire a lot. They really put a lot of effort into running fast in that film, and probably believe they are doing so, but crikey it takes them a long time to cover 100 metres. &quot;  Lee James has rubber worries: &quot;The commentators tell us that this game is in aid of a campaign to get people to wear condoms in Africa. Presuming Kaka is still contracted to Jesus, isn&apos;t that a bit taboo for him as an evangelical? Can we expect a legal challenge from God &amp; Son almightys at law?&quot;  Ben Dunn has considered Keane and his little legs at length: &quot;Keane, like Del Piero for Juventus, has lost the verve required by a striker. Capello advised Del Piero to take a more deep-seated position - a midfielder of vision - Del Piero refused and spent some considerable time on the bench. Having seen Del Piero play as a striker I can see Capello&apos;s point. He has no power nor turn of speed, but plays as though these are his strengths. I think Keane needs to look at playing further back, a possible Pirlo role, or a formation that allows a player behind a front two, otherwise he&apos;s a Scottishleague player for life.&quot; Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.  Richard Whittal points out: &quot;whenever Brazil move past the halfway line, the crowd suddenly resembles that gaggle of teenage girls greeting the Beatles at John F. Kennedy airport in 1964? PS - I don&apos;t think you look like Roadkill.&quot; No - I think it was us looking at you &quot;like you were roadkill&quot;.  45 mins We&apos;re off again.  Ireland win an early corner, given away by Bastos. This kind of thing is Ireland&apos;s best chance of a goal.  47 minutes Duff&apos;s corner breaks to Keane and his shot is blocked by Lucio. There was a bit of faffing by Cesart in there. I think he thought St Ledger pushed him, the big whingeing weed. John McLauchlin asks: &quot;What do you think of this Brazil midfield? Melo is a decent tackler who really is only a good enough player for Almeria, Silva has good positional sense and Ramires is quick. None of them make a pass of more than 10 yards with any accuracy. Isn&apos;t it ridiculous to have the tasks of one good midfielder done by three very limited players?&quot; I think they all pass it a bit like Dunga. And there&apos;s no goals in that midfield, or very many up front.  50 mins Brazil keep on attacking down both flanks and Bastos wins a corner. Colin Galloway asks: &quot;Hi Barney, big tussle involving Kaka just beyond half way line running back , 15 sec&apos;s before goal..arm&apos;s raised.....Referee had a look - did nothing.....did you see that or anyone else see that..?&quot; It&apos;s Henry all over again! Quick, start a Facebook page!  51 mins Nice stuff from Kaka and Ramires on the left edge of the Ireland penalty area and Kaka is suddenly furious with Andrews over somehting. I think he nudged him over when the ball had gone. They squared up to each other unconvincingly. Kaka! Jesus here. Cut that out. And Justin Kavanagh has disturbing news: &quot;Mention of your half-time Toffee Crisp has brought a wistful tear to my eye, Barney, as I&apos;ve been told to give up chocolate by my doctor this week. It&apos;s like being told that you can&apos;t watch Brazil at future World Cups. Oh to have Anto&apos;s dilemnas in Amsterdam.&quot;  54 mins Kaka has a shot at goal but it&apos;s blocked and Ireland break, but it&apos;s a bit slow and laboured although they do keep possession. Darron Gibson is coming on in a bit. Phil Sawyer asks: &quot;Re: Richard Whittal&apos;s comment at half time. &quot;PS - I don&apos;t think you look like roadkill&quot;. Was he talking to me? He hasn&apos;t seen me after a night on the ale. Or maybe he has, in which case last weekend went horribly, horribly wrong...&quot; No. He&apos;s still banging on about the time he came on the podcast.  56 mins Gibson comes on. Duff goes off. McGeady comes on too. Missed who came off for him. Keanes&apos; still puffing about out there. Ethan Dean-Richards adds: &quot;Bannister just cracked the joke that I was trying so hard to think of (Toffee Crisp etc). I guess that&apos;s the difference between witty contributer and laughing stock weirdo. So close.&quot; And Bastos has a thrash at goal from some distance but it flies just over with Given scrambling.  59 mins Brazil are still dominating this game, but quietly and with a sense that it doesn&apos;t really matter very much. More last-ditch tackling from Kelly on Kaka as he prepares to shoot.  61 mins Some nice approach play from Brazil ends up with Maicon having a shot from 15 yards out that St Ledger blocks with his ahem groin area. Grafite is about to come on. And Ben Dunn writes: &quot;It is a very different Brazil team from the classic stereotype. Their goalkeeper is on a level with the previously untouchable Buffon. Their defence has Maicon and Lucio, who are arguably the best in their positions at the present time. The midfield is made in the manager&apos;s image and has the creativity of the Ray Wilkins Triplets,&quot; writes Ben Dunn. &quot;On a different note. Fringe is on a break, V is still on a break and Lost is my only TV programme of the week. I am currently acquiring True Blood the first episode through my dear friends at EZTV. Worth it? any other recommendations? I&apos;ll be the first to make the obligatory The Wire comment, but I&apos;m looking for something less intense, and less Guardian.&quot; How about Scooby-Doo?  64 mins Grafite and Alves comes on for (the puffing and blowing) Adriano and Ramires. Alves almost scores within five seconds of coming as he robs St Ledger, beats the keeper and somehow fails to hit the target with his left foot. That was horrible defending. Robin Hazlehurst jeers: &quot;So Phil Sawyer&apos;s definition of a weekend that went horribly horribly wrong is one where he doesn&apos;t end up looking like roadkill? A man with low standards indeed.&quot;  66 mins Robinho spanks a shot just over from 25 yards. That came out of nothing. And Silver Fox asks &quot;Is it just me or is the atmosphere more akin to a boyband pop concert rather than a football match. Never heard so much girlie screaming since my daughter&apos;s birthday party.&quot; It is a bit squealy.  68 mins Robinho thinks he&apos;s scored but he&apos;s offisde, Graifte robbing McShane and putting him in for a nice finish past Given. Might have been an Irish boot that put the ball through to him, but the goal was perhaps offside so maybe it all evens out in the end. Moments later Robinho baloons a simple chance over the bar after Andrews gives the ball to Kaka on the right wing. Terrible defending but a very casual finish.  71 mins McCarthy just came on for his debut. He&apos;s the future. And James Tyler asks: &quot;If the conspiracy against Arsenal is to be believed, along with the theory that teams with less talent will frequently &quot;get stuck in&quot; against better opponents, how come Brazil aren&apos;t walking wounded?&quot; I have a hunch it has somehting to do with winning trophies and a hierarchy of respect. Check out those Ricardo Fuller comments. Plus Brazil are a big team.  73 mins Oh dear. A rubbish show-off attempt at converting a Maicon cross by Kaka. Pauses to do some keep-ups before having a shot and McShane robs him. That was ridiculous. San Boiling writes: &quot;Re Ben Dunn&apos;s TV Round-up. Has he tried &apos;Glee&apos;? Apparently quite a lot of people think that&apos;s quite good.&quot; It&apos;s not.  75 mins More TV hints. John McLauchlin suggests: &quot;Re: Ben Dunn. True Blood = Buffy the Vampire Slayer uncensored. I&apos;d recommend Breaking Bad.&quot;  77 mins BRAZIL SCORE!!!! Lovely goal by Robinho!! Really nice team interplay also involving Kaka and Graftie ends with Grafite backheeling a return pass through McShane&apos;s legs for Robinho to side-foot an effortless finish into the corner from the edge of the box. That were proper champion.  79 mins Best comes on for Ireland and almost gets on to the end of a bouncing ball in the six-yard box but he&apos;s crowded out. To be honest Brazil look fitter, stronger, and also much better out there right now.  82 mins Apparently there were 22 passes in the build-up to Robinho&apos;s goal. Take that Wing Commander Charles Reep! Brazil wind the clock down by keeping the ball a bit. And Sean Boiling is engaging in anti-social behaviour: &quot;I know this doesn&apos;t work in the proper pronunciation but hey, I&apos;m not Brazilian. Or proper. Could grafite scrawl his name in the history books of international friendlies with another of those trademark 70 yard beat all 11 opposition players twice and then back heel it into the net runs? Who has Trapp put on Grafite to tag him? Is Grafite spraying the ball around?&quot; Oh dear. It&apos;s getting late.  84 mins Nice footwork from Nilmar, who&apos;s also on now, and Kelly drags him down. Free kick in a decent position. Deflected for a corner and Ireland clear it. On watching things Scott W says: &quot;Old telly is the answer. Check out stuff before you were born. &quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot; are both great - and (in a blatant infringement) of copyright someone has uploaded them on YouTube.&quot;  86 mins Ireland won&apos;t have enjoyed this seocnd half. They just haven&apos;t had the ball at all. Must be awful playing against teams who can keep it like this and who you can&apos;t push around and get stuck into in return. Grafite runs on to Nilmar&apos;s pass and shoots wide from a tricky angle. A bit selfish that.  88 mins It&apos;s all dying a bit out there. Brazil want to go home. They&apos;ve done their bit in the second half. Hugh Collins says &quot;Ben should check out Mad Men. Best TV drama since Sopranos.&quot; Is it though? Grafite tries a cheeky chip from an angle. That would have been goal of the seaosn. It flies over Given&apos;s bar.  90+1 mins Kaka almost plays in Eduardo after some neat high speed interplay. That was really too easy against a tired looking defence. Down the other end Best has a shot which Cesar smothers (while Robbie Keane screams at him unfairly for not passing).  90+3 mins FULL TIME. Brazil win 2-0 and they deserved it. That could have been four quite easily. Really good display from Brazil in the second half and it all makes you long for the World Cup. That&apos;s all from me. Thanks for all your emails, sorry for not being able to put them all up.

And I&apos;m all in favour of cutting 10% off our carbon. And of domestic solar panels. Anything that slows our consumption is useful. But ultimately I don&apos;t really think the bottle bank is going to get us out of this. And being virtuous is not going to get us out of it either. Civilisation is going to need another energy source.&quot; McEwan&apos;s own view \u2013 having been persuaded by thinkers such as Stewart Brand, and despite his own long-held suspicions of the industry \u2013 is that nuclear energy is probably our best bet in the medium term. Michael Beard, Nobel prize-winning physicist, glutton and the protagonist of McEwan&apos;s latest novel, Solar, has an even more technologically complex solution. His work in the field of artificial photosynthesis as a way of harnessing the sun&apos;s power has made him rich and famous. Beard got his Nobel for &quot;modifying Einstein&apos;s photovoltaics&quot;, and McEwan enthusiastically explains that the bleeding-edge science in the book is real, if some way from practical application. &quot;If you go to America the amount of ingenuity being deployed, and the private capital \u2013 until this present recession \u2013 being invested in nanotechnology and solar energy is astonishing.&quot; For McEwan science is the road not taken, and he talks slightly enviously about his geneticist son&apos;s work and training. At the age of 16 he &quot;agonised&quot; at school over the arts or science route. &quot;My maths was actually pretty mediocre, but I did love science and eventually even &apos;got&apos; calculus, although I always felt if I so much as sneezed I would probably lose it again. But having a sense of awe that Leibniz could dream such things up, and other people could understand them, was very important to me. In the end I chose literature, but science has been a part of my life for just as long.&quot; It has become something of a commonplace to say that while McEwan&apos;s early novels exhibited a slight new-agey tinge that reflected the times, his more recent work is underpinned by a greater sense of rationalism in general and science in particular. But those closest to him see far more continuity. Timothy Garton Ash, a friend and confidant for 30 years, says &quot;the idea put about of the young Ian being open to mysticism and the like, as opposed to the hard-edged scientific rationalist of today, is just nonsense. He&apos;s always been supremely rational and both politically interested and engaged. As a novelist he has always been a matchless observer of the complexities of personal relationships, and also an intellectual and political writer. There is a play of ideas that runs through all the books.&quot; While McEwan&apos;s early work focused on strange sexual and psychological manoeuvrings, since the early 80s he has consciously engaged with both historical and contemporary events and has found himself being slowly co-opted into the position of our de facto national novelist, with all the praise and opprobrium that can bring. &quot;When I began I thought that literature was contained within a bubble that somehow floated above the world commented upon by newspapers. But I became more and more interested in trying to include some of that world within my work.&quot; His first attempt to break out of the &quot;rather claustrophobic fiction&quot; he had been writing in the 70s and early 80s was his 1985 screenplay, The Ploughman&apos;s Lunch, which featured a journalist writing about Suez at the time of the Falklands war. That led &quot;pretty directly&quot; to The Child in Time (1987) in which the story of a missing child is refracted through both science and domestic politics. Although he now says he thinks &quot;the least successful elements in that were its animadversions against Mrs Thatcher&quot;, his path had been diverted and he began to deal with pressing political issues, such as the Iraq war and, now, climate change. &quot;It&apos;s good to get your hands dirty a bit and to test how you see things at a given point. And it&apos;s very pleasing after writing something like Atonement or On Chesil Beach, which are historical, to get involved in some plausible re-enactment of the here and now. Maybe duty is too heavy a word for it. But it certainly becomes very attractive to bring a novel into the present.&quot; A few work-in-progress readings and public hints over the past couple of years revealed that Solar was not only going to be &quot;about&quot; climate change, but would also be a comedy. &quot;I actually find novels that are determined to be funny at every turn quite oppressive,&quot; he explains. &quot;But comedy in a more general sense, yes. It lets you play round at the edges of realism. You can be a little more breezy, slightly push the boat out on plot, be slightly less sober in evaluations of the possible.&quot; The genesis of the book was McEwan&apos;s journey to the Arctic circle in 2005 with a mixed group of scientists and artists to witness climate change at first hand. &quot;I adored that trip,&quot; he says. &quot;While the sculptors and painters did their thing, I just hiked around with whoever would come with me.&quot; Walking the frozen fjords with Antony Gormley he discussed landscape and imagination. At dinner there was &quot;idealistic conversation about how we had to be different in our relations with government&quot;. But just the other side of the door from the living quarters was a boot room. &quot;It was chaos. There was no malice, but people were careless and would inadvertently borrow each other&apos;s stuff. Clothes and equipment there to save our lives, which we should have been able to look after very easily, would go missing, and I thought, for all the fine words and good intentions, maybe there was a comic inadequacy in human nature in dealing with this problem.&quot; Copenhagen confirmed his fears. &quot;It was unprecedented for world leaders to be summoned by science. But it resulted in disarray and conflict with elements of Whitehall farce. So I thought that if I ever did get round to this project, I would want to write about a very flawed guy. Someone hopeless, or hopelessly self-interested.&quot; McEwan put the idea aside while he finished Saturday, wrote On Chesil Beach and completed the libretto to his and Michael Berkeley&apos;s opera, For You. But he was still thinking about the Arctic in 2007 when he was invited to a symposium of Nobel laureates discussing climate change in Potsdam. &quot;I got rather caught up in the grandeur of Nobel prizewinners. To have so many in one place was quite something. All formidably clever and grand, and legends in their own minds. My climate change man would have a Nobel prize.&quot; That McEwan should be addressing symposia of Nobel-winning scientists at all illustrates just how steep his career trajectory has been. In hindsight, winning the Booker prize for Amsterdam in 1998 was just a staging post. The global success of his next novel, Atonement, especially in America, saw him enter that rare territory of the literary novelist who finds himself troubling the end-of-year sales charts. Such success, and the fame that has come with it, has not always made for a comfortable life. Stories about him became front-page news. Family matters such as a distressingly messy custody battle with his first wife or the appearance of a brother he never knew he had were glibly characterised as being &quot;something from an Ian McEwan novel&quot;. His visa problems entering the United States were reported in more than 400 newspapers. As with many successful writers, shaky plagiarism allegations have surfaced, resulting in the reclusive Thomas Pynchon breaking cover to defend him. Comments defending his old friend Martin Amis from charges of racism saw McEwan&apos;s own views on Islam put in the dock, and on the blogosphere he can attract a rancorously toxic claque. He has inflicted some of these experiences \u2013 &quot;a few of mine, some of Martin&apos;s, some things I&apos;ve observed from afar&quot; \u2013 on Beard, who also finds himself at the eye of press storm. &quot;When you&apos;re in it, it feels like a gale is blowing through your house,&quot; he explains. &quot;But then suddenly it all moves on and you almost feel bereft. What do you do now? It&apos;s not funny at the time, but when it blows over it just seems absurd.&quot; Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a physicist and chief climate adviser to the German government, headed by Angela Merkel, herself also a physicist, was the man who invited McEwan to Potsdam. They first met at a joint artist/scientist seminar in Oxford in 2004. &quot;We had a very long chat about the climate problem. Back then I think he was cautious as to whether artists could play a role at all, but he was warming up to the subject. When I organised the Nobel Cause symposium I was delighted to have him there. He really wants to understand how physics works and gave a wonderful talk. And he does love to talk about equations and theories and so on, which is very unusual for a writer. They usually think it is cool to know nothing about science. Being a complete ignoramus somehow makes them feel dignified. But Ian is completely different.&quot; McEwan was born in Aldershot in 1948 into an army family. His childhood included spells living in Germany, the far east and Libya, which the Amis-Islam row led him to recall with &quot;only warm memories of a dignified, tolerant and hospitable Islamic culture&quot;. At his boarding school he was absorbed by music \u2013 from blues and jazz to Bach \u2013 as well as science and literature. His tastes may have been conservative enough \u2013 Shelley, Keats and Wordsworth, then Graham Greene and Iris Murdoch \u2013 but it was enough to set up &quot;the classic alienation, which I made a bit of a mess of&quot;. Both his parents had left school at 14 and, while they were &quot;kind and encouraging, they just weren&apos;t engaged in the things I was interested in, and so I ended up becoming moody about not being able to speak to anyone about Middlemarch at home. You don&apos;t want to be too hard on your younger self, but I probably was a bit intolerable and didn&apos;t realise until years later that there are lots of people who never read poems or novels or listen to Bach, who are just as compassionate and discerning beings as those who do. But aged 18 I had a problem about meeting people who hadn&apos;t read The Waste Land. What could I possibly say to them?&quot; In 1967 McEwan went to the University of Sussex to read English. There, an innovative course saw him exposed to a new road map of the modern European mind that led from Virgil and Dante through to Kafka and Bruno Schulz. &quot;By my second year, my nice orientation of the English literature canon had all gone and I became drawn into a much more tangled, chaotic and wilder set of books and imaginations. That was the point I wanted to join in.&quot; A &quot;terrible&quot; play soon emerged \u2013 &quot;sort of a religious allegory&quot; \u2013 the manuscript of which unexpectedly turned up a few months ago and which he swears will never see the light of day. There was also a long &quot;Yeatsian&quot; poem and some short stories that have not survived. Determined not to have a proper job after having seen the civil service pay scale chart from entry level to retirement age, he spotted a new MA course at the University of East Anglia that allowed for the substitution of one module with a piece of original fiction. He phoned and was put straight through to Malcolm Bradbury. &quot;I&apos;d read a couple of his books and I was amazed that he was on the end of the line. But the world was emptier then. It seemed there was a limited amount of people on the planet, and you really could phone them all up.&quot; Despite having comparatively little contact with Bradbury, or his other supervisor, Angus Wilson, McEwan says he had &quot; a pretty amazing year&quot; in which he wrote 30 short stories. &quot;I just had the time and space to write some stories that would be read by someone, even though they would just say, &apos;That&apos;s great, carry on.&apos; There was none of the stuff that happens now, where kids get their stuff read by other kids. That can be quite ruthless and I&apos;m not sure I would have survived it.&quot; After completing the course, McEwan set out on the hippy trail overland to Afghanistan. &quot;Which was fantastic. But there came a point in the back of this bus, driving across desert tracks, with the sun beating down everywhere, when I began to dream of a tiny whitewashed room in Norwich where the skies were grey and there weren&apos;t flies and beggars.&quot; Recognition came soon after his return home, with the journal New American Review taking an early story \u2013 &quot;Homemade&quot;, about teenage incest \u2013 and paying McEwan $400, &quot;which could keep you for months&quot;. More significant than the money was his appearance on the cover of the magazine, alongside Philip Roth, Susan Sontag and G\u00fcnter Grass. &quot;It is still the most exciting moment of my publishing life,&quot; he says. &quot;All the other good moments were just versions of it. Seeing my name alongside these legendary figures was like passing through a mirror.&quot; Jonathan Raban, a friend from the Norwich days, remembers what a coup it was for McEwan to sell his story. &quot;I&apos;d never met anyone who seemed, at least on the surface, so confident of his own take on the world and what he was doing. I remember him once saying that he had just finished a short story so was going to take six weeks off. I&apos;d never heard a freelance writer say that before. But he knew the rhythm of his writing life even then and didn&apos;t seem to be in the usual state of neurosis about his vocation.&quot; McEwan moved to London and began to make his way in a literary world subsidised, unexpectedly, by the Radio Times, which acted like &quot;an unofficial arts council. They paid extraordinarily well and employed lots of impecunious young writers to provide previews of costume dramas.&quot; He lived in a room in a &quot;rather wonderful house in Stockwell, which was quite a druggie scene. But I was still quite monkish in my habits. I loved marijuana, but never wrote on it. I&apos;d hang out with friends and watch movies or listen to music, but not write. I was always very clear on that.&quot; The other two axes of his literary life were &quot;Martin and Julian&quot; at the New Statesman, and the Pillars of Hercules pub in Soho, home of Ian Hamilton&apos;s New Review. &quot;I sort of had my 60s in the 70s. I had some wild times with Martin. It was a very free and amusing time and nearly all the literary friends I have now I met then. I imagine there&apos;s a group of young people meeting in a similar way in Stoke Newington now. I hope so, anyway.&quot; Writing as a career was from the very beginning &quot;an ideal life. It was endlessly changing. Everything you wrote was a new beginning.&quot; His early story collections and novels, First Love, Last Rites (1975), Between the Sheets (1978), The Cement Garden (1978), were met with acclaim, and the epithet &quot;a new voice&quot; was for once accurate. McEwan says he saw himself in a tradition that included William Burroughs, Jean Genet, the brothel scenes from Ulysses and Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover. &quot;There was plenty behind me to make me feel that what had to be really radical in literature was the content, not the style. What was named was more important to me than playing games. I did know about things like BS Johnson and those other novels published by Calder books, but I thought then, as now, that Finnegans Wake was a heroic charge up a cul-de-sac that saved everyone else the trouble. However brilliant it is, it showed that finally literature has to communicate in some sort of immediate way.&quot; Raban says McEwan&apos;s successful progression from the short story to novel was not a given. &quot;In his early novels, the first chapter, rather infamously, was just about perfect in that it was condensed like a brilliant short story. The novel afterwards then seemed to rework those threads. But he developed that long memory of the novelist, and the more recent books have overwhelmed me with their sense of architecture. He has become the best realist novelist alive. He&apos;s always been able to observe the world very closely and astutely, and the work is saturated with precise and particular detail. For me Ian will never be divorceable from that measured, wide-eye blink he takes at the world. He has a readiness to be surprised by anything that happens.&quot; While some of his early work had excited mild controversy, he got his first taste of a proper scandal when his 1979 television play, Solid Geometry, which featured a pickled penis in a jar, was banned. &quot;It was a bit embarrassing because I got a flood of invitations to speak about censorship and share a platform with eastern European dissidents. I never thought my case was even remotely like theirs. That was my first run-in with elements of the left who claimed we lived in a police state, which I didn&apos;t really buy.&quot; He categorised himself as part of the &quot;anti-totalitarian left and was always aware of the daftness of people who thought there was anything good to be said about the Soviet Union&quot;. He visited eastern bloc countries with EP Thompson as part of the European Nuclear Disarmament movement. &quot;We were there to help Russian anti-nuclear dissidents who were critical of the Soviet military-industrial complex. But I had discussions there that really threw my politics. These wonderful, brave people would be telling me how marvellous Mrs Thatcher was for standing up to the Soviet Union. I was entrenched in my loathing of Mrs Thatcher, so it was unsettling. I suppose it&apos;s the sort of thing I should re-examine at some stage, as these things do become a habit. But while life did get easier in Britain in the 1980s, I still don&apos;t feel any great affection for her.&quot; McEwan says that although Solar may be about climate change, we shouldn&apos;t forget that it is a novel. &quot;The best way to tell people about climate change is through non-fiction. There&apos;s a vast literature of outstanding writing on the subject. But what I wanted to get across is a sense of how difficult this task is going to be. That said, and even after Copenhagen, I remain optimistic. The decline of oil production and its rising price, which will be very painful, will push us a bit. I also think people are much more adaptable and flexible than governments think. And then there&apos;s the new technology. Who knows, maybe mine and Michael Beard&apos;s lofty dreams of artificial photosynthesis, which is not impossible, might yet save us all.&quot;", "sentences": ["In hindsight, winning the Booker prize for Amsterdam in 1998 was just a staging post."], "title": "Ian McEwan: 'It's good to get your hands dirty a bit'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/06/ian-mcewan-solar", "tags": ["Ian McEwan", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-07T00:05:42Z", "article": "Wing Yip Business Centre, Oldham Road, Ancoats, Manchester (0161 839 3312). Dim sum for two: \u00a335  How was I supposed to resist the allure of a restaurant called Glamorous? How could I not want to go there when I have quite clearly made the pursuit of glamour the entire point of my life? And surely they do not come much more glamorous than this? Or, as they put it: &quot;How many other Chinese restaurants do you know with their very own secure multistorey car park, a total seating capacity of 600, and the biggest chandelier you&apos;ve ever seen adorning the centre of the restaurant?&quot; Glamorous occupies a football pitch-sized slab of floor space in the Manchester business centre run by Wing Yip, the behemoths of catering suppliers to Britain&apos;s Asian restaurant business. In theory I travel all over the country reviewing myriad Chinese places that claim to make all their own food. In reality, as Wing Yip itself boasts, almost all of them will get some or even a huge majority of their dishes from the company, which means that most of the time I&apos;ve almost certainly been eating exactly the same dishes, just on different crockery. It therefore made a kind of sense to head for one of the motherships. And anyway, it&apos;s called Glamorous. It had to be done. Which is essentially the sum of it. Glamorous has to be done, but probably only once. After all, you would not want to miss out on that multistorey car park. One wall of the restaurant is made up of windows, which look out into its gunmetal-grey depths. We were proudly offered a window seat, and after the long march across the tundra of the dining room were grateful for the rest, even more so for the view of a lovely Lexus.     Glamorous's dim sum with char sui buns. Photograph: Howard Barlow    On a weekday lunchtime the place was packed with Chinese families. Having eaten the food, I do not take this as a sign of quality (I rarely do). Presumably they had all been in the supermarket downstairs, were hungry, and regarded the food here as not actively offensive. In places, however, the experience can be entertaining. Our waiter, a stringy chap in a bigger man&apos;s suit, certainly thought so. He took our dim sum order with barely restrained glee, finally belching out gales of laughter when I ordered the goose web. Not unreasonable: he thought we&apos;d hate it, and so did I, but I needed one more look at the matter of fowl extremities. I have long thought braised chicken feet disgusting; all that gelatinous, knobbly stuff. Well, goose feet are exactly the same, only bigger. Char sui buns, while hardly exemplary, were soft and light, and the sticky, sweet, porky filling did the job. Strands of squid, though showing that rubberiness that comes with a pause in the deep freeze, had at least been greaselessly deep-fried. I loved the seafood in a scallop and prawn dumpling, which had a pleasing bite, but the sticky rice-flour casing was far too thick and gelatinous. The same was true of a steamed dumpling of prawn and chives. This was all the odder because we had ordered it from the deep-fried list, and this had been nowhere near the bubbling oil. I pointed this out to the waiter, who was insistent that, whatever the menu said, this was what we had ordered. Weirdest of the lot was a mixed meat dumpling with soup, which I assumed from the description to be xiao long bao, those miraculous little parcels of loveliness in which the shell encases the broth so that invariably it dribbles down your chin. What arrived was a bowl of stock and, floating in it, the broken shell to a dumpling and one sad crabstick. We asked a waitress what it was. She didn&apos;t know. She asked her friend. She didn&apos;t know either. Our waiter came back, said it was for someone else, took it away and then brought it back again, telling us it was the one we had ordered. I dug around in its depths with a spoon, forcing the crabstick to roll and bob. I didn&apos;t taste it. There are limits. There is a much longer main menu and hanging in the window of a kitchen were some glossy lacquered ducks. I concluded it might well be possible to get a glamorous meal here.

Responding to my recent Cif piece about Mayor Johnson&apos;s numerous evasion tactics he says I should have realised long ago that Boris is a bad thing and goes on to upbraid others he considers far too soft:   In terms of the political tack of the Johnson administration, there is a now assumed consensus that it is basically Ken-light. The many proponents of this view in the media point to liberal proclamations concerning refugee rights. But this is a highly problematic argument. The bulk of the progressive policies of the Livingstone era have now been removed or are in the process of being dismantled.  Friendly then draws up a familiar list of Boris sins, points to the latest public transport fare hikes and blames the Mayor for problems with the funding of the Tube upgrades. This critique is interesting for several reasons.  Let&apos;s look at that &quot;Ken-lite&quot; view. It&apos;s not a term I&apos;ve used, but those who have are mostly referring to Boris&apos;s continuing to back the biggest transport infrastructure projects that were planned and begun under Livingstone. Boris has prioritised Crossrail, raising money from property developers and businesses to help fund it. He&apos;s also argued vigorously that Tube Lines should meet the shortfall in upgrade finances rather than TfL and fare-payers (the funding chaos is Gordon Brown&apos;s fault, not Boris&apos;s, anyway). In these very big ways Boris, far from reversing Ken&apos;s &quot;progressive agenda&quot;, has continued where Ken left off. Ask Ken. Friendly also laments the reducing or dismantling of cultural festivals and the ending of the Women&apos;s Unit. The trouble with making a big issue out of these is that quite a lot of Londoners don&apos;t care. These include one or two lefty feminists I could name, people who&apos;d welcome a big, multi-cultured popular music concert in the capital but think Rise required an update, and others who reluctantly accept that private sponsorship is going to have to play a larger part in the funding of cultural events in the capital and probably would have under any mayor.  What about those public transport fares rises? It is undoubtedly very telling that the most pain has been inflicted on those on the lowest wages. But too many lefties have failed to notice that many public transport changes are unchanged this year and that Boris has actually increased the range of benefit claimants who qualify for concessionary fares.  In short, Boris has not always behaved quite like the deep-dyed free-market believer he fundamentally is. This morning, he has announced funding to improve the provision of rape crisis centres. True this follows an impressive exercise in direct action and his critics are right to say that he&apos;s still falling short of his election promise. Even so, Boris can rightly claim that he&apos;s done more on the last mayor on this issue. My point is very simple. It is that characterising Boris as an archetypal, nasty, right-wing Tory &quot;behind the mask&quot; will cut only so much ice in the real world. That&apos;s only partly because it&apos;s only partly true. There&apos;s another reason too. Try this from a London primary school teacher:  I met Boris Johnson! He is so witty, and so intelligant (sic). And I have been buzzing all week since that moment! Kelly, Charles and I went to &apos;Question Time&apos;, it only happens twice a year, and the mayor and other politicians answer questions from the public about controversial issues. These issues included crime, the Olympics, transport, the environment etc etc. Did you know that London is actually safer than Amsterdam or Paris? I really wanted to meet Boris but [it] seems so did everyone else there so we ended up leaving without getting a chance, but then who gets on the same tube as us?! Boris and about 7 other politicians. This was my moment!!! I politely introduced myself and asked him to be the prime minister of NZ. Himself and the other politicians found this greatly amusing and this led onto a conversation about Lord of the Rings and Flight of the Concords. He was very friendly as were the other politicians. My class and I are going to write to him and lets hope he will come into school to see us!  Yes, people like him. No challenger from the left should forget it. Neither should he or she forget that any bold and progressive alternative agenda must contrast itself with everything that Boris has actually done, not simply certain very particular things that some lefty activists might wish he hadn&apos;t.

Though Sutton&apos;s father had been born into slavery before the civil war, he became a farmer and then the head teacher of a segregated high school in San Antonio, Texas. All of his 12 surviving children got a college education, and Percy went on to become a significant figure in New York politics and a role model for the next generation. After studying at the all-black Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and the Hampton Institute in Virginia, Sutton served in the second world war in the all-black fighter squadron known as the Tuskegee Airmen, and as an intelligence officer in Italy. Then he went to law school in Brooklyn, and soon built up a practice as a civil rights lawyer. He represented many black activists arrested in civil rights demonstrations in the south, and was himself once arrested with Stokely Carmichael. He was lawyer to Malcolm X and his widow, Betty Shabazz, and defended their grandson when, at the age of 12, he was convicted of starting the fire that killed Shabazz in 1997. Sutton in effect succeeded Adam Clayton Powell Jr as the political boss of Harlem, joining a group of African-American politicians known as the Harlem Clubhouse. It included the future powerful black congressman Charles Rangel; the future mayor of New York, David Dinkins; and Basil Paterson, the father of the present governor of New York, David Paterson. In 1965, Sutton was elected a member of the New York state assembly and soon became the spokesman for its 13 African-American members. The following year, he was elected borough president of Manhattan with 80% of the vote. An elegant speaker, accomplished politician and popular figure, he retained the post till 1977, when he resigned to run for mayor of New York, but was beaten by Ed Koch. Thereafter he mentored younger politicians, including Jesse Jackson and Sharpton, and turned his great energies to his business interests, as the owner of a popular African-American radio station and of the black weekly newspaper the Amsterdam News. With his brother Oliver, a judge, he acquired WLIB-AM, the first radio station in New York to be African-American-owned. It became part of his Inner City Broadcasting corporation, which acquired radio stations in other cities, including Los Angeles and his native San Antonio. In 1983, Sutton bought and restored the venerable Apollo theatre on 125th Street in Harlem. It had been at the heart of the area&apos;s renaissance in the 1920s and 30s, and is once again one of the city&apos;s most prestigious venues. Sutton married Leatrice O&apos;Farrell in 1943. They divorced in 1950 and he married Eileen Clark. He remarried Leatrice in 1952.

The Barbican&apos;s move into east London will continue: for example, when the jazz legend Wynton Marsalis arrives with the Jazz at Lincoln Centre orchestra from New York there will be jam sessions at Dalston&apos;s Vortex and a family concert in Hackney. &quot;We are creating a new model for the future of what an arts centre can be,&quot; said Kenyon. &quot;It depends on the interaction of excellent names with as diverse an audience as possible.&quot; In visual arts, the Barbican art gallery&apos;s big summer show will be an exploration of the relationship between surrealism and architecture, with the architects Carmody Groarke designing a &quot;house&quot; in which there will be the work of artists from Man Ray to Dal\u00ed to Louise Bourgeois. Then in the autumn the gallery will host the first European exhibition devoted to avant-garde Japanese fashion from the early 1900s to the present. The Barbican&apos;s main resident orchestra, the London Symphony orchestra, will see the principal conductor, Valery Gergiev, take on Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich as well as a less familiar name, the living Russian composer Rodion Schedrin.

It closed the first day&apos;s trading in shares of World Online. While previous dotcom IPOs had rocketed skywards, shares in the pan-European internet service provider halted a mere \u20ac0.20 above their offer price. The firm was still valued at an eye-watering \u20ac12bn (\u00a37.2bn) but in web terms the performance was a disaster. The internet bubble, which had created a slew of paper millionaires and a fair clutch of real ones, was beginning to burst. The so-called &quot;new economy&quot; was turning out to be nothing of the sort: it was just boom and bust on steroids. After the weekend, World Online shares crashed to earth. In London, investors started bailing out of Lastminute.com, which had managed to get onto the stock market just days before, and as jitters about over-valued technology stocks became panic, markets across the world went into reverse. It quickly became a rout that pushed scores of businesses to the wall and ushered in a technology recession that lingered at least until the arrival of Google on the American stock market in the summer of 2004. And an estimated trillion dollars of investors&apos; money went down the drain as the contagion spread to the communications infrastructure sector. They had argued that in a gold rush the real winners were the ones who sold the shovels and pickaxes \u2013 in the internet&apos;s case, the actual equipment of the web \u2013 but they quickly discovered that in a recession, everyone loses. Companies which had poured hundreds of millions into building huge fibre-optic cable networks and data-hosting centres suddenly found their mantra of &quot;build it and they will come&quot; sounded hollow. They had built, but the dotcom clients suddenly were not coming. Companies such as KPNQwest, Pangea and CityReach International collapsed while others such as Energis, Telecity and Cable &amp; Wireless were forced into massive restructurings. But out of the mess emerged a new way of doing business. The internet did have a profound effect on both society and commerce, just not as quickly as the &quot;digerati&quot; from the dotcom boom, with their inflatable boardrooms and dress-down style, had hoped. Some of the technology trends that everyone now takes for granted were born in the boom, from instant unmetered internet access, web TV and &quot;cloud computing&quot; to social networking and the mobile web. They may have been born in the boom but only in the past few years have they come of age. There was already unrest in the air when World Online floated. The week had started with the publication of the annual statement to investors in Berkshire Hathaway by its investing guru boss, Warren Buffett. Having refused to invest in tech stocks because he did not understand them, he was forced to apologise for the fund&apos;s poor performance in the previous year, but warned: &quot;If anyone starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly manic portions of this enchanted market, you might remember still another line of song: &apos;fools give you reasons, wise men never try&apos;.&quot; As his message was sinking in, Freeserve, Britain&apos;s biggest internet service provider and 80%-owned by Dixons, started offering unmetered internet access for the first time, after being forced to react to moves by cable group NTL and Alta Vista the previous week. The move ripped a hole in its business model \u2013 it had made money from call charges \u2013 but chief executive John Pluthero said it would mean more people would spend more time online and Freeserve would make money from content, e-commerce and advertising \u2013 a battle the ISPs are still waging. Even back then, analysts were unconvinced, starting to doubt the crazy revenue projections built into their financial models. Then on the Tuesday, Lastminute.com made its stock market debut, crystalising a \u00a3150m paper fortune for its founders, Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox, the young couple who had become pin-ups of the British dotcom boom. The shares rocketed from 380p to 555p within minutes of the opening but the nearly 200,000 retail punters who had registered to take part in the float were left disappointed, given just 35 shares each. At their height on that first day, Lastminute.com&apos;s shares valued the business at \u00a3800m. That&apos;s \u00a3800m for a company that in the previous three months had made revenues \u2013 not even profits \u2013 of just \u00a3409,000, the naysayers pointed out. But the dotcom boom was all about the creation of a new paradigm for business. Companies could not be valued on multiples of revenues or profits, the dotcom crowd argued. As Julie Meyer, founder of internet networking event First Tuesday and one of the UK digerati&apos;s fiercest evangelists, said on the day of Lastminute&apos;s ascension: &quot;As for value, it is like beauty \u2013 all in the eye of the beholder.&quot; And it was a brave person who denied the power of putting a small &apos;e&apos; in front of any business model, be it e-venturing or e-commerce. There had been a lot of &quot;moonshots&quot; \u2013 companies whose shares soared on their debut \u2013 created out of the stock of dotcom businesses. In the US, for instance, between 1975 and 1998 only 39 IPOs doubled in value on their first day. In 1999, 117 achieved it. By the middle of March 2000, 43 had already doubled in value on their first day. There were mammoth gains to be made and the effective takeover of Wall Street bellwether Time Warner by digital upstart AOL at the start of 2000 really had seemed to signal an unstoppable revolution. A few days before World Online went public, there was talk that Yahoo was about to merge with eBay, having been in talks with Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corp, in order to compete with the AOL/Time Warner behemoth. Such talk helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average race up 500 points \u2013 its biggest one-day gain \u2013 fuelling concerns on Capitol Hill about the &quot;casino mentality&quot; gripping US markets. This side of the Atlantic, traders were becoming nervy. Buoyed by the positive share price reactions which had greeted dotcom investment announcements from the likes of Sky, Pearson and Reuters, magazine group Emap announced plans to invest \u00a3250m in new e-ventures, only to see its share price drop 12%. Investor sentiment was turning against &apos;dotcommery&apos;. When traders returned to their desks after that weekend, the selling gained pace and after three days in the public markets World Online&apos;s shares had lost 20% of their value. By the end of the following week Lastminute.com shares were down a similar amount. &quot;The greed evident in the flotation might actually increase the chances that the company disappears up its own portal,&quot; the Guardian commentator Edmond Warner said at the time, summing up a mood. In Germany, shares in Lycos Europe dipped under their issue price within moments of the company going public. In the US, the Nasdaq still had some life in it and touched a high of 4816.35 points on March 24 as internet technology firm Cisco surpassed Microsoft as America&apos;s most valuable corporation with a valuation of $579.1bn. But the rot had set in. Within a few weeks, company after company was pulling its flotation \u2013 starting with video-on-demand player Yes Television, which pulled its \u00a3600m IPO \u2013 and the following months one after another high-profile corporate collapse as funding dried up. Even Joanna Lumley&apos;s endorsement could not help health and beauty site Clickmango, for instance, while the demise of fashion retailer Boo.com, amid tales of executive jets and champagne excesses, quickly became the stuff of legend. Also headed into the deadpool were so-called business-to-consumer \u2013 or B2C \u2013 firms with such webby names as Letsbuyit.com and UrbanFetch. Business-to-business \u2013 B2B \u2013 firms, e-finance boutiques and so-called dotcom incubators were wound up or sold on the cheap. Once tipped for a \u00a3700m flotation, online retailer Jungle.com, for instance, was snapped up by Argos owner Great Universal Stores for \u00a333m; the technology behind online information group Scoot, which once had a stock market valuation of more than \u00a32bn, was picked up by BT for just \u00a35m. By the end of 2000, World Online itself had been taken over by rival Tiscali. Investors suffered massive losses as, having hit its peak in early March, the FTSE Techmark index, launched with great fanfare just the previous November by then-chancellor Gordon Brown, went on to lose 90% over the next three years. The Nasdaq dropped 83% over the next two-and-a-half years. The pendulum had swung wildly from &quot;everyone&apos;s going to be a millionaire by Christmas&quot; to the &quot;internet is dead&quot;, remembers web entrepreneur Jamie Riddell, one of the British pioneers of internet advertising who launched his own agency, Cheeze, in late 1999. &quot;We were a new digital advertising agency trying to promote the web ... and we came back after the millennium and the party just stopped. We had gone from one extreme: people throwing hundreds of thousands of pounds at companies with business plans that did not add up, to the other: people saying &apos;no, the internet is not going to work&apos;.&quot; &quot;We survived because we were a very lean business \u2013 we took six months with no salary \u2013 and by maintaining the conviction that the internet was the future. We did not have a fish tank in the stairs or anything crazy, we kept it sparse. It was beans on toast for six months,&quot; he said. Eventually the company prospered and three years ago was scooped up by the Digital Marketing Group. Part of the reason the post-dotcom collapse was so prolonged was that while the boom provided fertile ground for new ideas, the technology of the web lagged behind. The internet connections being offered by the likes of Freeserve, for instance, were 56Kb per second dial-up. The average home connection today is more than 80 times faster. Back in 2000, getting a broadband connection, which ran at a fraction of the speed available today, cost upwards of \u00a350 a month and only a few tens of thousands of people had one. Most home connections struggled with the overly complex sites created by many B2C companies, such as Boo.com, while the chances of consumers being able to watch internet TV, as proposed by some companies during the boom, were slim indeed. Telewest experimented with virtual worlds as it tried to drive sales of faster cable connections, but two years later it had abandoned its experiments as it struggled with its debts. It was another two years before BT started properly rolling out broadband services and only in the last few years has it become ubiquitous. Back in 2000, data-hosting companies talked of corporate clients storing information on the web, or switching to an application service provider (ASP) model, under which many of the programmes used by their employees would be run on the internet. Few companies, however, were confident enough about their web connections to plot such a move. But now, companies like Google are challenging the might of Microsoft by providing corporate clients with everything from document management to calendars and email through a browser, and so-called &quot;cloud computing&quot; is one of the hottest topics in tech. The dotcom boom also saw the sale of licences to operate the next generation of 3G mobile phone services. The mobile phone operators had already tried unsuccessfully to get consumers to try a pared-down version of the internet \u2013 using technology called Wap \u2013 but it took years for 3G services to take off. It was not until the arrival of the 3G iPhone in 2008, which spawned a host of copycat touchscreen devices, that 3G services came of age. &quot;It was a very tough time after the boom, because we did not have the audience online that we do now, we did not have the technology,&quot; Riddell remembers. &quot;We had the ideas, but the boom was built on foundations of sand that were washed away.&quot;", "sentences": ["The gong that signalled the end of the business day on the Amsterdam stock exchange sounded particularly ominously when it rang out on Friday, 17 March, a decade ago."], "title": "Ten years after the crash, the dotcom boom can finally come of age", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/14/technology-dotcom-crash-2000", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Martha Lane Fox", "Telecommunications industry", "Nasdaq", "eBay"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-14T00:07:12Z", "article": "Solar is a sly, sardonic novel about a dislikable English physicist and philanderer named Michael Beard. He&apos;s a recognisable Ian McEwan type, a one-dimensional, self-deceiving man of science. We have met others like him before in McEwan&apos;s novels \u2013 such as Joe Rose, the science writer who narrates Enduring Love, or Henry Perowne, the brian surgeon protagonist of Saturday \u2013 but none is quite as repulsive as Beard. Perhaps McEwan should have written against expectation by choosing as his protagonist a scientist who has a profound artistic sensibility in the model of his friend Richard Dawkins, or an artist who is articulate in the language of science, as McEwan is himself. As it is, he remains a determined binarist; what continues to interest him are stark dichotomies, the clash and interplay of stable oppositions. Repeatedly in his fiction he sets reason against unreason, science against art, the mind against the body, technology against nature. Beard, who we are encouraged to believe won a Nobel prize in physics as a young man for something called the Beard-Einstein Conflation, is a short, fat, balding, much-married man of immense bodily appetites and scant self-discipline. He rapaciously consumes food, women and drink, with little regard for the consequences. He&apos;s a resolute short-termist, fearful of commitment and of becoming a father, living for the here and now. His behaviour is a local example of the more general problem of human over-consumption: just as Beard devours everything around him, so we are devouring our world, with its finite resources and fragile ecosystems. The trick of the novel, its central comic turn, is to make Beard, the greedy, selfish uber-consumer, an accidental expert on anthropogenic climate change. Through his expertise as a physicist, and then his opportunism in stealing the research ideas of a graduate student who works with him at an institute in Berkshire known only as the Centre, Beard is engaged in a programme to create cheap renewable energy through a process of artificial photosynthesis (you&apos;ll need to read the book to be filled in on the science). McEwan&apos;s great gamble is to narrate Solar, which is in three parts and spans nine years, from 2000 to 2009, entirely from Beard&apos;s point of view. Some of this is satisfying, especially the pithy scientific elaborations: McEwan, who has a precise, technician&apos;s vocabulary, has swotted up to PhD level on physics, just as he did on neurosurgery for Saturday, musicology for Amsterdam and molecular biology for Enduring Love. None of this extracurricular learning feels perfunctory, especially when compared with, say, a novel such as Martin Amis&apos;s The Information. In that novel, disquisitions on infinity, black holes, dwarf planets and astronomy felt imposed on the narrative rather than being intrinsic to it. In Solar, the physics never feels forced or unearned but rather is embedded in the deep structures of Beard&apos;s consciousness. We see the world just as he does, in all its cold reductiveness. In McEwan&apos;s early fiction, in his strange, experimental short stories and novellas, with their isolated, sexually deviant male protagonists, he wrote from the outside in, as it were. His was always the controlling intelligence, aggressively masculine, and he followed his young male protagonists less in thought than in action, detailing their psychosis and alienation with the cold detachment of a coroner examining a corpse. So devoid of emotion were these early fictions that reading them felt almost like an act of voyeurism. McEwan appeared to have no feelings for his characters; instead, he dissected them as if they were rats in a laboratory experiment. Here was, as John Updike said of Amis in a different context, &quot;an atrocity-minded author&quot; \u2013 but one with perhaps the most controlled, exact and fastidious prose style of all contemporary British novelists. McEwan&apos;s cruellest book, the one in which the violence seems most gratuitous and nasty, is The Comfort of Strangers (1981), his novella about a young British couple adrift in an autumnal Venice of shadows and fear that marked a point of transition for him: after this, and a long period of silence, he returned as a different writer. The instinct for cruelty remained but it was mitigated by a much deeper, more sophisticated, even feminine, moral and aesthetic sensibility. From The Child in Time (1987) onwards, he was less a postmodernist than a realist, with a 19th-century interest in character, agency and storytelling, in the what, how and why of the human dilemma. In addition, he was developing a modernist&apos;s concern with consciousness, and began to experiment with different ways of representing the essence of what Virginia Woolf called the &quot;quick of the mind&quot;. McEwan was now writing from inside out: thought determined action, and there was a new descriptive density to his writing. Where once he had shrunk and compressed, he now expanded and inflated. He was no longer a miniaturist, and yet he was still a writer of great, self-contained set-pieces, such as his description of a ballooning accident that provides the celebrated opening to Enduring Love; or the disappearance of an infant from a supermarket at the beginning of The Child in Time, a scene of such intense and urgent panic that it would torment any parent who read it; or the extended scene in On Chesil Beach, where the virginal newlyweds try and fail to consummate their marriage, with devastating consequences for the rest of their lives. Yet what unifies all McEwan&apos;s fiction is his preoccupation with the randomness of human endeavour in a post-religious, Darwinian world: his novels invariably turn on one sudden, unaccountable, life-changing happening or fatal equivocation. In Solar, the moment of crisis occurs when Beard returns from a trip to the Arctic to discover one of his graduate students at play in his house. It&apos;s quickly apparent that he is having an affair with Beard&apos;s unhappy and desperate wife (the marriage is over; Beard is a serial adulterer), and, in the ensuing confusion, the student falls and hits his head: &quot;No breathing, no pulse.&quot; Instead of helping the student or calling for an ambulance, Beard stumblingly intervenes to make it appear as if he has been murdered \u2013 as you would \u2013 so as to frame one of his wife&apos;s previous lovers, a thuggish builder whom Beard has confronted earlier in the novel. The circumstances of the death are used by Beard to extricate himself from his marriage, to punish the loathed builder and to reanimate his moribund career by appropriating the student&apos;s research into climate change and claiming it as his own. In one bound, it seems, he&apos;s free. That&apos;s a lot of change to believe in, however, and from this point everything feels excessively neat, ruthlessly schematic. Solar is very similar in style to the Booker prize-winning Amsterdam, especially in its narrative tidiness, jauntiness of tone and desire to punish foolish men. But Amsterdam was a novella, whereas Solar feels as if it has been stretched far beyond its natural length. Much of the first part, which is set in 2000 and culminates in the death of the student, reads like an exercise in extended scene-setting, to no obvious purpose or effect. The protracted episode in which Beard travels with a group of scientists, artists and green activists to the Arctic, played mostly for laughs \u2013 he pisses outside and his penis freezes; he is menaced by a polar bear \u2013 is laboriously over-described. There is, sentence by sentence, an uncharacteristic verbosity. The chief revelation of the Arctic mission is to show how the bootroom, where the well-intentioned group keeps its foul-weather clothing, becomes, after only a few days, a site of anarchy and chaos. This then is another parable of human rapacity: we take what we can, when we can. The best and most complex scene occurs towards the end of the second part. Beard and his latest lover, a kind, generous, full-figured woman, are together at her house. She has prepared a meal, and just before they sit down to eat it she tells Beard that she&apos;s pregnant and determined to keep the baby. In sentences of extraordinary poise and precision, McEwan contrasts Beard&apos;s selfish sense of revulsion at the news with that of his lover&apos;s hopeful joy. So minutely does he track Beard&apos;s ever-shifting, contradictory positions you have a returning sense, so familiar in McEwan&apos;s fiction, of events somehow sliding inexorably towards disaster. But then the lens blurs, there&apos;s an unexpected softening of focus and, after having sex, exhausted, the couple fall asleep. We next encounter Beard, four years later, in 2009, at the beginning of part three. He&apos;s in New Mexico preparing for a conference, and it is there, under the ferocious sun, that a lifetime of carelessness eventually catches up with him in a denouement that wouldn&apos;t be out of place in a West End farce. It was always going to be high risk, wagering so much on having as your central character a comic grotesque so loathsome and self-pitying, with thoughts mostly so banal, and then leaving the reader trapped, unrelieved, in his company for nearly 300 pages. In Atonement, the character Bryony writes fiction in which she seeks &quot;to show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive&quot;. What is absent from Solar, ultimately, are other minds, the sense that people other than Beard are present, equally alive, with something to contribute. Without them, after a while, it feels as if you are locked inside an echo chamber, listening only to the reverberations of the one same sound \u2013 the groan of a fat, selfish man in late middle age eating himself.

In a deal struck today, PVH agreed to buy Hilfiger from venture capital firm Apax Partners, which has presided over a successful turnaround of the business it bought in 2006. The brand&apos;s eponymous founder, Tommy Hilfiger, will stay on as &quot;principal designer and visionary&quot; under the ownership of PVH, which has a portfolio stretching from starchy Van Heusen formal shirts to Calvin Klein&apos;s raunchily advertised underwear lines. &quot;Calvin and Tommy are global iconic mega-brands,&quot; said PVH&apos;s chairman, Emanuel Chirico. &quot;We look forward to having the two of them in our portfolio to really drive growth.&quot; Under the terms of the deal, PVH will hand over \u20ac1.9bn in cash and \u20ac276m in shares for Amsterdam-based Hilfiger, giving Apax a healthy return on the \u20ac1.2bn it paid for the business in 2006, when the label was struggling with waning sales and a lack of fashion mojo after losing touch with its &quot;edgy&quot; roots. The tie-up is intended to be complementary in geographical terms. Calvin Klein&apos;s annual sales of $5.8bn (\u00a33.85bn) are heavily weighted towards the US, while Hilfiger&apos;s $4.5bn of revenue is tilted towards Europe and Asia. PVH wants to use Hilfiger&apos;s distribution network to spread the international recognition of its brands. Hilfiger&apos;s chief executive, Fred Gehring, said his label&apos;s use of the US flag and close association with American values was made it &quot;particularly appealing in many emerging markets&quot;. The takeover is a fresh chapter in a turbulent history since Irish-American designer Tommy Hilfiger created the label in 1985. One of nine children from a town in upstate New York, his early goal in fashion was to bring urban looks from London and Manhattan to smaller communities. Hilfiger expanded with close links to the music industry and enjoyed popularity with rap stars in the 1990s, including Snoop Dogg. But the brand lost its way towards the end of the decade. Gehring said it had become &quot;over-licensed and over-exposed&quot; and strayed too far from its &quot;preppy&quot; zone of shirts, chinos and denim. Over the past four years, Apax has built Hilfiger by opening stores in Europe and Asia, while striking a distribution deal with the department store chain Macy&apos;s to put it on a firmer footing in the US. Hilfiger recently opened a flagship store on Manhattan&apos;s Fifth Avenue and now has 1,000 outlets, making a profit of \u20ac270m in the year to March. Hilfiger remains a high-profile individual in the fashion world. He struck a deal with SonyBMG to present a series of pop concerts streamed online on a channel called TommyTV, featuring artists such as Wyclef Jean and Beyonc\u00e9, in an effort to lure younger shoppers. The entrepreneur hit the headlines in 2006 by getting involved in a punch-up with Axl Rose, the frontman of Guns N&apos; Roses, in the VIP area of a New York nightclub. Chris Kim, an analyst at JP Morgan in New York, told Bloomberg News that the buyout makes sense for PVH in helping the firm to build its US fashion brands in Europe: &quot;PVH could extend some of their brands into Europe, whether it is Arrow or Van Heusen or Izod, where they have essentially no exposure.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;We look forward to having the two of them in our portfolio to really drive growth.&quot; Under the terms of the deal, PVH will hand over \u20ac1.9bn in cash and \u20ac276m in shares for Amsterdam-based Hilfiger, giving Apax a healthy return on the \u20ac1.2bn it paid for the business in 2006, when the label was struggling with waning sales and a lack of fashion mojo after losing touch with its &quot;edgy&quot; roots."], "title": "Tommy Hilfiger joins the Phillips-Van Heusen fold in \u20ac2.2bn deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/15/tommy-hilfiger-buyout-fashion-designer", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Fashion", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Life and style", "Business", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-16T10:58:22Z", "article": " 10.20am: These are some of the key developments so far and a guide to the Guardian&apos;s latest coverage of the dispute.     16.03.10: Steve Bell on Gordon Brown and the looming British Airways cabin crew strike Photograph: Steve Bell    \u2022 BA cabin crew will be barred from picketing the airline&apos;s main Heathrow base at Terminal Five if a strike goes ahead. \u2022 The airline has pledged to fly 60% of passengers to their destinations during the cabin crew strike. \u2022 Unite has offered to suspend the strikes if BA resubmits a peace offer, while Acas has urged both sides to draw back from confrontation. \u2022 The Guardian&apos;s cartoonist Steve Bell illustrates Labour&apos;s difficulty over the issue by depicting Gordon Brown as a bloated and naked air hostess (see above). \u2022 The Conservatives are calling on Labour to reject any more funding from Unite, as the try to revive memories of a party in hock to the unions.

Forget the fact that many cabin crew have worked proudly for this airline for ten, twenty, thirty or even forty years; that whole families have followed in this profession of serving passengers though generations. We were here before you came Mr Walsh and we will be here when you have moved on. You may have been CEO through the worst headlines that BA has ever endured - numerous price fixing scandals and T5 disasters, but it is the almost clandestine move of charging British Airways&apos; customers a premium price whilst delivering a low cost service that will be your lasting legacy. Far from keeping the flag flying, under your stewardship Mr Walsh, our airline has become a faded and tattered version of itself. The media that cheer your iron fisted, jingoistic approach to staff relations will perhaps discover your real motives; as the high standards of service that British Airways prides itself on are allowed to dwindle away in the pursuit of lower costs. Again, shame on you Mr Brown and Lord Adonis for choosing to be so ill-informed regarding the real reasons for our dispute, and equally for buying into that same myth for your own political ends. The general election is due to be called on one of our strike dates and in a moral panic, without even bothering to look beyond the headlines and find out what really this is all about, you both leapt enthusiastically and cynically on the bandwagon of criticism. After thirteen years in power you both finally choose to face down and condemn &quot;union power&quot;. \u00a0Except you got it wrong; this is not a hotbed of irresponsible left- wing militants trying to bring down an airline, but a predominantly female, professional and loyal, family orientated, middle England and middle class workforce, desperately trying to save it. So bravo chaps. And the worse thing? You all know this, but it suits your different aims to allow decent, hard working, caring people to be falsely demonized in this way. We know the good job that we do for our airline, and our customers appreciate the way we look after them; we don&apos;t want to strike nor do we want to inconvenience a single customer, but we feel that we have been left with no other way to get our voices heard. The campaign against cabin crew is helping British Airways to adopt a service style synonymous with our current cheerless CEO. We don&apos;t want that; we want to be proud to do the job that we love. \u00a0We want to be able to say, &quot;yes we can&quot; and &quot;hope you enjoyed your flight&quot;, not spend the whole flight apologising for ill thought through cost cutting measures. We want to come to work without fear and with pride once again. We firmly believe that it is cabin crew who truly fly the flag for our airline - and yes, with a smile, not a sneer. Sincerely, British Airways Cabin Crew   11.22am: Are you planning to travel with BA next weekend? If you are please share your experiences. What&apos;s it been like getting information from the company? Have you been forced to switch airlines? Have you tried claiming insurance? Please let us know in the comments section below, or email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk.  11.34am: The Tories are really putting the boot into Labour over the strike and the party&apos;s links to Unite. Michael Gove, the shadow education secretary and the party&apos;s election strategist, says the union represents a new &quot;militant tendency&quot; within Labour. In his speech he says:   The union behind the strike is Unite, the man behind Unite is Charlie Whelan, and yet Gordon Brown has failed to take the steps which are within his power to demonstrate that he wants this strike to stop.  Gove also details more of the party&apos;s links with Unite and other unions:  Jack Dromey, Unite&apos;s deputy general secretary and husband of Harriet Harman, has been selected in the safe seat of Birmingham Erdington. And John Cryer, one of Unite&apos;s political officers, has been selected in the safe seat of Leyton and Wanstead But this is just the tip of iceberg of a new militant tendency in the next generation of Labour MPs. Ten prospective parliamentary candidates work for trade unions, including the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, Ian Lavery, an open admirer of Scargillism in Wansbeck; and Unison&apos;s regional officer Lilian Greenwood in Nottingham South. And all told, 59 Labour PPCs are members of Unite, 27 are members of the GMB and 19 of Unison.    In a slicker corporate video Willie Walsh says BA has done everything in its power to reach an agreement with the union.             12.06pm: BA and Unite are playing out their dispute on YouTube. BA cabin crew are &quot;amazing heroic people,&quot; a passenger tells Unite&apos;s YouTube channel.             12.24pm: Andy Sparrow on that Tory party press conference:   Basically, it was an attempt to identify Charlie Whelan as public enemy number one. Gove said Whelan was &quot;unleashing the forces of hell on families who want to get away this Easter&quot;.  Whelan has hit back on Twitter.  Very proud of all the unite staff and members involved in unite4labour. The pathetic Tory attack shows what a brilliant job you are doing.   12.59pm: The Guardian&apos;s transport correspondent Dan Milmo says the prospects for a strike are &quot;in the balance&quot;. But why aren&apos;t Willie Walsh and Tony Woodley currently at Acas?  1.06pm: We&apos;ve been getting some mixed reaction from BA ticket holders. Sandra has been looking forward to seeing her family in the Philippines, via a flight to Hong Kong. She emails:\u00a0  So far I have more up-to-date information from newspapers than I have from BA.\u00a0I booked my holiday to the Philippines and Hong Kong in November 2009. I haven&apos;t seen my family in three years and I saved money religiously for the ticket. Now this has happened I don&apos;t have the luxury to simply look for another flight or rebook at another date.\u00a0I&apos;m supposed to fly on 28 March but we won&apos;t know for sure until 22 March whether we will fly or not. Despite BA&apos;s attempt to fly 60% of customers - I fall under that 40% who has a strong chance of not flying. Three flights to Hong Kong and it is ours that is likely get cancelled if this weekend is anything to go by. The worse part is that the main flight to Hong Kong is with BA and from Hong Kong to Manila is with Cathay Pacific - so we have to cancel them all.\u00a0I would like some certainty about this whole situation. People like myself who worked hard (two jobs) to save to go see my family and then not knowing whether I will see them - only to be offered a refund and no other news other than wait till the 22nd.\u00a0I am normally sympathetic to the unions but I think they are unreasonable about the reality of the economic climate.\u00a0  My colleague Lars Eriksen, our Copenhagen stringer, has had better luck:  I was booked to fly with BA from Heathrow to Nice on 28 March. The re-book option on the BA website wouldn&apos;t let me change my booking to the Nice flight departing from London City airport on the same day.  However, when I got through on the phone this was re-booked without any problems (despite the London City flight costing an extra \u00a3200). They also allowed me the option of changing back to the Heathrow departure in case the second wave of strikes is cancelled.  Pretty decent customer service - if you can manage to get through on the phone.   1.16pm: Passenger Oscar Fernandez faces disruption this weekend but his sympathies lie with Unite and cabin crew. He emails:   My wife and I are flying BA this weekend. Fortunately this time, it&apos;s for an uncomplicated holiday and we&apos;re not fussed. Unlike Christmas, where we feared the strike would cost us \u00a32000+ pounds worth of tickets to and around Colombia which we had booked independently of our BA flight. So this time we&apos;re taking it in our stride. Worst case scenario - we&apos;ll be stuck in New York for an extra few days. But we&apos;re visiting friends. Now, you may ask, why, after the December &apos;scare&apos; we continue to fly BA. Well I must agree with the BA cabin crew letter (see 11.15am) because they devote themselves to the job and make it worthwhile flying BA even when you&apos;re stuck in &apos;cattle&apos; class. And another line of sympathy for the strikers: it wasn&apos;t them who privatised British Airways, was it? It was the politicians and their greedy bank friends who handed it over to private management whose only concern is to squeeze the last drop out of any business.  The result? Millions of pounds in losses over the last two years due to poor vision and strategy (only thing for Mr Walsh is that others like JAL made the same misjudgements). And it&apos;s now the employee&apos;s fault? Give me a break!   1.22pm: Unite has reached a settlement ... but only in its separate dispute with Milford Haven Port Authority.  1.27pm: Here&apos;s the latest statement from Unite:  Unite is ready to meet BA. But the company needs to put its offer of last week back on the table. If BA thinks that strikes are going to be avoided with a worse offer, the company is conning the travelling public.  The company is still trying to bully and bludgeon its way through this. We need a serious approach to addressing cabin crews&apos; concerns. Our representatives on the ground are confident the strike will have overwhelming support among cabin crew, despite the company&apos;s bullying and harassment, which risks poisoning the atmosphere on BA flights for years to come.  The latest from BA and Willie Walsh is that the strike is a &quot;cynical attack&quot; on passengers travel plans.  Walsh says:   Due to the numbers of cabin crew who have called in to offer their services over the weekend, the schedule will be slightly larger than we had originally anticipated.  Despite the desire of Unite&apos;s leadership to ground the airline, the flag will continue to fly. Around 60% of our customers will be able to fly as planned and many thousands more can be rebooked onto alternative BA flights or onto rival airlines.  I recognise the frustration of customers booked for travel from 27 March onwards, when the second stoppage is due to begin, and we will do all we can to give them more clarity about their specific flight number once we start to understand just how many cabin crew are willing to work as normal.  We remain absolutely determined to search for a sensible settlement and our door remains open to Unite, day or night. It is not too late for the Unite to call off this action and we will do all we can to reinstate some of the cancelled flights.    2.09pm: Dan Milmo has ominous news for passengers still hoping for a resolution. He understand that British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (or Bassa the cabin crew branch of Unite) have been making practical preparations for a strike. This includes booking a venue near the perimeter of Heathrow which will operate as strike HQ.  2.11pm: More passenger emails. Mark Spiers has a ticket to Chicago on the first day of the strike and is due to return to the UK on the third day. He&apos;s looking forward to racking up some air miles.  You might think it would be best to avoid BA but they have already promised the 777&apos;s will all go this Saturday from T5 and whilst\u00a0my flight will have less crew than normal I am quite excited. BA always\u00a0employ a\u00a0major charm offensive around a crisis and I am sure this one will be no different, who knows I might get some airmiles for my trouble!   Will is hoping to fly American Airlines to New York from Manchester after a a BA flight to Heathrow. He&apos;s been getting mixed messages from both airlines.  American Airlines refused to make any changes most of yesterday, saying it was BA&apos;s problem to sort out any segment which BA wouldn&apos;t deliver. \u00a0 Before 5pm BA&apos;s position was that my flight might not be cancelled. \u00a0 \u00a0After 5pm (when their own website said it would be) their position was that they can&apos;t touch an American Airlines booking, they have no access to change it, and only American Airlines can do so. American Airlines said their computers were still showing my flight as running (even though BA.com said it wasnt). \u00a0They said they couldn&apos;t make free-of-charge changes until their computer updated to agree that the first segment had been cancelled by BA. \u00a0 \u00a0But how long is the general public supposed to wait around for that to happen? \u00a0They were also still maintaining that it should be BA trying to rebook me and not themselves. It wasn&apos;t till 7pm that American (whilst still saying the computer maintained the flight was still operating) agreed to rebook me Manchester to Chicago O&apos;Hare, to New York La Guardia. \u00a0  When I asked why I couldn&apos;t be transferred to the one remaining MAN-LHR (at 7am) they told me &quot;if any flight is cancelled due to strike, they will all be cancelled&quot;). \u00a0 Again, that&apos;s not what the BA website was saying. \u00a0 When I insisted they told me, &quot;actually sir, that one is now full&quot;. \u00a0 \u00a0Well of course it was now full because all of BA&apos;s own passengers had been hastily booking themselves onto it automatically through the BA website and call centre, \u00a0whilst I&apos;d been waiting for American to catch up!  For two companies which work every day together, and who are always talking about trying to get approval to formally merge, and who have mutually paying customers who rely on them both to function and cooperate, they seem totally incapable of doing so. \u00a0 I would dearly love to get some sort of official comment out of the both of them as to how they can be so disorganised and seem to leave all the running around to the end customer to sort out.   2.48pm: Some people are never happy. Nick Kidd&apos;s holiday on a Caribbean island looks likely to be extended because of the strike, but he wants to get home. His flight on Sunday from Turks and Caicos to London has been axed and one the following week also looks doubtful. &quot;You would have thought this would be the last flight BA would want to axe as there is only one a week,&quot; Kidd told PA. &quot;There are families with young children out here and no one knows how they are going to get home. There is an American Airlines&apos; flight from here to Miami but I&apos;ve got a lot of equipment with me and I don&apos;t want to take that flight.&quot; (That&apos;s it from me. My colleague James Sturcke is about to take over. Thanks for all your comments and emails, please keep them coming.)  3.25pmIt&apos;s unconnected to the cabin crew dispute, but BA this afternoon announced it had moved closer to agreeing a union deal over its \u00a33.7bn pension deficit. If they can get around a table about that, why not with the cabin crew? BA says:  &quot;British Airways has concluded consultations with its joint trade unions on the future benefits of its defined benefit pension schemes. This is an important step forward in the process of addressing the pension deficits which the trade unions will be recommending to their members. The new benefit structure will be proposed to the trustees and form part of the negotiations towards a recovery plan that is expected to be presented to the Pensions Regulator by June 30. The proposals are intended to avoid the closure of the pension schemes and maintain British Airways&apos; contributions at the current level of \u00a3330m per annum.&quot;  Under the main proposal, pension scheme members can receive lower future benefits and keep their current levels of contribution or opt to pay an extra 4.5% to maintain their existing pension benefits.  3.30pmI don&apos;t know if you receive the same Google ads on your screen as I get on mine, but here are the ones I&apos;ve got.

BMI, which flies from Heathrow to Aberdeen, Amsterdam (only until 28 March), Belfast, Cairo, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jeddah, Manchester, Moscow and Riyadh, says it&apos;s trying to secure larger aircraft and more flights in anticipation of high demand. And there&apos;s exciting news for BA silver and gold executive card holders:  bmi will do all it can to assist BA customers who are caught up in the dispute. bmi is currently upgrading flights to larger aircraft and looking at adding additional frequencies. What&apos;s more BA Silver and Gold Executive card holders flying with bmi will be offered access to the bmi lounges including - The Great British lounge, bmi&apos;s flagship international lounge at London Heathrow.   4.50pmBrand Republic reports it&apos;s a good day too for Virgin Atlantic:  Virgin Atlantic is to fly the England team to the Fifa World Cup in South Africa, having been appointed as the Football Association&apos;s official airline supplier.   5.25pmThe Tories are continuing to make hay out of the links between Unite and Labour. They have published a document called Charlie Whelan&apos;s New Militant Tendency. The document claims:  - Unite has spent more than \u00a3460,000 directly funding 148 seats being contested by Labour at the next election.  - Gordon Brown and 12 other cabinet ministers have been funded to the tune of \u00a333,000. Jim Knight received the most at \u00a36,560 while John Denham had to make do with \u00a3277.38. Brown got \u00a31,000. The Mail calls it &quot;an extraordinary dossier&quot; while Whelen labelled it &quot;a pathetic Tory attack&quot;. Here&apos;s my colleague Andrew Sparrow&apos;s write-up.  That&apos;s it for today&apos;s live blog. But be rest assured - there&apos;ll be plenty of coverage of strike developments in the coming days.", "sentences": ["BMI, which flies from Heathrow to Aberdeen, Amsterdam (only until 28 March), Belfast, Cairo, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jeddah, Manchester, Moscow and Riyadh, says it&apos;s trying to secure larger aircraft and more flights in anticipation of high demand."], "title": "BA strike build-up: live updates", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/mar/16/ba-strike-build-up-live", "tags": ["British Airways", "Trade unions", "Gordon Brown", "Air transport", "UK news", "Travel", "Unite"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-16T22:00:03Z", "article": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has identified the 18-year-old Ajax attacking midfielder Christian Eriksen as an Arsenal star of the future, although the manager may have to bide his time before he can conclude a deal for the Dane. Wenger has received glowing reports on the player, who made his debut for Denmark as a substitute in the 2-1 friendly defeat by Austria two weeks ago, not least from Dennis Bergkamp, the former Arsenal striker who is a youth coach at Ajax. Wenger&apos;s attention may have been encouraged by Eriksen&apos;s contractual situation: he is on a low-paid youth-team deal which expires next year. The Frenchman may also have considered Ajax&apos;s worrying financial position: the Amsterdam club has incurred heavy losses and will have to raise funds in the transfer market this summer. Eriksen, though, appears set to sign a new, more lucrative longer-term contract and says he remains happy at Ajax. Under Martin Jol, the former Spurs manager who took over at Ajax last summer, the teenager has been playing first-team football, although his recent appearances have been on the left flank, rather than in his preferred No10 playmaker&apos;s role. Eriksen is small but he has good vision, dribbling skills and an incisive final pass. Jol has likened him to the Dutch internationals Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart. &quot;I have to be very wrong if this player will not become a good, a very good or a top player,&quot; Jol has said. Several other leading clubs have shown an interest in Eriksen, including Chelsea, whose sporting director Frank Arnesen, as an ex-Ajax and Denmark player, knows all about him. There is debate in Denmark as to whether Morten Olsen, the national team manager, ought to name Eriksen in his squad for the World Cup finals in South Africa.", "sentences": ["The Frenchman may also have considered Ajax&apos;s worrying financial position: the Amsterdam club has incurred heavy losses and will have to raise funds in the transfer market this summer."], "title": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger targets Ajax's Danish youngster Christian Eriksen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/16/arsene-wenger-christian-eriksen-arsenal-ajax", "tags": ["Arsenal", "Premier League", "Football", "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-18T22:50:01Z", "article": "&quot;I don&apos;t know much about you,&quot; says Peter Greenaway, sipping his mint tea, &quot;but I do know two things. You were conceived, two people did fuck, and I&apos;m very sorry but you&apos;re going to die. Everything else about you is negotiable.&quot; Negligible, too. For Greenaway, there&apos;s sex and there&apos;s death and &quot;what else is there to talk about?&quot; He believes, he continues, as relaxed as if predicting rain tomorrow, &quot;that all religion is about death and art&apos;s about life. Religion is there to say: hey, you don&apos;t have to worry \u2013 there&apos;s an afterlife. Culture represents the opposite of that \u2013 sex. A very stupid Freudian way of looking at it, but one is positive and one is negative. Especially against people like you. All religions have always hated females.&quot; Steam billows up from the cup into his face. He looks half David Attenborough, breath fogging the lens as he explores the Arctic (he has the same energy, the same gleaming curiosity), half Chris Tarrant, emerging from a cloud of dry ice. We&apos;re in a cafe on a grand, damp square in Amsterdam; Lady in Red on a loop, sausages on the menu. Greenaway, 67, lives nearby with a theatre director called Saskia and their two young children \u2013 he also has couple of grownup daughters from a previous marriage to Carol, a potter. Looming opposite is the Rijksmuseum, of which Greenaway has just given me a first-class tour, embracing the role with relish: rolling his r&apos;s, spitting his t&apos;s, hammering great deep cleaves between each syllable. Tourists stop and goggle, not necessarily at the Vermeers. We wound up at The Night Watch, Rembrandt&apos;s musket-heavy canvas and the subject of Greenaway&apos;s latest film, Nightwatching. It&apos;s a sort of Renaissance-era CSI (a show he admires; he&apos;s also a Midsomer Murders fan) investigating the puzzles in the painting itself and the mystery of the artist&apos;s sudden fall into virtual penury. Martin Freeman plays Rembrandt: oddly plausible and often nude. In fact Nightwatching is rather more conventional than much of his back catalogue. It&apos;s an easily digestible examination of \u2013 yep, sex and death \u2013 and Greenaway&apos;s other key concerns: painting, snobbery, conspiracy. It&apos;s the latest in an ongoing project to unpick nine art masterpieces through movies and attendant installations. He&apos;s already knocked off The Last Supper and The Marriage at Cana (&quot;Which I think is the wedding of Christ&quot;). The motherlode is Michelangelo&apos;s Last Judgment. Talks, he says, are underway with the Vatican. The Night Watch, he reckons, is the first work of real cinema, on account of Rembrandt&apos;s manipulation of artificial light. Though were Rembrandt around today, &quot;he would have been shooting on holograms. He would be post-post-James Cameron.&quot; He shakes his head. &quot;All really worthwhile artists, creators, use the technology of their time and anybody who doesn&apos;t becomes immediately a fossil.&quot; In Greenaway&apos;s case, that means moving towards &quot;feature film as essay. Like Montaigne. It&apos;s much more discursive. It doesn&apos;t hang on to a psychological narrative and it&apos;s not impressionistic. I don&apos;t want to take you anywhere. It&apos;s not a piece of escapism.&quot; At 67, Greenaway is no longer interested in cinema per se \u2013 it&apos;s a half-dead medium wasted by taking its cues from books, &quot;telling bedtime stories for adults. Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are illustrated books. Not cinema. I want to be a prime creator. As every self-regarding artist should do.&quot; He believes cinema needs to figure out a way to get out of the dark (&quot;Man&apos;s not nocturnal&quot;), get rid of the frame, and the camera, too. &quot;We have a cinema of what we see, not what we think.&quot; Until that happens, though, he&apos;s still making films. And still, apparently, enthused by their possibilities. He talks as much about two other films he has in the pipeline as he does Nightwatching: one about Eisenstein losing his virginity in Mexico, another \u2013 &quot;my first, real, dyed-in-the-wool pornography&quot; \u2013 about a 17th century Dutch engraver. He fishes a postcard from his blazer pocket. It&apos;s another Rijksmuseum highlight, this time by Hendrik Goltzius. &quot;Here you can see Lot and his two daughters; this is a few minutes before they fuck him in order to produce a continuation of the human race.&quot; Why does he do so much? &quot;Maybe it&apos;s a hunger. A horror of the empty space. Without wishing even remotely to impress you, I&apos;m involved in 26 projects at the moment all over the world. It&apos;s a glorious opportunity to practice being an artist.&quot; Greenaway is an incurable self-promoter, forever ready with a barrage of stats about how many people he VJ&apos;d in front of in Gdansk, or have seen The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover. There will always be, he says, &quot;people who travel thousands of miles to see a Greenaway film. And I&apos;m still painting \u2013 I&apos;ve got a big exhibit coming up in Milan soon. And that&apos;s even more private.&quot; Yet it is on show to the public? &quot;Yes. Well, do you think a person who keeps a diary keeps it for himself? Anybody who writes a diary insists it must be read by someone else. So if I&apos;m making very private films I want people to see them; of course I do.&quot; There&apos;s a soreness beneath the swagger. In England, at least, Greenaway must be his own cheerleader. He&apos;s come under attack from his peers; even some of his defenders qualify their praise. He&apos;s also had a rough write-up in a lot of interviews. He suggests various explanations: because he&apos;s a jack of all trades, not a specialist. Because he&apos;s not Oxbridge. Because the English are &quot;textually minded \u2026 and so those who practise the image are regarded as not kosher.&quot; He cites an ally in undervaluation: RB Kitaj, another artist of ideas. &quot;He had a big exhibit in Tate 10 years ago and he was absolutely excoriated by people like you because he did your job so much better than you can. He understood it so much more than you did.&quot; He&apos;s happy in Holland. He likes the lack of snobbery, the openness, the freedom. &quot;For a long time now they&apos;ve been able to talk about homosexuality, abortion and euthanasia at the breakfast table. Elsewhere people turn away in embarrassment or run for the hills.&quot; He is, he says, planning to take advantage of the freedom afforded and kill himself when he&apos;s 80. &quot;My youngest daughter will be 21 so I can see her to full adulthood. Why would it be sad? I&apos;ve got 14 years left. They say the most valuable thing about death is that you never know when it&apos;s going to happen. But I think this a curse. I think if we knew we&apos;d make much better use of life.&quot; To some extent, this suicide plan is another example of his eagerness to be at the cutting edge \u2013 &quot;I think very soon we&apos;re all going to have to seriously discuss compulsory euthanasia.&quot; But it&apos;s also nobler. He&apos;s an ideas man to the end, who&apos;s keen to put them into practice \u2013 and not just in film. He has a genuine sense of responsibility.  &quot;I&apos;ve had a fantastic life and I&apos;m still enjoying it and am an extremely happy man, but there has to be a trade-off somewhere. I&apos;m a Darwinian. All I can think is that we&apos;re here to fuck, to procreate. And we&apos;re incredibly focused towards it. All our literature and television is pushing us towards it. But I passed on my genes a long time ago, so I have to justify my place in the human race some other way.&quot; You may have to cook up a purpose in life for yourself &quot;since we&apos;ve thrown away God and Satan and Freud&quot;, but he&apos;s evangelical about the necessity of doing so. &quot;I&apos;m not here to play tiddlywinks and I don&apos;t think you are either.&quot; He&apos;s off soon after, striding across the square in his thick pinstripes, booming into his mobile, bursting to crack on with those 26 projects while he&apos;s still got the time. \u2022 Nightwatching is released on 26 March. Peter Greenaway will be taking part in a Q&amp;A for Nightwatching at the ICA in London on 28 March. \u2022 This is a longer version of the interview published in Film&amp;Music.", "sentences": ["We&apos;re in a cafe on a grand, damp square in Amsterdam; Lady in Red on a loop, sausages on the menu."], "title": "Peter Greenaway's pact with death", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/18/peter-greenaway-nightwatching", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Peter Greenaway"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-03-19T16:53:44Z", "article": "English rugby fans travelling to Paris this weekend will be greeted by a Nike advertising blitz featuring the word &quot;Hello&quot; stitched over a fresh wound.

The lineup: Don Pepijn Schipper (music, vocals). The background: Today&apos;s new artist is brought to you out of a sense of responsibility. It is our duty to report on him \u2013 less because we feel an urgent need to communicate his brilliance, but because his achievements are so undeniable. Not that we&apos;d ever heard of him, which probably says as much about our own need to explore his world as it does about the way you can be massive in one area these days and still be a total unknown elsewhere.  Don Diablo, then. He&apos;s Dutch, although his stage surname means &quot;devil&quot; in Spanish. He&apos;s one of those furiously busy types: a producer, songwriter, artist and DJ who also makes music for movies and TV ads, runs two record labels, directs his own music videos, and is an ambassador for Dance4Life, an &quot;international UN-supported action campaign to fight back against HIV and Aids&quot;. Since signing his first record deal at 15, he has released more than 70 singles in Holland, proven his A&amp;R credentials by discovering and signing Mason (who had a UK Top 3 hit with electro banger Exceeder) and remixed everyone from Public Enemy to Iggy Pop, Frankmusik to Mika. Plus, with 5.5m downloads in the past 12 months, he has been several times been named most blogged artist in the world by the music blog aggregator The Hype Machine. Oh, and just when you were starting to hate him for being so successful, you find out he was voted best dressed man by Esquire magazine, most eligible bachelor by something called Jackie magazine (which we thought had folded in 1993) and was the highest ranked Dutchman (No 15) in Cosmopolitan&apos;s 100 hottest men alive. So far, so complimentary. Then you hear his music and the praise judders to a halt. His parents might have named him after Don Van Vliet, aka Captain Beefheart, the godfather of skew-whiff avant-rock&apos;n&apos;droll, but this 30-year-old smoothie is about as un-idiosyncratic as they come. He&apos;s so straight it&apos;s almost surreal. Of the tracks from the forthcoming Exit Studio Sweatshop album, the single Who&apos;s Your Daddy? is comical electro with rock guitars and lots of bits where the words are repeated \u2013 &apos;peated \u2013 &apos;peated \u2013 like they used to have in crap 90s remixes. The exhortations to &quot;shake your honey bun-bun&quot; and &quot;feel the sweat drip from your body&quot; are like a parody of a parody. Diablo might invite you to &quot;get down and get freaky&quot; but this is no more a soundtrack to delirium and acid-dazed hallucinodelia than Wings&apos; Live and Let Die was an inducement to mass suicide. Where I Belong is so lacking in finesse it makes us think of Liam Gallagher if he went techno. It&apos;s not even brilliantly moronic, like, say, Wiley&apos;s Take That. Satellites, featuring Ish, recalls the worst of Mr C from the Shamen \u2013 it&apos;s like a lampoon of a wideboy geezer rap-techno track from an old episode of The Day Today. Never Back Down might feature a snippet of Strawberry Letter 23, but even that lustrous soul classic can&apos;t save it. Hyperactive feat Example is no better. Is that a Funky Drummer sample? Does someone use the word &quot;mofo&quot; and the phrase &quot;dropping the bomb&quot;? Is this terrible? Yes, it is. &quot;I&apos;m gonna take you back a little/Like a DeLorean.&quot; Sweet Jesus. Did Derek B die in vain? Shocking stuff. Bad meaning bad. The buzz: &quot;Don Diablo&apos;s rise from DIY beginner to global superstar has been one of the most rapid and thrilling DJ journeys of recent times.&quot; The truth: We would put his enormous success in the Low Countries down to the widely available skunk, but he&apos;s highly rated here, too. Frankly, we&apos;re flummoxed. Most likely to: Take the role of Basshunter, ie the daffy Euro DJ, if they decide to keep Celebrity Big Brother going next year. Least likely to: Create anything genuinely mind-bending. What to buy: The album Exit Studio Sweatshop is released through Sony Music Entertainment in May, preceded by the single Who&apos;s Your Daddy? on 19 April.

At his peak, Smyslov was renowned for his strategic and end- game play, and more recently he set new achievement records for a grandmaster in old age, reaching the world title semi-finals at 63 and maintaining his strength into his 70s. Yet chess was only his second career option, after he failed to become a singer with the Bolshoi Theatre. Smyslov was born in Moscow. He learned chess at six from his father, a player of master strength who once won a game from the future world champion Alexander Alekhine. The 14-year-old Smyslov was inspired to take up the game in earnest after watching the Moscow international tournament in 1935. His progress was rapid. He won the Moscow title in 1938, placed third in the 1940 USSR championship, and, most significantly, came third again in the 1941 Soviet &quot;absolute championship&quot;, behind only Mikhail Botvinnik and Paul Keres, who at that time were probably the two best players in the world. Smyslov was excused military service due to poor eyesight, and used the war years to hone his game. He came second to Botvinnik in the 1944 USSR championship, yet still lacked international recognition. The US was the dominant chess power throughout the 1930s, with four successive gold medals between 1931 and 1937 in the biennial team Olympiads. So when the US and USSR met in a 10-board radio match in 1945, the Americans were favourites. In the event, the Soviet team won 15.5-4.5, a score that included Smyslov&apos;s 2-0 victory over the four-time US champion Samuel Reshevsky. The mature style of the young Russian&apos;s wins made a big impression, especially the first game where the American was bemused by a prepared opening. After 23 moves the respective clock times read Reshevsky, one hour; Smyslov, three minutes. Third place behind Botvinnik at Groningen 1946 confirmed Smyslov&apos;s position among the elite. That year Alekhine died, leaving a vacant title, and in 1948 a five-player match tournament decided his successor. Smyslov finished runner-up to Botvinnik. He was a decade younger than his rival, and the result established him as the new champion&apos;s heir apparent. By now he had perfected an intuitive, strategic style, which relied much more on a finely tuned sense of optimum squares for his pieces than on specific calculation of variations. His opening repertoire favoured long-term plans rather than theoretical debates, exemplified by his quiet 2 Nc3 against the fashionable Sicilian 1 e4 c5 and the several in-depth defensive systems he developed against the Ruy Lopez 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5. He liked the English 1 c4 as a route to simple, clear positions and to the endgames where he had no peers. At the board Smyslov usually sat immobile, clenched hands to his cheeks. Tall and auburn-haired, he would pace the arena with a leisurely, almost stately mien. He had an individual technique, too, when moving a piece, grasping it midway down its stem rather than near the top as most players do, then placing it on its new square with a slight screwing action. The overall effect was of controlled, assured power. In 1950 Smyslov, who had a fine baritone voice, was among several hundred singers who entered a national contest for a position at the Bolshoi, failing only at the final shortlist stage. Singing remained one of his great interests and he sometimes gave recitals during chess tournaments, often accompanied by Mark Taimanov, a fellow grandmaster.     Smyslov v Botvinnik, USSR championship, Moscow 1955. Smyslov  beat his great rival in brilliant style by 1 Rd8+! Re8  If Rxd8  2 Qxa4 or Kg7 2 Qf3.  2 Qf3! Qc4 If Rxd8 3 Qf7+ and 4 Qxh7 mate, 3 Rd7! Resigns. If Rf8 4 Rxc7! Qxc7 5 Qxf8+! Rxf8 6 Rxf8+ Kxf8 7 Ne6+ and Nxc7 with an easy endgame win.     His bid for the Bolshoi helps explain why he finished only third in the 1950 Budapest Candidates tournament, but he made up for it three years later when winning the Zurich 1953 Candidates, one of the strongest tournaments of all time. From 1953 to 1958 he was in his prime, and fully the equal of Botvinnik; yet the older man held the world title for a total 13 years, as against just one year for Smyslov. The answer lay in Botvinnik&apos;s superiority in match play, in preparation, and in using the small print of championship regulations to his advantage. Botvinnik took an early lead in their 1954 series, exploiting weaknesses in his challenger&apos;s openings. Though Smyslov levelled, Botvinnik regained a narrow advantage and kept enough in hand to draw the match 12-12 and retain his title for another three years. Smyslov then won the 1956 Candidates in Amsterdam, and this time came better prepared for the championship. His strategic and endgame skills proved much superior and he won 12.5-9.5 with two games to spare. It was very different in the 1958 mandatory return match, which Smyslov began not fully recovered from a bout of influenza. Botvinnik unleashed the Caro-Kann 1 e4 c6 as an opening surprise, took a 3-0 lead and, though he tired near the finish, regained the title 12.5-10.5. They called Smyslov &quot;the winter king&quot; and his brief tenure seemed to diminish his motivation. He was still favourite for the next Candidates in Yugoslavia in 1959, where his chief rival was the dazzling new talent Mikhail Tal. Tal specialised in the calculation of complex tactics, the complete antithesis to Smyslov&apos;s mastery of positional nuances. Before they met in the first round, Smyslov declared he would punish Tal&apos;s unsound style, but it was the younger man who triumphed. Soviet officials, who preferred a Russian to the Latvian Tal as candidate, were then scandalised when the normally staid Smyslov whose wife, Nadezhda Andreevna, had stayed at home in Moscow, started a public relationship with a Yugoslav woman grandmaster that affected his play. His failure in Yugoslavia seemed to mark the end of Smyslov&apos;s career as a serious world-championship contender, but he continued to enjoy high-level success and the creative satisfaction of his artistic games. He won eight successive tournaments in the mid-1960s, with victories ranging from Havana to Hastings and Monte Carlo to Moscow. Then, to everyone&apos;s surprise, he qualified as a candidate again at the age of 62 in 1983, and was paired in his quarter-final with the West German No 1 Robert H\u00fcbner. After extra time and a 7-7 scoreline, the organisers decreed that the match should be settled by the roulette wheel in the Austrian casino hosting the match. Smyslov flew back to Moscow without waiting for the denouement, but the wheel stopped at his colour, red, and he advanced. He beat Hungary&apos;s Zoltan Ribli in fine style in the semi-final before losing, despite a tough resistance, to the rising star Garry Kasparov in the final. Smyslov continued to perform at a high level well into his 70s. Nobody of his age had ever maintained grandmaster strength, though later another durable ex-Soviet, Viktor Korchnoi, achieved similar results. In 1991 Smyslov won the inaugural World Senior (over 60) championship, and he had several impressive scores in the annual Veterans v Ladies match. By now his eyesight was deteriorating badly, so that he was virtually calculating without sight of the board. He could still fight his corner, as when David Bronstein, who had tied for second at Zurich 1953, claimed that Soviet officials had pressured himself and other Russians to arrange results to ensure that Smyslov finished ahead of the American Reshevsky. Smyslov denied any knowledge of pre-game arrangements at Zurich, and countered that Bronstein&apos;s own success in the 1950 candidates was deliberately staged when he was a point behind the leader with two rounds left and allowed to catch up. The title of Smyslov&apos;s 1979 autobiography V Poiskakh Harmonii (In Search of Harmony) referred both to his abortive musical career and to his belief that smooth interplay of the pieces was the key to practical success. Grandmasters respected his achievements as an icon of the golden age of Soviet chess and he was often invited as an honorary guest to tournaments. Smyslov and his wife of more than half a century spent their final few years in near-poverty as his heart ailment deteriorated. Nadezhda survives him. \u2022 Vasily Vasiliyevich Smyslov, chess grandmaster, born 24 March 1921; died 27 March 2010 \u2022 This article was amended on 29 March 2010.

And it has nothing to do with his mercurial talents or the millions of euros that have been lavished on them. The Barcelona striker has come to be considered an enigma on these shores, a triumph of style over substance, and supporters of the leading clubs have wondered what all the fuss is about. The conclusions have been based on more than fleeting fancy. Ibrahimovic has faced English teams no fewer than 10 times since 2002-03, with Ajax, Juventus and Internazionale, and not only has he failed to taste victory, he has failed to score. Even worse, he has cut a peripheral, often sulky, figure. In four of the past five seasons, his club has been pressed from the Champions League knockout phase at the hands of an English team. With Juventus, the pain was inflicted by first Liverpool and then Arsenal; with Inter, it came from Liverpool and then Manchester United. Ibrahimovic, however, is a long way from being the shy and retiring type. He once told John Carew that what the Norwegian striker could do with a football, he could do with an orange. In fairness to Ibrahimovic, his footwork with an orange is outrageous. Check it out on YouTube. He was in typically self-assured form on his arrival in London before the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal and his message was plain. Previous toils mean nothing. With Barcelona, everything is possible. &quot;I don&apos;t think I have performed to my best level when I have played against English teams, but always for Italian teams to play against English ones is not easy,&quot; he said. &quot;For an Italian team, the most important thing is not to concede but where I play now, it&apos;s a different philosophy. We always look to score. &quot;I think Barcelona knew what they were buying. I had five fantastic years in Italy and before that, I played in Holland. The people who know their football know the way I play. I don&apos;t think I have to demonstrate for anybody. I have won six league titles in a row so I don&apos;t know what more I have to prove.&quot; Ibrahimovic has seven titles in total. The first one came at Ajax in 2002 before the streak began. He won the Eredivisie again with Ajax in 2004 and then came Serie A twice with Juventus and three times with Inter. It is the Champions League he wants now and with Barcelona, the reigning champions, he senses opportunity. He joined the club in an eye-watering deal last summer and cost \u00a343m, with the Catalans giving Inter the \u00a317m-rated striker Samuel Eto&apos;o on top . He scored in his first five La Liga matches and, after three in his last three games, he has 18 in all competitions this season and momentum behind him. &quot;If I play well, the goals will come,&quot; he said. Ibrahimovic might have signed for Arsenal rather than Ajax when he left Malmo FF, his hometown club, in 2001. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, had a \u00a33m deal in place and Ibrahimovic was even photographed with an Arsenal No9 shirt. Wenger, though, wanted to double-check and he asked the player to turn out in a trial match. Ibrahimovic was affronted and he moved to Amsterdam. He will not be lacking motivation at the Emirates this evening. The return to Arsenal of Thierry Henry felt like a sideshow last night as Lionel Messi&apos;s devastating abilities were discussed and Ibrahimovic held court. It is unclear whether Henry will start. It was put to Ibrahimovic that Messi&apos;s talents were somewhat underrated in England before he scored in last season&apos;s Champions League final against United. Prior to that, the Argentinian had failed to score in 10 European ties against English opposition. Sound familiar? &quot;What goes around comes around,&quot; said Ibrahimovic. &quot;People talk. Leo scores in the final.&quot; Ibrahimovic has done his talking.

I&apos;m in Zaandam, near Amsterdam, standing in front of a hotel that looks like a pileup of traditional Dutch houses, all grafted together in bright greens and blues, their pediments, gables, windows and roofs pulling and pushing at my eyes. My mind is not, however, playing tricks on me. And no, this is not an April Fool. This is the Hotel Inntel Zaandam, a madcap fairytale of a building. In fact, this 12-storey structure is, for a while, hard to take in. It looks like a trick, a conjuring act, as if some maverick architect ran off to join the circus, and learned how to balance one building on top of another, possibly while riding a bike. It&apos;s a stupefying, funny, delightful building \u2013 a quirky addition to the skyline of Zaandam, capital of the Zaanstad region and a town best known (until now) for its cocoa, biscuits and Europe&apos;s first McDonald&apos;s. &quot;I didn&apos;t set out to shock,&quot; says Wilfried van Winden, chief architect of WAM, the Delft-based practice behind it. &quot;But this is, of course, an outspoken building. And the language it speaks is the architectural language of Zaanstad. It makes a big statement, sure, but the building is not an imposition \u2013 it belongs here.&quot; All the facades you see, explains the architect, are based on traditional Zaanstad houses. &quot;From a stately notary&apos;s dwelling,&quot; he says, &quot;to workers&apos; cottages.&quot; Van Winden&apos;s favourite is a re-creation, high up, of a blue house that features in a work by Claude Monet, painted during a trip to Zaandam. Funny buildings rarely come off. There was a painful period, not so long ago, when architects worldwide practised a style we learned to call post-modernism. This mostly involved the cutting and pasting of historic building details on to office blocks, shops and hotels in a puerile attempt to make big new buildings \u2013 blocky by nature \u2013 lively and entertaining, as if every town could be improved by looking like Las Vegas. The one country to hold out against this was the Netherlands. Instead, the Dutch pioneered a line of cool, calm and collected urban buildings that have long been held up as a model of modesty, intelligence and decorum. Yet there is also an exuberant tradition in Dutch architecture that has been sidelined in recent decades. One has only to think of the extraordinary housing complex in Amsterdam called Het Schip (the Ship). Built in 1917, with soaring prows, a mast-like tower and a wealth of ornamentation, it shows that Dutch architecture over the past 100 years has been a rich affair. During the last decade, new forms of neo-traditional buildings have sprouted in Dutch towns. Many are kitsch, but some are wholesome, appropriate and well handled. WAM&apos;s hotel, however, is in a class of its own; it will certainly put Zaandam on the tourist map. &quot;The best compliment I&apos;ve had,&quot; says Van Winden, &quot;is from friends who say the building makes them smile. This should be enough for any architect.&quot; Curiously, this building started out as the Golden Tulip hotel, part of a small chain, but it was bought, almost immediately, by the Inntel group, who promptly changed its name. The idea for its design came to Van Winden while he was thinking about the nature of hotels in town centres. These, he thinks, should be more like a &quot;home from home&quot; rather than concrete boxes. In the Inntel&apos;s 160 bedrooms, everyone gets to live in a little house rather than an anonymous space that, however plush, could be in Amsterdam or Auckland. Guests are already taking photographs, so they can tell friends and family: &quot;Look where I stayed!&quot; The planners said: &apos;Go for it!&apos; The hotel, which cost \u20ac15m (\u00a313.4m), rises not from some freakishly isolated site, but from a new development of traditional streets lined with neo- traditional buildings. This might not be to everyone&apos;s taste, yet these streets and buildings root the hotel in an urban flowerbed that seems all of a piece. A modern building of this size is not, of course, wholly traditional in construction. The core of the hotel is concrete, while the &quot;houses&quot; that rise up it are timber and clapboard, meaning that many of the rooms, especially the suites, really do feel like individual and even authentic houses. Cleverly, they come across as both familiar and enticingly new. The city&apos;s planners gave the hotel the green light because, although a little unusual, it fitted into the area&apos;s overall design. They were also intrigued, says Van Winden. &quot;What they said, in a way, was, &apos;If you can really build this, go for it.&apos;&quot; Van Winden founded WAM a year ago. As you might expect, his style is hard to pin down. Those who might wish to caricature him as a cartoonist or a clown will be disappointed by the refined and generous Modern housing he recently designed in Amsterdam. And for all its apparent craziness, this hotel is, at heart, a rational building, with an interior that is carefully planned. While the bedrooms are essentially modern, they&apos;re adorned with images of traditional Zaandam streetscapes, as well as colourful old adverts for Zaandam cocoa powder and biscuits, blown up to cover entire walls. Like the facades, these root the hotel firmly in Zaandam. As Van Winden says, &quot;When you wake up here, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll say, &apos;Where am I?&apos;&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 April 2010 to correct the spelling of Het Schip.", "sentences": ["I&apos;m in Zaandam, near Amsterdam, standing in front of a hotel that looks like a pileup of traditional Dutch houses, all grafted together in bright greens and blues, their pediments, gables, windows and roofs pulling and pushing at my eyes.", "One has only to think of the extraordinary housing complex in Amsterdam called Het Schip (the Ship).", "In the Inntel&apos;s 160 bedrooms, everyone gets to live in a little house rather than an anonymous space that, however plush, could be in Amsterdam or Auckland.", "Those who might wish to caricature him as a cartoonist or a clown will be disappointed by the refined and generous Modern housing he recently designed in Amsterdam."], "title": "Much of a Dutchness: the Hotel Inntel Zaandam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/mar/31/hotel-inntel-zaandam", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Netherlands", "Culture", "Travel", "Hotels", "Netherlands holidays", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-01T23:05:06Z", "article": "The year that Gerard Kleisterlee took over as chief executive of Philips, the company abruptly sank into the largest loss in its history. The Dutch firm, still best known for consumer electronics, had skirted around bankruptcy in the mid-1990s after a series of strategic blunders but recovered ground later in the decade. Then the dotcom bubble burst and the business, which was a leading player in semiconductors, went back into a downwards spiral. &quot;From a number of dimensions, 2000 had been a record year,&quot; Kleisterlee recalls, in heavily Dutch-inflected English. &quot;2001 and 2002 were also record years but in reverse order,&quot; he says with a quiet laugh. &quot;Then of course with the impairments and the write-downs on acquisitions we had done, we reported two years in a row, the biggest net income loss in the history of the company. That was my start. But from there on, it can only get better.&quot; Philips, which began as a lightbulb manufacturer in Eindhoven in 1891, has an illustrious past and has been behind some of the most significant advances in consumer technology. It brought to market the first rotary-head shaver in the 1930s and is still widely known for its Philishave brand. It introduced the first cassette tape; in 1972 launched the first video recorder, and in 1982 introduced the compact disc with Sony. The firm also played a pivotal role in developing the DVD and still gets a royalty for each disc and DVD player sold. But in recent decades, the unwieldy company has struggled to increase its revenues, along the way exiting markets including computers and recorded music with the sale of Polygram. It has also often failed to translate its world-beating technology into a commanding position in the market. &quot;We initially had a good share of the CD market, but then we moved down the path of CD interactive for example, which was basically a precursor to CD rewriteable or Playstation,&quot; Kleisterlee offers. &quot;Great technology, maybe too early, or not well positioned. So CD interactive never really made it into the marketplace as a successful application, even if the interactivity was a breakthrough in technology. That is an example of where we had the greatest technology but we were not able necessarily to turn it into the greatest market success,&quot; he says. When Kleisterlee, who trained as an engineer, began running the business, he embarked on the latest of many overhauls. Investors had become so used to Philips reshaping itself that it had become a &quot;restructuring play&quot;, he says. In a phrase that might ring familiar to workers at the BBC, he told the management board in his first big meeting as chief executive that they were &quot;too old, too male, too Dutch&quot;. Today, he says, &quot;I am the only Dutchman on the management board. I have a French chief financial officer, a German who does innovation and countries for me, an Italian is running lifestyle, an American is running healthcare and a Belgian is running lighting.&quot; The most significant decision was to sell the semiconductors business. The disposal met two aims. Kleisterlee, 63, wanted to unlock Philips from the highly cyclical semiconductors business and also to move further from components to finished products. He also quickly got out of making mobile phones, a disastrous foray by his predecessor, and now licenses the brand. BattlesAt the time, Kleisterlee says the business still regarded itself as a high-volume consumer electronics company. But much of that space has now been ceded to manufacturers from Asia and emerging markets, while margins have shrunk. &quot;We are picking our battles more and more.&quot; The company, he says, had hardly made a profit in televisions in the United States for 50 years, and now licenses its brand there, focusing instead on Europe and Latin America. The company has been refocused around three areas: consumer lifestyle, which includes televisions, shavers and electric toothbrushes; lighting, where it remains a world leader and sees growth in LED energy-saving bulbs; and healthcare, where it makes products such as CT scanners and home defibrillators. After nearly a decade of restructuring, the company has gone from 189,000 people and sales of \u20ac32bn, to 116,000 and sales of \u20ac23bn. Consumer remains the biggest part of the business but is also the part of the group that has struggled the most during the recession. It is healthcare, competing against Siemens and General Electric, where the company clearly sees the biggest potential for growth, with an ageing population in most developed markets and relatively high margins. Philips has spent \u20ac10bn on acquisitions in the past few years, much in healthcare, including its largest to date, the $5bn takeover of Respironics in 2007, a firm that treats sleep apnoea (a condition that causes people to stop breathing during the night). Kleisterlee struggles to make sense of the three divisions, talking broadly about how they all touch the consumer, and about health and wellbeing, before admitting that one can spend too much in &quot;intellectual rationalisation&quot;, and that he might be happy with what is &quot;just a nice portfolio&quot;. Among other changes, he also placed a stronger emphasis on marketing, appointing a chief marketing officer, in the hope that the business might strengthen its branding and better translate its technology into market share. The slogan \u2013 sense and simplicity, which surely owes something to Jane Austen \u2013 was introduced in 2005. Kleisterlee, an imposing business-like presence with ice-blue eyes, has much invested in making a success of the company. Not only did he join straight from national service, but his father had spent his entire career at Philips before him. Working for a large corporation, he says, gives you ample opportunities \u2013 he has worked in manufacturing, sales and run the business in Taiwan and China. But in interviews, he also points out that in post-war Europe, the emphasis was on getting a steady job for life. Doubling profits  The headquarters of the business moved from Eindhoven in 2001, and remains in a small cluster of towers in Amstel, a quiet suburb of Amsterdam. It is not yet clear whether the latest reinvention of Philips has paid off. After getting the portfolio into the shape he wanted, Kleisterlee set targets to get the business growing again. Then came the global recession, and the target of doubling profits by 2010 was abandoned. In 2009, sales were down 11% year on year \u2013 its lighting division depends heavily on the construction market, while consumer electronics was hit by the slump in consumer demand. Kleisterlee talks perhaps less with exasperation than as someone used to things not going as planned. &quot;We set a few goals for ourselves, and then comes the crisis, and we said, God, we were getting in shape and now comes the crisis and we can&apos;t show [the improvement].&quot; The share price in the past year has risen from \u20ac15.59 to \u20ac25.33, but still trades below the level when he started. But he compares Philips&apos; performance in this recession with the years after he joined and finds grounds for optimism. While Philips plunged into the red after the tech bubble burst, it still achieved profit of \u20ac424m last year in a far harsher environment. Could the firm be ready to grow after decades of stagnation? &quot;I definitely have that feeling; of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You have to unlearn a lot of things in a company that has been focused on risk containment, because so many things went wrong over past decades that almost the institutional instinct, the Pavlovian reaction, is always to focus on the downside. You have to create a culture where people are motivated to go for the upside. But I am hopeful we are getting there.&quot; The CV Born 1946, Germany Education Eindhoven Technical University, electronic engineering Career 1974-81, Philips Medical Systems, manufacturing management; 1981-86, Philips Professional Audio, general manager; 1986-94, Philips Components, industrial director; 1994-96, Philips Display Components, managing director; 1996-98, Philips Taiwan &amp; China, president; 1999-2000, Philips Components, chief executive; 2000\u201101, Philips, chief operations officer; 2001\u2013, Philips, chief executive Family Married with three children Other posts Daimler supervisory board", "sentences": ["Doubling profits  The headquarters of the business moved from Eindhoven in 2001, and remains in a small cluster of towers in Amstel, a quiet suburb of Amsterdam."], "title": "Hard-wired: Kleisterlee is reinventing the inventive Dutch firm Philips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/02/philips-chief-executive-kleisterlee-interview", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Global recession", "Business", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-02T09:22:42Z", "article": "Hello Ronald, how are you? Fine thanks, Small Talk, and you? Tremendous. Now then, who is going to win the World Cup? My favourite is Spain because they are playing the best football and they have the experience from winning the European Championships. Can Holland win it? Everything is possible in our lives but for me they are not the big favourites. The big favourites are Spain and Brazil and then you have some outstanding teams like England, Holland and Argentina. Holland have a lot of quality in midfield and in attack but in defence we need to be stronger. As you know, England didn&apos;t go to the World Cup in 1994 and it was all because of you. You should have been sent off that night in Rotterdam, yes? That was for me not the question. They had to hate the referee. He made the wrong decision to give me the yellow card. Have you bumped into Graham Taylor at all since then? No I haven&apos;t. Have you ever seen the documentary that was made in England about that match? No, but I heard a lot because when I was still a player I had to play in England and the public was not happy with me. Did that bother you? No, never. I can understand that. Holland is a small country but always have a powerful football team. Why? I think we have very good facilities for the youth in Holland. We have very good youth coaches and I think that is some of the reasons that always Holland has very good football players. If Small Talk were to go on holiday to Holland, what should we see or do? First of all you go to Amsterdam. Amsterdam is not typical Dutch in that we are open people but you can go to Volendam, that is a little place outside of Amsterdam. But if you like the sun then it is better to go outside of Holland. What is the last piece of music that you bought? It was by Marco Borsatto. It is typical Dutch. What are we talking, tippy-tappy piano, searing axe solos, what? No, it is a little bit of party music that we use in Holland. It is very good music but I like all good music: UB40, U2 and that kind of thing. Do you like to cook? When I was a player it was not normal that I would cook at home but now that I have more time, I do sometimes. I like it, I like to cook and maybe sometime I would like to have some lessons. What is your best dish? Italian pasta. What was your favourite toy as a child? [Guffaws] Not a lot because my best present for my birthday was always a ball! I played sometimes with the train that we used in Holland but not a lot. Do you still have that train? [Wistfully] No, I don&apos;t have it anymore. Would you consider buying a new train? [Chuckles] No, no, no. Do you collect stamps? No. I sort of collect watches. It started 10 years ago and then every time there was a new sports watch or new colours I tried to get it. How many do you have now? About 25 or 30. But they are cheap ones, not expensive. I just like sports watches in different colours so that when I have a blue jacket I can wear a blue watch and that kind of thing. Do you have a big watch to wear around your neck like the rapper Flavor Flav? No, no, I don&apos;t like that. If you had a chat show on television, who would you like to interview? Tiger Woods. And what would you ask him? Nothing about the story in the last few months. I am also a golf fan and for me it is always incredible that when he needs to play the best shot of the day, he can do it despite all the pressure. Do you ever watch your matches from the past? When my two boys were growing up and asking me about what I did and what kind of player I was I showed them all the matches from the European Championships in 1988 when we beat Germany in the semi-final and won the final against Russia. My kids did not know that and I showed them the video and they said &quot;Papa, in that time football was very slow and lots of passing back to the goalkeeper, it was very easy!&quot; Kids, eh? Finally Ronald, can you tell us a joke? My jokes are in Dutch and I know from my time in Spain that when I try to translate a Dutch joke it does not sound very funny. So no, sorry. Not to worry, Ronald, bye! Bye Small Talk.

Taking the stand for the first time since his second trial began just over a year ago, Khodorkovsky brandished a jar of crude oil and said state prosecutors had failed to grasp how the oil industry worked. He is accused of stealing $25bn worth of oil and laundering most of the proceeds. Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003 after defying the then president, Vladimir Putin, by funding opposition political parties. He has been in jail ever since. In 2005 he was sentenced to eight years in prison for tax evasion and he was then charged with further offences as he neared parole in what critics say is an attempt to keep him behind bars. Opening his defence, Khodorkovsky today produced two glass jars full of oil, which had been hidden under his lawyer&apos;s desk. A strong smell of petrol flooded the courtroom, prompting the judge to ask irritably: &quot;How did that stuff get in here?&quot; &quot;I see nothing amusing about flammable liquid existing in the court where there are so many people and just one door. Get rid of it,&quot; the judge, Viktor Danilkin, snapped. Khodorkovsky said the prosecution had not managed to produce any documentary evidence over the past year to show he had embezzled oil from his company, Yukos, or its subsidiaries. Showing off the jars, he said prosecutors had willfully or ignorantly confused three different concepts: crude oil, processed oil, and the right to the ownership of oil. The prosecution claims he stole 350m tonnes of oil \u2013 Yukos&apos; entire output between 1998 and 2003. Speaking from inside a bulletproof glass cage, Khodorkovsky said he could not have stolen the oil since it belonged to him. He said the judge who found him guilty of tax evasion at his trial in 2005 had agreed Khodorkovsky was the owner. The charges against him were therefore &quot;contradictory&quot; and clearly invented, he argued. Khordorkovsky added: &quot;This is just more proof of this corrupt and politically motivated process. (This trial) is because of my support for political parties and also because I had the best crude oil company in Russia.&quot; Earlier Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky&apos;s co-defendant, angrily dismissed the Kremlin charges as &quot;rotten&quot;. &quot;They are fantastic,&quot; he said. The prosecution wrapped up its case last week.The judge today rejected a petition from Khodorkovksy that he should dismiss the case. He also refused to stand down from the case \u2013 another defence demand. Lebedev had earlier insisted the judge was not fit to hear the case since he had failed to throw it out, even thought the prosecution had not managed to produce any evidence. Khodorkovsky&apos;s supporters packed the courtroom today, with his elderly mother and father also attending the proceedings. Khodorkovsky&apos;s mother, Marina, said the case against her son was entirely fictitious. &quot;He wants to give his defence, but nobody seems to be listening,&quot; she told the Guardian. The former oligarch&apos;s supporters say that Russia&apos;s judicial system is prone to political interference, with judges receiving instructions from the Kremlin in important cases as to what verdicts to give. The defence says it intends to call more than 400 witnesses over the next few weeks, including Putin, Russia&apos;s prime minister. Before his feud with Khodorkovsky Putin warmly praised Yukos for its contribution to Russia&apos;s economy. Khodorkovsky&apos;s lawyers said that if Putin refused to attend \u2013 which seems probable \u2013 Russia&apos;s paramount leader would be guilty of &quot;public cowardice&quot;. Writing in his blog, Khodorkovsky&apos;s lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, said: &quot;The very charges underpinning this years-long process \u2026 are completely incoherent: you cannot say that someone stole all of Yukos&apos;s oil while at the same time sustaining that they had failed to pay taxes on profits made from selling that same oil.&quot; He adds: &quot;The fact that major news organizations even have to pretend that what is occurring in this courtroom is somehow related to the administration of judicial affairs is an insult to the intelligence of the Russian people.&quot; The trial is being regarded as the most important test of President Dmitry Medvedev&apos;s pledges to tackle his country&apos;s &quot;legal nihilism&quot;.

The significance of a first date at the pictures with a future life partner would, for instance, tend to overshadow any rigorous analysis of onscreen events. And then of course there&apos;s the venue. Because that can make (or break) the whole experience, at its most impressive lending a night out at the flicks an entirely new dimension. Now usually, of course, said venue will be an actual cinema. If you&apos;re spectacularly lucky, it might even be somewhere like the Lafayette Theatre in tiny Suffern, New York State \u2013 an establishment recently discussed by the US film writer Glenn Kenny in an illustrated paean to what looks to be a palace of delights delightful enough to make even watching Clash of the Titans a joyous experience. &quot;One feels thrilled just sitting there before the lights go down,&quot; Kenny writes and yes, the combination of chandelier and Wurlitzer does appear more than a little magical.  We&apos;ll all have our own favourite movie houses, the ones that whether through splendour or squalor cast a spell on you even as you&apos;re bumbling your way to your seat, then keep it in place once the main attraction is under way. I&apos;ll cast my own ballots here for the wondrous juddering grothole that was London&apos;s infamous Scala during the 80s, or, with the nostalgia turned down and the taste for the finer things cranked up, the present day Apollo on Haymarket, a luxuriantly-appointed gaff that makes even the most dreary clunker a pleasure to sit through. Plus, for the sheer crazed opulence of its foyer and hallways I&apos;ll throw in Amsterdam&apos;s vast art deco temple the Tuschinski. And yet there&apos;s also a case for taking films out of the cinemas altogether \u2013 not on to our laptops, but into the properly scaled, communal world of screenings in the most unusual and offbeat spaces, all the techno-fetishism of the age of Avatar undercut by the relative ease with which a big screen with decent sound and picture can be rigged up for a grateful audience. It&apos;s a trick that in the last couple of years has been brilliantly performed by the organisers of Secret Cinema and the Summer Screen events at Somerset House, not to mention Banksy&apos;s Exit Through the Gift Shop with its debut in a &quot;pop-up cinema&quot; in a tunnel beneath Waterloo station.  Liberating movies from their conventional surroundings freshens up the very act of filmgoing \u2013 and with it whatever movie happens to be involved. Personally, while I&apos;ll always treasure Harold and Maude purely for its own sake as the finest of screen romances, I&apos;ll cherish just as much the experience of seeing it on my first ever visit to New York. I picked up a flyer with directions to a shabby diner, from where I was ushered into a dimly-lit and sparsely-decorated back room that appeared to function as a storage area, with a rickety screen that looked better suited to a slide show, set up in front of a dozen hard-backed chairs. The result was at once highly disorienting, perfectly in keeping with the film, and a thousand times more memorable than simply reaching for the Love Film envelope on top of the TV.  There again, maybe I&apos;m biased. What are, I think, my two earliest memories of filmgoing came within a few short weeks of each other. First, in the new year of 1978, my father took me to see Star Wars at what would have then been a state-of-the-art premises in Leicester Square. Staring up from my seat it was, to my five-year-old self, dizzying, deafening, a moment I knew would make me the envy of my peers back in Brighton \u2013 and beyond that, it made no impression at all. A while later, however, I went to the birthday party of one of those same peers where, after God knows how much sugar-packed 70s kids&apos; foods, a sheet was slung up in the front room, a creaking projector wheeled out, and with the wintry dusk of Hollingbury Park gathering outside, a series of Laurel and Hardy shorts were shown. We were silenced but for periodic gales of high-pitched laughter \u2013 and I was hooked. That&apos;s the beauty of cinema \u2013 sometimes you don&apos;t even need a cinema to fall for it.", "sentences": ["Plus, for the sheer crazed opulence of its foyer and hallways I&apos;ll throw in Amsterdam&apos;s vast art deco temple the Tuschinski."], "title": "The view: Magical places to watch movies | Danny Leigh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/apr/09/magical-places-to-watch-movies", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-10T23:06:13Z", "article": "David Mitchell, I&apos;m willing to wager, is the only British novelist under 50 whose work has had an academic conference dedicated to it. Taking place over two days at St Andrews last September, the David Mitchell Conference featured papers by more than 20 scholars, including such treats as &quot;Writing Inside/Out: Genre and David Mitchell&apos;s Paratext&quot; and &quot;Hypertext, Palimpsest and the Virtual Text: Tracing the Digital in David Mitchell&apos;s Ghostwritten&quot;. If you knew nothing about Mitchell other than the titles of these treatises, you&apos;d be forgiven for assuming that he is an experimental writer in the postmodern mould; that he&apos;s achingly self-conscious and (probably) insufferably earnest; and that his work singularly lacks commercial appeal. The first of these assumptions would be correct: Mitchell is experimental. But the others would all be wrong. For Mitchell, as his scores of fans know, is a long way from being the stereotype of the pretentious postmodernist and his work is anything but unreadable. In fact, in the 11 years since he announced himself with his multi-narrative first book, Ghostwritten, Mitchell has built a reputation as just about the most audacious, thrilling and, above all, entertaining young British novelist there is. He&apos;s that genuine rarity, a writer of startling ambition whose work is challenging and unconventional, yet whose storytelling gifts keep you turning the page. AS Byatt, an early fan, identifies this knack for narrative as being critical to his success. &quot;David tells a good story. He doesn&apos;t have any intention of refashioning the world, he doesn&apos;t even really have a message. His writing just gives intense pleasure.&quot; At the same time, he&apos;s an experimenter with the ability to &quot;imagine these extraordinary large structures&quot; \u2013 although she points out that &quot;he&apos;s an innovator because he wants to do something new, not because he wants to be the kind of writer who is known as experimental&quot;. Byatt&apos;s sentiments are echoed by the broadcaster John Humphrys: &quot;He is just a brilliant storyteller. Everyone seems to write big books these days. And mostly they&apos;ve become rather tedious. Mitchell&apos;s novels are long, but they don&apos;t feel it. The narrative moves.&quot; If Ghostwritten established Mitchell as a talent to watch, his subsequent efforts have confirmed him as a writer of dazzling range and impressive consistency. His second novel was the Booker-shortlisted Number9dream (2001), the story of a young Japanese man combing Tokyo for his missing father. What might have been a derivative tale of Murakami-style alienation was made distinctive by the interleaving of dream sequences and reality, so that it was never clear if what we were reading was actually happening or just taking place in the narrator&apos;s head (or, indeed, was some kind of video game). Next came the even more ambitious, Calvino-inspired Cloud Atlas (2004), a giant Russian doll of a novel featuring six linked narratives ranging dramatically in location and time. It, too, was Booker short-listed and received rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. It was also the first of Mitchell&apos;s novels to be a big commercial success, selling more than 500,000 copies in the UK after being selected for the Richard and Judy Book Club. A slimmer, more autobiographical fourth novel, Black Swan Green (2006), followed; for some, this marked a disappointing change of direction (although others pointed out that it was typical of Mitchell that he should publish what is usually a first novel \u2013 the one about growing up \u2013 fourth). Mitchell fans will no doubt be pleased that his fifth novel marks a return to boldly imaginative territory. Indeed, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet, which is published next month, may just be Mitchell&apos;s most ambitious book yet. Set in 1799, in shogun-era Japan, it describes (in gleeful, often gruesome detail) life on the small island of Dejima, a Dutch trading concession close to Nagasaki. Dejima, with its cultural intermingling, represented an intriguing early example of the clash of civilisations. Mitchell tells his story through the eyes of a young clerk, De Zoet, who gets stranded on the island when war breaks out between the British and Dutch, and who embarks on a passionate affair with a young Japanese midwife. In many ways, the most surprising thing about The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet is that Mitchell allows his imagination to rest in one place for so long. In earlier books, his narratives tended to zigzag. AS Byatt reckons that it&apos;s &quot;extraordinarily entertaining and well-realised \u2013 he really knows Japan, he really knows how they think&quot;, although, for her, the novel doesn&apos;t quite reach the heights of Cloud Atlas. So who is the man responsible for these trailblazing fictions? What gives David Mitchell the ability to inhabit so many different worlds? People who know Mitchell regularly say two things about him: first, that he&apos;s extremely private, and second, that he&apos;s extraordinarily nice and unassuming. He was born in 1969, the son of artists who moved to Worcestershire when he was seven (his father worked as a designer for Worcester porcelain). He described himself as a shy child whose middle-class background made it hard for him to fit in with the farm kids he went to school with. This social awkwardness was compounded by early difficulties with language. He didn&apos;t properly learn to speak until he was five and as a child suffered from a bad stammer. Being a stutterer makes you unusually attuned to language and Mitchell has described how, in the playground, he would think ahead to avoid words he could stammer over, coming up with posh-sounding options that would, in turn, elicit mockery from his fellow pupils. Thus he gained an early insight into the pitfalls of speech, its nuances and social gradations. Mitchell&apos;s early literary efforts consisted of poems for the parish magazine. He went to Kent University (and stayed on for an MA in postmodernism), after which he spent a while working at Waterstone&apos;s. He lived in London for a couple of years before moving to Hiroshima, where he stayed for seven years, combining working as a foreign language teacher with writing. He met his wife, Keiko, in Japan and they had a daughter before moving, in 2003, to southern Ireland, where they still live (they now have a second child). Mitchell is not a writer who in any way courts fame and he keeps himself detached from the literary scene. He conveys the impression of being almost monk-like in his dedication to writing; it is, for him, virtually a religious calling. But Mitchell doesn&apos;t work exclusively on novels; he has recently found time to write the libretto for the Dutch composer Klaas de Vries&apos;s opera WAKE, which will have its premiere in the Netherlands next month. Japan has been a huge influence, both personally and in terms of his artistic development. It has provided him with a subject but, more broadly, he has written of the appeal of being an &quot;alien among natives&quot;, of living in a society where he could never hope to fit in, where he had to &quot;kiss my sense of social belonging goodbye&quot;. This sense of detachment, Mitchell said, encouraged him as a writer; lacking a firm sense of &quot;citizenship in the real world&quot;, he had to &quot;stake out a life in the country called writing&quot;. And he has made that country an extraordinarily rich, variegated place; as one critic pointed out, his novels &quot;contain multitudes&quot;. But Mitchell&apos;s nowhere man tendencies have struck others as a limitation. He is, everyone agrees, a brilliant ventriloquist, a writer with an almost unique ability to roam between settings and inhabit a range of novelistic registers. But what, exactly, does his own voice sound like? In what was one of the few less than adulatory reviews of Cloud Atlas, the novelist Philip Hensher wrote: &quot;I still couldn&apos;t say that I could identify a page of prose as Mitchell&apos;s.&quot; The American critic Laura Miller, another Mitchell sceptic, agrees that his work has been shackled by an overreliance on aping the styles of others. &quot;The feeling with his early novels, particularly Ghostwritten, was: why am I reading a Murakami pastiche when I could be reading Murakami?&quot; Yet for his legions of devoted fans, such concerns miss the point. To them, Mitchell is the nearest thing to a magician that contemporary literature has to offer, someone whose work, at its best, has a belief-defying quality that can only be marvelled at. As Humphrys puts it: &quot;I don&apos;t quite know how he does it. Technically, I suppose a lot of his books shouldn&apos;t work, because he creates these incredibly implausible scenarios, but he always gets away with it.&quot; The good news for his fans is that Mitchell, who is still only 41, will probably be getting away with it for quite some time to come. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2010.

However not even the most cynical of travellers could have predicted that planes would be grounded today due to a volcanic eruption in Iceland.Having lain dormant for almost 200 years until last month, the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier, 120 km east of Reykjavik, erupted spectacularly yesterday. Airports are closed and flights cancelled across the UK, with the National Air Traffic Service warning the volcanic ash poses a &quot;significant safety threat to aircraft&quot;.  8.22am:  In addition to Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports being closed flights from across the UK have been affected. Here&apos;s a round up: Heathrow airport has cancelled 161 flights due to the volcano. A spokeswoman just confirmed 83 arrivals and 78 departures will not travel today, and warned the number of cancellations &quot;is expected to grow&quot;.&quot;Earlier on it was predominantly domestic flights,&quot; she said.&quot;But now it is affecting a wide range of destinations as the volcano continues to erupt and the ash moves further south.&quot;Over 100 flights to and from Gatwick have been cancelled, while a spokesman for Stansted Airport said 17 scheduled departures were cancelled and the number was likely to rise throughout the day. Meanwhile Birmingham International Airport has cancelled around 70 flights, and a spokeswoman for Luton airport has warned &quot;flights will be severely disrupted today.&quot; Some flights have also been cancelled at East Midlands and Exeter airports.  8.28am:  The Guardian&apos;s Scotland correspondent, Severin Carrell, has this:  &quot;All flights to and from every Scottish airport, including lifelineservices to Scottish islands, have been grounded by national airtraffic control services, leading to the cancellation of 250 flights.The restrictions affect all domestic flights from UK airports to Scottish airports.The only services which could still fly are military and coastguard search and rescue flights, by helicopters which normally fly at low level. Every airport in the UK is expected to be affected as the ash cloud begins spreading south-eastwards.The BBC Scotland is reporting that Glasgow airport is quiet, with many air travellers hearing messages to stay at home. The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, has been forced to cancel an election campaign visit to Dunfermline and Edinburgh this morning.From PA: The Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) at RAF Kinloss, which oversees search and rescue operations across Scotland, is co-ordinating the transfer of a patient from east Scotland to London by Royal Navy Sea King.It would not normally send a helicopter from Scotland so far south but due to the air traffic control (ATC) restrictions caused by the volcanic ash there were no civilian aircraft or military fixed wings options available.The call came in at 3.13am and the patient was taken by ambulance from Dunfermline to a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick.From there the patient will be flown to Regent&apos;s Park where the ambulance will meet them and take the patient to University College Hospital.An RAF spokesman said: &quot;If we had not taken this patient by helicopter then the only other option was a road ambulance.&quot;       Photo from Benzo.is    8.58am: Some amazing pictures emerging from Iceland of the volcano. A Flickr group has been set up, with images showing the lava spewing from the glacier, melting ice and sending steam and ash into the air. Thanks for Benzo.is for this snap. Mark Duff has emailed saying Ryanair have cancelled all flights to and from the UK today.  An update on the airline&apos;s website confirms it:  &quot;Ryanair confirms that no further Ryanair flights will operate to or from the UK today (Thursday 15th April &apos;10) from 09:00. Air space closures are likely in other Northern European countries. Cancellations and delays may also be expected tomorrow. Flight cancellations will be updated below.&quot;   9.06am:  I&apos;ve just spoken to National Air Traffic Services, which controls the UK airspace and has the power to prevent airlines from flying. A spokesman said it visibility was not the problem, rather the damage it could cause aeroplanes.  &quot;It is the affect it would have on the aircraft engines. It&apos;s a very abrasive substance and essentially it clogs the air intakes and eventually shuts them down.&quot;   9.11am:  More from Severin Carrell on the effect of the volcano on the general election campaign (I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be writing that when I woke up this morning):  The cancellation of flights has now had a severe impact on election campaigning in Scotland, for Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories, with all the main parties hurriedly trying to rearrange high profile visits from senior figures flying up from London.After the Lib Dems confirmed that a visit by Treasury spokesman Vince Cable to Edinburgh and Dunfermline had been scrapped, the defence secretary Bob Ainsworth had to cancel a visit to Rosyth dockyard to campaign for Labour&apos;s candidate and the Tories abandoned Ken Clarke&apos;s trip to the Borders.The Tories are still hoping Clarke will visit other parts of Scotland later today and are searching for alternative travel plans, but admit it will be difficult. &quot;We&apos;re trying to fire up the Quattro,&quot; said one official, referring to the 80s cop drama character Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes. The fictional detective featured in the Labour campaign poster which backfired spectacularly earlier this month when Labour tried to portray Tory leader David Cameron as the homophobic, sexist Hunt, failing to realise he was a hugely popular anti-hero.The growing disruption is also likely to force the Lib Dems to cancel tomorrow&apos;s plans to launch their Scottish general election manifesto in Shetland, the islands constituency of party leader Tavish Scott, who is also heavily dependent on air services.   9.14am:  ALL FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF HEATHROW AND STANSTED SUSPENDED FROM 12.00PM Just received the following email from a BAA spokesperson:  &quot;Due to airspace restrictions, in accordance with international regulations as a result of the on-going volcanic activity in Iceland, we anticipate that all flights in and out of Heathrow and Stansted airports will be suspended from 1200 today. Therefore, we strongly advise passengers intending to fly from this time not to travel to the airport today. We will provide further updates as we get more information from air traffic control provider NATS.   9.21am:             Sky News is covering the disruption live from various locations. This video, showing an interjection from a man wearing a hooded-top bearing the legend &quot;Hooters&quot;, is from Edinburgh airport. The Sky reporter handles it impeccably.  9.44am:  @malacara quite rightly corrects me for claiming the image below and the Flickr group I linked to are from the Eyjafjallajokull glacier.  &quot;Umm, actually, that flickr group just shows photos of the earlier eruption in Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls, which was quite &quot;touristy&quot;. This one is not this pretty and photographers can&apos;t get anywhere close to it to take snapshots.&quot;  Malacra has kindly posted a spectacular photo that is from the recent eruption, as well as an equally impressive video, which will follow. Just to recap, the cancellation of all flights from Heathrow and Stansted will cause disruption to tens of thousands of people.Heathrow alone operates 1,300 flights in and out of its five terminals a day.&quot;There is going to be significant disruption, particularly in the peak periods later on,&quot; said a spokesman.Stansted operates 400 to 450 flights to and from the airport each day. A spokesman said it was hard to say how many would be affected.&quot;Fortunately we have got past our busiest departure period,&quot; he said.&quot;But this has the potential to affect flights tomorrow and beyond, depending on how long the restrictions are in place.&quot; Not even the Great Britain Ice Hockey Supporters Club are safe from flight disruption, the Press Association reports.Around 50 members of the club, heading for the world championships in Slovenia are stranded at Stansted.  The club&apos;s merchandising secretary, Gordon McQuade, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, said a party of supporters had been due to fly out this morning.&quot;The championships are taking place in Ljubljana but we are actually flying to Trieste because ironically Ljubljana airport is closed because the runway is being resurfaced.&quot;We were due to fly out with Ryanair this morning. All we have been told is that the flight is cancelled and we are just waiting to hear what is going to happen.&quot;    10.00am:  The volcano has caused disruption across northern Europe, with all air traffic in northern Sweden suspended, affecting the cities of Skelleftea, Lulea, Kiruna and Hemavan, according to the national aviation authority. Air traffic in northern Finland was also halted. In Norway, King Harald V and Queen Sonja, who had planned to fly to Copenhagen for the Danish queen&apos;s 70th birthday, were faced with travelling by &quot;car, boat or train&quot; after the Norwegian airport operator Avinor said it was closing all commercial airspace, royal family spokesman Sven Gjeruldsen said. A canceled trans-Atlantic flight left Norway&apos;s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg grounded in New York, where he had been meeting with Norwegian businessmen. In Ireland&apos;s Ryanair has cancelled all of its flights in and out of Britain through today, but said it would try to operate some flights out of southern Ireland. The national carrier, Aer Lingus, canceled at least 40 flights in or out of Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Belfast.  10.19am:  News breaking from Associated Press: &quot;Civil aviation officials say no flights allowed in British airspace from 1100GMT due to ash.&quot; (Heathrow and Stansted had already said they would cancel flights from this time, but this news that no flights will be allowed in beyond 12pm (BST) is fresh. I&apos;ll try and get clarification on this shortly. Meanwhile Jill Insley, head of the Guardian&apos;s consumer team, was at Gatwick this morning and spoke to some passengers whose flights have been cancelled.  I spoke to a couple, Johann and Carrie Sikora, from near Ashford in Kent who were due to be flying to Verona at 12pm, for the wedding of two friends.  Carrie is the bride&apos;s bridesmaid, and Johann is the best friend of the groom. They&apos;ve been told they won&apos;t be able to get out there today, and that there&apos;ll be no flights tomorrow. With the wedding due to take place tomorrow afternoon, they&apos;re desperately trying to get the train to Verona instead. &quot;Its not really sunk in yet, but I&apos;m gutted,&quot; said Johann, however he was quite prosaic on the reasons for the cancellation.&quot;If we&apos;d missed the flight because of the traffic I&apos;d have been have been disappointed, but this morning when I turned the TV on I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.&quot; Carrie was on the phone to the bride, who said her close family were in Verona, and two friends, but the rest of wedding party, including all the groom&apos;s family, were stuck in Britain.   10.37am:  Reader Tim emails in: &quot;My son Sam (aged 8) wants to know all the science stuff, not the travel stuff - he&apos;s not interested in flight cancellations (and rightly so). So on behalf of Sam, can anyone tell me what VEI of the eruption is????&quot; Seeing as you put four question marks, I thought I should oblige. My colleague James Meikle received the following this morning from the Science Media Centre. Dr. Thor Thordarson, Volcanologist, University of Edinburgh, said:  &quot;Since the New Year, unrest in the form of seismic activity and inflation has intensified beneath the Eyjafjoll volcano in South Iceland and eruption(s) has been expected. The 20.03.2010 - 12.04.2010 event was a small basaltic fissure eruption on the lower east flanks of the Eyjafjoll volcano, whereas the one that began this morning emerged from fissures (vents) within the summit crater and extended just outside its southern rim.&quot;  Dr Dave McGarvie, Volcanologist, The Open University, said:   &quot;This wasn&apos;t unexpected because the eruption that took place last month between two ice caps has diverted off to the east and erupted again at the current site. It is essentially the same eruption which has found a new pathway to the surface. The eruption this time is coming through 150 metres of ice, melting it and pouring water down to the north \u2013 the rivers will be carrying as much water as they would in the peak of a Spring melt. &quot;The eruption can now develop in three ways:\u2022 It will melt ice, go on for a time and then die out, and nothing more will happen.\u2022 It will stimulate a larger eruption which will release a new batch of magma \u2013 this has happened in the past and is the worst case scenario. In this instance, the resulting ash cloud would disrupt international travel with flight paths being diverted.\u2022 It stimulates lava flow to come out which will melt a canyon in the ice to low lying regions. This previously happened in the ninth century.&quot;   10.50am:  Denmark&apos;s air space will close from 4pm GMT, according to Danish aviation officials. Meanwhile, the National Air Traffic Service has said the UK&apos;s airspace will be closed for 6 hours this afternoon. &quot;From midday today until at least 6pm, there will be no flights permitted in UK controlled airspace other than emergency situations,&quot; a spokesman said.&quot;This has been applied in accordance with international civil aviation policy.&quot;We continue to monitor the situation with the Met Office and work closely with airline customers and adjoining countries.&quot;  11.16am:             This video is from Eumetsat, which monitors weather and climate from space. You can see the volcanic ash drifting ominously over to the UK. My colleague Lee Glendinning has emailed to point out that the Guardian ran a piece last week on volcano tourism, which was timely. Meanwhile the intrepid David Munk, who travelled to Mount Yasur, a 350m high volcano on the island of Tanna, in the South Pacific in 2008, has some advice:  I was told by my guide on the rim of the crater that when a big explosion happened look up in the air. If a piece of lava appears to be moving it won&apos;t hit you. If it appears to be floating in the air then its coming straight at you so start running. Not suggesting that lava will rain on London - but you never know when tips like that can come in handy.  Here&apos;s David&apos;s video of Yasur erupting.  11.22am:  The seriousness of the situation has been brought sharply into focus by Conservative party leader David Cameron, who has fearlessly condemned the volcanic ash as it threatens to descend upon these fair British Isles. Cameron, on the election campaign trail in Halifax, said it was a &quot;very worrying&quot; situation.  &quot;It is very worrying news. Our first thoughts must be with the emergency services who will have lot of work to do, and with all those who were planning to travel for work or holidays who have been grounded or delayed and whose arrangements have been thrown into such a difficult situation. It does look a very worrying and difficult situation and obviously we have got to do everything we can to ease the burden on people.&quot;    11.40am:  Valur Gunnarsson, a reporter in Reykjavic, has been telling us about the situation on the ground.  We heard last night that all flights had been cancelled to northern Norway but this is the first I&apos;ve heard about the effects on the UK.  Over here, a big concern is flooding - the volcano is in the middle of a glacier. Seven hundred people were evacuated last night. The volcano has chunks of glacier to fall off and the flooding has caused infrastructure damage costing some 100m kronor.  The other big fear is that of a chain reaction with an eruption at another volcano called Katla. Lots of people went to look at the eruption and some people got stuck and had to be rescued. The Norwegian ambassador had to be rescued as our finance minister who had to be taken out by helicopter.   11.50am:      Met office projections of the plume of Ash rising from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, Iceland.

There&apos;s more on the Met Office&apos;s website on how volcanic ash forecasting works.  12.08pm:      Aircraft traffic as of 12pm (BST) - from Flightradar24.com  Photograph: www.flightradar24.com/guardian.co.uk    Picture from Flightradar24.com, where you can watch live aircraft traffic in Europe. The image shows the last few flights departing/arriving in southern England. There&apos;s more information on the picture below on Simon Rogers Datablog. Simon&apos;s also pointed out that &quot;volcanos are erupting all over the world, all the time&quot;.  He&apos;s put a link to the Global Volcanism Program, which compiles a rolling tally of volcanic activity across the globe.  12.13pm:  Hilary Osborne, editor of guardian.co.uk&apos;s money site, has very kindly sent some advice on what to do if your flight is cancelled.  If your flight is cancelled then your airline should offer you a choice: you can either cancel your booking and get a refund, or rebook on a new flight.  If it&apos;s part of a package deal, and the alternative flight the airline offers will make a big difference to your holiday, you should be entitled to cancel the whole deal and get a refund. However, if you have booked only a flight and its cancellation will mean you lose money you have spent on accommodation or transport arranged at your destination, your airline is not obliged to refund you. You will have to check your travel insurance to find out if you can make a claim. A spokeswoman for RBS says customers with insurance bought through Direct Line, Churchill and RBS will be covered, but they should contact their airline, travel company or hotel firm first to see if they are making alternative arrangements.   12.30pm:  I&apos;ve had a couple of emails asking if the ash poses a health risk, and my colleague James Meikle has been investigating. The Health Protection Agency says the plume &quot;is not a significant risk to public health because it is at high altitude&quot;.  &quot;The HPA will continue to monitor the plume&apos;s movement although is not expected to touch ground over the UK in the near future.Even if the plume does drop towards the ground the concentrations of particles at ground level are not likely to cause significant effects on health.Rainfall over the UK could cause a small amount of the ash to be deposited over the country but quantities are expected to be too small to cause health effects.&quot;  Asthma UK has seconded this, stressing that while volcanic ash &quot;can trigger asthma symptoms in people with asthma,&quot; at the moment it is too high to pose a problem. &quot;We advise people with asthma to monitor the news closely and ensure they keep their reliever inhaler on them at all times,&quot; said Cher Piddock from Asthma UK. &quot;If people are concerned about their condition, they can speak to an asthma nurse specialist on our Adviceline, on 0800 121 62 44,&quot; she added. Prof Ken Donaldson, professor of respiratory toxicology, University of Edinburgh, has also moved to allay health concerns.  &quot;Volcanic ash is on the whole not a very harmful material and the ash is currently more than 10km up in the stratosphere, where aeroplanes fly.  It will eventually dissipate by dilution in the huge air mass in the stratosphere. The risk to members of the UK public and the population of the world generally from these ash exposures is negligible.  Even people who are in the plume of volcanoes where the ash comes to earth and they wade through it like snow, show very little adverse health effects.&quot;   12.36pm:  More from Valur Gunnarsson, reporter on the ground in Reykjavic, on the flood the volcano caused yesterday:  Up to 800 people had to be evacuated from around the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in southern Iceland. The eruption comes from within a glacier and as this has melted, flooding has occurred in the surrounding area. Around one fifth of the ice in the crater is thought to have melted, so further flooding is expected as more ice turns to water. The flood headed in the direction of Highway 1, the ringroad which surrounds the island. The walls that were in place to protect the road have been damaged, but have largely held up. A newly built bridge was thought to be in danger, and so a construction crew working on a nearby harbour was ordered into action. The construction men dug holes in the highway in four different places, thereby affecting the direction of the flood. &quot;The guy on the Caterpillar really earned his pay,&quot; said Minister of Finance Steingrimur Sigfusson to Frettabladid newspaper while taking a break from the ongoing banking crisis yesterday to witness the events.    12.54pm:  I&apos;ve just spoken to a Met Office spokesman regarding the likelihood of flights resuming today. He said he would &quot;expect flights to be cancelled tomorrow&quot;. &quot;It is mainly to do with the eruption and how long it is going to be expelling the dust and ash,&quot; he said.The National Air Traffic Service has suspended flights in and out of UK airspace from 12pm until 6pm, but the Met Office spokesman said &quot;flights will probably be suspended for longer&quot;.&quot;The dust cloud will be above us through today and through tomorrow, and potentially into the weekend,&quot; he said.&quot;It depends on how much dust and ash has come from the eruption.&quot;But I definitely expect flights to be cancelled tomorrow.&quot;Her added: &quot;The only thing we&apos;ll really notice at ground level is a spectacular sunset, especially for nothern parts of the UK.&quot;  13.08pm:  One of the previous volcanoes in Iceland may have sparked the French Revolution, writes Valur Gunnarsson, reporter in Reykjavic:  This may not be the first time in history that a volcano in Iceland affects the rest of Europe. The largest to take place on the island so far happened in 1787. Some historians suggest that this led to crop failures all over Europe, leading to the French Revolution in 1789.  It was the Laki volcano that erupted in 1787. Abel Covarrubias has written about this on his blog: &quot;After several years of extreme weather in Europe caused by the Laki eruption, the ensuing destruction of crops and livestock brought famine and poverty that built up in France, triggering the Revolution which began in 1789.&quot;  1.19pm:  We&apos;ve had a few questions on Twitter as to why planes cannot take off from the UK heading south \u2013 seeing as the ash is making its way down from the north.  Hopefully this Guardian graphic helps to show how much of the ash is already over the south of England. The image from the Met Office (see 11.50am) also shows how the ash is covering the country (all be it at a very high altitude). For clarification on that diagram, the red lines indicate ash at 20,000ft, green show the movement of ash at 20,000-35,000ft and blue is ash between 35,000-55,000ft. Charles Arthur&apos;s piece on just how damaging volcanic ash can be for planes should also explain why so much caution is being taken. The National Air Traffic Service told me earlier that it was not just the risk of planes crashing that led to its decision to suspend traffic in and out of UK airspace, but also the damage that could be caused to aircraft over a longer term of 2-3 years.  1.34pm:  Brussels airport has just cancelled all outgoing flights due to drifting volcanic ash, according to Associated Press.The airport&apos;s website has actually crashed, but apparently it was reporting flights are cancelled throughout today. Passengers have been told no planes will depart.  1.53pm:  With flights to Scotland from elsewhere in the UK off limits, it seems people have been turning to road and rail. The Guardian&apos;s transport correspondent Dan Milmo has emailed me this from National Express, whose coaches are fully booked today following the cancellation of flights.   National Express coach services to / from Scotland and London Heathrow are full today (15 April).Extra coaches have been added to the network for tomorrow and more coaches will be added to cater for the required demand.National Express also operates coaches to and from all major airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, East Midlands, Bristol and Luton.All National Express coach services are operating as normal.   Meanwhile a spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies confirmed train companies are experiencing &quot;an increase in demand&quot;.  &quot;It&apos;s deeply regrettable that the cloud of volcanic ash is causing disruption to people&apos;s travel plans. &quot;Train companies are experiencing an increase in demand as air passengers shift to rail services.  &quot;Where it&apos;s possible, operators are looking into what can be done to provide extra services to help stranded air passengers to get around the country as quickly and easily as possible.&quot;   2.02pm:  Blog readers concerned that eight-year-old Sam&apos;s thirst for knowledge (see 10.37am) has gone unquenched can relax. The Guardian&apos;s environment correspondent, David Adam, has kindly supplied a piece explaining volcanic eruptions: &quot;Volcanic eruptions and ash clouds explained&quot;  Magma usually lies as pressurised pools of molten rock deep beneath the Earth&apos;s surface. During an eruption it rises. This drops the pressure and gas dissolved in the magma starts to emerge and forms bubbles, just as it does in champagne when a cork is released. The bubbles cause the magma to froth violently and burst out as a volcanic eruption. When the boiling fragments of liquid magma hit the cold air they freeze into individual dust particles, driven upwards towards the high atmosphere by the power and heat of the eruption. As the turbulent torrent rushes out it rips and pulverises rocks from the volcano, adding to the growing cloud of ash.   2.16pm:  More from David Adam&apos;s volcanic piece:  The dust can also help reduce global warming. The effect of the Iceland ash cloud will be small but larger eruptions help to cool the planet as they reflect sunlight back into space. The 1815 eruption of Mt Tambora in Indonesia produced so much volcanic ash that it triggered the &quot;year without a summer&quot; that brought widespread failure of harvests across Europe, famine and economic collapse.  The &quot;year without a summer&quot; was mentioned in Lord Byron&apos;s poem Darkness. I know that because of this tweet:  RT @will_tooke: @qikipedia &apos;The bright sun was extinguished, and thestars Did wander darkling in the eternal space&apos; Lord Byron, Darkness1815 #ashtag   2.36pm:  No flights will be allowed in or out of the UK until 6am tomorrow &quot;at the earliest,&quot; the national air traffic service has said. Here&apos;s the full statement which has been posted on Nats website:  The cloud of volcanic ash is now spread across the UK and continuing to travel south. In line with international civil aviation policy, no flights other than agreed emergencies are currently permitted in UK controlled airspace.  Following a review of the latest Met Office information, NATS advises that these restrictions will remain in place in UK controlled airspace until 0600 tomorrow, Friday 16 April, at the earliest. We will review further Met Office information and at 2000 today (local) we will advise the arrangements that will be in place through to 1200 tomorrow. We continue to work closely with airports, airlines, and the rest of Europe to understand and mitigate the implications of the volcanic eruption.   Countries across northern Europe have now closed their airspace. Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol Airport says Dutch airspace will close at 6pm (BST). The airport says on its website that air traffic to and from the Netherlands will be scaled down in the coming hours and will be shut down entirely from 7pm (6pm BST). &quot;I can&apos;t say how long it will last. As long as necessary,&quot; Marjolein Wenting of the Netherlands&apos; Air Traffic Control agency said on RTL television. &quot;This is unique for the Netherlands.&quot; Airspaces in Ireland, northern Sweden and Norway have all been closed since this morning (see 10.00am), and Denmark&apos;s airspace will be shut from 5pm BST.  3.00pm:  Nats has just announced flights to and from the UK will actually be suspended until 7.00am (BST) tomorrow, not 6am. They will review Met Office information and at 8pm today will advise the arrangements that will be in place through to 1pm tomorrow (not 12pm as earlier stated). A Nats spokesman in the UK told the Press Association earlier: &quot;No one can remember a time before when controlled airspace has been closed in the UK.&quot;This is certainly one of the most significant instances of flight restrictions in living memory.&quot;&quot;We certainly do not think we have over-reacted. Safety is our main priority and volcanic ash is a serious threat to aircraft.&quot;  3.19pm:  Time for some emails. David Hickmott has sent this:  &quot;I&apos;m half hoping for mushroom cloud-esque, apocalytpic darkness. Possible rain of fire. Will I be massively disappointed when London just looks a tad hazy?&quot;  Yes, I&apos;m afraid you will be disappointed. This is from James Neill, who has spotted a little plane on Flightradar:  So just what is so special about this lonely little Cessna stillflying over London?? Call sign TWF63 = G-JBIS = a Cessna 550 Citationhttp://twitpic.com/1frbfg  Liz Bury has also been in touch:  Do you know if there&apos;s any suggestion, or evidence to suggest, that this eruption is linked to climate change?  Can anyone help James and Liz? Meanwhile, four of this weekend&apos;s Carnegie Challenge Cup ties involving French sides are under threat due to the ash, and Great Britain&apos;s preparations for the ice hockey world championships in Slovenia have also been hit following the volcanic eruption.  The squad were due to fly out of Gatwick Airport tomorrow morning before playing the opening game of Division One Group B against Croatia at 1pm on Saturday. My colleague Helen Pidd, who is trying to get to Berlin, emails to say she has been thwarted in her attempts to travel by Eurostar. They are full, and she was only able to get on one at 8am tomorrow. In other Guardian-employee-related-travel-news, my own flight from Gatwick to the Isle of Man, booked for 7:35pm tomorrow, is in the balance. Why not send your travel woes? Email: adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or Twitter: @adamgabbatt  3.41pm:  Lots of emails waiting for me upon my return from an (unsuccessful) Kit Kat-buying trip. Don&apos;t worry Liz Bury, it seems the eruption is not linked to climate change: Roy Allen writes:  There is absolutely no possible causal link between volcanic eruptions or earthquakes and climate change.Zero. Nada, Zilch. Completely unconnected phenomena.  And from Owain Shave:  please tell Liz Bury - No , absolutley no link to climate change.Volcanoes erupt. They&apos;ve done so since the earth was formed, and willcontinue to do so long after we&apos;re gone. If you want to geek out, there is a slight seasonality to volcaniceruptions, thought to be due to loading/unloading by the weight of iceas the ice grows and retreats, but the major drivers of volcanism(plate tectonics and mantle plumes) have absolutely nothing to do withclimate change.  And not wanting to leave James Neill feeling left out, Bill Spring has emailed regarding the mysterious low-flying plane.   1. The Cessna will be flying at a few hundred feet. Commercial flights would be flying at a height of several thousand metres where the ash cloud is thicker. 2. Cessna&apos;s don&apos;t have jet engines. 3. Cessna&apos;s are not flying at several hundred miles an hour. So a little slow old Cessna can potter around without any problems.   Thanks also to all the people who responded to Liz and James&apos;s queries in the comments section.  3.53pm:      London Evening Standard ash cloud coverage.    The London Evening Standard has hit our office. The newspaper is certainly not underplaying the volcanic ash saga. &quot;Million passengers hit by worst chaos since second world war,&quot; reads their subheading.  4.00pm:  Earlier (11.22am) David Cameron described the volcanic ash plumes as &quot;very worrying&quot;. Not to be outdone, Prime Minister Gordon Brown has stressed that &quot;the safety of our population is of the highest importance&quot;.   &quot;It [the suspension of flights] is a temporary decision. It will be reviewed at all times.  &quot;But safety is the first and predominant consideration, and if any travelling public are inconvenienced I apologise for that, but it is important that everybody&apos;s safety comes first.&quot;    4.12pm:  A number of airports in France are now closed. The French Civil Aviation authority says that Paris&apos; main airport and nearly two dozen others are closing due to volcanic ash.The Civil Aviation authority cites security reasons for the decision.  4.26pm:  Possibly the worst travel woe I have heard so far, sent to me by @hutchaye on Twitter:  Travel woes-Christmas in Paris nearly ruined due to Eurostar snow debacle. Surprise weekend 4 gfs bday in Portugal in ruins  However other travel woes are available, this is from Paul Rutherford:  I was meant to be flying to Inverness from London for a Stag Weekend in the Highlands tomorrow morning. Booked up on the 12 hour overnight bus instead.  And this from Michael Crooks:  Does this mean my own Barcelona-Dublin-Aer Arann trip to the Isle of Mantomorrow is also in the balance?PS We&apos;ll probably be in The Saddle on the quay if you&apos;re bored. Which you will be.  And Tom Stainer from CAMRA reports that members could see their own Isle of Man travel plans disrupted:  Thanks for keeping us informed throughout the day \u2013 with CAMRA&apos;s AGM/Members&apos; Weekend due to take place on the IOM this weekend, there&apos;s another 1,000 or so real ale fans with their travel plans also in the balance thanks to The Cloud. Fingers crossed we all get out there tomorrow! (if you&apos;re struggling, have you checked the Steam Packet ferry times from Liverpool?) And if you fancy a pint and some good pub suggestions while you&apos;re out there, give me a bell.  Elsewhere, Matthew J Owen has sent a riposte to Roy Allen&apos;s earlier reply to Liz Bury&apos;s question (&quot;Do you know if there&apos;s any suggestion, or evidence to suggest, that this eruption is linked to climate change?&quot;)  [To Rory Allen&apos;s answer that] &apos;There is absolutely no possible causal link between volcanic eruptions orearthquakes and climate change. Zero. Nada, Zilch. Completely unconnectedphenomena&apos; ...I would like to add a caveat. Whilst I agree that there is no link between our current global warmingtrend and volcanic and earthquake activity, this is certainly not the caseon geologic timescales. On several fronts really, by I will limit myself to a couple: 1/ Pinatubo eruption, an example of a volcano erupting ash high into theatmosphere, reflecting the sun&apos;s radiation and leading to a short livedcooling of the Earth&apos;s climate. 2/ Instances in the distance past where large scale (i.e. half the size ofIndia) eruptions are believed to have caused catastrophic climate changeby releasing huge volumes of Methane into the atmosphere (such as theDeccan traps). 3/ During deglaciations - changes in the stress on the Earth&apos;s crustcaused by melting ice and rising sea-levels causing increased occurrencesof volcanic eruptions. So, this eruption in Iceland is not being caused by climate change, but ifit pumps it&apos;s emissions high enough into the atmosphere it could have aninfluence on our climate over the next year or so.   4.42pm: Some dispute over the accuracy of Bill Spring&apos;s answer to James Neill&apos;s question earlier. (See 3.41pm). Geoff Whitworth:  I hate to disagree with Bill Spring and get all train spottery, but that plane is a Cessna Citation, not a 172 or the like. It&apos;s a big ass twin engined executive jet. Here&apos;s a photo: http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cessna-550-Citation/1423263/L/&amp;sid=f1f79bbca4836f5d6bc6f4b52e1e010c So why is it still in the air?  Nick Evans:  Actually, the Cessna Citation is a business jet and so Bill Spring is entirely wrong, in every respect.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_Citation_II  And Philip Benson:  Hi Adam,Bad news about the Kit Kat!I&apos;m not one to normally correct things, but as a former pilot I want to mention that the Cessna Citation 500 is a small JET powered Biz-Jet... not powered by a piston engine, as you write...  So what was this Cessna Citation doing in supposedly restricted UK airspace?  4.58pm:  Right, some final travel woes, firstly from Gordon McKenzie:  I am supposed to be flying back from JFK to Paris then Birmingham tonight. I can&apos;t get any information about what is happening - the online check-in isn&apos;t working for unspecified reasons, and ringing Air France at JFK gets a recorded message that the office is closed, despite the recording going on to give opening hours indicating it should be open.  Depends on the airport in Paris, but I think you&apos;re going to struggle (see 4.12pm). And you definitely won&apos;t be able to fly in to Birmingham until 7am tomorrow at the earliest. From Ian McDonough:  Hi there, a mention to my mate Rob Griffiths. He lives in Cologne and cannot get back home to Chester for his 50th birthday. We&apos;ll have a few beers here Rob.  (Happy birthday Rob). Dan Ashley:  Is the cloud getting lighter as it heads south? Am I in danger of not being able to fly to Lanzarote from Luton on Sunday?  And finally, dave_digger tweets:   @adamgabbatt Any suggestions from readers how to get to Vienna? Got a wedding on Saturday &amp; all bar the Bride still in the UK. Bad times!   Right that&apos;s it for today, thanks for all the emails, comments and tweets, sorry I couldn&apos;t post them all. I&apos;ll be back tomorrow, with bag packed and fingers crossed. Good luck to everyone hoping to travel tonight.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol Airport says Dutch airspace will close at 6pm (BST)."], "title": "Icelandic volcano: UK flight disruption", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2010/apr/15/volcano-airport-disruption-iceland", "tags": ["Air transport", "UK news", "Weather", "Iceland", "Travel", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Flights", "Europe", "Volcanoes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-15T19:27:09Z", "article": "     An unprecedented no-fly zone imposed across Europe following a huge volcanic eruption in Iceland is set to remain in force into the weekend, causing travel chaos for over a million air passengers. Airspace stretching from Ireland to Finland, including airports in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, was closed today following the violent eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in south-east Iceland which sent a plume of ash across some of the world&apos;s busiest flight paths. All UK airspace was closed from noon except for &quot;agreed emergencies&quot;. It is likely to stay shut tomorrow, with the force of the eruption showing no sign of abating. Last night north-westerly winds continued to blow the eight mile high plume across the continent, raising fears that airlines could be grounded for days. One volcanologist said the ash could present intermittent problems to air traffic for six months if the eruption continued. The last time the volcano erupted in 1821, it spewed ash for two years. The pan-European shutdown affected an estimated 4,000 flights and is the most dramatic step of its kind in living memory. It caused the most international travel chaos since the 11 September attacks on America in 2001. Airports across France closed tonight following the lead of safety authorities in Ireland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland and Denmark. Planes travelling from America to Europe had to turn back over the Atlantic and a jet carrying British forces back from Afghanistan was grounded in Cyprus. The plume is projected to spread east and south over Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states, as well as parts of Russia. &quot;We certainly do not think we have over-reacted,&quot; a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Service said, prior to extending the total shut down of all UK airports until at least 1pm today. &quot;Safety is our main priority and volcanic ash is a serious threat to aircraft.&quot; In 1982, a British Airways jumbo jet became a giant glider when all four of its engines failed after flying through a volcanic plume over Indonesia. After a terrifying descent, the crew managed to get the engines started, before landing the plane safely in Jakarta. The Met Office predicted planes will be grounded all day on Friday, while John Swinney, the cabinet secretary in the devolved Scottish government, said the ban on flights is likely to remain in place for &quot;some days&quot;. Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, will tomorrow morning meet senior transport officials to consider contingency plans if the current weather situation continues. The impact of the volcano, which began erupting in the early hours of Wednesday morning, eclipsed the build-up to the leaders&apos; debate in Manchester . Gordon Brown apologised for any disruption caused by the eruption but said &quot;safety is the first and predominate consideration&quot;. David Cameron broke off electioneering at a Halifax primary school to say it was &quot;a very worrying and difficult situation&quot;. The ash cloud, almost invisible to the eye, began to spread across Europe on in the early hours of Wednesday before stretching east to northern Norway, Sweden and Finland and south across Scotland and the UK, engulfing Britain totally by Thursday afternoon. The runways and aprons at Heathrow, normally the world&apos;s busiest airport, were becalmed. Manchester airport was almost empty with 75,000 passengers unable to travel. The eruption of the volcano which had been dormant for 187 years caused devastation in Iceland and civil protection teams had to evacuate around 700 residents when torrents of melt water flowed off the glacier through fields and farms. Day turned to night east of the eruption as thick grey ash fell, leading to fears among farmers for their grazing farm animals. Geophysicists in Iceland said that the production of ash from Eyjafjallajokull is likely to continue at a comparable level for some days or even weeks. &quot;Where it disrupts travel depends on the weather,&quot; said Einar Kjartansson, a geophysicist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office. &quot;It depends how the wind carries the ash.&quot; John Strickland, director of air transport consultancy JLS Consulting, said the effects on long haul travel could be particularly severe because of Iceland&apos;s position on heavily used routes. Ironically, Reykjavik airport was one of the few European airports to remain open, because the wind direction carried the plume away from the country&apos;s capital.", "sentences": ["Airspace stretching from Ireland to Finland, including airports in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, was closed today following the violent eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in south-east Iceland which sent a plume of ash across some of the world&apos;s busiest flight paths."], "title": "Volcano chaos as Iceland eruption empties skies in Britain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/15/iceland-volcano-ash-flights-grounded", "tags": ["Transport", "Iceland", "Weather", "Air transport", "Travel", "World news", "Flights", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Europe", "Volcanoes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-16T17:28:41Z", "article": "Tens of thousands of travellers were left stranded across Europe today as the drifting ash cloud spread rapidly south-east from Iceland and caused the biggest shutdown of the continent&apos;s airspace since 11 September 2001. Eurocontrol, the intergovernmental air control agency, said it expected 11,000 flights to take place across all of Europe&apos;s skies today, compared with an average of about 28,000. From France and Belgium to the Czech Republic and the eastern Baltic states, aviation authorities declared their airspaces closed, with many predicting the bans to last until Sunday. Eurocontrol said the impact would continue &quot;for at least the next 24 hours&quot;. As passengers across the continent struggle to find alternative means of travel, hotel and train services are dealing with a surge in demand. Channel tunnel train operator Eurostar advised customers without bookings to stay away from the terminals in Paris and London, while Thalys, the northern European high-speed train link, said it was allowing passengers to buy tickets even for fully booked services. Demand was so high at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport train station that staff at NS Hispeed were handing out free cups of coffee. While causing general disruption to tens of thousands of ordinary passengers, the ash cloud also threatened to interfere with the travel plans of dignitaries from around the world. In Poland, where airports were closed early this morning, concerns grew that many visitors to the funeral of the late president and his wife would be unable to make it to the ceremony, due to be held on Sunday. Despite the possibility that guests such as Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy would not be able to fly into Krakow as planned, the family of Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in last weekend&apos;s air crash, issued a statement urging that the date should remain the same. &quot;It is the will of the family that under no circumstance the date of the funeral be changed,&quot; said presidential palace spokesman Jacek Sasin. He added that while postponement remained an option it would be &quot;an absolute last resort&quot;. &quot;All we can do is wait,&quot; a spokeswoman for Krakow airport told the Associated Press. Sunday&apos;s state funeral was not the only high-profile event to be overshadowed by the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull. In Copenhagen, Denmark&apos;s Queen Margrethe saw the guest list for her 70th birthday party shortened as flight bans forced cancellations from dignitaries including Spain&apos;s King Juan Carlos and Iceland&apos;s president, Olafur R Grimsson. Meanwhile, airports across Europe were forced to bow to the progress of the ash cloud as it raced south-east from the North Sea, spreading deep into France and east towards Russia. Harry Geurts of the Dutch meteorological office said the cloud was moving south-east at around 25 miles per hour, but that cloud cover impeded experts&apos; ability to track it precisely. And, while authorities in parts of Norway and Sweden today began loosening airspace bans, many other countries put their airports on lockdown. &quot;We have not seen a situation like this \u2026 since the attacks of 11 September 2001,&quot; said a spokesman for the DGAC, France&apos;s civil aviation authority. In Paris, more than 20 bases across northern France were closed until 8pm at the earliest, despite a four-hour window this afternoon allowing flights into the three airports around the capital, including Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly. In Belgium, Slovakia, Denmark, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Austria, airspaces were closed progressively throughout the day and, despite varying estimations of reopening, could remain shut until Sunday. In Germany, all the chief airports \u2013 including Frankfurt, Europe&apos;s third busiest terminal \u2013 saw serious disruption to schedules. It was not only short-haul flights that were caught up in the chaos as the ash cloud interfered with several key paths in and out of Europe. Transatlantic flights from the US east coast were badly affected, with only 120 of around 300 scheduled crossings going ahead this morning. With airlines including Qantas, Korean Air and Cathay Pacific cancelling their flights, around 60 services between Asia and European cities were also called off. As the havoc spread throughout the day, tales of travellers&apos; woes filled the airwaves. Stranded passengers at Frankfurt were given camp beds to lie down on, but little could be done to sooth their frayed nerves. Gerd Pszolla-Stanzl, who had been due to fly to Boston to run in the city&apos;s marathon on Monday, was despondent. &quot;That&apos;s perhaps half a year&apos;s training for nothing,&quot; he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Stranded at Roissy airport in the north of Paris, one passenger, Anne, told French radio she had nowhere to go. &quot;We are from the provinces so we left yesterday afternoon when people were just talking about a cloud that was only affecting the north,&quot; she said. &quot;Now we&apos;re told there&apos;s no flights, but it&apos;s too late, we&apos;re stuck. We&apos;re going to have to see the ordeal through to the end.&quot;", "sentences": ["Demand was so high at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport train station that staff at NS Hispeed were handing out free cups of coffee."], "title": "Ash cloud over Europe causes worst travel chaos since 9/11", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/16/ash-cloud-europe-volcano-travel-chaos", "tags": ["Air transport", "Transport", "Weather", "Channel Tunnel", "France", "Belgium", "Czech Republic", "Poland", "Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden", "World news", "UK news", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Flights", "Europe", "Volcanoes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-16T21:56:00Z", "article": "Steve McClaren&apos;s road to redemption runs 10 miles or so west of the German border, winding through an area known as the Garden of the Netherlands. At its heart is the eclectic, slightly edgy university town of Enschede, a sort of mini Berlin and the home of McClaren&apos;s FC Twente. It is here that, on Sunday afternoon, the former England coach hopes to beat Feyenoord and, depending on Ajax&apos;s result, become the first English manager since Bobby Robson at Porto in 1996 to win a major European league title. With two games left Twente \u2013 a Dutch equivalent of Ipswich or Norwich \u2013 are one point clear of Martin Jol&apos;s Ajax in the Eredivisie and on course to secure a first Championship since 1926. &quot;We&apos;re optimistic but we haven&apos;t done it yet,&quot; McClaren says. &quot;I just hope we can for the people here. They accepted me straight away and have taken me into their lives. This part of Holland is known as Tuckerland and I&apos;m one of the Tuckers now.&quot; Asked if it is correct that he is Enschede&apos;s most famous Tucker, the 48-year-old laughs before finally replying: &quot;It&apos;s been a good two years here.&quot; After finishing second last season Twente had tight hold of the title until Tuesday night when they suffered only their second defeat of the season, losing 1-0 at AZ Alkmaar hours after their team bus had been pelted by missiles hurled from a viaduct. Although everyone escaped injury it proved an unnerving experience, totally out of sync with two seasons during which McClaren has been met with such friendliness and openness that he has shed the guarded carapace developed by so many English \u2013 not to mention England \u2013 managers. At Twente&apos;s training ground in Hengelo, the small satellite town adjacent to Enschede where he has a house, there is an open-door policy unheard of in Premier League environs. &quot;People are very open,&quot; he says. &quot;Anyone can come and wander round, watch us and discuss what we&apos;re doing. Journalists are welcome to come every day to see us train and talk to me or any player they want to. It&apos;s been quite a culture shock but it&apos;s been good, you have real relationships, real trust with journalists.&quot; At Twente McClaren has rediscovered the benefits of being himself. Convinced spin was king and success in football impossible without the right image, his time in charge of Middlesbrough and England saw him become overly obsessed with presentation and public relations. One Friday morning at Middlesbrough&apos;s training ground reporters attending McClaren&apos;s weekly news conference noted a stray piece of A4 paper left lying on the desk. It turned out to be a crib sheet, listing questions he was likely to be asked \u2013 along with appropriate answers. Small wonder Boro&apos;s then manager routinely ran late for such briefings. Quite apart from being prepped by a press officer, he never spoke to journalists without also visiting Bill Beswick, the club&apos;s former sports psychologist. Beswick advised him on how to put a positive spin on the most unpromising situation but McClaren merely seemed strangely wooden as he trotted out clich\u00e9d sound-bites punctuated by the latest buzzword. No one in the Netherlands accuses Twente&apos;s manager of being similarly &quot;false&quot;. Indeed McClaren, who has been accompanied by no English staff, is thriving without his old, once sizeable, support network. &quot;I haven&apos;t brought any English connections,&quot; says the man whose team regularly attracts 24,000-strong, unbelievably noisy, sell-out crowds. &quot;My assistants are all Dutch, there are some fantastic young coaches here. I thought it was important to embrace and understand the culture of the club and Dutch football rather than import a different one. Anyway when Sir Bobby Robson advised me to take this job he said: &apos;Go, son, and make sure you go on your own.&apos;&quot; In a country significantly less fixated by celebrity than England, McClaren has rediscovered the difference between substance and superficiality and decided he will stand or fall by virtue of his coaching and man-management ability. &quot;There&apos;s an intense spotlight on football here,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&apos;s hours of discussion about tactics, technique and quality rather than the sort of things the English talk about. The Dutch aren&apos;t really hooked up on fame.&quot; Although the \u20ac5.5m (\u00a34.8m) McClaren invested in signing Bryan Ruiz, a free-scoring Costa Rican forward bought from Ghent who now boasts 25 goals in 44 league appearances, shows he has not lost his transfer market eye, a tight budget has precluded the possibility of signing players along the lines of the Boro recruits Gaizka Mendieta, Bolo Zenden and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. &quot;This is a community club, owned by the fans, so we have to sell players every year and polish up rough diamonds,&quot; he says. Forced to rely on improving personnel on the training ground, McClaren has reminded himself he is an exceptionally good coach. These days, though, he is a considerably more daring manager than Middlesbrough fans may recall. An enthusiastic convert to the Dutch interpretation of 4-3-3 featuring two genuine wingers, this long-term purist has been hailed as a true disciple of total football by none other than Johan Cruyff. &quot;I decided I&apos;d better adapt to 4-3-3,&quot; McClaren says. &quot;If it was good enough for thousands of Dutchmen it was good enough for me. And in Holland, football is about performance, fans can see their team lose but still be happy if they&apos;ve played well.&quot; This attitude has proved remarkably liberating. &quot;I&apos;m not frightened of failure any more because, after the failure with England, I&apos;ve seen the ultimate,&quot; he says. &quot;It didn&apos;t kill me and I thought, &apos;Well, what more can they throw at me?&apos; It&apos;s made me a wiser and more experienced manager and I&apos;d like to think a better person.&quot; A willingness to uproot from the family home in North Yorkshire, which this frequent flier on KLM&apos;s Amsterdam-Durham Tees Valley route tries to return to on a weekly basis, marked McClaren out as far braver than the majority of his compatriots. Indeed he has joined the late Robson \u2013 a staunch ally and mentor \u2013 Terry Venables and Roy Hodgson in becoming one of the very few English managers to pack his tracksuit, unearth his passport and reap rich dividends. Despite the year remaining on his Twente contract and a claim that &quot;I do enjoy it here, I&apos;d like to stay&quot;, it is inconceivable that offers from England and elsewhere in Europe will not be forthcoming this summer. Expat life suits him but has, inevitably, contained a few tricky moments. Remember that comedy foreign accent \u2013 a YouTube hit \u2013 McClaren affected while answering a Dutch journalist? &quot;My three sons all said: &apos;Bloody hell, Dad,&apos;&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;But I have noticed that, when people come over from England to see me, they all do the same. They suddenly start talking very slowly in strange voices and I have to say: &apos;The Dutch can understand, they speak perfect English.&apos;&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;It didn&apos;t kill me and I thought, &apos;Well, what more can they throw at me?&apos; It&apos;s made me a wiser and more experienced manager and I&apos;d like to think a better person.&quot; A willingness to uproot from the family home in North Yorkshire, which this frequent flier on KLM&apos;s Amsterdam-Durham Tees Valley route tries to return to on a weekly basis, marked McClaren out as far braver than the majority of his compatriots."], "title": "Steve McClaren: from wally with a brolly to Dutch master", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/16/steve-mcclaren-fc-twente-eredivisie", "tags": ["Twente", "Eredivisie", "European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-19T20:30:01Z", "article": "Here I am in Glasgow. Should I go to a Rangers-themed bar or a Celtic bar? They&apos;re side by side. There are TVs playing the match; scarves, shirts and memorabilia festoon the walls; a full range of beers and spirits are on sale. The lighting is over-bright, but there&apos;s no one about. Beside these dodgy pubs, not for the likes of an English wimp like me, there is a discreet but heavy door. It is forbidding rather than welcoming. Plunge in, and you&apos;re in prison. This is Swiss artist Christoph B\u00fcchel&apos;s contribution to the Glasgow International, which opened at the weekend. B\u00fcchel is a difficult artist. He\u00a0recently installed a lifelike and fully functional sex club in the Secession building in Vienna. Local swingers were invited to come and play. But his installation at Glasgow&apos;s Tramway isn&apos;t naughty-but-nice. Once past his two fake pubs, it is horrible: huge, dangerous and depressing. Built around a maze of shipping containers, it plunges you into waiting rooms and punishment cells, communal toilets and showers, a rancid prison hospital, an autopsy room with a frightening slab, revolting dormitories, and much besides. I&apos;m not\u00a0even sure I saw all of it as I careened through, going from one monstrous interior to another, one misery after the next. This is as life-like as it gets, and you thank God it isn&apos;t real. The maze of rooms is just a preamble to a huge space, the central feature of which is the gutted and flayed fuselage of a large passenger jet. More chunks of mangled aeroplane stand about. There are rows of defiled, busted seats: you imagine bodies thrown this way and that. Something terrible has happened. A bomb? An engine fire? Soot-fouled clothes, kids&apos; dolls, suitcases and rucksacks; the impedimenta of all the passengers are in the process of being sorted. This seems to be the work of the detainees kept here. I need a drink, but those bars at the entrance are probably for warders only, and even they are divided along sectarian lines. Who are the prisoners here? B\u00fcchel isn&apos;t telling. At the time of my visit, this hyper-realist, immersive installation had no title. Is it about football and sectarianism, bombings and imprisonment, plane crashes? Secret prisons and extraordinary renditions? All that effort, the piling of horror on horror \u2013 what&apos;s it for? Eventually B\u00fcchel provided a title: Last Man Out Turn Off Lights. B\u00fcchel&apos;s art is gobsmacking but literal. What you really want to know is the script inside his head. The mind reels at the thought of the expense, all that grisly and depressing detail. B\u00fcchel makes other installation artists look like wimps. Next to him, Gregor Schneider looks like a maker of low-budget fictions, even though his art is obsessive and precise in a way that B\u00fcchel&apos;s is not. He makes Mike Nelson look like a toy maker, whose work has never managed the same scale and sprawl. And he makes the late Ed Kienholz look like an impressionist: Kienholz never aimed at realism in the way B\u00fcchel does. The trouble is, being overwhelmed isn&apos;t enough. It is only spectacle. Gimme a sex club any day. Or Douglas Gordon&apos;s 24 Hour Psycho. Gordon&apos;s 1993 slow-mo version of the Hitchcock film is a great piece, and the artist has reworked it at Tramway as a double-screen variation, playing backwards and forwards, side by side. This recomplicates an already complex work, recently a subject of homage in\u00a0Don DeLillo&apos;s latest novel, Point Omega. De Lillo&apos;s novel, like Gordon&apos;s installation, meditates on time, on images, on presence and perception. The persistence of the past \u2013 and the ways we accommodate it in the present \u2013 are also themes Irish artist Gerard Byrne weaves into A Thing is a Hole in a Thing It Is Not (cumbersome title, complicated video installation). This is at a disused, partially renovated building in Glasgow&apos;s city centre, one of many works in the International that have insinuated themselves into gardens and houses, studios and patches of waste ground, as well as galleries and museums. &apos;The white bicycle is anarchistic!&apos; As we wander between the screens, Byrne revisits various discussions and ideas surrounding American art in the mid-1960s. He resurrects a radio conversation between the young Frank Stella and sculptor Donald Judd. On the screen, the camera drifts between radio dials and reel-to-reel tape recorders, a microphone, hessian-covered speakers, a hand, an elbow. We hear the artists talking. But did this interview take place? Or is it a kind of play, based on artists&apos; statements and the writings of critic Michael Fried? The voices are those of actors. I want to rush home and check my copy of Fried&apos;s Art and Objecthood. On another screen, a car drives along a highway at night, and we hear the ruminations of the late Robert Smithson. Other footage is shot in the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven: is that a real Don Judd, or\u00a0is it made of painted cardboard? The\u00a0doubts creep in. Byrne&apos;s work dovetails past and present, fiction and reality. His work is full of art history, and of questions. Elsewhere, at Common Guild, a house owned by Gordon and run as an elegant gallery, Byrne shows a series of black-and-white photographs that continue his ruminations. A lot of art tries too hard, or is overcomplicated. Much of it is clever, but that doesn&apos;t make it interesting. At his best, Byrne rises above all this flim-flam. His art is complex, and as playful as it is sometimes profound. Free white bicycles, just like the ones the Dutch Provos offered as part of an ecological, car-free anarchist campaign in Amsterdam in the 60s, are being ridden\u00a0through the streets of Glasgow. Fifty cyclists gathered in George Square last Friday. A bike was symbolically doused in white paint. There was even a speech, read in Dutch and English but\u00a0not, sadly, in Glaswegian. &quot;Amsterdammers! The asphalt terror of the motorised bourgeoisie has lasted long enough!&quot; it began. &quot;The white bicycle is anarchistic . . . A bike is something, but almost nothing!&quot; The Provos also promoted sexual health clinics, squatting, a tax on polluters, free childcare and \u2013 only half jokingly \u2013 better weather. Last Friday, the Glasgow sky was an unblemished blue, with not an aeroplane in sight. The Provos were on to something. Many were also on something, which is one reason why the original plan petered out. Visitors to the festival can now borrow a bike to get around all the\u00a0art. But wobble up to the Hunterian gallery to see a small Joseph Beuys show, part of Anthony d&apos;Offay&apos;s Artists&apos; Rooms project, which features vitrines containing cardboard boxes of old lard, and when you come out your bike&apos;s gone: nicked or borrowed by some other art-lover to freewheel to the David Shrigley show at\u00a0the Kelvingrove gallery. A song to still traffic Shrigley&apos;s small exhibition has vitrines filled with deliberately humorous nonsense, including a stuffed Jack Russell that stands on its hind legs and holds up a placard saying, &quot;I&apos;m dead&quot;. There is more ambiguity in Beuys, who was not famous for his jokes. But I like Shrigley, and best of all when he is at his most mordant. I usually like Jim Lambie, too, but his show here, which inaugurates the Modern Institute, is far too crowded and overworked. Coming out of Jimmie Durham&apos;s exhibition at Glasgow Sculpture Studios, where the Native American artist delves into the links between Scots colonialists and the Cherokee, I found myself in a patch of feral wasteland next to a railway line. Choked with Japanese knotweed, this is Vestiges Park. Strange, mirrored figures stand in the weeds, reflecting the branches. Side tables and other domestic furniture dangle from trees. There are monsters and mushrooms: it is enjoyable nonsense. Unidentifiable burps, groans and other fanciful animal chatter rise from the undergrowth; a\u00a0disembodied voice emanating from a\u00a0hole in the ground talks about eating property developers and committing other laudably foul acts. There is something of the Provo spirit in this project, curated by the artist-run Glasgow gallery Lowsalt. Back in the town centre, I heard a voice singing the folk song Lowlands. The song wafts over the river Clyde, echoing under the arches of a bridge, drifting up Jamaica Street and haunting the traffic on Argyle Street. Sung by Berlin-based Glasgow artist Susan Philipsz, the disembodied voice\u00a0goes mostly unnoticed, though occasionally someone pauses on Glasgow Bridge, captivated. It is a voice\u00a0that stills you amid the roar of the traffic. This seems to me to be\u00a0enough. Round the corner at the Gallery of Modern Art, Fiona Tan has installed Tomorrow, a 2005 video in which a camera pans slowly across a lineup of Swedish students. The faces of modern Sweden are Nordic, southern Asian, Middle Eastern, black and white. A head-scarfed Muslim girl smokes. Other kids smile and joke. On a smaller screen in front of the first,\u00a0the camera shows the group from\u00a0a distance. Adolescents when Tomorrow was filmed, they are now young adults. It is an affecting portrait of a moment that is past, and somehow avoids nostalgia. Two days isn&apos;t enough to see Glasgow International. It gets bigger and more ambitious with every two-yearly edition. Lively, exhausting, the festival seems this time to have achieved the right mix of the local and the international. Glocalisation is here to stay, so long as the aeroplanes keep flying. If not, there&apos;s always the bike. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2010.

The surface at the national stadium is in the throes of being relaid for the 11th time since 2007, in the wake of fierce criticism over its condition for the FA Cup semi\u2011finals, with Geoff Webb, the chief executive of the Institute of Groundsmanship (IOG), saying the FA admitted the most recent pitch was &quot;too hard&quot;. Mistakes, he suggested, were made. There are no fears, though, for the state of the turf for the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Portsmouth on 15\u00a0May. Experts feel that, as long as the job is done properly, a new pitch ought to take seven to 10 days to bed in. The FA will revert to the formula it used ahead of last season&apos;s FA Cup final, when the pitch was relaid, rather than attempt to employ different methods in an effort to enhance the surface. The FA&apos;s business plan to 2023 involves Wembley being used for non-football showpieces and pop concerts to service the stadium&apos;s debts. The relaying of the surface is common practice at other multi-use stadiums, such as the Amsterdam Arena; if a concert makes a profit of, for example, \u00a3300,000 and a turf relay costs \u00a3100,000, it makes sense in business terms. Wembley&apos;s problem, however, is that its particular micro-climate has made it difficult, on occasions, for new pitches to bed in. &quot;We appreciate we have to improve the quality of the pitch and we are determined to do so,&quot; said an FA spokesman, following a meeting between the governing body, the Sports Turf Research Institute, which is in charge of maintaining the Wembley surface, and the IOG. &quot;We&apos;ve enjoyed constructive meetings with a number of industry consultants who support our strategy and we will continue to liaise with them. Under the current business plan there is provision for pitches to be changed over the course of a season but there is no set number for this.&quot;", "sentences": ["The relaying of the surface is common practice at other multi-use stadiums, such as the Amsterdam Arena; if a concert makes a profit of, for example, \u00a3300,000 and a turf relay costs \u00a3100,000, it makes sense in business terms."], "title": "Wembley turf to be relaid up to 65 times by 2023 in FA plan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/19/wembley-pitch-surface-relaid", "tags": ["Wembley stadium", "The FA", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-20T06:45:58Z", "article": " 7.46am:  Just as we thought the eruptions from Eyjafjallajokull were subsiding, off it goes again. National air traffic authorities lifted the restriction on airspace in Scotland and the north of England yesterday, and had been expected to open up the whole of UK airspace, including London, later today. Not any more. In light of the eruption strengthening, Nats released a statement at 2.45am this morning. Although Scottish and some English airports will still open from 7am, with the prospect of some airspace over England opening up from 1pm, Nats said the main London airports will not be open today. As yet it is unclear how, or if, the strengthening of the Eyjafjallajokull eruption will affect European airspace. France said yesterday that European countries would resume airline traffic today in designated &quot;caution zones&quot; where the threat of ash is considered less dangerous. However the latest statement from Eurocontrol, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation, said much of the airspace in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, northern Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Switzerland and parts of Ukraine remains closed. Eurocontrol said flights are taking place in southern and central Europe, including the Czech Republic, the Balkan area, Bulgaria, Hungary, southern Italy and France, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey, as well as Norway and parts of Sweden.  7.58am:      David Miliband. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP    Foreign Secretary David Miliband has been on GMTV this morning, and advised stranded British travellers in Europe to head for Calais. &quot;This is an unprecedented situation, it is affecting the whole of northern Europe, so our priority is first, to make the most of the hole in the clouds that is going to emerge because of the temporary stalling yesterday of the volcano, secondly, to continue to offer as much consular assistance as we can to Brits who are stranded around the world,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the first message to British people who are in Europe though is to go to Calais because it is from Calais that they can cross the Channel.&quot;I have just heard reports of people being able to arrive at Calais, either in cars or on foot and pretty much go straight on to ferries, the extra ferries that we have laid on.&quot;             .  8.15am:  Do you remain stranded today? Are you scheduled to take advantage of the lifting of the European flight restrictions? Or, worst case scenario, were you due to take advantage of the restrictions being lifted, but remain stranded after Eyjafjallajokull began to erupt again? We want to hear from you. Perhaps we could even help. Email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk, message me on Twitter: @adamgabbatt or comment below. In the meantime, here&apos;s a video from ABC news with a particularly snappy title (&quot;The Eruption: Up Close and Personal&quot;). And here&apos;s a slideshow of images, set to heavy metal music in time-honoured YouTube tradition.  8.35am:  At around 6pm yesterday rumours swept the internet that a second volcano, Hekla \u2013 believed to be one of the most active in Iceland \u2013 had also began to erupt. As it turns out, some joker had swivelled a webcam normally pointed at Hekla round so it pointed at Eyjafjallajokull. Chortle chortle. There&apos;s more on that at BusinessandFinance.ie (where else?). In yesterday&apos;s blog we had lots of useful advice from people who had managed to get home despite the flight ban. If you have any tips please let me know (contact details in the post below). Also, what would be absolutely splendid is if someone being &quot;rescued&quot; by HMS Ocean, Ark Royal or Albion could get in touch for a chat. Here&apos;s some messages I&apos;ve received so far this morning. \u2022 Alan Maddison:  Hi , we are travelling to cuba on 25th april , do you think it is likely that flights will be back to normal by then .  Hello Alan, the Met Office and Nats don&apos;t seem to be looking that far ahead at the moment. &quot;We can&apos;t predict when the volcano will erupt,&quot; is what I&apos;ve been told. Fingers crossed. \u2022 Richard Bossons:  I&apos;m really appreciating all the blogs, it is the only way to get any reliable news. I&apos;m stuck in Girona but luckily with a seat on a coach leaving for Paris on Wenesday night and Eurostar booked for Friday am. Not much in the press about the French rail strike which has really caused more difficulties for people stuck in Spain. I tried to get a train to Paris from Girona on Sunday but was told nothing was available and trains to Montpellier were cancelled.However someone I spoke to yesterday said their wife had managed to get a train via Perpignan. The strike has not been cancelled as far as I know. Ryanair told me on Sunday that the next available flight back to UK was on Saturday assuming no further ash. This must be out of date now.   8.47am:       @thetronz @adamgabbatt Stuck in Cyprus. Should I try to get to Madrid and then home or just sit tight for a few more days. What do you think? I&apos;ve just spoken to a Foreign Office spokeswoman for you. &quot;British nationals should not travel to Spain specifically for repatriation to the UK,&quot; she said.  She said those stranded should await updates from the Foreign Office, by continually checking its website, and stay in touch with your airline. Hope that helps (a bit), even if it is frustrating. We&apos;re expecting some more on this possibility of a Britain-Spain &apos;repatriation hub&apos; later today, so keep checking the blog.  8.55am:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;The specialist website Airline Industry Review has a handy summary of the airports that are open and closed in Europe. Those open include: Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Rome, Moscow, Madrid, Barcelona, Vienna, and Oslo. But more importantly the site also lists the airspace availability across Europe, with much of it still closed. So flights are still heavily restricted.  And it is scathing of airline chiefs who are pressing for an opening of airspace. It offers this technical warning:&quot; &quot;This is not a very good choice as if an equipment such as a PITOT tube gets damaged, you will be unaware of it till an accident takes place.&quot; It points out: &quot;Scientists from Wiltshire and ETH Zurich after test flights have concluded that the UK and Swiss skies are still dangerous to fly in and that there are gritty particles between FL80-100.&quot;&quot;  9.10am:  Lots of people with family stranded, or stranded themselves. From the emails: \u2022 Heather Lambert is at the mercy of not just the volcano, but also earthquakes:  I am one of those un-lucky people stuck down-under in Adelaide S.Australia. My flight was due to leave Adelaide today arriving back in the UK Wednesday 22nd April but now everything is cancelled with Qantas and my next re-sceduled flight back is 1st May but this is only IF they are allowed to take off. There is a lack of contact but was told to keep my mobile on, awaiting a call possibly giving me good news that they are going out sooner. I am stuck here for another 10days possibly longer, who knows? I have to vacate my accommodation on Thursday 22nd April. My travel agent say contact Qantas but Qantas say contact your travel agent.... Friday we had an earthqake here in Adelaide about 23:16hrs and now one has happened in Kalgoorlie this morning 08:06am (Perth time) PLEASE I WANT TO GET HOME My son is at Uni in Bournemouth and concerned about me but I know I am one of millions. Thank GOD for mobiles ......&quot;  \u2022 Ben Sumner reports that Virgin &quot;might&quot; cover the cost of flights to UK:  My wife and two friends are stuck in New York (lucky them) it wouldn&apos;t be so bad but she is desperate to get home to see her 18 month old son. The statement about European travel from miliband is one thing but what is being done for people stuck outside Europe where alternatives to flight are limited. Even if the ash clears the earliest flight Virgin could get her on is the 30th. It doesn&apos;t appear they are planning extra flights or clearing existing flights of people starting trips as opposed to trying to get home. At least the hotel have been great (1871 House) not only is it really beautiful and well located but they have actually given them a discount for the next few nights to help out (so much for profiteering) and let them use their office for international calls and the internet for free. The consulate only has recorded info, they have tried several travel agents but could only find a flight with aer lingus on 26th and of course if they cancel with Virgin will definitley have to pick up the hotel tab themselves. Virgin have generously said they &apos;might cover it&apos;  \u2022 My colleague John Stuttle&apos;s daughter is missing out on her education:  I saw on the live blog you wanted to hear about people stuck abroad. My 13-year-old daughter is stranded in Bogota with her mum where they were visiting family. They were due back on Saturday but are now booked on a flight that gets back on 28th April. She is naturally very distressed at all the school and homework she is missing  \u2022 And Edward Genochio is just miserable:   Not stuck in Europe, so having to find other reasons to be annoyed. Oh look, here&apos;s one, from your 7:58 update: David Miliband: &quot;I have just heard reports of people being able toarrive at Calais, either in cars or on foot and pretty much gostraight on to ferries, the extra ferries that we have laid on&quot; &quot;WE have laid on&quot;? Sorry, did I misunderstand something? Is Milibandnow Chairman of P&amp;O? Or have we just nationalised the ferry companies? Grumble grumble grumble.   9.16am:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;David Miliband is advising stranded passengers to head for Calais but a word of warning: there&apos;s a rail strike on in France. Union leaders have hinted that the strike could soon be suspended, according to Radio France Internationale. But the 12 day strike is still causing disruption on the French railways. British passengers caught in the double whammy of volcanic ash and the French rail dispute have been talking to PA. &quot;We were supposed to be flying back from Alicante last Saturday and were hoping to carry on by train through France but now we have just heard about the strike,&quot; said Karen Curley, on holiday with her husband Michael. &quot;Ideally, we would arrange a car hire with other people but there are no cars available to hire so all we can really do now is to head to the border and see if somehow we can get across.&quot;  9.18am:  Part of Scottish airspace including Aberdeen, Inverness and Edinburgh airports, and south to Newcastle airport, will continue to be available from 1300-1900 today, Nats has announced.  More on that shortly.  9.27am:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Nats has issued a new advisory on flight restrictions today. Some flights from Scottish airports and Newcastle airport will continue today, and it will allow flights in UK airspace above 20,000ft between 1pm and 7pm.  But it warns &quot;the situation is likely to change during the course of the day&quot;. Another statement is due at 3pm. &quot;The situation regarding the volcanic eruption in Iceland remains dynamic and the latest information from the Met Office shows that the situation today will continue to be variable,&quot; it said.&quot;  9.30am:       \u2022 Andrew Wilbur sends some advice:  Not sure how much help this will be to anyone else, but I found a way to get home from Italy through a little creative planning. After finding no space at all on overnight trains to Paris, nor coaches, I managed to get a train ticket from Milan to Geneva (\u20ac65), then Geneva to Paris (about \u20ac75). The Eurostar seats were selling out fast and the company seems to be involved in the worst kind of price gouging (avg. price for standard class now around \u00a3220 from Gare du Nord to St. Pancras) but I bizarrely found a &apos;Leisure Select&apos; upgraded seat for nearly \u00a3100 less. All in, an expensive way to get back but it&apos;s worked. Best of luck to everyone else.   9.55am:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Eurocontrol, Europe&apos;s intergovernmental air traffic control body, says that most of the airspace above mainland Europe is now open.Airlines such as the German carrier Lufthansa and the Dutch airline KLM have resumed longhaul flights and some European shorthaul flights. This isn&apos;t much help to stranded Brits but it might help some people edge closer to continental ports where they could get ferries to the UK. Eurocontrol tweeted: &quot;Situation today 75% of landmass in Eur open to flights, so hopefully up to 60% of flights operating.&quot; Meanwhile the situation in the UK appears to be worsening. Glasgow airport is to close after 1pm.&quot;  10.03am:       @manpreet1 @adamgabbatt Stuck in India - Airlines can&apos;t give any information until heathrow re-opens. Debating flying into Paris, and trying my luck.  10.08am:  Hungary has fully opened its airspace, effective immediately, Reuters has reported. Gyula Hangyal, deputy director of air traffic at air traffic control agency Hungarocontrol, made the announcement this morning. &quot;Hungary, being far from the eruption and the air space where ashes are present in high concentration, similar to neighbouring countries ... considers its air space below 6,000 metres (19,680 ft) as a low concentration area,&quot; Hangyal said. (Airspace below 6,000 metres in Hungary had been closed earlier today.) &quot;Therefore from an air traffic point of view, the air space is open, and Ferihegy International Airport [in Budapest] is open,&quot; Hangyal added. Airlines have to assess risks on their own, he said, adding that Hungarocontrol will revise its assessment of the situation once in every six hours.  .  10.11am:      Matthew Weaver     &quot;Sam Jones is at Heathrow with some stranded passengers taking bets on when the first plane is going to leave. One of them is a California academic who has just presented a paper at a conference on &apos;zombies and the undead&apos; at the University of Hertfordshire. &quot;She is running severely low on funds,&quot; Sam says.&quot;  10.15am:  From Dan Milmo, Guardian transport correspondent:  Government sources said an estimate of up to 400,000 people stranded abroad was comprised of unofficial figures from tour operators and airlines, including a forecast of 150,000 exiles from holiday companies. A government source said that figure was now likely to have diminished because &quot;lots of people have used their ingenuity to get home.&quot;   10.18am:       @benjilanyado Screw you Iceland. First you buggered my football club, then the economy, then this. Enough belligerence already. No-one likes a show-off.  10.23am:  My colleague, Esther Addley, has emailed over a press release - apparently the launch of a &quot;\u00a3500m cruise ship&quot;, scheduled to take place today, has been cancelled so the vessel can head to Spain to pick up Brits left stranded due to volcanic ash.  The 122,000 tonne Celebrity Eclipse will leave Southampton, Hants, tonight destined for Bilbao.Fed-up holidaymakers who have spent days trying to get home will now get to sleep in brand new cabins - and will even be able to play croquet on the way home.The luxury vessel was due to take travel agents on a two day launch cruise on Thursday so they could see what the new ship had to offer.But the crisis caused by the Icelandic volcano eruption has prompted the ship&apos;s owners to change plans.It is thought tour operators requested the voyage to pick up around 2,000 stranded Britons desperate to get home.They have all made their way to the Spanish port after being unable to get flights home at the end of their holidays.Even though British airspace may open, the backlog will take days to get through.Eclipse, which can carry 2,850 passengers, will make the journey and get back to Southampton late on Friday.    10.25am:      Matthew Weaver     &quot;Eruptions from the volcano are not as strong as the last few days, according to the Met Office, but it is still producing levels of ash that are dangerous to aircraft engines. In a statement it said: &quot;Eruptions from the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano are weaker than they were at the weekend but eruptions still take ash over 10,000ft at times. Weather patterns continue to blow areas of ash towards the UK. &quot;As the volcanic activity changes, there may be some clearance of ash at times, over parts of the UK. We will be looking to provide timely advice about when these opportunities might happen. &quot;The Met Office is unable to advise of any details of any flights. However, many airlines are providing information on their websites.&quot;  10.45am:  Mark Tran, my vigilant colleague, has this:  The Times&apos; Paris correspondent flew to Calais in his own plane - how&apos;s that for intrepid reporting - to talk to Brits making the long journey home.  Here&apos;s the article.  10.52am:  Some hopeful news for people in east Asia/BA customers - British Airways was able to operate its first flight since Saturday this morning, when a Boeing 777 took off from Beijing. BA said it hoped the plane could land at Heathrow if flight restrictions for southern England were lifted later. If not, the aircraft will land in Scotland or at a European destination. &quot;We are hoping to get a number of in-bound, long-haul flights away today,&quot; a spokesman said.  10.55am:      HMS Ark Royal to the rescue. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA    Hurrah! The first of three Royal Navy warships has begun rescuing stranded Britons. HMS Albion arrived in Santander, northern Spain, this morning and began loading some 250 troops and 200 civilians to take them back to the UK. Another two Navy vessels, aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal and commando helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, have also been deployed to rescue Britons stuck in Europe. &quot;Bulldog spirit&quot;, etc, etc.  11.03am:  I&apos;ve received a statement from Airbus, saying it flew two test planes from Toulouse yesterday, one over France and the other over both France and Germany.  Please see the findings below: A380 MSN 004 landed at 18:00 after 3h50min of flight, and A340-600 MSN 360 landed at 19:40 after 5 hours of flight. The flight test crew did not notice anything abnormal and the post flight inspection showed no irregularities. We have passed the information to the engine manufacturers and the airworthiness authorities to support them in evaluating safe conditions for flight.\u202a   11.17am:  Guardian reporter Sam Jones, out at Heathrow airport, has spotted an aeroplane, presumably one of the first to enter airspace in the south of England since Thursday. &quot;Far too high up to have taken off from here. It looks like an airliner but it is so high up I can&apos;t see it accurately.&quot; I&apos;ve just spoken to the Nats press office, who said &quot;it may well be that it is above 20,000ft&quot; \u2013 however Nats statement at 9am this morning seemed to suggest planes would only be allowed in UK airspace to the south, even if they were above 20,000ft, from 1pm.  Overnight the CAA, in line with new guidance from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) decided flights above the ash cloud will be permitted in the UK; between 1300-1900 this will enable aircraft movements above 20,000ft in UK airspace.  I&apos;m waiting for a call back from Nats press office.  .  11.20am:      Matthew Weaver     &quot;If you&apos;re stranded in Europe the official advice from the Foreign Office is now to head for Calais. Lizzy Davies, from the port says this is sensible advice. She has been talking to cheerful but tired passengers about to board ferries for England. &quot;The general atmosphere is one of calm. Generally things are going off fairly smoothy... People have been left very non-plussed by the idea of HMS Ocean powering to their rescue, lots see it as naked political manoeuvre by Gordon Brown&quot; she said. She added there is only minimal disruption due to the French rail strike.&quot;  11.34am:       Tom Robbins, travel editor of the Observer, emails help for those looking to hire a car:   There&apos;s a shortage of hire cars in numerous European locations, exacerbated by the SNCF strike, but availability varies wildly from location to location. We found cars available today for a pick up in Nice and drop off in Calais for \u00a3127 with Hertz, including one way drop-off fee, but a pick up in Barcelona and drop off in Calais cost \u00a31,632 with Europcar. Because many hire cars are being taken into different countries around Europe, Hertz has set up a special &quot;transfer&quot; website listing cars that need to be returning to their country of origin. Customers who return these cars do not have to pay the usual one-way drop off charges.   11.39am:       Comment from Charlie5000:  Some holiday companies are organising buses to take people stranded in Spain back to the UK. The buses run from Madrid to Gatwick and are a few hundred pounds.Here&apos;s a link to a homepage:lowcostholidays.comAnd a link to their special bus page:Lowcostholidays Stranded Bus Package   I have to say, having looked at the website, it certainly won&apos;t be cheap \u2013 \u00a3399 \u2013 but I suppose many people have paid a lot more than this to get home.  11.51am:  Nats have called me with an update on the aircraft eagle-eyed Sam Jones spotted earlier (see 11.17am). Turns out flights are allowed over 20,000ft before 1pm after all. A spokeswoman admitted the Nats statement was a &quot;little unclear&quot;, but said flights have been allowed over 20,000ft since this morning. &quot;My guess is it is a flight over 20,000ft,&quot; she said. &quot;Or it might be a Met Office scientific plane taking measurements.&quot;&quot;Or it could be a plane flying in uncontrolled airspace.&quot; Nats only controls airspace above 20,000ft, she explained. There is a patchwork below 20,000ft \u2013 called Class G airspace \u2013 where single engined planes can fly, and which Nats doesn&apos;t have control over.      Eurocontrol graphic. Eurocontrol.int    .  11.55am:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Eurocontrol, Europe&apos;s intergovernmental air traffic control body, has published a new map showing the current no fly zones marked in yellow. It recommends that flights should be allowed in lower airspace in the areas marked in green.&quot;  12.03pm:  We have some experts answering questions live at 1pm on the volcano.  Professor Andrew Hooper is a geo-scientist at the Department of Earth Observation and Space Systems at Delft University of Techology in the Netherlands. He spent 18 months doing postdoctoral research at the Nordic Volcanological Centre of the University of Iceland. Dr Grant Allen is an atmospheric scientist at the School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at Manchester University. They&apos;ll be online from 1-2pm, but you can post your queries for them now:Iceland volcano: ask the experts  12.10pm:       From Daniel Cole:   I live in Berlin and am due to be running the London Marathon on Sunday for team Amnesty International (for which I&apos;ve raised $2,000 in sponsorship). I have a flight booked on Saturday morning, but am anxious that it will be cancelled. I have no other contingency plans, what would you recommend my options are now? Ferry from Denmark / Amsterdam \u2013 or even just try and hitch it to Calais?  The UK Foreign Office is advising Britons to travel to Calais \u2013 but that is advice for stranded people desperate to get home. If you were to go for that, however, you could do worse than try and hitch a ride through RoadSharing. But it might be worth hanging on before heading for Calais. There&apos;s an update from Nats on UK airspace due at 3pm, and Eurocontrol should be releasing more information on European airspace too.  12.13pm:       @Airlineindustry: BA aircraft currently en route to LHR are carrying extra fuel to enable a diversion if LHR doesn&apos;t open..      Flightradar.com    .  12.17pm:  Avid blog readers may remember the sight of Flightradar24.com as thousands of planes were grounded over Thursday and Friday. Here&apos;s the latest snap shot of current airline activity across Europe (courtesy of Matthew Weaver). The yellow symbols show where planes are taking off, the blue crosses show closed airports. Quite heartening for some, I&apos;d have thought.       12.20pm:   Drahdiwaberl: That plane Sam Jones spotted over Heathrow at about 11 am was this one: # Reg: D-AIGV# Hex: 3C64F6# Model: Airbus A340-313X (A343)# Airline: Lufthansa# Lat: 51.52831# Lon: -0.90823# Altitude: 32000 feet (9754 m)# Ground speed: 421 knots(780 km/h / 484 mph)# Track: 261\u00b0# Radar: NET2# From : Munich, Franz Josef Strauss (MUC)# To: Miami, Miami (MIA) And it wasn&apos;t the first. Lufthansa and KLM flights have been passing over Britain at over 20,000 ft since at least just after 9am, north-south and east-west, one or two going directly over Heathrow. At least three were Lufthansa from the US.    12.27pm:       \u2022 David Pares&apos;s significant other is still stranded:   Hi again Adam. My Girfriend&apos;s flight has been duly cancelled (for the second time) from Cyprus so they have taken the advice that one of your correspondents gave us on your blog yesterday to fly to Athens and try their luck home from there. Next problem is the embassy told them that trains are all booked up from Athens for the next day or two apparently. They&apos;re gutted they&apos;ve not made it to Santander to ride home on a destroyer... (oh and her exams start in two days).  \u2022 Sabra Wrice puts a different perspective on the disruption:   I was due back in the US on the 17th of April after being here for the past 6 months. I haven&apos;t been home or seen my family since then. I watch the updates every day waiting for them to say we can fly. My flights been rebooked for this Saturday, I am hoping for the best. I keep reading about them going to save stranded Britons, but what about the people who are stranded in Briton? My visa runs out soon and all I want to do is get home.  \u2022 And Emily Wootton&apos;s mum is seeing a lot of Spain:   My mother has been stuck in Spain alone (her first trip by herself) since last Thursday. After traveling on a bus from Malaga to Gibraltar, then via train to Madrid, she is now on another bus to Santander. I have booked her a ferry ticket from there to Portsmouth but not until Monday 26th. All the advice is to get to the French ports but I wonder if you&apos;ve heard anything about people putting on buses etc to get from northern Spain to French ferry ports? All public transport appears to be booked up or on strike. Any help much appreciated as there must be thousands of others all heading the the same direction that cannot get onto ferries from Spain for some time.  I think I put a couple of links up earlier about buses from Madrid to London, or you could take a look at RoadSharing or similar (I&apos;m not on commission from them, just seems to be one of the more handy services).  12.33pm:  Lizzy Davies emails with an update on the scene at Calais: &quot;The queues are substantially longer than they were this morning. They are snaking round the terminal block. That said, people are reporting waits of only around 45 minutes to get a foot passenger ticket.&quot;  12.38pm:  Andy Pietrasik, Guardian travel editor, emails:   According the Times, Stanley Johnson, father of the Mayor of London, has made it on to HMS Albion.    12.43pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Jeremy Lennard was due to start a sub editing shift at the Guardian on Thursday. He&apos;s going to be bit late as he&apos;s stranded in Galicia in Spain. He emails: &quot;I was due to fly in to London tomorrow, but what was to be a two-hour flight is now a 33-hour bus journey that&apos;s going to make me three days late for work, which must be something of a record.  &quot;It was a mad scramble yesterday to get a ticket, and I was lucky to get one. Websites crashed, call centres were overwhelmed and I twice lost reservations while payments waited to go through. In the end I got the last seat available this week. Getting to the Pyrenees is easy, but there is nothing available north from there.  &quot;I&apos;ve been very tempted to make an adventure out of the whole affair by seeing if I could hitch all the way back to London with a piece of cardboard daubed with &apos;volcano victim&apos; or some such on it. &quot;I&apos;m off to buy a couple of good books and one of those horseshoe-shaped pillows to put round your neck.&quot;  12.53pm:  Dan Milmo writes: &quot;It is understood that CAA officials will meet this afternoon to discuss whether the data is reliable and thorough enough to conduct a &quot;risk assessment&quot; on flying in air corridors where there is a low level of volcanic ash.  European Union transport ministers have agreed to establish three types of flying zones comprised of: no-go areas; safe corridors where all flying is permitted; and flight paths that contain ash but do not pose a danger. Lord Adonis told Sky News this afternoon that he is now looking at &quot;safe flying&quot; zones but stressed that safety would be the prime consideration. He added: &quot;It is very clear that this ash problem is not going to go away overnight, which is why we are looking to establish a safety regime which gets airports open, but without in anyway compromising passenger safety.&quot; Adonis has just issued a statement through the Department for Transport. Here is the full text:  &quot;Safety of air passengers remains my paramount concern. All decisions being taken by the aviation regulators are intended solely to protect the travelling public, and I will not compromise passenger safety.&quot; &quot;A number of Scottish airports have been open this morning and services will be operating from some airports in northern England later today.&quot; &quot;I have been in constant dialogue with European and UK regulators on establishing a safe flying regime in areas potentially affected by ash. I held a constructive meeting with airline chief executives and the Civil Aviation Authority this morning. We took stock of work to collect and pool flight data, and information from engine and airframe manufacturers. This work is continuing today as a matter of urgency, including additional test flights, and I will be meeting with airlines, airport operators and the Civil Aviation Authority again this evening.&quot; &quot;We are maintaining increased capacity for passengers to cross the channel. In total there are an extra 20,000 passenger places a day across Eurostar, Eurotunnel and the ferries. HMS Ocean and HMS Ark Royal are on standby to provide additional capacity, so that all travellers who arrive at the channel ports can be conveyed home.&quot; &quot;I will make a further statement later today.&quot;   12.58pm:  Remember our live Q &amp; A is about to start. I&apos;ve just been told there will be a third expert answering your questions \u2013 Chris Yates. &quot;Chris is an independent aviation analyst with expertise onsafety and security. He can answer questions on the effect the ash hasaircraft and their engines.&quot;Iceland volcano: ask the experts  1.04pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;It&apos;s been another hectic day, so here&apos;s a summary of the main points so far: \u2022 A handful of domestic flights have taken off from Scottish airports but air restrictions remain in place after concerns about another ash cloud heading for the UK. Flights in England are unlikely to resume today.  \u2022 Ministers are meeting this afternoon with a view to drawing up safe fly zones in the UK. \u2022 Airspace restrictions have been partially lifted in Europe, with most continental airports open for a reduced flight schedule. \u2022 The Foreign Office is advising Britons stranded in Europe to head for Calais and the other French ports.&quot;      Met Office prediction for 6am BST tomorrow    .  1.13pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;The latest ash cloud forecast doesn&apos;t look good for the UK. The Met Office predictions show the cloud covering all but the north east corner of the UK.&quot;  1.21pm:  Couple of snippets from our Iceland volcano Q&amp;A, which is up and running. Here&apos;s an exhange which should help explain why the ash is hanging around so much. Q: unclecharlie \u2013 &quot;There seems to have been little discussion in the news surrounding how and when changes in the wind may blow the ash away from UK airspace. Is this because they are unlikely to have a major effect? Or is it because such changes are unlikely to happen in the near future (i.e within the next few days)?&quot; A: DrGrantAllen \u2013 &quot;In response to unclecharlie, the reason we can not accurately say when the plume will not be &quot;blown our way&quot; is because we have been subject to what we call a &quot;blocking high&quot;, similar to the weather regime which brought the cold snap in early January. The eventual breakdown of blocking highs is hard to perdict accurately, perhaps only with 2-3 days notice. Currently, and thankfully, it would appear that there is a likelihood that this high pressure system will break down around Friday, which would mean a return to Westerly winds from the Atlantic, which would mean the ash would not be blown South as it has recently.&quot;  1.37pm:       \u2022 Fernando Rodriguez Villegas has some handy advice for those looking to get from Spain to France:  Someone in your blog mentioned that trains Barcelona-Montpellier had been canceled because of the strike. I couldn&apos;t get tickets on those trains so bought bus tickets on ALSA a couple of days ago \u2013 https://www.alsa.es/portal/site/Alsa/. I had to use Paypal since otherwise my (French) credit card refused the transaction but, in principle, got the tickets for a 1:30 am bus to Montpellier. Total for 4 passengers 200 euros. Trip is almost 5 hours. I have tickets on a 15:30 TGV from Montpellier to Paris. If it doesn&apos;t run because of the strike I also have a car reserved at Avis (pickup at train station which is very close to the bus station). When lingering outside the Sants station in Barcelona we were approached by a taxi driver who offered to take us to Perpignan for 400 euros or Montpellier for 700 (basically a 2 euro per kilometer rate). He seemed like a very decent man not a shark actually.  \u2022 Julie Hopkins is concerned about the possibility of a strike in Greece:  My brother-in-law is camped out with us (he should have returned to the UK last Thursday); BA have him booked on a flight this Thursday but even if the flight is able to go because of the ash, we have been told there is a national strike planned in Greece for Thursday and Friday. Rumours are that it may be cancelled. Does anyone have any accurate, up-to-date info?  \u2022 Jonathan Shipley has a dilemma readers may be able to help with:  Another question for you, if I may. I&apos;m another traveller stranded outside the uk; in NY as it happens, so it&apos;s not been a terrible burden. But nevertheless I do need to get back and am very unsure what to do. My dilemma is that AA rescheduled me onto a flight back from Chicago first thing tomorrow am (weds) which I have no way of knowing will happen or not. (Flying into Heathrow). In order to make it, I&apos;m booked onto a flight to Chicago this evening. My question is, do I complete that first leg of the flight? If I use it and the second leg doesn&apos;t happen, will I find it harder rescheduling again? I&apos;d rather be in NY than Chicago, as work has an office here, but I&apos;ll be furious with myself if I stay here and then the Chicago flight leaves as planned tomorrow. Any advice? Bit of a tricky one, I know...   1.41pm:  James Meikle has been speaking to BA and has an update on their flights which are bound for the UK:  &quot;BA has 12 long haul flights in the air hoping to land at Heathrow, and plans another 17 today.  It has already put contingency plans in place for them to land at other continental European airports if the dreaded ash stymies hopes of reopening airspace over London. The flights are on their way from east Asia, the west coast of the US, Mauritius and Mexico.&quot;   1.44pm:  It&apos;s all go over on the live Q &amp; A, well worth checking out. Snippet from DrGrantAllen:  In response to amiismith, the plume that is currently over the UK is contained in thin layers that exist near 2-3 km altitude with evidence of other thin layers at 7 km and 11 km. This infomration is measured by Lidars - or laser detection and ranging devices which are similar to radars. They can detect dust layers high in the atmosphere. It is these instruments that are best equipped to monitor the plume as it moves over the UK.   1.59pm:  Press release from IllicitEncounters.com \u2013 a &quot;dating site for married people&quot;. It seems the volcano has encouraged people to abandon fidelity.  IllicitEncounters.com, the UK&apos;s largest dating site for married people, has seen an unexpected surge in members and non-members logging on to the site from mobile devices in the last 4 days. The site suggests the increase can be attributed to the thousands of Brits stuck here and abroad, with nothing but their iPhones to amuse them. On average, IllicitEncounters.com receives around 7% of its traffic from mobile devices; on Friday 16th, this figure had risen to 15%. Over the weekend, the site received over 8,500 visits from mobile devices; traditionally, this figure would have been around 2,900. Adam Scott, CEO of the website, comments; &quot;Boredom and frustration mean that those stuck in airports across the world will be looking for the most stimulating, exciting thing they can get anyway with on their mobile. And what&apos;s more exciting than the idea of having an illicit affair?&quot;  IllicitEncounters.com are notoriously optimistic. I seem to remember the cold weather also prompted a surge in adultery. Look out for the World Cup causing a wave of extra-marital affairs in June.  2.04pm: The government has chartered a fleet of 100 coaches in Madrid to bus back Brits from Spain. Gordon Brown said the Spanish capital was now a &quot;hub&quot; for Brits stranded in Asia, Africa and America, as is possible to get there by plane. &quot;We&apos;re putting on coaches from Madrid. There&apos;s 100 already there in Madrid to do it,&quot; he told BBC Radio One&apos;s Newsbeat programme. &quot;In addition, people are coming with HMS Albion, which is bringing some of our troops back from Afghanistan through Santander in Spain.&quot;  (This is Matthew Weaver taking over from Adam, who has gone off for a well-earned break. You can email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk or reach on Twitter at @matthew_weaver).  2.19pm: The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, is to meet airline industry bosses at 6pm today to discuss the setting up of possible safe-fly zones, according to our transport correspondent Dan Milmo.      British passengers board HMS Albion at Santander port in Spain after flight restrictions were imposed due to volcanic ash. Photograph: Markel Redondo/Getty Images    2.22pm:  HMS Albion has just left the Spanish port of Santander carrying stranded Brits including a 31 14-year-old boys on football tour. Stanley Johnson, the father of London mayor Boris, was also on board. Others weren&apos;t so lucky. Pub landloord Denis Ryan, told the Sun: &quot;Gordon Brown&apos;s been on television saying he&apos;s sending this ship to northern Spain to bring us home and David Miliband&apos;s been doing the same thing. &quot;We made this horrendous journey to get here only to discover a select few people that are being allowed on the boat. I don&apos;t understand why they told us to come.&quot;  2.30pm: BA has cancelled all short and long haul departures today, it has just confirmed. &quot;We deeply regret the great inconvenience caused to our customers,&quot; it said in a statement. The Unite union, which represents BA&apos;s cabin crew, is concerned about the possible loss of jobs as result of all this.      A British family get ready to board the Royal Navy warship HMS Albion at Santander's port, Spain. Photograph: Alvaro Barrientos/AP    2.41pm:  The government is getting a anxious about possible compensation claims from those who have not been lucky enough to be ferried back to Blighty by the Navy. Could this explain the apparent hesitation at using HMS Ocean and HMS Ark Royal? If the go-ahead is given, commanders estimate they could take about 800 passengers on the Ocean and about 1,000 on the Ark Royal.       2.51pm:  Coaches in Madrid, what coaches? Our Madrid correspondent Giles Tremlett emails from Barajas airport: &quot;Weary Britons are already arriving at Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport in the hope of getting on one of the coaches that authorities have said will eventually run from here to the Channel ports. Consular officials are having to deal with angry travellers who have discovered that the promised coach service does not exist. Embassy officials say they are working hard on the logistics but, for the moment, their advice is for everyone to make their own way to the Channel.&quot;  2.57pm: Emailer Rebecca Bridgland wants more details about those buses in Madrid. She writes:    Where do the buses go from in madrid? Where can people register? When shall they start running? Is there still going to be a service on Friday evening \u2013 when my colleague gets back via Angola and Lisbon from South Africa.  We&apos;ll try to get some answers.  3.00pm: Flight restrictions will remain in place in the UK until at least 1am tomorrow except for parts of Scotland and part of northern England, air traffic control company Nats said.  3.02pm: More big news and something of an embarrassment for the prime minister: Gordon Brown&apos;s plan to send two Royal Navy ships to the rescue of Britons stranded at Calais have been called off. Richard Norton-Taylor writes:   &quot;The prime minister announced the dramatic move yesterday but today officials say that neither the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, nor HMS Ocean will be used - not least because the commerical ferry operators seem to be coping well, and both ships were too big to get into Calais anyway.  &quot;HMS Albion has just set sail from Santander in northern Spain with 290 British civilians and 200 troops aboard. It&apos;s due to dock in the UK tomorrow night or Thursday morning.&quot;  Here&apos;s some footage of disappointed tourists who were turned away from boarding the HMS Albion.  3.26pm: Max Benato, one of the Guardian&apos;s foriegn editors, made it in to work today after a long journey back from the Alps. She writes:  Things were looking pretty grim for us at 4.30am yesterday when we dragged three kids out of bed in the small ski resort of Vaujany, about one and half hours south of Grenoble. The ski company were shipping us home on a bus, a pretty unattractive prospect in the first place but made worse when we got to the 60-seater coach and found it was overbooked (a family of four decided to disembark and take their chances on getting a bus to Lyon and then train from there - &quot;a couple of nights in Lyon can&apos;t be as bad as this&quot;).  We then discovered that not only was the bus full to bursting but the chance was our bladders would be too as there was no loo! As it turned out, we had a couple of fabulous French drivers, Henri and Geoff, who drove like a dream, kept us fully informed, gave us plenty of stops and got us on to a ferry at Calais three hours ahead of schedule.  We arrived at Gatwick at 10pm last night, all agreeing that actually it hadn&apos;t been too bad at all and probably a lot more enjoyable than bedding down at an airport for an interminable wait. But then again, I&apos;m at work today and not dealing with an overtired, grumpy seven-year-old.   3.44pm: Ryanair has extended the cancellation of its northern European flights until Thursday at 1pm. Thats all routes to the UK, UK, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, France, Germany, Poland, Baltic States and north Italy. It has also cancelled all of its flights between Ireland and the UK until 1pm on Friday 23 April.  3.50pm: The Foreign Office is still vague on those coaches in Madrid. It says: &quot;Coaches are being gathered in the UK and Spain and will be dispatched to Madrid over the next few days. There are 150 coaches available in the UK to go to Spain and 50 of these will be leaving for Spain tomorrow.&quot; But where are they?  3.54pm: By popular demand here is a link to our popular &quot;make your own volcano&quot; suggested activity for the Easter holidays.  3.57pm: More on the HMS Ocean. It&apos;s not going to Calais as revealed here earlier (3.02pm). But sources now claim it might go to Cherbourg later this week. Ark Royal is heading off for a military exercise elsewhere.  4.01pm: Maev Kennedy&apos;s son is stranded in China. She writes:  Wild excitement this morning among the 40 pupils and four teachers in the Shanghaied school geography trip, including my son Samuel, stranded in 5 star luxury: they were told to pack their cases, they might be getting a flight this morning.  The cases are still packed. They&apos;ve just been told they might get a flight &quot;to somewhere&quot; late tonight. Meanwhile such is the boredom level that Samuel and Ben Austin-Duch, and their friend Lewis Lunson, in adjoining rooms, have taken to corresponding by letter.  Their school, Orleans Park in Twickenham, is so short staffed, with four including the deputy head in China and 12 more scattered around the globe, that each year has been asked to take a day off this week - so as far as the children are concerned, everyone gets a small share of the travellers&apos; good luck.   4.11pm:Foreign secretary David Miliband was evasive about both the coaches in Madrid and the HMS Ocean and HMS Ark Royal in the Channel. Speaking to BBC News 24 he couldn&apos;t say when the coaches would arrive and his tone was distinctly different on the ships from announcements yesterday. He said they would be there to ferry passengers &quot;if needed&quot;.  4.17pm: Why not fly old-fashioned piston planes? asks the Observer&apos;s Travel editor Tom Robbins. He writes:   &quot;While volcanic ash is damaging to jet engines, old-fashioned piston-engined planes are apparently unaffected. Private aviation company PrivateFly.com says it has been chartering piston planes across Europe in the last few days to get passengers moving.  About 20 of its clients have travelled overland to Le Touquet in northern France then flown in piston-engined planes back to UK airports.  Others have used piston planes to fly from the UK to Ireland, and domestically in the UK. Michelle McGovern from Dublin, who was left stranded in London on Sunday after a planned business day trip and unable to get home to her newborn baby, used the company to arrange a PA31 Piper Chieftain propeller aircraft from Lydd airfield in Kent to Dublin Western airport, with operator LyddAir.  Also on Sunday, telecommunications executive Andrew Reid and his wide Katy used a Cessna 182 piston aircraft, operated by PropStar, to fly from Kemble airfield near Cirencester to Aberdeen International in order to reaach the wedding celebrations of Olympic cycling star Sir Chris Hoy.  &quot;We were so thrilled to make it against the odds and it certainly added a note of drama to the occasion!,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;We enjoyed the flight too - it was a great way to travel&quot;.   4.21pm: Sam Jones has the latest from Heathrow:  &quot;Volunteers from United Sikhs, a global humanitarian relief charity, have been going round the arrivals hall of Heathrow Terminal 3 giving people rice and daal for lunch.  For some its their first hot meal for four days. There were around 500 people waiting in Terminal 3 when we heard over the tanoy that all flights are cancelled for today. People have now turned their attention to where to sleep tonight - whether its going to be the hotel floor or a local hotel.&quot;  (That&apos;s it for now.

I was in St Moritz after riding the famous Glacier Express railway across the top of the Alps from Zermatt, an eight-hour journey through scandalously spectacular scenery. During the trip I&apos;d passed the valley in which Europe&apos;s biggest glacier, the monstrous Aletsch, edges it&apos;s way downhill. This 27bn-tonne river of ice is, like most glaciers, shrinking as a result of global warming. I once went to the, perhaps excessive, length of circumnavigating the world without flying as part of my own personal exploration of the relationship between travel, carbon emissions and climate change. The retreat of Aletsch was a stark reminder of that journey and the motivations behind it. It&apos;s almost two years to the day since I returned from that trip and during the intervening period I&apos;ve become a passionate advocate of overland travel \u2013 even in the absence of belching volcanoes. Its not just for eco-geek reasons of carbon-emission efficiency, although if you need a justification for taking the train then I&apos;d argue that&apos;s a pretty good one. I love the simple pleasures that overland forms of travel like rail can bring; the rhythmic rumble of the wheels beneath you and the rolling vista of ever-changing views outside your window to name but two. It&apos;s intriguing that many of the stranded British passengers returning to the UK have mentioned the &quot;adventure&quot;, &quot;challenge&quot; and surprising joys of their return trips. &quot;There was so much to see!&quot; exclaimed one 81-year-old woman whose son had just driven her back from Switzerland. In recent years it has seemed that the unfettered growth of aviation would likely continue unchecked, despite high-profile politicking and protests around Heathrow&apos;s proposed third runway. Campaign groups, like Plane Stupid with their polar bears plunging from the sky, and Greenpeace&apos;s ingenious Airplot sit in stark contrast to the slightly disingenuous findings of the Government&apos;s own Committee on Climate Change. Their report at the tail-end of 2009 loudly trumpeted a vibrant future of aviation growth. Provided we decarbonise the rest of the economy by 90%. Lured by ludicrously low prices we Brits rapidly developed a dependency on cheap flights. Then the banks imploded, recession bit and the pound plummeted against the euro. These circumstances gave birth last year to &quot;staycation&quot;, when many of us swapped a continental twang for a UK holiday. Seventeen million fewer people took a flight last year, a drop of 7% on 2008 and the lowest level of aviation in six years. In the context of an annual 218,126,313 flying passengers, this isn&apos;t exactly the end of the jet-age of travel, but it&apos;s a definite shift and we&apos;re perhaps seeing the birth of a new trend \u2013 the &quot;traincation&quot;. Blended words like staycation and traincation can be rather clunky and inelegant. I can vouch for this personally after my own ill-fated attempts to launch &quot;frucool&quot; (frugal + cool) on a largely uninterested world. One online wit suggested it was something only a &quot;twunt&quot; would come up with. But with or without the recent intervention from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, there&apos;s real substance behind the emerging traincation trend, which is enough to warm the cockles of slow-travelling hearts everywhere. A survey by green lifestyle charity Global Cool recently found that just over half of Britons are now considering swapping planes for trains \u2013 a real milestone given our apparent addiction to flying. And it&apos;s not difficult to identify some of the factors driving this change. Like the increasing amount of time we&apos;re expected to loiter in airport terminals, or the latest airport security scanners that leave little to the furtive imagination, and for many are an invasion of privacy too far. Perhaps it&apos;s the cramped seat, poor food and mercenary tactics of the budget carriers with their convoluted rafts of hidden costs, luggage restrictions and uncanny ability to fly you only vaguely near your ultimate destination? It might not be the end of the affair, but the honeymoon period may well be coming to an end for us and budget airlines. There are sticking points, of course, namely cost and convenience. If the emerging traincation trend is to have any momentum and longevity then these will have to improve. At present it is usually more expensive and more challenging to book continental train travel than bagging a seat on a short-haul flight. But change is afoot. The travelling public are waking up to the fact that city centre to city centre travel by rail can be broadly comparable in cost to a superficially cheap flight that then has city to airport travel at either end, taxes, luggage fees and a miscellany of other incremental fees bolted on. Plus, the opening of new high-speed rail links, like the Brussels-Amsterdam line, means that the difference in journey time between train and plane for many popular destinations is narrowing. Booking is still a struggle, but websites like seat61.com and loco2.co.uk are demystifying these arcane processes, and simple &quot;one-click&quot; continental train booking can&apos;t be too far away. Perhaps cost, convenience and craters aren&apos;t the only drivers for this shift. Desire for comfort, and concern about climate change, might also be influencing travel behaviour. Global Cool&apos;s survey also revealed that 83% of travellers want their journeys to be greener, and there&apos;s no argument that the extra legroom and ability to move around freely on trains is a key selling point. It works for me. As I whizzed my way smoothly to Switzerland and back and crossed the Alps courtesy of Eurostar, SNCF and the Glacier Express to St Moritz I was convinced the traincation is the way forward. Nibbling on a smoked salmon blini and sipping champagne as the magnificent mountain panoramas unfurled around me, I wondered if the denizens of St Moritz with their private jets and bejewelled canines knew what they were missing. Who needs a volcano to experience the joys of slow? \u2022 Ed Gillespie went around the world without flying in 2007/8.", "sentences": ["Plus, the opening of new high-speed rail links, like the Brussels-Amsterdam line, means that the difference in journey time between train and plane for many popular destinations is narrowing."], "title": "Icelandic volcano: is this the start of the 'traincation'?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/20/train-rail-st-moritz-switzerland", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Switzerland holidays", "Travel", "Green travel", "Skiing holidays", "Alps holidays", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Environment", "Ethical and green living", "Volcanoes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-21T07:10:36Z", "article": "     6.04pm:  That&apos;s it for today, just time for a bit of a round up: Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control agency, said 21,000 of the continent&apos;s 28,000 scheduled flights were going ahead Wednesday. Almost all restrictions in Europe have been lifted by air traffic controllers, however there remain some closures of airspace over parts of Britain, Ireland and France. Elsewhere today Giovanni Bisignani, head of the International Air Transport Association, called the economic fallout from the six-day travel shutdown &quot;devastating&quot; and urged European governments to examine ways to compensate airlines for lost revenues, as the US government did following the 11 September 2001 attacks. He said it would take three years for the industry to recover from the week of lost flying time. Airlines lost $400 million each day during the first three days of grounding, Bisignani told a news conference today. At one stage, 29% of global aviation and 1.2m passengers a day were affected Back in the UK the transport secretary, Andrew Adonis, has denied that the government decided to reopen the skies to air travel under pressure from airlines. &quot;They have obviously wanted to be able to fly their planes of course they have but that has not been the issue at stake here,&quot; he told the BBC today. And a last bit of travel advice - both the Heathrow and Gatwick express will be running throughout the night to ensure passengers affected by flight restrictions can make it to and from the airports. Thanks for reading, and for the emails and comments  5.59pm:  Now look out for a row which is brewing over airlines bid to end rules that oblige them to help stranded travellers - see 3.39pm. Consumer group Which? while recognising no one could have foreseen the last week when the rules were drawn up, told my colleague James Meikle this evening: &quot;Without legislation we would have thousands and thousands of people stranded abroad without means of getting home, and without being looked after.  &quot;While we understand airlines are not to blame for anything that has happened over the last 7 days, passengers are consumers, and they need to be protected when something goes wrong.&quot;  5.54pm:  TUI Travel, whose chief executive earlier today described the governments response to the crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot;, (see 2.20pm) has calmed down. Dan Milmo&apos;s just forwarded me this statement:  &quot;Today, TUI Travel PLC and Thomas Cook Group PLC held a constructive meeting with the Transport Secretary which focused on the repatriation of stranded customers following the closure of airspace as a result of volcanic ash. We are pleased that Lord Adonis has recognised the importance of repatriation and the efforts we have undertaken in this area. We welcome the call for similar efforts across the rest of the travel sector. Separately, the companies have met with the Civil Aviation Authority and recognise their efforts in engaging with manufactures which has resulted in the new guidance issued yesterday, that has allowed air space to reopen.&quot;  And now they&apos;ve stopped criticising the government, transport secretary Andrew Adonis has recognised the &quot;great efforts&quot; made by travel companies. His statement:  &quot;I recognise the great efforts that tour operators are making to bring their customers home as quickly as possible and I want to see similar efforts made across the rest of the travel sector.&quot; &quot;Tour operators make a huge contribution to UK Plc. I have held productive discussions with the industry leaders today and will maintain a continuing dialogue over the coming hours and days.&quot;   5.40pm:  Severin Carrell has forwarded a statement from Highlands &amp; Islands Airports - which runs all Scottish airports north of Aberdeen and Glasgow - that serves as a reminder that the ash isn&apos;t completely gone yet.  &quot;HIA regrets to advise that all scheduled Loganair services from the current time until at least 13:00 hrs local time on Thursday, 22 April have now been cancelled. &quot;The continued presence of significant levels of volcanic ash in many parts of Scottish airspace \u2013 including &quot;no-fly&quot; zones ordered by the CAA and National Air Traffic Services which now cover Stornoway, Shetland and Orkney \u2013 and the forecast for tomorrow shows no material change for Loganair&apos;s operations.&quot;  &quot;This means all its islands services to the Inner Hebrides, Western Isles and northern Isles have been cancelled,&quot; says Severin.  5.24pm:  My colleague Andy Pietrasik emails:   EasyJet will today and tomorrow operate 15 special rescue flights to and from the UK to bring home passengers whose flights have been cancelled over the last week due to airspace closure. The airline has chartered additional aircraft over the next few days to collect passengers from Sharm El Sheikh, Madeira, Malta, Malaga and Alicante from its UK hubs. It says this will allow it to carry an additional 3,000 passengers who are stranded abroad. The flights are only for passengers who have previously had their booking cancelled. They should go to easyJet.com and log into the &quot;My easyJet&quot; section to transfer on to the new flights.   5.06pm:  Upbeat video/slideshow from fionahawthorne charting her family&apos;s journey to London from the south of Spain via &quot;hire car, coach, metro, train and ferry...&quot;  Set to the music of &apos;Red Plastic Bag&apos;.             .  4.38pm:       Sam Jones has been talking to people at Heathrow:  &quot;Mick Cutler&apos;s journey home may not have been quite such an odyssey, but the event that preceded it certainly was. Cutler, a 38-year-old NCO in the RAF, had just finished a 14-day, 1607-mile bike ride from San Diego in California to Galveston in Texas with five air force friends when the cloud put paid to their homeward plans. &quot; We should have been flying back on Saturday, but we got out in the early hours of Tuesday and we missed the open airspace last night and got diverted to Nice. Then we were put up overnight in Nice and looked after very well by BA. Being away for three weeks with a family waiting at home was tricky, then there was the uncertainty of not knowing when we would get here. We just had to make the best out of a bad situation really, but we were all anxious to get home as quickly as possible. British Airways picked up a lot of it. They were looking after us but there were the odd bits and pieces \u2013 like toiletries \u2013 that we had to buy, and obviously there was our washing and things like that. I probably spent about $150 and then about 100 Euros in Nice as well. I&apos;m looking forward to meeting up with the family. I&apos;ve got two young boys who kept asking when I was coming home. I&apos;m lucky that I have a very understanding wife. She&apos;s over the moon now.&quot; The scene upstairs in departures, under Terminal 5&apos;s massive steel and glass roof, was a little different. Huge electronic screens advising people to check their flights online did not seem to have stopped hundreds of travellers from turning up and trying their luck. Others had no choice. Conrad Seidel, a 23-year-old student from Stuttgart, was passing the time by playing slaps with his new friend Anna Schwalm, 20, from Frankfurt, who he had met while they were stranded in Vancouver. Although they were on the first flight back into Heathrow last night, which touched down at ten to 10, the young Germans were still a little way from home. &quot;We were always on standby in Vancouver - for five nights,&quot; said Conrad. &quot;We got here on the first flight \u2013 at 10 o&apos;clock last night. I should have been at university a week ago; I thought I&apos;d get there last week, but I got stuck. We slept here last night.[British Airways] gave us blankets and I wrote all my professors and they said it was fine. We&apos;re exhausted. I really want to emphasise that BA did a great job. It wasn&apos;t their fault \u2013 it wasn&apos;t a strike or anything. They kept us up to date and gave us a hotel and food vouchers and came to out hotel to tell us what was happening. British Airways honestly did a really, really good job. I would definitely go with them again. Other airlines just said: &apos;Ring this number.&apos;&quot;   4.22pm:  My new Twitter friend lefran, stuck in Japan, has some advice for anyone trying to get hold of KLM:      @lefran @adamgabbatt nothing worked for me until i contacted KLM on twitter, i&apos;d suggest everyone flying with KLM to get in touch with them on twitter because it took me 2 hours to get hold of them on the phone for them to say they wouldnt help, 10 minutes on twitter!  4.12pm:  Just been on the phone to the Guardian&apos;s Sam Jones, who&apos;s been at Heathrow Terminal 5 today.  &quot;The Sun has a couple of &apos;page 3 stunners&apos; welcoming people back into the country and giving them a little carrier bag with a copy of the Sun in.  This afternoon I met people who got the first flight in from Vancouver at 9.50pm last night, but were still having to rough it in the airport until they could catch their next flight out.  It doesn&apos;t feel very busy at all in arrivals, photographers and members of the press aside, but it&apos;s a bit busier upstairs in departures. But overall it&apos;s very calm, with not many people about.&quot;   4.01pm:  James Meikle has forwarded me a handy FAQ by Stewart John, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and past President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. &quot;The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch.&quot; \u2022 How do we know how much ash an engine can cope with? &quot;No-one knows the answer to this. The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch. Some ash will go straight through the engine without having any effect whilst some will get caught up. The speed, density of ash cloud, size of ash particles, temperature and wind all have an impact \u2013 in short there are just too many variables and it&apos;s extremely difficult!&quot; \u2022 Does ash affect the fuel efficiency of an engine? &quot;Ash only affects fuel efficiency if it starts clogging up the airways. The engine would fail before fuel efficiency became a real problem.&quot; \u2022 What has been learned from the test flights? &quot;Everything! They are what have shown that the flights are safe. They are the ultimate practical test and if there can be any criticism of this it&apos;s that there weren&apos;t test flights being done under controlled conditions right from the moment this crisis started.&quot; \u2022 On what evidence are the new CAA rules based? &quot;They&apos;re based on the results of the test flights. It&apos;s essentially a case of suck it and see.&quot; \u2022 What ash-damage checks will airlines have to make? &quot;Ash-damage will be checked extremely carefully. From the outside they will look at the fuel, air and oil filters. As well as this they will use borescopes to assess any internal damage to the engine. They have very sophisticated methods for doing this now and engines are designed with holes for borescopes for use in routine inspections. All these tests are objective tests that can be tested factually rather than subjective ones, so it&apos;s extremely rigorous.&quot; \u2022 Why can we fly now when days ago the advice said &apos;no tolerance for any ash whatsoever&apos;? &quot;The rules that said don&apos;t fly through ash were put in place a long time ago and it&apos;s basically been a case of updating them. You&apos;ve got to remember that thirty years ago no-one would have considered flying a twin engine across the Atlantic \u2013 you&apos;d have had to have four engines. New rules were made as part of EROPS (Extended range over water Operations) and at first twin-engine aircraft were never allowed to be more than 60 minutes from land, then 90 and eventually 240. Recently I was in a twin-engine plane that made the 16 hour flight to Hong Kong. Even 10 years ago we&apos;d never have done this. We&apos;d never faced this ash scenario before and it&apos;s been a case of learning to update \u2013 rules change as we get more confident and learn more about what we can do. It&apos;s just like a baby learning to walk. You move with the times as you gain confidence.&quot;  3.51pm:       Severin Carrell has an update on the situation in Scotland:  Aberdeen airport is still &quot;very much open and operational&quot; despite a new flying ban now affecting northern Scotland and the North Sea, a BAA spokeswoman has said.Three airports, on Orkney, Shetland and at Wick in Caithness, have been closed since 1pm after national air traffic control warned of a new ash cloud. The same plume led North Sea helicopter operators to suddenly ground all their oil and gas platform flights from Aberdeen after two Bond helicopters found ash coating their windscreens.But Sarah Campbell, a BAA spokeswoman at Aberdeen, said that only the far north of Scotland was affected; helicopter flights had now started again to the east and south-east. The only passenger flights grounded were to Lerwick, Kirkwall and Wick.&quot;Aberdeen airport is still very much open and operational. This afternoon a couple of routes have been affected by conditions to the north so there have been some cancellations but the majority of our routes are normal just now,&quot; she said.   3.39pm:  The Board of Airline Representatives in the UK, which represents over 90 airlines, has called on the UK government to tackle the EU Commission over unfair EU Regulations against member state airlines. Mike Carrivick, BAR UK chief executive, said today that regulation that forced airlines to provide for passengers during the disruption should not have been applicable in this case. He said the regulation was never meant to &quot;wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time&quot;. Full statement:  &quot;The eagerness of the EU and the UK government to publicly state that airlines have a responsibility under EU Regulation EU261/2004, to accommodate and feed passengers booked on flights cancelled by the volcanic disruptions, is a misuse of the regulation. &quot;Regulation EU261/2004 was intended to apply when airlines had individual delays or cancelled flights. It was never intended to apply to wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time. It is also relevant that airlines cannot immediately resume normal services from the moment that the airspace restrictions are lifted. This Regulation, when used in this way, is draconian, disproportionate and often impractical. &quot;In this particular situation, passengers have in all probability been delayed a lot longer than they might have been and airlines have lost millions every day as a result.&quot;   3.31pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Thomas Cook has confirmed that one of a rescue flight to Crete had to return to Manchester airport today after a technical fault. It insisted that the reason for the return was &apos;purely a precaution&apos; and had nothing to do with ash, but the pilot remarked on the &apos;intense&apos; smell of volcanic ash before the flight was sent back.  &apos;For information we got the smell of the ash from about 16,000ft in the climb,&apos; the pilot said in a recording spotted by Airline Industry Review.  A Thomas Cook woman said: &apos;Safety is of paramount importance to us so when the Thomas Cook Airlines TCX 952P developed a minor technical fault with its air conditioning, we took the decision to return the aircraft to Manchester as a precautionary measure. The development of the fault categorically had nothing to do with volcanic ash and whilst there were no customers on board, at no point were our crew or the aircraft in any danger. The plane will be back in service later today and will join the many Thomas Cook Airlines rescue flights currently returning stranded passengers to the UK.&apos;&quot;  3.27pm:       Stankle is unimpressed with Monarch:   @kimmiedunja  I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet I&apos;ll tell you; a friend of mine had her return journey to portugal booked through Monarch. When flights were first cancelled, monarch&apos;s response was &quot;you&apos;re on your own love - not our problem&quot;. Now flights have restarted - they kindly offered to fly her and her daughter back from portugal for \u00a31k.   3.21pm:  My colleague James Meikle has been given the latest figures on Heathrow&apos;s operations today.  Normally the airport would have 657 departures today, but the plan at the moment is for 422. It would normally have 655 arrivals, but the plan at the moment is for 343.   3.07pm:       kimmiedunja comments on the TUI/Thomas Cook criticism of the government (see 2.20pm):  Have to say I&apos;m with the TUI bosses here. Mum and her husband have been stuck in Cyprus with Thomson and although they haven&apos;t had much information from the tour operator they have been extremely well looked after: staying at the same (posh) hotel rather than being downgraded to save Thomson money, moved from half to full board, and increased entertainments etc to keep the stranded happy. My maternal grandmother was rushed to hospital whilst mum was away, and she has been duly anxious - so Thomson have ensured she&apos;s on the first flight back, and should land at Manchester in a couple of hours. I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet.   2.58pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Here&apos;s a great idea for anyone who&apos;s bored waiting for a plane: Andrew Losowsky, currently stranded in Dublin, is trying to put together a magazine written by and for &quot;fellow strandees&quot;. Working titles include Grounded, SkyFail and Someday We&apos;ll Fly Away.  Blogging from the airport he writes: &quot;If all goes well, the results will be published, probably via MagCloud and/or the Newspaper Club, and any proceeds sent to a charity that helps mitigate the effects of climate change on human populations. After all, we have to repent somehow. Who&apos;s in?&quot; Strandees are invited to answer four questions.&quot;  2.53pm:  jmbriggs, first name John, has been keeping a video diary of his volcano-affected journey from Riga to London on YouTube. Here&apos;s an entry from the room of his ferry from Lithuania to Germany. John suspects his travel companions have been accusing him of sounding like a warthog, which seems a little unfair.             Elsewhere the Guardian has a gallery of images taken as flights resumed today.  2.39pm:  Guardian travel editor, Andy Pietrasik, emails:  Iceland Express has started to resume flights between Reykjavik and London. Iceland Express was the first airline to leave London Gatwick at 01:35 on 21 April 2010. The flight carried 62 passengers to Keflavik Airport, Reykjavik, onboard a Boeing 757-200.   2.36pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Gordon Brown appeared to hint that some night flights, or a relaxation of flight time rules, might be possible to get stranded passengers back. &apos;Now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you&apos;ll find our airports are open longer to make that possible,&apos; the PM said at an election meeting in Cardiff recorded by ITN. He was also evasive about those illusive coaches in Spain. &apos;There are coaches for people in Spain if they need it, but most people will want to come back via the airline or the charter that they have already booked,&apos; he said.&quot;             .  2.33pm:  National Express is providing nearly 3000 coach seats to/from Dover and London today, a press release has just announced. &quot;A new 24-hour coach operation has been put in place tonight from Dover to help those arriving from Calais throughout the night to get home. 20 different departure times will depart to London where onward UK connections can be made.&quot; Here&apos;s the timetable for services from Dover to London: 0455, 0525, 0625, 0725, 0835, 0930, 1015, 1115, 1215, 1315, 1415, 1515, 1615, 1715, 1825, 2010, 2200, 0000, 0200, 0330 For people aged 16-59 it&apos;s \u00a313.90, a spokeswoman has just told me. Under 16s, people 60 and over and disabled can travel for \u00a36.95. The coach brings you in to London Victoria, where &quot;connections to 1000 UK destinations can be made&quot;.  2.20pm:  Is the government letting Ryanair and easyJet get away with abandoning passengers? That&apos;s what TUI Travel and Thomas Cook appear to be suggesting, writes Matthew Weaver:     Matthew Weaver    &quot;The chief executive of TUI travel, which owns Thomson and First Choice, has described the government&apos;s response to the volcanic ash crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot; in a joint statement with Thomas Cook this afternoon. &quot;It became apparent that the government is condoning a two tier system between the way low cost airlines and airlines of holiday companies operate,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Some low cost airlines stated that their focus would be to commence normal flying schedules as soon as possible and made it clear that it was the government&apos;s responsibility to repatriate their customers. We believe this is a flawed and inequitable approach that is to the disadvantage of consumers.&quot; &quot;It is clear that the Government has put no pressure on low cost airlines to implement their own equivalent repatriation plans,&quot; the statement added. In the statement the two companies contrasted the conduct of low cost airlines with the efforts they have made to bring passengers home. &quot;TUI Travel and Thomas Cook immediately activated their crisis plans when the full implications of the volcano eruption became clear last Wednesday 14 April. Due to airspace being closed, over the weekend TUI Travel repatriated customers via coaches, ferries and owned cruise ships. First Choice and Thomson are now repatriating 21,000 customers today and 32,000 tomorrow with the remainder of its customers being repatriated by Friday.&quot; Peter Long, TUI travel chief executive said: &quot;The Government&apos;s response to the crisis has been a shambles. It is clear that they underestimated the severity of the consequences of the decision for a blanket closure of the airspace for such a protracted period of time.  &quot;This has been compounded by the fact that they have neither put in place a viable repatriation plan or ensured that the industry behaves in a consistent and responsible manner.&quot;  2.05pm:       Severin Carrell with the latest on the North Sea airspace:  North Sea helicopters have been grounded and flights from Aberdeen banned again after the ash plume shifted again, closing air space north east of Peterhead in north east Scotland. The North Sea helicopter operator Bond said two of its aircraft encountered ash in rain clouds 70 miles offshore: they landed to find a coating on ash on their windscreens, but there were no deposits in their engines. &quot;A no fly area has been imposed again,&quot; a Bond spokesman said. The new closure will increase pressure on the oil and gas industry&apos;s system of rotating workers on and off their platforms: for the last five days, many flights have been replaced by slower and more demanding boat trips to the rigs.   2.00pm:  Matt Weaver has spotted that the Foreign Office is using Twitter to offer guidance to Liverpool fans traveling to Madrid for the game.      @ukinspain #Liverpool_Atletico: We&apos;ll be tweeting advice for fans tomorrow so follow us on your mobile (check your operator&apos;s charges).  1.54pm:       Giles Tremlett, our Madrid correspondent at Barajas airport emails:  Foreign office minister Chris Bryant was one of the first members of the government to start flying today, reaching Madrid this morning to study the &quot;hub&quot; operation set up for stranded Britons in the Spanish capital.  Between ten and twenty coaches will leave from Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport Terminal 4 for Channel ports during the day.  &quot;I really don&apos;t want to pretend that we can do everything because we can&apos;t,&quot; Bryant told the BBC. &quot;The main thrust now has to be by the airlines and tour operators.&quot; The embassy has a desk set up in the departures hall where people are joining the queue to get on the buses. Passengers are a mix of those who have been stuck in Madrid for days and others arriving on intercontinental flights.  Two coaches have left already, with two to three drivers on each coach to go straight through to Calais. Free bottles of water, but no toilets on some of them. The drivers say it will take them around 17 hours to Calais.   1.50pm:  Severin Carrell emails to confirm North Sea helicopter flights have been grounded \u2013 showing the plume is heading south again, potentially affecting more services.  We&apos;ll keep you posted.  1.39pm:       Tommyben: &quot;If you have a long wait for a flight it might still be worth going by land and water as most trains and ferries have capacity. Have a look at www.flightlesstravel.com for some alternative travel routes.&quot; The FlightlessTravel website is worth looking at. They have tips on travelling by cargo ship, which sound great fun.  1.30pm:  Rail lines serving London&apos;s airports will stay open around the clock tonight to help get stranded air passengers home, Network Rail has announced. Weekend engineering work on the Anglo-Scottish routes - the east and west coast main lines - has also been cancelled to enable more direct services to run. Robin Gisby, from Network Rail, said: &quot;Network Rail and the train operators are doing all we can to help get people home following the unprecedented air travel chaos. The main lines to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports will be opened round the clock tonight in an effort to speed people on their way.&quot; Paddington, Liverpool Street, Victoria and Gatwick - some of the UK&apos;s biggest and busiest stations - will also stay open around the clock tonight. So does this mean the tube will also be running, for the thrifts (like myself) who prefer to endure the hour-long Piccadilly? &quot;No,&quot; a spokesman for Transport for London has just told me. &quot;That&apos;s following consultation with the department for transport, and with other services like the Heathrow express, Gatwick express, etc, to understand what the demand is likely to be,&quot; he said. &quot;The tube runs up until midnight, and we did have plans in place to run the Piccadilly line into west London should that be necessary, but it does not appear, according to the Department for Transport, that there will be large numbers of people arriving overnight.&quot;  &quot;We do have an extensive night bus operation in London that will continue to operate, and we continue to monitor the situation. If the DfT ask us to run the service we will be able to do so.&quot;  1.18pm:      Terror as plane hits ash cloud [28 years ago]    How&apos;s this for responsible reporting? Copies of today&apos;s Daily Star have been removed from airport newsagent shelves over fears that its splash, headlined &quot;Terror as plane hits ash cloud&quot; with an image of a 747 with engines ablaze, could cause panic among travellers. Behind the headline is a picture of a Boeing 747, engines blazing. A picture which was taken from a TV reconstruction of an incident 28 years ago in which BA Flight 009&apos;s engines were knocked out by a volcanic ash cloud. Full story from John Plunkett.  1.12pm:  Good afternoon all, Adam Gabbatt taking over from Matt, who&apos;s gone for some soup. Right on cue, Severin Carrell calls back to elaborate on the airspace closures in north and west Scotland.  Airspace above the North Sea could also be closed to low level flights due to the volcanic ash, potentially affect the oil and gas industry.        12.54pm: Dan Milmo writes:  &quot;The head of the UK air safety body has denied that pressure from ministers and airlines contributed to the surprise lifting of a flight ban last night. Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said it was &quot;absolutely 100% untrue&quot; that the independent regulator had been leant on.  In an interview with the Guardian he said the transport secretary, Lord Adonis, and airline executives had not forced the CAA into a hasty re-writing of long-standing guidelines on flying through volcanic ash. &quot;Lord Adonis has been fantastic because he is an intellectual and not an elected politician. He has understood the evidence, the data, and has been very supportive. He has never once put pressure us and likewise the airlines, who were anxious to get flying again but knew that we needed to have a safe method of working.&quot;  Asked if passengers should have any concerns about a new safety regime that permits planes to fly through low density ash clouds generated by Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano, he added: &quot;I would happily fly myself. We have only taken this view after very detailed work by aircraft and engine manufacturers, in-flight testing and intensive investigations. All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; Planes are now taking off and landing at UK airports under a new carve-up of European Union airspace that divides the continent into three zones: a no-fly area; a safe flight region; and areas where flying is permitted despite the presence of ash.  Following intense discussions with engine and aircraft makers, British airspace that was unsafe under the old regime 24 hours ago was redesignated as acceptable for passenger flights. Haines admitted that it took a &quot;burning platform&quot; to focus the industry on an issue - flying through volcanic ash - that had not been examined in great detail previously by an industry whose overriding safety obsession in recent years has been terrorism.  &quot;It depends on how much priority people give to these issues. Some ICAO [the global aviation safety body] working groups go on for five years. Who would have thought that volcanic ash would have been one of their priorities?&quot;        12.44pm: There was a time yesterday when the only flights you could get in the UK were to the Scottish islands, today they are the only place you can&apos;t fly to and from. Could a new flights ban over the Scotland islands being heading south? asks our Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell:  The unpredictability of the Icelandic ash plume has just been underlined with the announcement that airspace over Orkney and Shetland has been shut down with immediate effect, leading to further delays and disruption for travellers and the oil industry. Highlands and Islands Airports, which operates nearly all regional and islands airports in the north and west of Scotland, has just released the following statement: &quot;Despite the widely publicised re-opening of UK airspace last night, National Air Traffic Services have issued directions in the last hour which indicate that the forecast concentrations of volcanic ash in the area around Orkney and Shetland are now expected to exceed safe operating limits between 13:00 and 19:00 today, Wednesday 21 April.&quot; So 15 flights linking Edinburgh and Aberdeen with Shetland and Orkneyscheduled for today have been abruptly cancelled.  Loganair, the main islands operator, is now offering passengers free tickets forrebookings. This closure raises the possibility of the flights ban being reimposed further south.   12.36pm: Airline acitivity across Europe, as tracked by flightradar24.com, is looking a lot busier than it has done over the last few days.      Screengrab from flightsradar24.com     12.06pm: More on the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; fiasco. The Foreign Office has just put out this statement:   &quot;Airlines have confirmed that due to flight restrictions being lifted from 2200 on 20 April, they will not now be diverting planes to a Madrid &quot;hub&quot;, but where possible flying direct to UK destinations. If you were planning to fly to the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; for onward transfer to the UK, you should now contact your airline for the latest advice about available direct flights. British Embassy staff are currently on the ground at the airport, helping passengers to find the best way back to the UK. The team&apos;s immediate priority is working with airlines and tour operators to get people on the first available flights to the UK. The Embassy team will be reinforced by more staff later today. Due to the earlier contingency planning, we have provision in place to allow us access to up to 150 coaches in and around Madrid. We are urgently assessing with the travel industry and our consular teams on the ground in Madrid how best to use this capability to assist British Nationals.&quot;   12.02pm: The airline industry is calling for a financial bailout and it appears to be trying to wriggle out of its compensation obligations to passengers.  &quot;This crisis is an act of god \u2013 completely beyond the control of airlines. Insurers certainly see it this way. But Europe&apos;s passenger rights regulations take no consideration of this. These regulations provide no relief for extraordinary situations and still hold airlines responsible to pay for hotels, meals and telephones,&quot; said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the International Air Transport Association.       11.43am: Michael Ellis, from Tettenhall in the West Midlands is stuck in Thailand, furious with the airline EVA, and looking for help. He emails:  My partner and I are stranded in Thailand. Today we were due to fly on the 11.50am EVA flight BR67. It was cancelled, but we were never called to try and standby for a later flight. In fact EVA have been nothing but unhelpful and their London team incredibly rude. We haven&apos;t yet been contacted concerning our return flight nor can we getthrough to reservations. We are now in Bangkok whilst political tensions increase in the city. Today we got caught up in a rally in Siam. We&apos;ve decided to move to Koh Chang, only an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, tobe safe and sound. EVA aren&apos;t helping with costs, but thankfully my insurance company are. We&apos;ve been told by other travellers that the soonest availability for a flight home is early May! I have already missed a flight on Friday to my best friend&apos;s wedding in Las Vegas, where I was supposed to be giving her away. Gutted and disappointed doesn&apos;t even cut it. I&apos;m stranded and need to get home. Please help?   11.31am: Five days of quiet skies has inspired some nice poetry and prose. Rural campaigners think we should be allowed to enjoy a world without planes every year. The experience of the last week has prompted the Campaign to Protect Rural England to call for a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; . Graeme Willis, senior rural policy campaigner, explains:   &quot;This disaster has revealed to many what they&apos;ve been missing: overnight the skies were stripped of the sight and sound of aeroplanes, and without the rumble and drone of aircraft people are reporting they can hear the simple sounds of the countryside once more. &quot;Perhaps the time is right to consider a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; to remind us all -for one day at least - of what we are all losing in our rush to be somewhere else. A planned approach to making all of our lives a little quieter and more tranquil could deliver some of the benefits of the last few days without the difficulties endured by so many people.&quot;   11.25am: &quot;Heathrow is starting to look like Heathrow again,&quot; according to Sam Jones at the airport with lots of hopeful passengers hoping to leave the UK.  11.16am: Guardian Daily presenter Jon Dennis was supposed to fly back from Barcelona on Friday. The ash cloud forced him and his young family to stay in a &quot;Swindon-by-Sea&quot; while they wondered how they&apos;d get back (as we heard on Monday 11.07am). Luckily they have just checked in for a return flight home. Jon describes his relief and the sense of solidarity among stranded Brits in Spain.  10.38am: The departure board at Heathrow still shows a rash of cancellations, according to the airline website Flightstats.      Screengrab from flightstats.co.uk          10.25am: Meanwhile, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano is still erupting, but is now producing less ash but more toxic gas, according to our science correspondent, Ian Sample. He writes:  The volcano is stable but remains active this morning, says Iceland&apos;s Civil Protection and Emergency Management Centre. The amount of ash being produced has fallen steadily over the past few days, but the plume is becoming more toxic due to higher levels of fluorine. The quantity of ash in the plume has dropped because the crater has become isolated from surrounding glacier ice. Most of the ash is produced when hot magma wells up and meets this ice and water.    10.19am: EasyJet says it plans to operate 900 flights (86% of its network) today. But it warns &quot;it will take several days to resume normal operations&quot;.      Adam Gabbatt     10.16am:  &quot;I&apos;ve just spoken with a press officer at BA. She said their longhaul flights are running as per BA&apos;s normal timetable this morning. So far both flights scheduled to take off \u2013 destined for New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 have done so. There could be some delays, she said, but all services should run. Short haul services will not run until 1pm today, however.  &quot;There&apos;s a lot of cabin crew and aircraft out of position,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to reposition the crews and the aircraft before resuming flights. Customers are still advised to check BA&apos;s website before flying, as there could be time changes and delays.&quot; She did say, however, that all short-haul services should be running after that time. In terms of BA flights in to the UK: again, short-haul services will only be operating from 1pm owing to repositioning, and services could be delayed. Long-haul flights will not be running normally inbound \u2013 because of diversions there will be delays \u2013 but should return to a normal service tomorrow. The latest information on flights will be posted on BA&apos;s website.&quot;  10.15am: Adam posts this Twitter exchange: @lefran @adamgabbatt I&apos;m stuck in Japan for another 9 days, no news on hotel or food budget or anything....impossible to get hold of call centers! @adamgabbatt @lefran ouch. Where are you staying for the next 9 days? @lefran @adamgabbatt my parents have had to snd me funds to check into a hostel. I now have little money left for food. Insrnce won&apos;t help me either       10.05am: Scores of Ryanair flights are still cancelled for tomorrow, including Helen Pidd&apos;s return from Berlin. Before heading for the railway station she emailed this:   My rearranged flight back from Berlin has been cancelled once again. I have thrown in the towel after five days waiting and I&apos;m going to get the train. Our environment colleagues will be glad to hear.        9.59am: What about those all those coaches in Madrid? Giles Tremlett, our correspondent in the city emails this:  I don&apos;t know what will happen to the &quot;Madrid hub&quot; idea for getting people stuck on other continents home via a long-distance coach service from Madrid airport. My guess is that, if it is not wound down, it will be used to try to help those stuck in Madrid and Spain already. There are plenty of them around. Online booking shops show flights available for today at \u20ac500 to \u20ac2,100 a shot but I am not sure I trust them. The first Iberia flight to London with free seats (\u20ac839) is, according to the company&apos;s own website, on Saturday. The first easyJet to London is on the 28 April. Yesterday the embassy desks at Terminal 1 and 4 were taking down mobile phone numbers of those stranded so that they could be called up when, and if, coaches became available. The first five coaches left last night with the ambassador, Giles Paxman, telling me this was &quot;just the start&quot; and that further resources would arrive today.       Adam Gabbatt     9.51am: &quot;Here&apos;s a breakdown of the financial impact of the volcano on various airlines. This is what some of the main carriers were losing at the peak of the disruption:  BA: \u00a315m-20m per day Easyjet: \u00a35m per day AirFrance/KLM: \u00a330.5m per day Emirates: \u00a36.5m per day Qantas: \u00a3900,000 per day TUI Travel (Owns Thompson and First Choice): \u00a36m per day Ryanair: \u00a35.2m European airports were losing around \u00a335m each day during the worst of the crisis. BAA, which owns Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton, was losing \u00a35m-6m each day.&quot;  9.42am: It&apos;s remarkable that flights have resumed so quickly, says our transport correspondent, Dan Milmo. Aviation restrictions usually take years to draw up. &quot;Given that the solution we have found is flying through clouds of ash, I think the government was understandbly a little bit weary of pushing Nats and the CAA into letting aircraft take off again after a blanket ban was put in place,&quot; he says.  9.18am: The crisis has cost the airline industry $1.7bn, making it worse than 9/11 in economic terms, according to the International Air Transport Association. It is also calling for restrictions on night flights to be lifted to help airlines return to normality.  Announcing the estimate IATA&apos;s director general Giovanni Bisignani said: &quot;At the worst, the crisis impacted 29% of global aviation and affected 1.2 million passengers a day. The scale of the crisis eclipsed 9/11 when US airspace was closed for three days.&quot; &quot;As we are counting the costs of the crisis, we must also look for ways to mitigate the impact. Some of our airport partners are setting industry best practice. London Heathrow and Dubai are waiving parking fees and not charging for repositioning flights. Others airports must follow,&quot; said Bisignani.  8.56am:       Maev Kennedy&apos;s teenage son Samuel has made it back it from a school trip to China.  The 40 year-10- and 11 geography students from Orleans Park, and four teachers, who have been stranded in five star luxury in China, arrived back into Heathrow at 3.32am, to cheers from the parents and a furtive dab of teary eyes from their school head, Jo Longhurst.  Hours after their flight took off from Shanghai last night, it was still being suggested they might land in Scotland, or Amsterdam, or Barcelona. Samuel - who described the flight, &quot;I had dinner, and then I had another dinner, and then I think I had another dinner&quot; - is fast asleep in his own bed.  Jo Longhurst is wide awake, wrestling with the nightmare scheduling for her 1,000 pupil comprehensive - high spirited respondents to yesterday&apos;s news blog please note, not posh private - school: she still has 12 teachers astray in the world, including the head of maths who is in Tibet, and who was warned yesterday she may not be able to fly back until May 6.   8.45am: In Thailand there&apos;s been a massive scramble to get on the first flights back to the UK. Ben Doherty, our man in Bangkok, writes:   I&apos;ve just got back from Bangkok Airport where the first London-bound plane has left. It was EVA Air flight. There absolute chaos trying to get onto it, authorities basically rang everybody who had had a flightcancelled (with EVA) in the last six days and said get to the airport.  We have a flight leaving today. Everyone rushed madly and it was first-in, first-served. Some people, who had only been delayed a day got on, while others who were on the original plane turned back last Thursday, are still stuck in Bangkok. I talked to a young couple whose plane was the last one cancelled into London. They missed the cut-off by a couple of hours. They are now at the back of the queue waiting to get home.  If you are having trouble getting home please get in touch or leave a comment below. You can email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk or reach me on Twitter at @matthew_weaver  8.40am:The LibDems have also attacked the Tories for trying to politicise the travel chaos. Norman Baker, the party&apos;s transport spokesman, said: &quot;It&apos;s pretty reprehensible for the Conservatives to be almost gleeful about the chaos that there has been. The government is responsible for many things in this country but a volcano going off in Iceland is not one of them.&quot;  8.19am: The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, insisted that safety regulators have acted in an &quot;appropriate and and proper way throughout&quot;.  Speaking to the BBC&apos;s Today programme he denied that the government had put pressure on safety officials to change the rules. &quot;I believe that they [safety officials] have done their duty properly, and I would not have wished to place any pressure on them to have acted faster, than was compatible with the safe passage of planes,&quot; Lord Adonis said. On the delay in lifting the ban, he said it was right to wait for the results of observational data and the views of aircraft manufacturers. He said hew &quot;irritated&quot; by Conservative criticism of the government&apos;s handling of the crisis, and accused the Tories of &quot;playing party politics&quot; over the issue.  8am: Airlines have started the huge logistical operation of trying to return their flights schedule to normal after six days of restrictions were suddenly lifted last night. The first passengers arriving at Heathrow have described their relief at returning to the UK, but stranded passengers and those with bookings have been warned that the phased resumption of flights could takes days and even weeks.  There are lots of questions to answer and issues to be resolved including:\u2022 Were the volcanic ash restricitions necessary?\u2022 Is it safe to resume flights? \u2022 Did the airline bosses bully the officials into lifting the ban?\u2022 How long will it take to get stranded passengers home? \u2022 What happened to all those passengers who were told to head for Calais? \u2022 With planes out of position and restriction still in place, how long will it take for air traffic to return to normality?\u2022 How damaging has the crisising been to the airline industry?\u2022 Did the government do enough to help stranded passengers? \u2022 And how will we remember the days of quiet skies? As the recriminations begin the advice to passengers is to check with their airlines about flights.", "sentences": ["Hours after their flight took off from Shanghai last night, it was still being suggested they might land in Scotland, or Amsterdam, or Barcelona."], "title": "Iceland volcano - UK flights resume", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/apr/21/iceland-volcano-uk-flights-resume", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Air transport", "British Airways", "Travel", "UK news", "Iceland", "Airline industry", "Flights", "Europe", "Volcanoes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-21T21:37:00Z", "article": "Thousands of miles from Britain&apos;s ash-shrouded Heathrow airport, passengers on flight BA84 on Tuesday morning were delighted to be taking off from Vancouver at last. Five days after the volcano crisis began, those on board, like many thousands of other travellers across the world, had been unsure how \u2013 or when \u2013 they would get back to the UK. The problem was, neither British Airways nor the government could guarantee the flight&apos;s destination. Mindful of the safety fears that had grounded an entire continent, the pilot announced that the delays had nothing to do with the shipshape aircraft \u2013 it just wasn&apos;t clear whether Heathrow would be available at the end of the nine-hour flight. The other 27 BA long-haul services heading towards the UK on Tuesday had the same problem, as airports at Shannon, Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels warned that their runways might be called upon if the meetings in London failed to lift a ban on flights in and out of the capital. As BA84 took off from Canada, BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, was being taunted by the sight of aircraft contrails 35,000ft above the Department for Transport headquarters in London. UK airline bosses had assembled at Marsham Street to seek a lifting of the flight embargo from the transport secretary, Lord Adonis. Britain, it had been judged, was safe for overflying at more than 20,000 feet, above the cloud of volcanic ash, but not for takeoffs and landings. BA was losing up to \u00a320m a day as a result. One person at the meeting said: &quot;It was frustrating to see someone else flying while we couldn&apos;t.&quot; Adonis told the most powerful figures in UK aviation that, without the approval of the Civil Aviation Authority, the air safety watchdog, the crippling ban would remain in place. There was, a government source said today, an element of opportunism in Walsh&apos;s decision to approve the flights on Monday evening. BA gave the go-ahead shortly after Nats, the national air traffic controller, said it hoped to allow flights into southern England the next day. &quot;It was a wily move by BA, but we knew that they might have to divert those flights somewhere else,&quot; said the source. Hours after the Monday announcement, Nats appeared to dash BA&apos;s hopes by admitting that a new plume of ash from Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano would keep London closed to flights. With 28 planes now heading to a newly shuttered UK, Walsh was rooting for a resolution from the Tuesday meeting. Adonis was adamant that any decision to lift the ban would be the CAA&apos;s call. On Saturday, the independent aviation regulator had called a round of teleconferences with the Met Office, aircraft engine manufacturers and specialists on volcanic hazards from the US Geological Survey. The discussion centred on finding a way of getting planes safely back into the skies. In Exeter, Met Office staff were tracking the plume arriving from Iceland with infrared satellites and 30 ground-based lasers that had been reassigned to monitor volcanic ash instead of the cloud base. Separately, forecasters were modelling how the plume might spread. The weather had conspired to impose a &quot;blocking high&quot; over Britain, meaning light winds and little chance of the plume blowing over fast. The forecasters used the &quot;numerical atmospheric dispersion modelling environment&quot;, a powerful programme that takes weather data and plots how clouds of particles are likely to spread. In its last emergency, the model had been used to forecast the spread of another toxic plume, from the Buncefield oil depot in Hertfordshire that exploded in 2005. The first runs of the model said nothing about the amount of ash in the skies over Britain, but it did show how the cloud would move and spread out with time. No-go areas of ash-filled air were defined as those with more than ten billionths of a billionth of a gram&apos;s worth of ash per cubic metre, which meant that under the old guidelines, a light scattering of ash was enough to ground a plane. Over the weekend, forecasters fed the dispersion model with data on the amount of ash being churned out by the volcano. With these figures in place, the model could give its first realistic estimates of how much ash the cloud contained. On computer screens, the plume showed up as a patch of sky where levels of ash were above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. The CAA asked the Met Office to generate two maps of the plume. The first showed where ash levels were above 200 micrograms per cubic metre and covered most of Britain. The second showed the plume only where it was 10 times more dense, with 2,000 micrograms of ash per cubic metre. &quot;We thought we could start working with those figures,&quot; said Jim McKenna, CAA&apos;s head of airworthiness, strategy and policy. &quot;We were trying to develop the concept and give the manufacturers a chance to look at the data.&quot; Within 24 hours of the eruption last Thursday, it became clear to Adonis that the situation could turn into a logistical and financial catastrophe. The government source said: &quot;It became clear that, because the situation was so unpredictable a sit-back-and-hope approach would not work. So we had to interrogate the no-ash-no-fly rule. It quickly became apparent that it was not a benchmark that had been developed in response to detailed scenarios, including how planes respond to them.&quot; By Sunday the CAA had garnered initially reluctant engine and aircraft manufacturers into working groups that were analysing whether the guidelines were too stringent. The aircraft engine manufacturers, including Rolls Royce and the US group, Engine Alliance, dug out old cases where airliners had flown through volcanic ash clouds inadvertently and studied reports on the incidents. There are plenty: in the three months up to February 1989, five commercial jets were damaged by ash clouds from Redoubt volcano in Alaska, while of 60 aircraft that were damaged in ash clouds in the 12 years to 1993, seven airliners, carrying more than 2,000 people, suffered dramatic engine failure. The incident reports were crucial for the manufacturers. Forensic inspections of aircraft that survived near-misses with volcanic ash clouds gave them a clue as to how much dust can cause an engine to fail. Engineers know how much air an airline engine sucks in every minute, so they could work back to how dense a cloud of ash might be dangerous. That same day, Sunday, a Dornier twin propeller research plane operated by the National Environment Research Council took off from Cranfield, Bedfordshire, and flew a route that was followed later by a BA 747 jumbo jet with Walsh on board. While the research plane took readings of ash levels, engineers waited at Cardiff airport to examine the BA flight when it landed. Conditions were perfect and the ground crew found no sign of engine damage. Amid mounting evidence from airline test flights that it was safe to fly through the ash, EU transport ministers agreed on Monday evening that &quot;safe flight zones&quot; could be established in the ash if national air safety watchdogs sanctioned it. At the same time, the aerospace giant Airbus ordered test flights of its own from Toulouse. An A380 took off into the French no-fly zone on a route that lasted three hours and 50 minutes. A second test aircraft, an A340-400, flew for five hours, crossing over into German airspace. Both planes were checked on landing and the inspection reports sent to the CAA and manufacturers that evening.After poring over the historical data and results from test flights, manufacturers one by one said their engines could safely fly in volcanic plumes with up to 2,000 micrograms of ash per cubic metre. &quot;They agreed that it&apos;s acceptable for that level of ash to be tolerated without any real restriction,&quot; said McKenna. A new safety code was roughed out: anything more than 2,000 micrograms per cubic metre is a no-fly zone. Between 2,000 and 200 micrograms requires planes to take extra precautions. Below 200 micrograms is considered no threat at all. But by Tuesday morning, those doubts had yet to crystallise into a sweeping rule change. Walsh was arguing that the BA test flight proved that flying through low-density ash clouds was safe \u2013 a finding backed by dozens of tests around Europe. The CAA still had to run its findings by a board meeting on Tuesday, however, with the airline executives reconvening at Marsham Street at 7pm. With the clock ticking as BA84 approached UK airspace, the CAA told Walsh and his peers that the board approved new guidelines that would allow flights through the ash \u2013 overturning years-old regulations in 96 hours. The BA boss had one question, according to the government source. &quot;Willie then said: &apos;What does it mean for my flights?&apos;&quot; CAA officials conferred with colleagues in Ireland and came back with the answer: you can land at 10pm. In fact, BA84 landed at 21.49pm, minutes after Adonis announced the changes on the steps of Marsham Street, becoming the first flight to grace Heathrow in nearly six days. A BA spokeswoman said: &quot;Our priority is to bring stranded customers home as soon as possible. When our long-haul aircraft took off , we were optimistic that London airspace would reopen after 1900 in the evening. We had contingency plans for the aircraft if the air space restrictions changed. Safety is our top priority.&quot; Andrew Haines, the CAA&apos;s chief executive, defended its conduct amid claims that airspace should not have been closed for so long. &quot;We achieved what often takes years in 96 hours. When you are dealing with people&apos;s lives it is not enough to say, this guidance looks a bit restrictive, let&apos;s just make up a less restrictive one, you have to agree new safety guidelines that are evidence based,&quot; he said. Asked if passengers should have any concerns about safety, Haines added: &quot;I would happily fly myself. We have only taken this view after very detailed work by aircraft and engine manufacturers, in-flight testing and intensive investigations. All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; The disruptive influence of Eyjafjallajokull may not be at an end. Chris Yates, an aviation consultant, said: &quot;Concentration levels of volcanic ash have been shown to be low \u2026 hence planes allowed to fly, but it&apos;s important to note [that] if concentration levels rise then airspace will be closed again and flights grounded. The airline industry has won the battle on this one, but it hasn&apos;t won the war.&quot;", "sentences": ["The other 27 BA long-haul services heading towards the UK on Tuesday had the same problem, as airports at Shannon, Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels warned that their runways might be called upon if the meetings in London failed to lift a ban on flights in and out of the capital."], "title": "Iceland volcano ash cloud: The full story of how the airlines won the battle for the skies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/21/airlines-battle-skies", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "British Airways", "Travel", "Willie Walsh", "Science", "Aeronautics", "Technology", "Engineering", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Flights", "Volcanoes", "Heathrow airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-22T16:38:31Z", "article": "It is not often you get a press release from a fool.

They will generate at least 25% of electricity from the hot air produced by MPs. Workington bridges flood gap Still in Cumbria, where there was joy as a temporary road bridge opened to reunite the divided town of Workington following last autumn&apos;s devastating floods. The remains of Northside bridge were finally demolished. The bridge had been swept away, killing police officer Bill Barker, 44, who was attempting to direct traffic away from the area. Since then, motorists attempting to cross the river Derwent in Workington have faced an 18-mile detour. A tree planted in memory of PC Barker was blessed by the rector of Workington. Cumbria county council said the replacement bridge would remain in place until the town again had two permanent crossings over the river. A temporary footbridge, built by the army and named the Barker crossing, was built to help residents but motorists have been forced to use Papcastle bridge at Cockermouth for the past five months. Market towns going under In Lincolnshire, a startling claim that its market towns will die in 10 years unless they can be improved. Lincolnshire county council is looking to carry out more research on how to improve market towns including Sleaford, Market Rasen, Horncastle and Alford. But councillors say they want action rather than &quot;intelligence gathering&quot; with some of Lincolnshire&apos;s historic towns declining and not attracting investors or shoppers. Independent councillor Jim Swanson said he believed markets towns needed more promotion. He told the county council&apos;s economic scrutiny committee: &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure in 10 years time there will be no markets as there will be no customers. &quot;We have a situation where customers are drifting away to big supermarkets and, quite rightly so, everyone is driven by cost ... Above all it&apos;s a marketing issue. We have to market the market towns. We have to advertise.&quot; Louth Wolds representative Charles Marfleet said council car parking charges in market towns created problems, while derelict and empty shops made it harder to attract new investors and businesses. On the lam in Dam From the Liverpool Echo, news that one of Britain&apos;s most wanted criminals has been arrested by Dutch police in Amsterdam. Armed robber James Muldoon, 30, of Liverpool, was caught at a flat in the Amstelveen suburb. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) said he was caught after a tip-off weeks. Muldoon was the first caught of six criminals named in March as thought to be hiding in the Netherlands. He was convicted of stealing goods worth \u00a341,000 from two lorries at a Grantham depot in which a security guard was attacked and given 13 years in his absence. Senior officers suspect the Dutch city has become a popular haven for crooks looking to keep out of the reach of the law. Fugitives are said to be attracted to the city because it is English-speaking with established and partially legalised drug and prostitution networks. Greek bat defies ash cloud A type of bat never seen before in the UK has been found visiting caves in Yorkshire and Sussex. Myotis alcathoe, or Alcathoe&apos;s bat, was identified by a research team led by Professor John Altringham at the University of Leeds and Professor Roger Butlin of the University of Sheffield during a Europe-wide study of bat population ecology and genetics. The bat \u2013 about the size of the end of a person&apos;s thumb \u2013 was identified in Greece nine years ago and is a native of continental Europe. It has been found in a Forestry Commission woodland in Ryedale in the North York Moors national park and in the South Downs.", "sentences": ["On the lam in Dam From the Liverpool Echo, news that one of Britain&apos;s most wanted criminals has been arrested by Dutch police in Amsterdam."], "title": "The Northerner: Why government is a fool's errand", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/22/northerner-blog-fools-workington-bat", "tags": ["UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-23T08:00:04Z", "article": "It&apos;s always hard to prove that judges of a literary competition have picked a book because of the reputation of its author rather than its intrinsic worth \u2013 but easy to suspect. If I mention Ian McEwan and Amsterdam, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know what I mean. It&apos;s hard to avoid such speculation with regard to the inclusion of The Bay Of Noon on the Lost Booker shortlist too. Following on from The Transit of Venus and The Great Fire (both winners of several awards, if not the Booker itself), Shirley Hazzard is a writer many take very seriously indeed (&quot;one of the greatest working in English today,&quot; according to a quote from Michael Cunningham on the cover of my copy of The Bay Of Noon). And that&apos;s the only reason I can imagine a book as inconsequential as this one could have ended up on the shortlist when far better novels haven&apos;t.  Set in Naples not long after the end of the second world war, the novel describes the friendship and tangled loves of an Englishwoman called Jenny and two native Neapolitans Gioconda and Gianni. Jenny has been brought to Naples to work in a &quot;big NATO establishment&quot; where she is to do translation and clerical work along with a number of other English girls: &quot;Angelas and Hilarys and Rosemarys who had wanted to get away from Reading or Ruislip or Holland Park\u2026 tender, uncherished strokes of pastel.&quot; The trouble is \u2013 as Claire Tomalin pointed out in a sharp Observer review back in 1970 \u2013 that Jenny is little more than a stroke of pastel herself. Except when she manages to catch jaundice and turn yellow late on in the book, she is singularly colourless. She informs us that she moved to Italy in order to escape an incestuous passion for her brother \u2013 but relates it with all the excitement of someone describing a head cold. In Naples meanwhile, she lives vicariously through her friend Giaconda \u2013 but we get very little sense of what that means, since Giaconda is herself so thinly sketched out. She has long hair. She lives in an interesting house in a messy bit of Naples. She once wrote a book. Her dad was a lefty. She stays with Gianni even though he&apos;s a bully, a womaniser and a bit of a bore. I couldn&apos;t tell you much more as there are so few real insights into her personality. Like every other person in the book, you get the impression that if you poked through her papier mach\u00e9 exterior, you&apos;d get nothing but air. Which might be forgivable if she did anything of interest, but aside from a few good bits of back-story about the war there&apos;s little more in here than navel gazing and singularly sexless bed-hopping. There is one character, at least, that does have real life \u2013 the city of Naples. The passion that is so lacking in the love stories shines through when Hazzard describes the heat, the warrens of streets, the poverty, the beauty and the strikes among the refuse collectors (that appear to have been as much a problem 60 years ago as they are today). So too does the author&apos;s talent. She can trot out nice lines about the long line of time running through this ancient city: &quot;The question &apos;What is it?&apos; took on, here, an aspect of impertinence; one might only learn what it had successively been.&quot; And even better ones about its peculiar charms: &quot;The tourist who comes and sees this shambles, has his camera swiped, is swindled by the taxi drivers and persecuted by old codgers flogging cameos, how can he know all that is just, so to speak, a show of civilities? \u2013 the surface pleasantries of a reality which is infinitely worse, unanswerably better?&quot; But clever as such descriptions are, and although the Naples nostalgia may be heady, they hardly make for a substantial novel. This remains a book that is only really of interest to those keen to track Hazzard&apos;s development as a writer. It doesn&apos;t deserve to win.", "sentences": ["If I mention Ian McEwan and Amsterdam, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know what I mean."], "title": "Looking back at the Lost Booker: Shirley Hazzard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/apr/21/lost-booker-shirley-hazzard", "tags": ["Lost Booker prize", "Fiction", "Awards and prizes", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-23T08:56:50Z", "article": "Close of play: Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire (250 and 250-8) beat Somerset (272 and 227) by two wickets Canterbury: Kent (317 and 327-7) lead Yorkshire (283) by 361 runs Whitgift: Surrey (493 and 57-2) lead Worcestershire (465) by 85 runs 6pm: And it&apos;s goodbye from me, writes Vic Marks. It&apos;s now freezing in my tent. Out in the middle Surrey are 52 for two and I&apos;ll be very surprised if this does not end in a draw, which would please Worcestershire more than Surrey. I am going to watch the TTTs tomorrow at Canterbury. Another draw is my guess but at least there is an enclosed press box. However for 4/5ths of the day is been a delight here at Whitgift. Much more uplifting than an empty ground at Colditz - whoops sorry - Kennington. 5.50pm: No more from me either, writes David Hopps. I am not heading for Guyana which sadly spares me from the delights of Buddy&apos;s Hotel (we started on hotels so we shall finish on them) where you can be stone-cold sober yet walk down a main staircase of such uneven drops that you feel totally wasted. Kent have had a great post-tea session, with Hockley and Tredwell in blissful control, and the lead has passed 350. Yorkshire are bowling some overs into Adil Rashid and if they are lucky they may get him sorted by midsummer. I am about to write an angry piece about it. Flash: Hockley just dismissed for 82, career best but no maiden championship hundred. 5.30pm: Welcome to the Vic Marks Somerset hotline, from where the news is mixed, writes Mike Selvey at Trent Bridge. The good is that a further, slightly iffy Notts wicket has fallen, that of Samit Patel, lbw to Alfonso Thomas although even from my slightly skewed angle in the press box, it looked to be sliding down legside. The bad, not to say ominous, is that Hashim Amla, probably the most prolific batsman in the world at the moment, is batting like a dream and has just taken 6.444 from the first five balls of a new Charl WIlloughby spell. At 171 for four, Notts still need 79 and the game remains in the balance. Just. Amla though holds the key. And that, alas, is the final offering from me. Work to do and then off to the World Twenty20 on Wednesday, which will be a lot more hectic and considerably less satisfying than the past fortnight on the county circuit. So thanks to everyone for the contributions and fun, and to Andy Bull for recognising that the county blog has a welcome place on the website. Bye for now. 4.50pm: Better news for Vic, a bit anyway, for a Somerset breakthrough has occurred, writes Mike Selvey. Bilal Shafayat managed to hit all around a straight one from Damien Wright and was lbw. He sloped off disgruntled although whether that was because it was legsidish or because he was one short of a half century (or even both) was not clear. But it broke a second wicket stand of 125 with Mark Wagh, who in what we in this business call an &quot; as so often happens&quot; was promptly caught behind in the following over for 70. So suddenly Notts are 127 for three and two new batsmen at the crease. 4.10pm: Something&apos;s happened here, writes Vic Marks at Whitgift. Three wickets fell for one run all to Jade Dernbach. At the other end Usman Afzaal is doing Bishen Bedi impressions. Worcestershire 460 for eight at tea. Draw still very much the favourite though Worcester do have an unusually long tail. Not sure I can take another day here. I may have to cast my eyes on the TTTs at Canterbury. Hoppsy, I presume you are playing tomorrow. Don&apos;t forget to do your imaging on the way home. 3.55pm: David Hopps at Canterbury has seen a troubled leg-spinner gain a little solace: Adil Rashid has taken a wicket on the brink of tea and it is the key wicket of Martin van Jaarsveld, lbw on the back foot for 78. Yorkshire&apos;s captain Andrew Gale had ignored Rashid for much of the afternoon session, but with Kent&apos;s lead heading towards 250 and van Jaarsveld and James Hockleyin complete control, he had little option but to return to the leg-spinner who had looked so out of sorts in his two overs before lunch. Rashid&apos;s first over was discouraging as another long hop was gratefully pulled for four by Hockley and he retreated to the cover boundary to admonish himself and practice his bowling action. From the first ball of his next over he struck, although van Jaarsveld greeted the umpire&apos;s raised finger with some surprise. At tea, Kent are 218 for six, 254 ahead. It has been a constantly fluctuating game, strokeplay enterprising and wickets falling in clusters. Both counties remain in this game with Kent a glimmer ahead. 3.30pm: Antidepressants for Mr Marks please, writes Mike Selvey at Trent Bridge. Poor old Vic. He has the triple whammy of a cold tent and crap game at Whitgift, and his brave boys going down the tube at Trent Bridge. At the moment Notts are making a mockery of what ought to be a difficult pitch, and Somerset&apos;s threadbare attack is down to their maverick bowler Peter Trego. The tattooed one replaces David Stiff, who at the age of 25 is on his fourth county, something which says much about his ability at this level. Perhaps he has a day job. Perhaps he soon will have when Vic gets back to Taunton. Certainly his name is one of the most evocative of a bowling action since Bob Cunis was described as &quot;neither one thing nor the other&quot;. It is stating the bleeding obvious to say that Somerset need wickets, but they do, and soon. As it is Mark Wagh is making hay and is past his half century, while Bilal Shafayat has just played comfortably. 3pm: On the subject of spinners it&apos;s good to hear Hoppsy being so protective of Adil Rashid of the table-topping Tykes, writes Vic Marks at Whitgift. From a distance I&apos;ve admired the way Yorkshire have nurtured him and my guess is that he&apos;ll get there in the end. A non-table topping Tyke has been wheeling away here, Gareth Batty. It&apos;s turning, albeit very slowly and he does not look like getting a wicket; his hundred is up. And he may be feeling a tad uncomfortable as he seeks to establish himself at his new club Last year he had an offer that he could hardly refuse - reckoned to be in six figures. Bear in mind that last season for Worcestershire he took nine Championship wickets in 10 games at 78 apiece. No wonder he may have been surprised when Surrey came a calling; no wonder he said &quot;yes&quot; and no wonder one or two are asking whether the Oval think-tank has spent some of their money wisely. Batty is a fine competitor etc... but he has to get a few people out now and again. There is not much venom in his deliveries at the moment. Give me Rashid any time... or Wainwright Worcs 423 for five, Batty nought for 114. Time for Rory H-B to grab the ball himself and get this game moving. 2.40pm: I think I may have got this one wrong, apart from wondering about the Somerset attack, writes Mike Selvey. An early wicket for Charl Willoughby before lunch (caught very low down at first slip at the very instant I was thinking that the slips were standing too close) has not been followed by anything threatening, a sharp blow on the hand for Bilal Shafayat apart. There has been no sign of the erratic bounce I anticipated, although the Somerset seamers may be hitting a different part of the pitch and at less velocity. Certainly they lack the raw aggression shown by Stuart Broad and Paul Franks in particular. However, for two and a half days this has been a pitch on which wickets can fall in clutches, so a collapse is never far away. 2.35pm: David Hopps in Canterbury writes: &quot;The tradition of the lime tree is an admirable eccentricity and we ought to preserve it.&quot; So opined EW &quot;Jim&quot; Swanton, the eminence of Kent cricket, a quote carried in the newly-published Trophies and Tribulations, an excellent examination of the past 40 years of Kent cricket by Mark Pennell and Clive Ellis. He would be a concerned man now would Mr Swanton. The first lime tree was destroyed in a storm in 2005 and its replacement, which I can reveal on a close examination over lunch is split and looking somewhat forlorn, is almost certain to be moved because of the new hotel development on the ground which is deemed evident to secure Kent&apos;s financial future. I have just been accused of being a Northern heathen by fellow occupants of the Canterbury press box for suggesting that the next one should be planted somewhere out of the way. Nobody who books a view of the cricket in the new hotel will want to draw back the curtains and not be able to see the game for a bloody great lime tree. And it cannot move so much nearer to the square to change from an &quot;admirable eccentricity&quot; to an unnecessary interference. It is questionable under the new plans whether there really is enough room for it. As for Kent, they are not taking root. They have lost three wickets in the first half hour after lunch, a sequence sparked by Geraint Jones&apos; ill-advised sweep at David Wainwright to be lbw for 53. Jones had played so well before lunch, but he had a chance to win the match and did not take it. Sam Northeast was lbw to Tim Bresnan and then Adil Rashid, whose leg-spin was predictably shelved after lunch, took an excellent catch at midwicket to off Wainwright to remove the dangerous Darren Stevens. At 131 for five, Kent lead by 165. It is a classic sunny Spring day today. Most of the over seventies are keeping coats firmly fastened and clinging to their thermos, but a few 20-year-olds have stripped to the waist to catch the rays. According to the forecast, there might even be a need for spot of sun cream tomorrow. I have had an email, incidentally, from Michael Henderson - whether from Berlin, London or Vienna I know not - but he is concerned at my suggestion that I briefly considered tearing down election posters on a grumpy drive into Canterbury this morning. He told me that this is a National Emergency and that I should desist. He also kindly suggested a very good pub. Regrettably, it is the same dilapiodated joint that Selvey recommended. My entire accommodation advice is trapped in 1988. I would be better off asking the Wife of Bath. 1.40pm: The game is drifting along gently here, writes Vic Marks at Whitgift. A Surrey spinner has finally taken a wicket - Schofield dismissing Kervezee; the sun is out; the flamingos are strutting their stuff behind the fence. But it is not obvious how we might get a result here unless Worcestershire declare behind. I can&apos;t see them doing that - in April - against Surrey - who have nicked Batty and Davies - with the cagey Tyke, Rhodes, at the helm. I have been carving out a World Twenty20 preview for the Obs. Selve is off to the Caribbean shortly so I&apos;ll pass on a couple of the revelations I&apos;ve made this morning. Scotland are not in the tournament although they were in my copy for quite a while. Pakistan won it last time - is it a bad sign that I had to check that? Also fretting about which game to cover tomorrow for the Obs. &quot;You could go to Durham,&quot; said Pat Gibson helpfully. Worcs 353 for five at lunch. 1.20pm: Kent are looking good at lunch at the St Lawrence Ground, writes David Hopps. An ebullient half-century by Geraint Jones has given Kent a lead of 130 with eight wickets remaining. Conditions are staying pretty consistent so for the statisticians among you here is a theory: 250-300 gettable, 300-320 challenging but possible, 320-340 would have to bat exceptionally well, above 340 would have to kidnap Azhar Mahmood. And what have England done to Adil Rashid? I had heard that he had returned to Headingley with his self-belief at rock bottom after an inactive tour of South Africa, and that has been illustrated by his two overs before lunch. They went for 20 and he was entirely lacking in rhythm. He has a straighter, longer, hunched run, encouraged by Mushtaq Ahmed during his part-time spell as England&apos;s bowling coach, but on this admittedly slim evidence it seems to have done him no favours. If Yorkshire get him buzzing again my midsummer they will count themselves lucky. First Monty Panesar, now Adil Rashid - two bowlers who have returned to their counties in desperate need of MOT and full service. England&apos;s spin bowling coaching just does not inspire confidence. England&apos;s selection \u2013 sending Rashid on a tour of South Africa rather than a learning tour of Bangladesh - was also a mistake. Yorkshire understandably respond to mention of England and Rashid with folded arms and aggrieved expressions. Fortunately for Rashid, his batting is strong enough for him to bat at No7 and bowl occasionally. Fortunately for Panesar, he has moved to a new county, Sussex, whose supportive approach is likely to be just what he needs. But Yorkshire have repeatedly told England that Rashid was not yet ready for international cricket and that he remained insecure about his talents. Now they have returned him, broken. 1pm: The Somerset innings has come to an end in an explosion of stumps and wickets to Paul Franks, writes Mike Selvey. So Notts need 250 to win, and I think, providing Somerset can bowl straight and exploit some erratic bounce, they ought to win. But have they the quality bowling to do so? Stuart Broad, so devastating for spell last night finished with a rather more chastening five for 89 from 15. Tres murdered him, as did Damien Wright, in rather less secure fashion. 12.30pm: Stop press - writes Mike Selvey - Selve puts mockers on Tres who has just steered Paul Franks gently to Ali Brown, a solitary slip standing wide. But his 98 has turned the match, a brilliant effort. Somerset 216 for eight. 12.15pm: A mystery solved in the press box today and I&apos;m glad to say that my memory has not deserted me as much as other senior moments have led me to believe. &quot;Who Won The Trouser Press?&quot; has been a topic of conversation for two days now, writes Mike Selvey at Trent Bridge. This is the item that was a prize when England played their warm-up match at Lilac Hill, near Perth in 1998. Cricket Archive revealed that Mike Atherton had top scored and was man of the match, but I couldn&apos;t recall him getting it, and he confirmed that yesterday, having just returned from Barbados via Port of Spain, Caracas, and Amsterdam. Mark Butcher was my shout although he made only 19 and bowled a single over. Transpires Butch did indeed win the trouser press as &quot;the best dressed and turned out cricketer&quot; which would have come as much a shock to him as it did to Alec Stewart, the one man in the world who would have no need for such a device. Meanwhile, reverting to county matters, Tres is approaching a brilliant and probably match winning century, currently 96 not out, as Somerset, 211 for seven have a lead of 233. Oh Hoppsy, the Trent Bridge Inn, referred to yesterday is actually the World enowned Tre t Bridge Inn. 12.10pm: I can&apos;t help noticing that Jonathan Bairstow is getting a bit of a blasting on the blog as Yorkshire&apos;s bye tally mounts up, writes David Hopps in Canterbury. Martyn Moxon made a passionate defence of him after the first day&apos;s play, fuelled by nothing stronger than a raspberry J2O (he had to pick up Tino Best at 5am). The ball had hooped round corners, asserted Moxon, for the first two sessions and he would have challenged most keepers to get a glove on them. Even if Yorkshire play Bairstow as a specialist batsman in the championship then Gerard Brophy is not the greatest keeper in the world. And if you play both Bairstow and Brophy then you have to drop a batsman - and that means not only goodbye to Adam Lyth, but presumably another request to Jacques Rudolph to open the batting on sufference in Lyth&apos;s place. In other words, taking the gloves off Bairstow has a knock-on effect in several other areas. Yorkshire will probably give Brophy the gloves on Sunday. But the new captain, Andrew Gale, has advocated Bairstow behind the stumps and that for the moment is where he is going to stay. Elsewhere, I see Gloucetsershire are going under again at Nevil Road, 46 for five against Sussex and requiring another 281. Two visits by the pitch inspector, who has found them not guilty, but two defeats. Some might suggest that had turned out even-handedly. Gloucestershire&apos;s designs on promotion have been sorely hit - and April is not yet spent. 12pm: My body is in position in my tent in South Croydon, writes Vic Marks. My mind keeps drifting to Trent Bridge where the game appears to be moving on. Anyway here Andre Nel has taken centre stage. He has managed to talk himself into the slips in this game, which is a grand idea for an old stager provided no one nicks it. Kervezee nicked it in the first over off Schofield and a crestfallen Nel dropped it. However the great big South African has atoned with a wicket, that of Moeen Ali. Nel, by a disturbing margin, has been Surrey&apos;s best bowler. Kervezee, by the way, is a sweet timer of the ball. I thought that David Hopps had once dabbled in the travel business yet somehow it comes as no surprise that compared to him my overnight accommodation was rather uneventful and totally devoid of any eccentricity whatsoever. Had a brief glass of wine - courtesy of Surrey CCC - in that amazing sports centre Selve was mentioning and then it was back to defrost in front of the leaders&apos; debate. Where will my lords and masters send me on 6 May? I need to vote. Which reminds of an election story of the late 80s. Jack Russell and Bill Athey, at the time living in the same constituency in Bristol while playing for Gloucestershire, were eager to exercise their democratic right. The problem was that they were playing in Yorkshire. So on the eve of polling day they set off in the same car back to Bristol on an arduous round trip to the polling station. One of them voted Tory, the other Labour. Worcs 307 for four. 11.50am: Nottinghamshire have just taken their first wicket of the day, that of Damien Wright, but it has come at a price, writes Mike Selvey. Wright was bowled by a horrible shooter from Luke Fletcher but not before he had scored 78 from 72 balls, with 15 fours, adding 136 in 20 overs with Marcus Trescothick. 33 for five at one time, Somerset are now in the box seat at 180 for seven: noone really minds seeing really erratic bounce when you are more than 200 on. The stardust wore off Stuart Broad by the way, and his three overs first thing disappeared for 25. 11.35am: Two lbw decisions have wrapped up Yorkshire&apos;s first innings in no time this morning and left Kent with a first-innings lead of 34, writes David Hopps. David Wainwright, who looked safer than most, finished unbeaten on 16. It felt a bit of a waste, but somebody has to bat No10 I suppose. Azhar Mahmood, excellent throughout, finished with 4-58. Talk around the ground is that Kent are close to signing Makhaya Ntini. Mr Summerfield at the bookstall was full of it this morning as he loaded his old cricket tomes out of his van. It is an excellent bookstall (it would be even better if he got rid of the David Lemmons), but he knows that there are more over-70s reading cricket books than under-30s, which does not offer much hope for the future. Two years from now, if his bookstall is not moved, it will probably be in the reception area of the new hotel. Not a brick has been laid yet and I think Kent may already have me on the banned list as a potentially troublesome customer. It is a big test now for Tim Bresnan and Ajmal Shahzad, who will have to be at their best to conjure up another Yorkshire victory before they head off with England for World Twenty20. 11.05am: Morning one and all, writes Mike Selvey at Trent Bridge. And the happiest of St George&apos;s Days, something I have long since celebrated but which suddenly appears to have hit the nation&apos;s conscience. I found listening to Peter Alliss reciting the John of Gaunt (&quot;Gaunty&quot;) speech from Richard II, to the accompaniment of Elgar&apos;s Variation &quot;Nimrod&quot;, a little saccharine. But there you are. Happy birthday Shakespeare for all that (although his 52nd wasn&apos;t too flash as he pegged out, the same day as Cervantes as it happened). As I speak Marcus Trescothick has arrived at the crease to tilt at a few windmills with Sancho Panza in the form of Damien Wright. Sorry about the pub, Hoppsy. It was very nice when I used to book the four poster room there. But that was 22 years ago. 10.30am: One of the many pleasures of life on the county circuit - whether as a journalist or a travelling supporter \u2013 is the occasional opportunity to seek out a nice spot to stay for the night. It&apos;s just that down here in Kent I&apos;m making such a terrible hash of it, writes David Hopps with dodgy stomach at Canterbury. Twenty-four hours ago, I stayed in the hotel that Yorkshire are using in Ashford, tacky tacky, and had a bit of a whinge about it. &quot;Never fear,&quot; said my colleague Mr Selvey, mentally thumbing through the 1982 Good Pub Guide. &quot;I know a great pub.&quot; Well, it&apos;s a great pub no longer. The low point came about 9.30pm when I was sat in an empty restaurant trying to finish a novel and the manager and one of his underlings convened a staff meeting on a table three yards away to discuss the rota for the following week. Talk about intrusive; well, incompetent really. I suppose I could have complained but it would have only turned into a Basil Fawlty moment. Selv, the recommendation was a shocker. But back to the cricket. Fortunately, Kent v Yorkshire has been a wonderfully well-fought, lively game and with luck it should cheer me up in no time. There are times when county cricket&apos;s ability to become an escape from the worst bits of the real world is a lifesaver.", "sentences": ["Cricket Archive revealed that Mike Atherton had top scored and was man of the match, but I couldn&apos;t recall him getting it, and he confirmed that yesterday, having just returned from Barbados via Port of Spain, Caracas, and Amsterdam."], "title": "County cricket - as it happened! | Mike Selvey, David Hopps and Vic Marks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/23/county-cricket-latest-scores", "tags": ["Cricket", "County Championship Division One", "County Championship Division Two", "Sport", "County Championship 2010 Division One", "County Championship 2010 Division Two"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-23T13:35:01Z", "article": "Bradley Wiggins believes he is in a &quot;really good position&quot; ahead of next month&apos;s Giro d&apos;Italia and has confirmed that he is targeting the opening time trial in Amsterdam, the team time trial and a spell in the leader&apos;s pink jersey. &quot;I&apos;m a lot better than I was this time last year just going into the Giro,&quot; Wiggins told cyclingnews.com. &quot;We did some testing on some local climbs in Spain which I was also doing this time last year.

A vision of vessels branching from the heart? Yet the page from Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s Codex Arundel notebook in the Treasures gallery of the British Library is not \u2013 or not directly \u2013 a study of human anatomy. It is a map: a geographical plan, a piece of the world reduced to a flat depiction. It shows the riverbed of the Arno near Florence and was made in about 1504 for a practical purpose. Florence, at war with its neighbour Pisa, had hatched a plan to divert the Arno and so deprive the enemy city of its lifeblood. Leonardo was surveying the river to work out how it could be turned from its course. And yet, if it is practical in purpose, and scrupulous in method \u2013 Leonardo has walked the riverbed, surveyed it \u2013 this little sketch map is cosmic in scope. It is a vision of the world, touched into life in a few strokes of red chalk. It expresses, magically, an entire philosophy. For it is no coincidence, still less a poetic flourish, that all the bloody strands of the riverbed make you think of anatomy. Leonardo and his contemporaries conceived the earth as a living creature, a macrocosmic mirror of our own inner life. As he put it: Man has been called by the ancients a little world, and certainly the name is well given, for if a man is made of earth, water, air and fire, so is this body of the earth; if man has in him a lake of blood, where the lungs increase and decrease in breathing, the body of the earth has its ocean which similarly rises and falls . . . When Leonardo drew his map of the Arno, the shape of the entire earth was changing. Just three or so years later, the Lorraine map-maker Martin Waldseem\u00fcller would publish what is arguably the most influential map in history: not only does it accurately depict the shape of Africa, but a thin sliver of land in the western sea is named, for the first time, &quot;America&quot;. The maps of the age of discovery boggle the mind with their intellectual conquest of space. In the mid-15th century, a state-of-the-art map created by the Venetian cartographer Fra Mauro had seen the world as a huge disc, with south at the top, Africa just a vague shape, and nothing to the west of the Fortunate Isles (the Canaries). Not just the knowledge of world geography but the very conceptualisation of space in this late medieval map looks to us remote and arcane. It seems an incredible leap that just over a century later maps of the world looked much as they do today \u2013 the same continents, their coastlines instantly recognisable, planned out on paper in a mathematically consistent manner. The period from 1500 to 1700 is the golden age of maps. Scientific achievement is central to that story \u2013 or is it? For Leonardo&apos;s little sketch of the Arno reveals that maps still had something about them of the fabulous and the mythical. They were works of imagination as well as calculation. This is why the maps of these centuries still give us a warm glow of pleasure, why they are treasured by collectors and daydreamers \u2013 because this was still a time when monsters haunted the oceans, even on the most forward-looking charts. The world was being discovered, its shape analysed, but it was imagined \u2013 Leonardo shows us \u2013 as an organic and mysterious entity. Rivers were arteries, the seas lungs. Nature was a synthesis of the four elements, fire, earth, air and water: maps were records of its marvels. Nothing could convey the wondrous and strange nature of geographical knowledge more spectacularly than the Klencke Atlas, which stars in an ambitious exhibition, Magnificent Maps, at the British Library, as well as in the accompanying BBC4 series The Beauty of Maps, featuring the exhibition&apos;s curator, Peter Barber. This book is taller than a man: bound in leather and closed with huge metal clasps, it opens to reveal a succession of printed maps each of which is more than 2m wide. This is the biggest atlas in the world, according to Guinness World Records \u2013 the macrocosm to the microcosm of Leonardo&apos;s Arno sketch. In November 1660 the diarist John Evelyn saw it in Charles II&apos;s cabinet of curiosities, together with portrait miniatures, precious stones and &quot;a curious Ship model&quot;: it was a present fit for a king, presented to the new and restored monarch on his coronation by a group of Amsterdam merchants. At that moment Amsterdam was the world centre of map-making. Maps were engraved and printed there not just for monarchs but for merchants and their families. The virtue of the atlas conceived by Johannes Klencke was, through sheer extravagance, to ennoble something that was actually increasingly universal. The maps in the great book are the same printed maps you see in Vermeer&apos;s paintings of Dutch merchant houses: in his Woman in Blue Reading a Letter, painted almost contemporaneously with the Klencke Atlas in the early 1660s, a young woman stands in the pale light from a window, her eyes fixed on the message she&apos;s reading. The light shines on her blue silken tunic and blue-upholstered chairs, which might suggest a lover far away across the blue sea. Behind her, dominating the whitewashed wall, is a printed map, mounted on wooden poles and hung like a painting to decorate the chamber. It is on the same big scale as the prints in the Klencke volume. It shows fractured peninsulas and islands separated by water, a Dutch geography of vulnerability that matches the woman&apos;s mood. Big printed wall maps appear in many of Vermeer&apos;s paintings, as well as in such contemporary scenes as Pieter de Hooch&apos;s A Woman Drinking with Two Men (1658) in the National Gallery. These views of everyday life bear witness to an almost totemic cult of maps. What, exactly, was the appeal of a huge woodcut map hanging on your wall? As\u00a0much as we want to read simple emotional messages into Vermeer&apos;s paintings, the wrinkled, breeze-touched, black and white paper maps he depicts also attest to a fascination with maps as such, with what they are \u2013 and this, for him, is enigmatic. Magnificent Maps leads us deep into the mentality of awe and wonder his pictures of maps communicate. It tells the story of mural maps \u2013 geographical statements that were hung on walls or even painted into the very plaster of palaces as frescoes. It argues that maps in early-modern Europe were as likely to decorate a room as paintings or tapestries were \u2013 and so puts a new twist on the truth that maps can be works of art in their own right. No one who has walked along the seemingly endless Galleria delle Carte Geografiche in the Vatican Museums would doubt this. This hypnotic corridor is today walked by streams of tourists heading for the Sistine Chapel, punctuated along its straight-as-a-ruler marble funnel by souvenir stalls. But it is a bizarrely memorable walk that grips your imagination and stays with you as one of the sights of Rome \u2013 for the entire corridor is frescoed with mammoth maps of Italy&apos;s regions and cities. Painted by Ignazio Danti in the mid-16th century, these epic cartographies create a terrestrial theatre that in its way rivals the heavenly theatre of the Sistine Chapel itself. The maps are realistic, detailed and on a colossal scale \u2013 but were they ever any use to anyone? It is hard to picture a Renaissance pope standing on a stepladder to study a detail of Volterra or Venice to decide some political move. There were manuscript maps in the Vatican Library that could be spread out on a table for real strategic meetings. These painted maps are images of power, designed to amaze and to stupefy. As you progress further along the corridor, the cavalcade of city plans becomes repetitive, narcotic and sublime. It is a spectacle as deliberately excessive as the Klencke Atlas, a majestic display of ownership and control of space. The architecture of the long gallery is itself a daunting demonstration of spatial majesty \u2013 an unfurling of absurdly generous proportions \u2013 and the maps mirror its grandeur. The British Library exhibition can&apos;t, obviously, bring the Vatican frescoes to London \u2013 although it includes large-scale photographs of this and other cartographic interiors \u2013 but does have the Klencke Atlas and a range of maps made in the same spirit of daunting excess. Jacopo de&apos; Barbari&apos;s bird&apos;s-eye view of Venice, created in 1500, is on a scale that would fit quite easily among the city plans in the Vatican: nearly 3m wide. But de&apos; Barbari&apos;s map is a woodcut, black ink on paper, that sent the image of Venice around the world to hang in foreign palaces as evidence of the Most Serene Republic&apos;s power. What a map. It seems for all the world to have been surveyed from the air. The incline of the earth as de&apos; Barbari looks down on Venice, seeing the exact shape of its islands in the ethereal setting of the lagoon, uncannily resembles an aerial photograph. But obviously he did not have a flying machine. He projected this image in his imagination, tilted up towards us at just such an angle as to reveal the overall shape of Venice while also allowing the eye to zoom in and see, as in a topographic painting, the scene on St Mark&apos;s Square. Ships teem around the Arsenale while a colossal triton rides a sea monster at the mouth of the Grand Canal \u2013 the real marries the fabulous as Venice is wedded to the sea. The artistic glory of Renaissance maps lies in the ambiguity of their nature, for it is impossible to decide if this a map in the modern sense or a landscape picture. It hovers magically between the two. A straightforward plan of Venice would reveal the contours of the city and the layout of the canals, but would not capture the living reality of city life; while a painting at street level, such as Carpaccio&apos;s Miracle at the Rialto, though it conveys the forest of chimneys and the intimacy of bridges, can give no sense of the city&apos;s overall design. There is a genius and a freedom to de&apos; Barbari&apos;s bird&apos;s-eye view that gives him both perspectives simultaneously \u2013 near and far. In the 21st century, a user of Google Maps can explore similar variations in perspective \u2013 moving from a city plan to a more detailed map of a neighbourhood to photographs taken on the street. This masterpiece gives all of that in one rich image. In fact, a map such as this is so close to landscape art that it urges us to ask \u2013 do early-modern maps ape landscape pictures, or is it the other way around? Mapping and landscape art evolved together in the Renaissance, and this exhibition reveals something quite shocking to conventional art history: that maps were displayed as works of art before landscape paintings were similarly valued. One of the earliest exhibits in the show is a facsimile of the Hereford Mappa Mundi, created like other medieval maps to stand alone and be studied like a painting or a stained glass window. The curators also attempt to reconstruct the world map that is known to have hung in Henry III&apos;s bedchamber in Westminster Palace in the 1230s. That is centuries before landscape art was valued in its own right. The first dated landscape drawing in European history \u2013 meaning a landscape that is not a background, but a theme in itself \u2013 is currently on view in the British Museum&apos;s exhibition of Italian Renaissance drawings: it was done on 5 August 1473 by Leonardo da Vinci. While its mountainous foreground is a fantasia of landscape, the plain in the distance rolling away towards the sea resembles a map in its outlines of fields. Just like Jacopo de&apos; Barbari \u2013 but in a uniquely sustained and complex way \u2013 Leonardo saw landscape art and map-making as intimately related. His drawings and paintings navigate an intricate course between the viewpoint of a landscape artist and a geographer. Unlike de&apos; Barbari he actually did try to build a flying machine and hoped to use it for skyborne observation \u2013 he writes in a notebook of &quot;surveying&quot; the land from his &quot;great bird&quot;. But he probably never did get his machine off the ground. Instead his bird&apos;s-eye views are feats of imagination, like de&apos;\u00a0Barbari&apos;s woodcut of Venice. Leonardo experimented with every point of view for map-making: his maps range from views of mountains in deep relief, the earth tilted up for our pleasure, to straightforward plans, to unique hybrids of the two. The vertiginous landscape of his painting The Virgin and Child with St Anne in the Louvre is itself as satisfying as a geographic atlas: the detailed rocks in the foreground stretch away to a blue vista of alpine mountains that has the sweep and scope of a map. Leonardo was a pioneer of landscape but his landscapes are legitimated, as artistic subjects, by religious narratives \u2013 there is no pure landscape painting by him. One of the first such paintings is by Albrecht Altdorfer and portrays a bridge and a castle in a forest (it&apos;s in the National Gallery): this is almost an anti-map, as it tells us nothing of where the place is, or its wider geographical context. But when painters started successfully to sell landscapes in the 17th century they took their cue from Leonardo&apos;s cartographic approach, and their paintings aspired to the status of maps. In 17th-century Europe maps were honoured and admired. The fresco maps of the Vatican and of other Italian palaces \u2013 Danti, who painted the Vatican maps, cut his teeth creating a fabulous room of maps in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence \u2013 were emulated across the continent. Printed maps, often hand-coloured, were designed to be displayed, as Dutch paintings show them to have been. If maps were hung like paintings, cartography also produced a new genre of sculpture \u2013 the globe. The exhibition has a pair of globes \u2013 terrestrial and celestial \u2013 created by Emery Molyneux in London at the end of the 16th century, that were the most renowned such objects in Elizabethan England. Maps of this age provided extraordinary density of information. Jacques Callot&apos;s map of the siege of Breda (1628-29) is not just a geographical but a historical image. It shows the battle for the Dutch town of Breda in complex detail, bearing witness to atrocities as well as recording the victory of Spain, and combining the human detail of a history painting with the spatial information of a map. It is a work of art in its own right and its topographic details also feature in the eerie vista of Vel\u00e1zquez&apos;s masterpiece of history painting, The Surrender of Breda. Landscape painters looked hard at such maps and their popularity. The landscapes of Ruysdael and Cuyp in the Netherlands, of Poussin and Claude in Italy and France, aspire to be maps. If you look at these paintings they all, in different ways, relate intensely to mapmaking. Dutch landscape artists go flat on the land, exploring its details: their paintings are like maps turned on their sides. In accuracy and detail they strongly resemble the printed maps streaming out of Amsterdam. The French landscape artists who worked in 17th-century Rome may seem less obviously geographical, but to look at their paintings is to look at pictures that sum up the world as encyclopedically as Leonardo does: again and again these paintings aspire to include every kind of scenery in one view \u2013 woodlands, rocks, sea, mountains \u2013 so that a painting has the satisfying completeness of a map of the world. Not until the 19th century would painters rebel against this tendency for each landscape to be a kind of world map \u2013 a summary of the nature of landscape as such. A beguiling example of such paintings is Francisque Millet&apos;s Mountain Landscape with Lightning (1675). Here it is not just a variety of scenery that is encompassed: every one of the four elements is on view. The Leonardesque view of the Alps encloses a rich anthology of natural and human terrains, a world map in one glorious vista. Even so, it is no more compelling, as a work of art, than the maps of the age. Only when geography became truly rationalist, when maps were purified into utilitarian tools, did landscape art rule the gallery alone \u2013 and that transformation around 1700 was a loss to the imagination. Art and science both lost blood when monsters vanished from the maps.

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said providing heroin on the NHS would cut crime rates and help wean addicts off the drug. Speaking in a personal capacity after a debate on the issue at the RCN&apos;s annual conference in Bournemouth, he said: &quot;I do believe in heroin prescribing. The fact is, heroin is very addictive. People who are addicted so often resort to crime, to steal to buy the heroin.&quot; He said he was aware of the controversy over how chronic drug users should be treated, but said: &quot;It might take a few years but I think people will understand. If you are going to get people off heroin then in the initial stages we have to have proper heroin prescribing services.&quot; The statement provoked an immediate reaction from academics and from within the nursing profession, with many saying that this was a &quot;slippery slope&quot; which could see the state subsidising other addictive drugs such as cocaine. However there is emerging research that this strategy can work. Pilot studies run by academics at King&apos;s College&apos;s national addiction centre suggest that allowing users to inject heroin under medical supervision could cut local crime rates by two-thirds in six months. Of 127 users involved in the pilots, three-quarters &quot;substantially reduced&quot; their use of street drugs, while their spending on drugs fell from \u00a3300 to \u00a350 a week. The number of crimes they committed fell from 1,731 in three months to 547 in six months. Users were offered a range of support, including psychological therapy, and typically attended the clinic up to twice daily, seven days a week. The cost was about \u00a315,000 per patient per year, compared with prison costs of \u00a344,000 a year, researchers behind the pilots said. Dr Carter said: &quot;Critics say you are encouraging drug addiction, but the reality is that these people are addicts and they are going to do it anyway. I think there should be research into drug consumption rooms \u2013 they have them in Sydney and Amsterdam.&quot; Despite being derided as state-funded &quot;shooting galleries&quot;, he said in these two cities users had stopped injecting in places such as school playgrounds and the stairwells of housing complexes. Debating the issue at the RCN conference, several nurses agreed with the approach. Claire Topham Brown, from Cambridgeshire, said providing heroin on the NHS could cut the transmission of viruses such as HIV and hepatitis and provide a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to get people off heroin and on to the heroin substitute methadone. However Gail Brooks, from the RCN&apos;s UK safety representatives committee, opposed the idea: &quot;Where would this stop? Cannabis, cocaine, crack cocaine \u2026 other substances? If you do this for heroin, do you have to do this for every other drug out there?&quot; Some academics were highly critical of the approach, saying that it would enter the realm of &quot;social problem prescribing&quot;. Neil McKechnie, professor of drug misuse research at Glasgow University, said: &quot;Prescribing heroin on the basis of reducing crime is risky territory. It should be on the basis of clinical need \u2026 in this case an individual prescribed a medicine to reduce crime. It is an ethically questionable proposal. &quot;We should be focused on getting users off drugs, not giving them access to additional drugs. Certainly over the last 10 years of the Labour government we have emphasised harm reduction over abstinence.&quot; In the runup to the election the major parties have all stressed the importance of alternative treatments for long-term drug addicts. Other experts said money should be spent on therapy instead. David Green, director of the Civitas thinktank, said: &quot;Money should be spent on therapy approaches, rather than keeping users on drugs. &quot;One idea being piloted at the moment is using so-called &apos;opioid antagonists&apos; \u2013 drugs which make people sick if they take heroin. There is a pilot currently underway in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and it takes five days or so for users to get off heroin.&quot;", "sentences": ["I think there should be research into drug consumption rooms \u2013 they have them in Sydney and Amsterdam.&quot; Despite being derided as state-funded &quot;shooting galleries&quot;, he said in these two cities users had stopped injecting in places such as school playgrounds and the stairwells of housing complexes."], "title": "Prescribe heroin on the NHS, says nurse leader", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/26/prescribe-heroin-nhs-nurse-rcn", "tags": ["Drugs", "NHS", "Nursing", "Health", "Drugs policy", "Drugs", "Crime", "Society", "Politics", "Science", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-26T22:00:01Z", "article": "When Bach visited the court of Frederick the Great of Prussia in 1747, he was warmly welcomed by the highly musical monarch, and responded with his Musical Offering to the king, a virtuoso demonstration of contrapuntal dexterity based on a theme Frederick had given him.

Bach&apos;s canons and fugues largely lack instructions as to which instruments should be deployed. In selecting from two violins, viola, cello, double bass, flute and harpsichord, the Dutch Bach specialist and his colleagues stressed the primacy of intermeshed lines over colour, which here the composer clearly considered secondary to abstract themes juxtaposed with their own inversions. The exception was the trio sonata, for which Bach stipulated flute, violin and continuo, the first instrument a homage to Frederick, a\u00a0flautist. This was the evening&apos;s most spontaneous performance, with flautist Jan de Winne and violinist Catherine Manson competing for attention, even if the limitations of the baroque flute left the latter the clear winner. After the interval, Koopman was joined on harpsichord by his wife, Tini Mathot, for an alternative version of the Musical Offering&apos;s six-part Ricercar and a concerto for two harpsichords.

Alas, we must trust the manufacturer&apos;s claims instead:  Satino Black is the only truly CO2-neutral toilet paper made with 100% recycled paper and an environmentally friendly production process, and yet it is just as soft and white as normal toilet paper. &quot;Many users do not know that for the largest part toilet paper is still made of trees which are chopped down for that specific reason. That is totally unnecessary. That&apos;s why we manufacture Satino Black from 100% recycled paper,&quot; says Henk van Houtum, director of Van Houtum. &quot;In addition, we have developed a new production process during the last two-and-a-half years to replace all the harmful chemicals with biologically degradable raw materials and additives&quot; The water and energy consumption for the production of Satino Black are already the lowest in the world in the market segment.

And, as we must assume that Sheryl Crow&apos;s request in 2007 that we only use one sheet of toilet roll per visitation went largely unheeded, the sheer quantities of dead trees we now use to nettoyer nos derri\u00e8res demands a new approach. As Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defence Council, said last year: &quot;Future generations are going to look at the way we make toilet paper as one of the greatest excesses of our age. Making toilet paper from virgin wood is a lot worse than driving Hummers in terms of global warming pollution.&quot; I have a feeling that Van Houtum, the Dutch paper manufacturer responsible for Satino Black, might be slightly overplaying its hand, though:  It&apos;s so easy to go green.

For updates from around the grounds, scroll down The counties are having their say on reorganisation of the county championship, writes David Hopps. The Professional Cricketers&apos; Association is also surveying its members. Now, the Guardian&apos;s county blog gives you an opportunity to have your say. Counties must reply by 4 June on five potential options for the county championship. All options aim to reduce the amount of time given to the championship to create room for the Twenty20 cricket that is essential to the game&apos;s financial survival. The ECB considers the proposals on 23 June, with the executive board poised to make a decision on 6 July. But already plans have been thrown into chaos as the Test-match counties have formed an unofficial pressure group under the chairmanship of the Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves, who held emergency discussions with the ECB chairman Giles Clarke this week. With many counties under increasing financial pressure, and the Test-match counties pleading for additional revenue because of ambitious ground improvement plans, a move away from 16 four-day games and a greater emphasis on Twenty20 cricket is inevitable. Feedback from county cricket followers has been strongly against any American-style conference system. There is even a Facebook group in protest about the possibility \u2013 a rare example of county followers beginning to form themselves, if vaguely, into an online pressure group. These are the options in the consultation document: 1) A Premier Division of eight teams and Division One split into two regional pools of five teams. This idea is fast gaining favour. Premier Division sides play each other twice, making a total of 14 matches. Division One sides play each counties in their own pool twice, so maximizing the number of derby games, and counties in the other pool once, making up 13 games. 2) Retain the present system of two divisions of nine, but with reduced games. Just accept that there is no time for each county to play the others twice and get on with it. 3) Unapologetic Americanism. Three conferences of six teams each with end-of-season play-offs. No promotion and relegation and no top division, with sides drawn randomly. No information on whether candyfloss and Big Macs will be compulsory. Counties are taking this seriously, but they will face a supporters&apos; revolt if they ever raise the energy. 4) More unapologetic Americanism \u2013 again three divisions of six, but with matches played over five days. It would therefore replicate Test cricket which might have appeal to some. But four-day cricket has always been popular with county players and coaches as a true test of ability. And the lower the standard, the shorter the length of game the players can justify. Can county cricketers really make five-day cricket remotely appealing? 5) The addition of three Minor Counties to expand the first-class counties to 21. This would enable them to be split into three divisions of seven with one-up, one-down, reducing matches to 12 games. Salary caps would be enforced, graded for each division, and transfer movement encouraged. But it is unlikely that three Minor Counties would want to join the championship, especially in the current financial climate and talenty \u2013 and the ECB&apos;s annual handout, currently about \u00a31.7m - would be spread more thinly. Don&apos;t forget to vote. 3.18pm: Can someone explain to me, asks Vic Marks, why it is that the Test grounds believe that they should have a monopoly on any new Twenty20 competition? I understand one reason: the Test grounds have over-reached themselves. They may have been encouraged to do this by the ECB and as a consequence they may feel a little betrayed by the centre. They have spent millions on the basis that they will be hosting international cricket on a regular basis. But there are too many &quot;Test&quot; grounds and not enough big fixtures to go around. So there is a desperate scramble to recoup some money via some/any Twenty20 extravaganza. By why do the Test grounds assume that any Twenty20 extravaganza would not be suitable at Worcester, or Chelmsford - or indeed Taunton? Very often these grounds produce a better TV product, which is what matters so much nowadays. They offer a better stage; stands are more easily filled; it is easier to generate &quot;atmosphere&quot;. To encapsulate the problem: I was at Cardiff last Sunday for a 40 over ground. That mammoth stand, which was full of people and excitement when Monty and Jimmy Anderson were playing their forward defensives against Australian, was completely empty. To save money they did not even bother to open it to cut the cost of stewarding. How will Cardiff, a sporadic international venue, balance the books? PS No play yet - just mizzle.     This picture showing Jonathan Trott being run out by Australia's Simon Katich at The Oval last summer won the Sports Action section of the World Press Photo competition. Photograph by Gareth Copley/PA    3pm: Andy Wilson at Old Trafford writes: Early tea, inspection at 3.40pm, possible start 4pm. Mopping up has started, although it&apos;s still raining. 1.40pm: Raining at Old Trafford, writes Andy Wilson, and shaping as a lengthy afternoon delay. Be interesting to see how any reforms to the Championship dovetail with a new Twenty20 competition? My conspiracy theory would be the eight-team Premier League ending up remarkably similar to a 10-team Twenty20 EPL - the Test grounds (Durham, Glam, Glos, Hants, Lancs, Middx, Notts, Warks, Yorks) plus one other. Who would get that 10th lucky ticket? All conjecture, of course. 1.10pm: Rain easing, almost stopped but the covers are still on, reports Vic Marks at Taunton. The presence of CMJ means that we keep an eye upon what&apos;s happening at Hove. Sussex are on the brink of another win, Monty has taken three wickets this morning, two of them, following the usual pattern, were lbws. Who, we wondered, is umpiring down there. Well, one of them is Graham Lloyd, Bumble&apos;s boy and an ex-Lancashire and England (for ODIs) player. He must have joined the list recently because I haven&apos;t spotted him before. Which set us thinking on the old chestnut about the genes and how important they must be in cricket - but then so is nurture, I suppose - and the number of current players who merely represent another generation of first-class cricketers. In this game there is, of course, a Compton; there is also a Masters, whose predecessor was not quite so prominent as Denis, but &quot;Hod&quot; plodded in for Kent a couple decades ago. Looking around the counties now there are many familiar names. Most of their fathers hit me for six. This list is not comprehensive - yet. In fact it&apos;s fairly random, but here goes ... Bairstow, Broad, Borrington, Compton, Gatting (a nephew), Hogg, Cobb, Maynard, Sidebottom, Jefferson, Wells (son of Alan is on the Sussex staff), Willey, Tremlett with Ealham and Butcher only just retired. No doubt there are more. Over to you ... 12.30pm: And a few other updates from the Second Division, writes Andy Wilson. Monty&apos;s taken a second wicket for Sussex to keep them on course for victory against Leicestershire, Paul Borrington - a young non-South African, hurrah - going well for Derbys at Northampton, and Middlesex need 280-ish to beat Gloucestershire. The moment for Andrew Strauss to make his mark? 12.20pm: A frustrating morning for Kent so far, writes Andy Wilson at Old Trafford, but that could leave Lancashire with a tricky decision. With helpful overhead conditions and the pitch still offering pace, bounce and movement, Makhaya Ntini and Amjad Khan both looked dangerous. Ntini had Mark Chilton dropped at third slip before adding to his overnight score, and Amjad had a loud appeal for a legside caught behind against Prince turned down. Amjad in particular seemed to lose his rag, bowling too much short stuff which Prince dealt with harshly. Rob Key has turned to Simon Cook and Darren Stevens, but Lancs have moved on to 130 for three - a lead of 237 - with Prince approaching another half century. However, the forecast is for light showers today then heavier rain tomorrow, so they will have to consider an early declaration - especially with the change in the points system in the Championship this season to which Vic has already referred, whereby a draw carries only three points and there are 16 available for a win. 12pm: I&apos;m mildly concerned about all this talk of rain in the west, writes David Hopps. It&apos;s due to arrive at Headingley around tea time \u2013 although it might be petering out by the time it reaches Leeds - but the county blog could be down to a single game, and me giving score updates to the web&apos;s version of &quot;a traditional county crowd.&quot; That would be a shame. Dale Benkenstein insisted that he had no fitness problems when he left the ground last night \u2013 he had injured his right knee on the first day running out Anthony McGrath - but he must have just been acting tough. He has been limping around at the crease this morning as Durham have slowly added to their overnight 54 for three without further mishaps. They are 84 for three in response to Yorkshire&apos;s 610 for six declared. It is his right knee so it is the backfoot shots that are giving him most discomfort. On a pitch of reasonable pace and bounce Tino Best could put him under a lot of pressure, but this is not a pitch of reasonable pace and bounce. He has got away with one cut shot against Best that he played without much control, but with 45 minutes gone Yorkshire have turned to Adil Rashid. He can prepare for a long bowl and after his inactivity with England in South Africa that can only be beneficial. 11.35am: It&apos;s raining - not quite double wipers - but it&apos;s solid rain, writes Vic Marks in Taunton. No chink in the skies, no hope of play before lunch, not much hope of play today. Proper April weather at last. So I&apos;m off to the pavilion (the Andy Caddick one) to deliver the Wisden Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award to Jos Buttler. I collected it on his behalf - a trophy and a leather-bound Wisden - at the dinner a couple weeks ago. It could have remained in my study for a couple of years, but this morning I&apos;ve remembered. Will pop back later but the game will not be advanced. I wonder - if the weather improves tomorrow - whether the tinker with the points system this year will prompt to the two sides to conjure a game. 10.40am: A surprise chance of a prompt start here, with both teams warming up under despite gloomy skies and the odd spot of drizzle, writes Andy Wilson at Old Trafford. Lancashire will be keen to press on, with a commanding lead of 175 and seven second-innings wickets remaining, although as someone said last night, they surely can&apos;t rely on Kent batting as badly again. Darren Stevens was the significant exception to that, hitting an aggressive and intelligent century to follow the four wickets he took in Lancashire&apos;s first innings. There&apos;s an interesting piece about Stevens by the Kent cricket guru Mark Pennell on the testmatchextra.com website - to which I must declare an allegiance as a regular contributor - describing the 33-year-old&apos;s winter in South Africa then Zimbabwe, and the influence of Geoff Arnold on his much-improved bowling. The idea that anyone would choose to play cricket in Zimbabwe surprised me, but that&apos;s probably just my ignorance never having been to the country. Stevens linked up with the former Yorkshire and Middlesex seamer (and keen Castleford fan) Chris Silverwood who was coaching out there, apparently. Zimbabwe&apos;s victory over Australia in a Twenty20 warm-up game in the Caribbean also came as a shock to those of us who have only been vaguely aware of their recent signs of a modest improvement. It will be interesting to see how they do in the tournament proper. One last thing relating to this match, that may already have been discussed in previous county blogs, is the effect that a regulation change forbidding the use of the heavy roller during matches may have on pitches in the Championship this year. The theory I&apos;ve heard expressed by people who know far more than me is that it makes decisions such as the one Rob Key made here, to bowl first, even more risky as the heavy roller has previously delayed the deterioration of pitches. That could make the big fourth-innings run chases that have become increasingly common in recent years far more tricky. (When Kent are 373 for two on Friday afternoon, don&apos;t hold that against me.) 10.20am: After play finished at Headingley last night, I grabbed a quick beer with Gareth Copley, PA&apos;s award-winning cricket photographer and one of the funniest people on the cricket circuit, writes David Hopps. Copley is flying to Amsterdam about now for the World Press Awards for this picture of Jonathan Trott being run out by Simon Katich during the final Test in the Ashes series at The Oval last summer. Copley has to make the longest speech of his life tomorrow and, as he will be no doubt surrounded by war photographers who have never even heard of cricket it should be quite a challenge. I have advised him just to do his impression of Derek Pringle. The pub we were in had three pumps of London Pride, adorned with the heads of Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Women of a certain age were glowering at the Brown pump and drinking lager and lime instead; I know not why, I may have missed something. The results made interesting reading: Lib Dems 36%, Labour 33%, Conservatives 21%. Before I realised what was going on I had ordered a pint of Abbot. I hope that does not put me down as a supporter of the Pope. It has long been a source of frustration for the best sports photographers \u2013 of which The Guardian&apos;s Tom Jenkins is another - that their best work often does not reach the paper - or even the web. Cameras are laden with evocative sports shots that never see the light of day. This picture of Trott, incidentally, was requested by his wife to display on the lounge wall as a surprise present when he returned from Bangladesh. Trott had remarked in passing in Bangladesh that he had did not overly care for the photograph because it showed him getting out. (Practical man that he is, he would have preferred the shot that got him to debut Test hundred - even if it was taken from half a mile away and was hopelessly out of focus.) It is to be hoped that Trott&apos;s surprise went down well. In fact that is precisely the story that Copley should tell in Amsterdam. I must ring up and tell him.", "sentences": ["Copley is flying to Amsterdam about now for the World Press Awards for this picture of Jonathan Trott being run out by Simon Katich during the final Test in the Ashes series at The Oval last summer.", "In fact that is precisely the story that Copley should tell in Amsterdam."], "title": "County cricket \u2013 as it happened | David Hopps, Vic Marks and Andy Wilson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/29/county-cricket-live-blog", "tags": ["County Championship Division One", "Cricket", "Sport", "County Championship 2010 Division One"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-04-29T11:02:34Z", "article": "Dutch landscape art is a lovely detour for the imagination, best enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon. Actually, that&apos;s not quite right \u2013 it creates its own benign Sunday around it. Presumably that was the appeal for Amsterdam merchants in the 17th century who enjoyed peering into tranquil rustic worlds painted with a cartographer&apos;s eye for the shapes of fields. Landscape painting often fills a void in urban hearts. Many of the first great European images of the countryside were painted in Venice \u2013 a city cut off from its rural territories by water. Similarly, in their tall canalside houses fitted with cranes to raise goods to lofty warehouses, Dutch merchants must have longed for clean air and open spaces.  The National Gallery in London is rich in Dutch landscape paintings. One that entrances me is Salomon van Ruysdael&apos;s River Scene (1632). This painting has made me look again at the entire genre it belongs to. Did I say these pictures are realistic, topographic, reassuring? But anyone who gazes at Ruysdael&apos;s river under a cool sky will soon notice what is strange about it. The soft pale green trees that fringe the river are reflected in its calm glassy surface so completely and clearly that the painting depicts two worlds, not one: the mirror-world in the water conjoins with its counter-image above, the roots of the trees literally pointing in two directions. What at first seemed a simple scene turns out to hint at a portal to another dimension, a grotesque intertwining of worlds.  There is as much suggestion, as much mystery in this painting as in any surrealist dreamscape. Indeed, you might compare it directly with the reflective landscape of Salvador Dal\u00ed&apos;s Metamorphosis of Narcissus in Tate Modern.  In fact \u2013 do that. Both museums are free. A walk between the National Gallery&apos;s Room 16 and Tate Modern&apos;s Level Two galleries to compare Dal\u00ed with Ruysdael would provide a two-way key between art&apos;s different universes. Excitement in art is not always announced by drums and drama.

You&apos;ll find the full Notes ... series here. Will Dean&apos;s episode three blog Episode four: New Amsterdam &quot;We gave you everything, we gave you your name. And what have you done with it?&quot; Andrew Campbell Despite being filmed inside in California, Mad Men is one of the most NYC of New York City shows. Never more so than this episode, which weaves threads between Pete&apos;s rich Manhattan history, the new money of Trudy&apos;s family, Don&apos;s misunderstanding of how this &quot;marvellous machine&quot; of class works and the Bethlehem Steel campaign. Let&apos;s focus on Pete. New Amsterdam highlights his struggle to maintain an equilibrium between the three roles in his life. That of son to New York social royalty \u2013 to whom his career is &quot;no job for a white man&quot; His role as husband to Trudy and son-in-law to her generous, new-money parents, who inadvertently emasculate him when stumping up for the marital home. And finally, his role as a subordinate to Don. You could argue that Pete&apos;s trying to do the right thing by each and is eaten up by his neuroses. He is (and probably knows he is) employed on the basis of his name, despite being talented. But while Trudy&apos;s mother revels in dropping his family&apos;s name to the head of the condo board, Pete seems reluctant to use it. It&apos;s both a gift \u2013 as his father believes \u2013 and a curse. How can he be his own man when Don, father-in-law Tom and his father won&apos;t let him? &quot;I came to this place and you people tell me that I&apos;m good with people. Which is strange, because I&apos;d never heard that before,&quot; he tells Don, exasperated. But Pete doesn&apos;t appreciate what he&apos;s got either: he often tells others &quot;you always get what you want&quot;. He can&apos;t see the city for the skycrapers. Pete begrudgingly looks up to Don as a father figure \u2013 but he only antagonises Draper by publicly taking the side of Walter from Bethlehem Steel, and then pitching his (better) Backbone Of America idea to the client during a hotel rendezvous with some cocktails and escorts. Walter then drops Pete in it while Don is pitching his O! Little Town idea; a breakdown in command that leads to Don demanding his sacking. Pete is only saved by \u2013 what else? \u2013 his name. &quot;You&apos;re going to need a stronger stomach if you&apos;re going to be back in the kitchen seeing how the sausage is made,&quot; Bert tells Don as he explains why a Dychman is inexpendable. &quot;Honestly, I think she&apos;s jealous of me. I&apos;ve seen it before, I was in a sorority.&quot; Betty Pete&apos;s turmoil often runs in parallel with that of Betty. She, like Pete, wants to be appreciated. With a husband who spends his spare time sketching ads, it takes the attentions of a young boy to put a smile on her face. Having agreed to babysit for Helen Bishop, Betty finds herself in the bizarre situation of telling off Helen&apos;s son Glen for walking in and staring at her while she&apos;s on the toilet. After apologising, he tells her &quot;your hair is so beautiful, you look like a princess&quot; before asking for a lock of it, which Betty, surprised and a little flattered, gives him. It&apos;s easy to draw a line between her shrink comparing her to a little girl and Betty enjoying the company of a little boy. But really, as she says to the doctor about Glen not getting any attention, she has the same problem. Glen&apos;s reaction is to act out inappropriately, hers is a nervous one. Incidentally, the incident was inspired by something Matthew Weiner did himself as a kid. Finally \u2013 she projects her own anxieties onto Helen \u2013 telling her shrink that Helen is jealous and worrying for Glen: &quot;That poor little boy. The person taking care of him isn&apos;t giving him what he needs.&quot; Notes: \u2022 Pete and Trudy&apos;s place costs $30,000, which I reckon is about $220,000 today. They&apos;re at 83rd and Park in the Upper East Side. \u2022 The Dychman family that Pete comes from is both real \u2013 they came to New Amsterdam in the 1600s and owned most of Harlem. &quot;His grandfather dropped the lot in 1929, panicked. Some people have no confidence,&quot; Bert tells us. \u2022 Glen Bishop is played by Marten Weiner who is, of course, Matt&apos;s son. \u2022 Bert Cooper worries about seeing Pete&apos;s mother at old money summer resort Fishers Island \u2013 where Ike himself used to golf. \u2022 I liked Pete&apos;s line: &quot;Direct marketing, I thought of that! Turns out it already existed but I arrived at it independently.&quot; 20th Century Tales \u2022 Helen is off stuffing envelopes for JFK. The leaflet she brings back appears to be a Photoshopped mixture of two of these brochures and the badge at the bottom of that link. \u2022 &quot;The Armory, when are they going to tear that dinosaur down?&quot; asks Trudy of the beautiful Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue. \u2022 Sal&apos;s artwork is compared to the WPA&apos;s adverts. \u2022 &quot;Sterling Cooper has more failed artists and intellectuals than the Third Reich,&quot; says Don. Culture Watch \u2022 We open on Pete and the boys listening to the Billboard-topping live comedy album The Button-Down Mind Of Bob Newhart. &quot;It&apos;s not Lenny Bruce,&quot; sighs Kinsey. \u2022 Don says he&apos;s screening a TV commercial that &quot;will probably look better when it&apos;s breaking up Bonanza.&quot; \u2022 Pete offers to get Walter tickets to Bye, Bye Birdie on Broadway. \u2022 It&apos;s Interesting to see Bethlehem Steel mentioned while at its postwar peak (1960 was the first year US steel imports exceeded exports). If we zip forward 45 years to The Wire, we see the result of its demise in the desolation of Baltimore. \u2022 Glenn has to go to bed before The Real McCoys . \u2022 Trudy&apos;s father refers to these two Lux ads starring Natalie Wood and Janet Leigh. \u2022 Betty is reading to Bobby and Sally from Nursery Friends From France (1950) by Olive Beaupre Miller. Miller&apos;s company The Bookhouse For Children was a pioneering one that employed almost solely women. Here&apos;s a good little history. \u2022 Pete looks over Manhattan and the title credits to Ella Fitzgerald singing Manhattan. &quot;We&apos;ll settle down, right here in town.&quot;", "sentences": ["Will Dean&apos;s episode three blog Episode four: New Amsterdam &quot;We gave you everything, we gave you your name.", "New Amsterdam highlights his struggle to maintain an equilibrium between the three roles in his life.", "\u2022 The Dychman family that Pete comes from is both real \u2013 they came to New Amsterdam in the 1600s and owned most of Harlem."], "title": "Mad Men: season one, episode four", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/apr/29/mad-men-season-one-episode-four", "tags": ["Mad Men", "Drama", "Television", "Television & radio"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-05T11:39:33Z", "article": "     In short Founded on a dare and a joke, Les ballets C de la B is a cacophonous, many-headed dance-theatre collective whose performances careen between surrealism, social psychology, slapstick and semiotics. Coherence, needless to say, is not a priority \u2013 but that&apos;s the world we live in. Backstory It&apos;s 1984, and Alain Platel, a 28-year-old Belgian educationalist working with disabled children, has been urged by an old teacher to go and see a ballet by Maurice B\u00e9jart. He does so, and thinks it&apos;s terrible. They argue about it until the teacher throws a taunt to Platel: well I&apos;d like to see you do better. Platel, whose theatre experience amounts to some amateur drama and dance he had done as a child, picks up the gauntlet and gives it a go. Thus began Les Ballets C de la B, now one of the most influential dance theatre companies in the world. Platel got together with his sister and a friend \u2013 sniggeringly, they gave themselves the grandiloquent title of &quot;Les Ballets Contemporains de la Belgique&quot; \u2013 and produced a little performance in his loft in Ghent. An audience member happened to be from a new theatre festival; he invited the group to perform there, and they walked off with a special prize. Flush with success, they continued to create small-scale works on an ad hoc basis, with modest success. Then in 1993, a group of 30 international theatre programmers who were attending a festival in Amsterdam went by chance to see Platel&apos;s piece Bonjour Madame. They loved it, and Les Ballets C de la B was catapulted to a new level, beginning to receive big tour bookings and to attract state funding (which was doubled in 1997). Since then, the company has become a major international player. It is run as a collective, which encourages its performers to develop their own choreography, and several important artists have emerged from its stable, notably Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. Its performers are diverse in age, nationality and training, and outside performers join in for particular projects \u2013 most unusually, the 65 babies for Christine de Smedt&apos;s 9x9 in Rotterdam (the piece was performed with completely different casts in different cities between 2000 and 2005), even 14 dogs for Platel&apos;s Wolf (2003). Watching Les Ballets C de la B An influential source of inspiration for Platel is German dance theatre icon Pina Bausch. Like her, he is interested in the performers as people. Like Bausch, too, his pieces are created collaboratively with a diverse set of performers (they draw on their personal experiences and skills to make the material), and are typically montages of different scenes loosely linked by a theme. There&apos;s a lot of talking, but Platel pays notably more attention to music than Bausch, and frequently incorporates musicians (often singers) into his performances, as well as using classical scores including Bach, Mozart, and Monteverdi. The characters in Platel&apos;s work are often outsiders and, like Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, he can also make the normal surreal.            This approach has become something of a house style: the choreographers nurtured within the collective, such as Cherkaoui, Koen Augustijnen and Lisi Estaras, have the same hallmarks, using similar means even though their ends may vary. Expect diversity at a C de la B performance: you might see an aerialist, a ballerina, a contortionist and a countertenor all choreographed together; or themes that interweave war with shopping, or religious iconography with domestic life; or scenes that veer between violence, comedy and compassion. It&apos;s a tricky balance to pull off, and sometimes the pieces can dissipate their own energy. But at its best, this multiplicity of means and media can give flashes of insight into our own selves and panoramic views of the spectacle of our lives. Who&apos;s who            Other than Platel, C de la B&apos;s main choreographers have included Cherakoui and Hans van den Broeck (both now independent), and current company members Augustijnen, De Smedt and Estaras. Guy Cools and Hildegard De Vuyst have often worked as dramaturges with the collective.  Fact Pumba, a tiny papillon dog who featured in Platel&apos;s Wolf, was famous for shamelessly diva-ish behaviour at curtain calls. The little pooch would stand in front of the dancers and milk the applause, and would exit slowly with a mock-modest backwards glance, as if reluctant to abandon his adoring public. It was such a performance that the audience would often burst into more applause, and Pumba would return, graciously, for a another bow. In their own words &quot;You can only go forward, make something new, by trying out fusions and letting things evolve. That is the way dance can speak.&quot;Alain Platel, interview with Sarah Frater, Evening Standard, 2004 &quot;I seek everything that unites people rather than what divides them, even if I insist that everyone keeps his own personality.&quot;Platel, L&apos;Humanit\u00e9, 2006 &quot;If some people are upset, well, it is not my intention. Maybe when you&apos;re younger you&apos;re into provocation; now, no, not really. It doesn&apos;t mean you should be bland.&quot;Platel, interview with Jim White, Telegraph, 2006 In other words &quot;One of the hallmarks of C de la B productions has been the way they take tough subjects and imbue them with wit and life-affirmation.&quot;Luke Jennings, Observer, 2007 &quot;Platel often sets his works to noble music \u2013 Purcell or Bach \u2013 and this has the unexpected effect of giving his characters lyric flight without sentimentalising them.&quot;Judith Mackrell, Guardian, 1999 &quot;The key to its success is Platel&apos;s flair for picking performers who can bring vulnerable nutters to life in a series of heartbreaking and hilarious vignettes, and to create a dramatic progression that seems to exist independent of narrative.&quot;Louise Levene, Independent, 1998 Do say &quot;I could do better than that.&quot; (It worked for Platel; why shouldn&apos;t it work for you?) Don&apos;t say &quot;Performing dogs? Like Britain&apos;s Got Talent?&quot;  See also Pina Bausch was one of Platel&apos;s first inspirations. Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and Wim Vandekeybus are often cited with Platel as the foremost of a wave of influential choreographers who emerged from Belgium in the 1980s. Cherkoui, Ted Stoffer and Van den Broeck are established choreographers who were nurtured by Les Ballets C de la B. Now watch this Platel&apos;s Wolf (2003). Pumba (see Fact, above) appears at about 1 min 15, snuggling in the cleavage of dancer Raphaelle Delaunay Foi (2003) by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui Film-maker Sophie Fiennes talks about Platel, with clips from his piece Vsprs (2006) Patchagonia (2007) by Lisi Estaras Ted Stoffer&apos;s Aphasiadisiac (2008) Where to see them next Lisi Estaras&apos;s primero is on from 5 to 7 May 2010 at the Lilian Baylis Studio, Sadler&apos;s Wells, London.

When he burst into the public consciousness in 1966 by launching, with Hans Gruijters, a new party \u2013 Democrats 66 (D66) \u2013 it was like a blast of fresh air in the stultified atmosphere of the Hague. He offered a new vision and a fresh approach to politics, which led some commentators to describe him\u00a0as\u00a0&quot;the\u00a0Dutch Kennedy&quot;. Unlike the\u00a0former US president John F Kennedy, however, he\u00a0never achieved the highest public office and indeed, both his career and the fortunes of his party would prove to\u00a0be something of\u00a0a\u00a0rollercoaster ride. The height of his achievement was to hold the twin posts of foreign minister and deputy prime minister from 1994 until 1998, in a coalition administration under the Labour prime minister Willem &quot;Wim&quot; Kok. But this was also the period that marked what for Hans was the low point of his public life, when in 1995 Dutch peacekeepers failed to prevent the Serb massacre of more than 8,000 men and boys at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 an act denounced by\u00a0the international criminal tribunal for\u00a0the former Yugoslavia in the Hague as genocide. Born the second of nine children into an affluent, devoutly Roman Catholic banking family in Breda, southern Netherlands, he was christened with the awesomely resonant names Henricus Antonus Franciscus Maria Oliva, a mouthful that was quickly truncated to the nickname &quot;Hafmo&quot;, which stuck with him well into adult life, when he adopted the moniker Hans. He attended three Catholic primary and middle schools before entering the prestigious Saint Canisius College in Nijmegen. After a year of military service in 1951-52, he took up a place at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, although he had just declared himself an atheist, and he spent the rest of that decade reading law. Hans took advantage of the new freedom to travel that had become available in post-second world war western Europe to get to know France and its culture intimately, even writing occasional columns for a Perpignan newspaper, l&apos;Ind\u00e9pendant. He realised that he was temperamentally far more suited to the world of letters than he was to the law courts, so on graduation he joined the Algemeen Handelsblad newspaper in Amsterdam. At the same time, he became involved in various cultural activities. A holder of the Thorbecke prize for elocution, he\u00a0chaired a televised Dutch-language dictation competition and sat on various cultural boards, culminating in his chairmanship of the Netherlands Ballet Orchestra in 1999. He wrote a number of stories and a book, The Citizen and Politics (1992). Hans was drawn into politics largely out of frustration at what he saw as the inadequacies of the traditional Dutch parties in the turbulent mid-1960s, when the Provos counter-culture movement was at its height. The D66 was initially not so much a party as a\u00a0movement without clear policies, which nonetheless inspired many people, the young in particular. This led\u00a0to Hans and six colleagues being elected to the House of Representatives in 1967. The hoped-for breakthrough to become a senior party in government never quite happened, however. When not in opposition, D66 would be condemned to be a minor party in various coalition combinations, its reputation often suffering as a result. When forced to choose which party to\u00a0back on the first such occasion, Hans unwisely declared: &quot;If I had a gun at my chest, I&apos;d opt for Labour.&quot; The party did indeed opt for Labour, but ditched Hans as its leader, though less than a decade later he was back in that position. In 1981 he had a short term as\u00a0defence minister in a grand coalition of traditional parties, which he referred to as disastrous. The anti-establishment D66 appeared to have become part of\u00a0the establishment, to the dismay of\u00a0many of its voters. Undeterred by political setbacks, Hans nurtured D66 through to a second flowering in the 1990s. As foreign minister, he often attracted attention, for example causing a diplomatic rift with Turkey by allowing a gathering of the Kurdish parliament in exile to\u00a0take place in 1995. That year, he also infuriated the Chinese by highlighting human rights while on an official visit to Beijing. Human rights, the power of\u00a0the individual, equality and a passionate belief in the European project were all central to his political philosophy. When the Netherlands held the EU presidency in the first half of 1997, he insisted to the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the need to combat terrorism in return for economic aid. Hans retired from active politics in 1998, being granted the honorific title of minister of state, but he was delighted to be appointed a Dutch government representative to the EU convention charged with the task of drawing up the ill-fated European constitution in 2002. He accepted the challenge, despite the fact that, two years earlier, he had had a liver transplant, made necessary because he had contracted hepatitis C from an infected blood transfusion many years before. Hans married three times and was twice divorced. He had a son with his first wife, Anna Los, and two daughters with his second wife, Olla van Maasdijk. He spent his last decade with a partner 24 years his junior, the novelist Aldegonda &quot;Connie&quot; Palmen, marrying her last November, by which time it was clear that the end was near. She and his children survive him. \u2022 Henricus Antonus Franciscus Maria Oliva\u00a0&quot;Hans&quot; van Mierlo, politician, born\u00a018 August 1931; died 11 March 2010", "sentences": ["He realised that he was temperamentally far more suited to the world of letters than he was to the law courts, so on graduation he joined the Algemeen Handelsblad newspaper in Amsterdam."], "title": "Hans van Mierlo obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/05/hans-van-mierlo-obituary", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "European Union", "World news", "Politics", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-05T18:04:42Z", "article": "Hannah Horovitz, who has died of cancer aged 73, made a distinctive contribution to international music as a promoter, both in the public sector and through the enterprises she ran. Born in Vienna, the youngest child of\u00a0the international art publisher Bela Horovitz, founder of the Phaidon Press, and his wife Lotte, Hannah came to Britain with her family in 1938 following Hitler&apos;s annexation of Austria. After St Paul&apos;s girls&apos; school, west London, and a period in the book trade, she worked at Expo 67 in Montreal, returning to London as a media researcher. Soon afterwards she joined the Harold Holt concert agency, which led her to set up Hannah Horovitz Management in 1971. There she fielded an impressive list of international artists, aiding performers such as the pianists Andr\u00e1s Schiff, Craig Sheppard and Ilana Vered, the Cleveland Quartet and the flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal. One of Hannah&apos;s most remarkable achievements was to engineer the world premiere of the opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis (The Emperor of Atlantis), written by two Czechs, the composer Viktor Ullmann and the poet Peter Kien, in the Theresienstadt ghetto camp in 1943. The manuscript of this masterly satire on Hitler found its way to the conductor Kerry Woodward, whom Hannah introduced to the American director Rhoda Levine, thus making possible the production at the Netherlands Opera Studio in Amsterdam in December 1975. The work has since been filmed, recorded and performed worldwide. As deputy director of the British Council&apos;s visiting arts unit (1978-96), Hannah introduced to the UK outstanding artists in the fields of dance, theatre and opera, working tirelessly on their behalf to secure visas and support and forging links between British and international cultural communities. During this period her love of American Yiddish culture and humour found expression in her initiating the UK&apos;s first Day of Yiddish Culture in 1986 in collaboration with Michael Vyner, then artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. The event included the London debut of the Californian ensemble The Klezmorim, which encouraged the klezmer revival in the UK. On retirement, Hannah was awarded honorary membership of the British Council, and she continued to devise innovative projects such as the international debut recital series at the Wallace Collection in central London. Launched in 1997 by the Springboard Concert Trust, of which she was a co-founder, the concerts won great acclaim, introducing over the course of\u00a010 seasons more than 70 young artists in 43 concerts and bringing more than 8,000 people to the museum, many for the first time. The style and panache with which Hannah introduced each capacity-filled event reflected the appeal of the format, a recital in the beautiful surrounds of the Great Gallery, preceded by champagne and croissants and a\u00a0private view of the entire collection. Throughout her career, Hannah had an unfailing instinct for new talent and opened many doors for young artists at the threshold of their careers. She believed in the performer&apos;s duty to make audiences feel welcome, reflecting her deep concern for and interest in people, which was evident in her wide circle of colleagues and friends. Treasured by her large family, she is survived by her brother, the composer Joseph Horovitz, and her sister, the art publisher Elly Miller. \u2022 Hannah Horovitz, music promoter, born 21 October 1936; died 4 March 2010", "sentences": ["The manuscript of this masterly satire on Hitler found its way to the conductor Kerry Woodward, whom Hannah introduced to the American director Rhoda Levine, thus making possible the production at the Netherlands Opera Studio in Amsterdam in December 1975."], "title": "Hannah Horovitz obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/05/hannah-horovitz-obituary", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-06T18:22:50Z", "article": "An intelligence agent began giving evidence today against three Northern Irish men accused of involvement in a dissident republican arms-smuggling plot. The man, identified only as &quot;Amir&quot;, appeared at Belfast crown court but was partially screened. The undercover operative, who spoke with an English accent, did not identify his branch of the security services but an earlier hearing was told the operation was part of an MI5 sting against the Real IRA. Between them the County Armagh men \u2013 Paul Anthony John McCaugherty, 43, and Desmond Paul Kearns, 44, both from Lurgan, and 41-year-old Dermot Declan Gregory, also known as Michael Dermot, from Crossmaglen \u2013 deny a total of seven charges. McCaugherty is accused of conspiring to possess firearms and explosives and using almost \u20ac46,000 for terrorist purposes, membership of &quot;the Irish Republican army&quot;, and making the deeds of a restaurant in Portugal available for the purposes of terrorism. Kearns is accused of conspiring to possess firearms and explosives, and Gregory of the restaurant charge. Amir told the court that he started work in August 2004 in an operation against Irish targets. He was told his target travelled widely in Europe buying goods and he was asked to bump into him and befriend him. The witness said he knew the man as John and was shown a photograph of him. The court heard yesterday that he was in reality the accused Kearns.Amir said he first met Kearns outside a store in Luxembourg where he was buying cut-price cigarettes and he told him he could supply them at even cheaper rates. After a series of meetings in bars in Brussels and Amsterdam, the witness said he sold Kearns and a woman he was told was his wife, Alison, cigarettes, laptops, clothes and jewellery before mentioning that he could get guns from Pakistan. Amir said that at one meeting Alison told him: &quot;You should go over to Ireland and supply them with weapons,&quot; but she subsequently denied she had been serious. In July 2005, the security services told Amir that he should introduce a man to Kearns as a weapons expert called Ejaz. The witness said that when the subject of guns was raised, Kearns said he would go back to his associates and see what they thought but insisted he did not want to get involved in any meetings himself. A tape recording of one meetings in an Amsterdam bar has been played in court.The operation, which the court previously heard related to what police believe was an international gun smuggling operation, involved numerous meetings throughout Europe and even Istanbul in Turkey. Various conversations during the multitude of meetings were secretly taped and in some cases even videoed.

The singer of Foals is describing how he has kept a journal since he was 12, detailing his innermost fears and feelings. He&apos;s kept every volume he has filled, except one. &quot;I was about 18 and I got into a fight with this guy over something stupid,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I had a satchel with my journal in. We were punching each other in the face, and when the fight dissipated, the journal had gone. I was so angry, trying to find it, running around like some apparition at two in the morning. Then I ran past a girl I&apos;d been out with and she had a date. I\u00a0must have looked possessed.&quot; As Philippakis talks, a succession of incidents conspire to interrupt his flow. Waiters present him with food he hasn&apos;t ordered; two young Japanese girls sit right beside us and chat; he&apos;s twice asked to stop smoking; and, farcically, a chap arrives with a tuba and proceeds to serenade Philippakis. But they barely disturb him. It&apos;s surprising to discover Philippakis is so emotionally wrought. When Foals emerged from Oxford in 2008, they seemed almost the definition of a &quot;haircut group&quot;, their angular barnets matching their music&apos;s mix of afrobeat and math-rock. While there was much to admire in the quintet&apos;s music, it seemed more cerebral than heartfelt. Enough people bought their debut album, Antidotes, to take it into the top three, but polyrhythms and seemingly flippant lyrics to songs such as The French Open \u2013 which addressed (in French) the subject of Andy Roddick&apos;s serve \u2013 left many with what Philippakis describes as an unfair impression that they were &quot;calculated, distant pseudo-intellectuals&quot;. &quot;When we started, the music was almost a premeditated mix of blending techno and minimalism,&quot; he admits. &quot;We&apos;d set ourselves these rules, like &apos;only staccato rhythms&apos;, and &apos;guitars must be played really high&apos;. But it was all genuine. It&apos;s just been a natural progression.&quot; Back\u00a0then, Philippakis never thought of himself as a frontman. Foals started as an instrumental group and lyrics were something he &quot;just tagged on&quot;. When he did reveal anything in song, he&apos;d couch his\u00a0sentiments in &quot;so many layers and metaphors that no one knew what I was\u00a0saying&quot;. Two years on, everything has changed with Foals&apos; second album, Total Life Forever. It&apos;s a gigantic departure: not only\u00a0does it take their sound into intense rock and global funk (something like\u00a0Talking Heads produced by Tusk-period Fleetwood Mac), but it overflows with confessionals and, thrillingly, the\u00a0emotions that were missing from the\u00a0first. What happened? &quot;Before, I was almost hiding in the music,&quot; Philippakis says, which possibly also explains why he yelped rather than sang his way through Antidotes. &quot;I used\u00a0music to build a fortress around myself. But I realised I needed emotional catharsis. Music can be a soothing balm.&quot; Over two days and two countries, two encounters with Philippakis suggest that songs such as the new album&apos;s haunting first single Spanish Sahara \u2013 &quot;leave the horror here,&quot; he sings, &quot;forget the horror here&quot; \u2013 are just the tip of an emotional iceberg. He talks of feeling ill at ease in the world, of his particular fascination with ups and downs, be they the rise and fall of empires or bipolar disorder moodswings. He talks about his predominant feelings being &quot;sadness and hollowness&quot;, and of feeling an &quot;air of finality&quot; around him, as if &quot;we&apos;ve seen the best days already&quot;. Most troublingly, he says he is &quot;carrying this stuff around, this black, unfathomable rage&quot;. He doesn&apos;t seem like a pretentious rock star visiting the dark side for effect. As he puts it: &quot;Without the solace I&apos;ve found in music, I would have gone mental.&quot; Philippakis was born an outsider. The son of a Greek artist father and Jewish South African academic mother, he was brought up mostly in Oxford. His father returned to Greece when he was six, and Philippakis remains troubled by the idea that his father would leave a loving family to go and live on his own. &quot;He was a very powerful figure even in his absence,&quot; he says \u2013 the family would sit under a portrait Philippakis Sr had painted, and the memory of his father&apos;s meditations on life&apos;s difficulties exerted a profound influence on the son as he grew up. &quot;My ambition and an appetite to do something better has come from that, but I also grew up with this big, silent terror of whatever this &apos;difficult&apos; life was.&quot; Because his mother was on a low wage as an academic, Philippakis qualified for an assisted place at Magdalen College boys school in Oxford. He was bright and devoured art, French and literature, but found himself facing many of the troubles faced by young men without a father figure. He had rages, problems with authority (&quot;I&apos;d tell the teachers to fuck off&quot;), was twice suspended from school, and, surrounded by wealthier boys with no apparent insecurities, felt alone. He listened to the sort of music young men do when they&apos;re angry and confused \u2013 grunge, metal, industrial rock, anything intense \u2013 and found friends who felt the same. Among them were a band called Youthmovie Soundtrack Strategies, who first gave ecstasy to Philippakis and his childhood musical soulmate, Jack Bevan, and introduced them to a world of different music. &quot;They looked like they were from the other side of the world,&quot; Philippakis says of Youthmovies. &quot;Skinhead cuts and everything, pretty full-on, making this out-there music. They&apos;ve split up now, but they acted as a catalyst. We realised we weren&apos;t a bit of flotsam and could do something exciting and courageous.&quot; Andrew Mears of Youthmovies was in the first lineup of Foals, whose members came from various Oxford post-hardcore bands, playing a funked-up reaction against city&apos;s dry music scene. &quot;We wanted to form a band to play house parties, rile the people who didn&apos;t like dancing, steal their girlfriends and play music,&quot; says Philippakis, but things soon turned serious. Mears opted out after one single, but Philippakis decided to leave his English literature degree course at St John&apos;s college to give all his attention to Foals, and his bandmates followed suit (guitarist Jimmy Smith, who studied geography at Hull, is the only member to\u00a0have completed his degree). The decision paid off, but Philippakis doesn&apos;t remember\u00a0much about their early success. &quot;I was stoned a lot of the time as a way of not having to deal with it,&quot; he says. &quot;It felt like we were being given a compliment we didn&apos;t deserve.&quot; That self-critical streak doesn&apos;t seem to have left Philippakis. In Paris, only minutes after finishing the show to a rousing ovation, he is virtually inconsolable. He complains that he couldn&apos;t see the crowd, and felt &quot;dislocated&quot; from the gig and the other members. &quot;I just get so frustrated,&quot; he says. &quot;If something isn&apos;t right I feel like I wanna combust into fireballs.&quot; In the solitude of a side room, we spend\u00a0the early hours talking about the wild emotional swings that inspire his creativity, and how he finds it easier to put feelings in songs than express them to other people. &quot;I used to get smitten quite a lot,&quot; he explains. &quot;I&apos;d get crushes, then when they weren&apos;t returned I&apos;d feel inadequate. With one girl in particular I spent a very intense summer, but I never even got to kiss her. She played games and I enjoyed it. But after that I built an enamel around myself. It&apos;s taken years to get to where it is now, which is very hard.&quot; The &quot;enamel&quot; protects him \u2013 although he admits that &quot;sometimes it&apos;s me bestowing the affection then withdrawing it&quot;, just like his father used to \u2013 which leaves him feeling terribly guilty. &quot;I find relationships with human beings quite difficult,&quot; he says. He can perform to thousands of people, but when it comes to dealing with individuals, &quot;I have a flaw.&quot; &quot;I haven&apos;t had a proper girlfriend since I was at uni,&quot; he says. &quot;I have had a series of relationships with girls, but I wouldn&apos;t call them girlfriends. I have a tendency to intermittent recurring relationships with people who are also dysfunctional, so the girls involved don&apos;t talk to me for periods at a time. It&apos;s a very parasitic, symbiotic relationship. I got into a big fight recently with a girl I know for saying that. She&apos;s quite different to me and very volatile. We&apos;ll cease communication, then meet up and it&apos;s all very intense. I said, &apos;You know why we&apos;re fucked up? As a biological thing, I am deficient.&apos;&quot; Because he&apos;s never been close enough to anyone to properly confide in them, he says he creates imaginary confidants in his songs. And he seems to share his feelings more in song than he says he can in real life. I&apos;m certainly left with an impression he&apos;s not giving everything away: on the title track of Total Life Forever, almost shrouded behind a glorious funk backdrop, Philippakis sings about finding a person to\u00a0whom he can show &quot;my true colours&quot;. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m aware of myself enough [to do that],&quot; he says, delicately, which makes me wonder aloud if he&apos;s comfortable with his sexuality. But he insists that&apos;s not an issue. &quot;I mean, I like women a lot. I don&apos;t have problems engaging physically, but mentally.&quot; Philippakis has never had therapy on his own, but says some of the lyrics in the album&apos;s closing track, What Remains, refer\u00a0to a period of family therapy, which involved three psychiatrists staring at the Philippakises from behind glass: &quot;And\u00a0you&apos;d feel the pressure from behind the glass, being relayed into the room \u2026 It\u00a0felt like being in quicksand.&quot; He says he found the process frustrating and pointless, and though he doesn&apos;t want to reveal more about what he calls &quot;family mental illness&quot;, he says he is haunted by the fear of turning into his father, and repeating the cycle of abandonment. &quot;I do\u00a0look up to him, but my mother says that\u00a0I&apos;ve inhabited his [emotional detachment] to try and understand him,&quot; he says. &quot;The person you least understand in the family or is most distant, you become them. And that&apos;s how the cycle continues. You flip the damage on to yourself.&quot; However, songwriting is therapy, and Philippakis says singing about his troubles every night on stage makes him feel better.\u00a0&quot;It feels voodoo, like an exorcism,&quot; he says. Pop no longer seems to be a home to the\u00a0troubled, to those seeking an answer to questions about themselves, in the way it perhaps one was. The sophisticated commercial processes of the music industry preclude much expression of such raw humanity, and when such people do make their way through the system, it appears ill equipped to nurture them, as\u00a0the case of Amy Winehouse suggests. Are Foals, then, among the last of the soul-baring rock bands? &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if \u2013 not in five or 10 years, but beyond that \u2013 kids look back on bands as some quaint, almost nostalgic thing, like we&apos;ll watch something from the 1920s,&quot; Philippakis says. And should we be worried about him? &quot;I&apos;ll work things out,&quot; he says. &quot;In 10 years&apos; time I&apos;ll still be making music, and taking photos, but with a wife. And I definitely want kids.&quot; He smiles. &quot;I&apos;m actually really looking forward to doing the gardening.&quot;", "sentences": ["In an Amsterdam square, tourists all around, Yannis Philippakis is pouring his heart out."], "title": "Foals: 'I built an enamel around myself'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/foals-total-life-forever", "tags": ["Foals", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-08T17:06:28Z", "article": "Bradley Wiggins claimed his first ever leader&apos;s jersey in a Grand Tour by winning the opening time trial in the Giro d&apos;Italia.

I was oblivious to anyone on the course, I was in my own world. That&apos;s what I always do in time trials. If I crashed, I crashed.

After his fourth overall finish in last year&apos;s Tour de France, Wiggins is considered an overall contender.

Actually, he was the second; a reader notes that Mark Cavendish was the first, in the early stages of the 2009 race.   The British professional squad Team Sky earned their best result to date on Saturday when Bradley Wiggins won the prologue time trial in the Giro d&apos;Italia. However, the relationship between the Great Britain Olympic squad and the pro team will be under scrutiny this summer. An independent review has been commissioned by British Cycling and UK Sport into the relationship between the Olympic set-up and Team Sky, who were launched at the start of this year to guide Wiggins, a triple Olympic gold medallist, to victory in the Tour de France. The review, by Deloitte, will be completed this summer. It is looking for three outcomes, according to Russell Langley, the head of communication at UK Sport, who said: &quot;One is to look at operational arrangements between Team Sky and the track squad, how the programmes work together.&quot; The review will also examine how risks around the two programmes are being managed. &quot;This is an independent review and it will benefit us and UK Sport and ensure that everyone is complying with the requirements that UK Sport would wish us to,&quot; said Brian Cookson, President of British Cycling. &quot;We&apos;re as anxious as anyone that the team shouldn&apos;t lose any competitive advantage and this is a way to ensure that every bit of Lottery funding that comes to the UK cycling team is used to their benefit.&quot; Its third task will be to assess whether performance targets are being met. &quot;That is the key one,&quot; said Langley. &quot;We invest millions of public money in British Cycling and we and they will be judged by the medals won in 2012.&quot; Britain&apos;s cyclists have not been set their target for the 2012 Olympics. They won eight golds in Beijing in 2008. For 2010 their performance target was between five and 10 medals in world championships. At the world track championships at the end of March, the team won three golds and four silvers in Olympic events. Team Sky and the Olympic cycling squad are both headed by Dave Brailsford, who is performance director at British Cycling and principal of Team Sky. Shane Sutton, head coach of the track cycling team, has the same role with Team Sky. Other Olympic coaches listed on the Team Sky website are the Olympic team psychiatrist and senior manager, Dr\u00a0Steve Peters, as &quot;head of medical&quot;; the track endurance coach Dan Hunt (race coach); and the academy head Max Sciandri (sport director/coach). Team Sky&apos;s riders include other Olympic team members, notably the Beijing gold medallist Geraint Thomas, and the team will be expected to provide most British riders for the road events at the London Games. The team is owned by Tour Racing Limited, which includes Brian Cookson, the chairman of British Cycling, and the chief executive, Ian Drake, on its board and is in turn owned by Sky. Explaining the thinking behind the review, Langley explained that &quot;it is not being done from any negative angle, but to ensure that both programmes are working well and can deliver what they need to.&quot; In addition, it is hoped that lessons can be learned from the Team Sky tie-in with the Olympic track squad to further the development of other sports. Brailsford was not available for comment. Wiggins won Saturday&apos;s 8.4km time trial in Amsterdam by 2sec and became the first Briton to wear the pink leader&apos;s jersey in the Giro.

Her deep, resonant voice and soulful phrasing drew comparisons to Nina Simone. But after Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, she withdrew from music and more than a\u00a0decade passed before she returned to\u00a0performing in 2000. She then released three superb albums and toured internationally, delighting audiences and critics with her uniquely Balkan blues. She was born in Belgrade to a Romany father and Croatian mother. Her father played the accordion for a living and her mother was a singer. The couple split while Ljiljana was an infant, and her childhood was spent listening to her mother sing at cafes, bars, restaurants and weddings across the Balkans. Mother and daughter settled in the small city of Bijeljina in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here, Ljiljana enjoyed some semblance of a stable life and excelled in singing and playing the piano at school. When her mother was too ill to sing at a restaurant one night, the 12-year-old Ljiljana presented herself to the musicians as a substitute. Reluctantly, they gave her a chance and were hugely surprised when she sang with great poise and confidence. From then on, she\u00a0too was a professional singer. Within a year, Ljiljana&apos;s mother had fled Bijeljina, abandoning her. This, and the birth of Ljiljana&apos;s daughter Silvana when she was 14, meant that school was no longer an option. Ljiljana worked in kafanas (Yugoslav bars with live music), singing all manner of\u00a0musical genres: Gypsy romances, Balkan folk songs, pop hits, Russian ballads and jazz standards. Her supple voice grew ever more confident and by the late 1960s she was a favourite among Belgrade&apos;s intellectuals and artists. She got her first record contract in 1969. Throughout the 1970s, she appeared regularly on state television, released albums and performed. Yugoslavs used to refer to her as &quot;the mother of\u00a0Gypsy soul&quot; because she was capable of conveying hurt and longing like few\u00a0others. In the 1980s Yugoslavia&apos;s music scene changed as civil society broke down, and turbo-folk \u2013 garish, sexualised, electronic pop \u2013 predominated. Dismayed by this music and rising nationalism, Ljiljana fled with Silvana and her other two children, Elizabeta and Dragan, to Germany in 1987. There she settled in D\u00fcsseldorf, married (just to get residency papers, she claimed) and took her husband&apos;s surname of Buttler. She had a series of menial jobs: cleaner, factory worker, kitchen hand. In 2000, the Amsterdam-based Bosnian record producer Dragi Sestic, one of the founders of the successful Bosnian ensemble Mostar Sevdah Reunion, tracked her down and slowly convinced a reluctant Ljiljana to begin singing again. &quot;And after all she had lived through, she was really capable of\u00a0singing the blues,&quot; said Sestic. The resulting album, The Mother of Gypsy Soul (2002), demonstrated that her smoky voice and ability to convey beautifully languid Balkan blues remained intact. This album won her an international audience and she began touring Europe. Her bulky figure and deep voice made her a striking live performer. A BBC4 documentary, The Bridge That Survived, directed by Mira Erdevicki, followed Ljiljana&apos;s return to Bosnia, capturing both her artistry and sanguine personality. The albums The Legends of Life (2007) and Frozen Roses (2009) demonstrated that she remained one of the world&apos;s most expressive singers. Her last British performance was as part of the Legendary Gypsy Queens and Kings show at the Royal Festival Hall in London last October. She is survived by Silvana, Elizabeta and Dragan, and four grandchildren. \u2022 Ljiljana (Petrovic) Buttler, singer, born 14\u00a0December 1944; died 26 April 2010\u00a0", "sentences": ["In 2000, the Amsterdam-based Bosnian record producer Dragi Sestic, one of the founders of the successful Bosnian ensemble Mostar Sevdah Reunion, tracked her down and slowly convinced a reluctant Ljiljana to begin singing again."], "title": "Ljiljana Buttler obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/12/ljiljana-buttler-obituary", "tags": ["Blues", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-14T10:19:50Z", "article": "Details of a dream safari holiday enjoyed by the Van Assouw family before the fatal plane crash that killed all 103 passengers except nine-year-old Ruben van Assouw emerged today in his father&apos;s travel blog. Ruben is recovering in hospital, surrounded by flowers with a stuffed orange Tigger under his arm, not knowing his parents and brother died in the disaster on Wednesday as the family returned to the Netherlands from South Africa. Ruben has spoken briefly to his aunt and uncle, who flew to his bedside after he was found, still strapped to his seat, semiconscious and bleeding from wounds to his legs, about half a mile from the tail section of the Afriqiyah Airways Airbus 330-200 which came down short of the runway in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. &quot;He&apos;s awake. He&apos;s talking. He is listening,&quot; a Dutch foreign ministry official, Ed Kronenburg, told Associated Press after visiting the boy. &quot;Of course he also sleeps quite a lot because he got anaesthesia and is still a bit dizzy.&quot; Ruben and his 11-year-old brother, Enzo, had travelled with their parents, Trudy and Patrick, who were celebrating their 12-and-a-half-year wedding anniversary, a Dutch tradition. Patrick van Assouw, 40, set up his blog before the family holiday began. &quot;The boys have been counting the days and minutes and can&apos;t wait. Just three more nights&apos; sleep, boys!,&quot; he wrote in an entry dated 23 April. The trip began on a rough note. Ruben was sick on the plane to South Africa, and on the first day of the safari he &quot;puked the car full&quot;, Patrick wrote on his blog. But the family soon made their way through South Africa, across the border into Swaziland, and finally into the mountainous nation of Lesotho before they turned for home. &quot;We ran into a very large number of impalas, which we nicknamed deers,&quot; Patrick wrote. &quot;Enzo&apos;s second find was the elephant. Also saw buffalo, gnu, fox, zebra, more deer, ostrich, a lot of birds, turtle, giraffe, apes, boar, more deer.&quot; The family also encountered two rhinoceroses and the day before they boarded the ill-fated return flight Patrick wrote that they had seen a hippopotamus. After changing a flat tyre at a desolate spot near Sani Pass, which connects South Africa and Lesotho, the family stood on a remote bluff overlooking a stunning panorama of Lesotho. It was 9 May, the final day of the safari. &quot;Beautiful Mother&apos;s Day gift,&quot; Patrick wrote in his final entry. Ruben is said to be recovering well after four and a half hours of surgery to repair multiple fractures to his legs. Dutch officials said he could be flown back to the Netherlands this weekend. A bouquet of white flowers wrapped in pink tissue was propped against the door of the Van Assouw&apos;s home in Tilburg, south of Amsterdam. At the crash site, the debris included a romance novel, Zoete Tranen \u2013 or Sweet Tears \u2013 open at page 225, a charred boot, a black high-heeled shoe and a motorcycle jacket with Marlboro and Ferrari logos. Dutch officials helping to identify victims of the crash say 70 of their citizens are among the dead. Two Britons with dual nationality are known to have died. One was Nigel Peter, a senior manager with AirQuarius Aviation, a Johannesburg-based charter company, who was married with one son. The other has not been identified. A third UK casualty, Priscilla Collick, a 52-year-old mother of two from Swansea who had lived in Britain for nearly 30 years, is reported to have been a South African national.", "sentences": ["A bouquet of white flowers wrapped in pink tissue was propped against the door of the Van Assouw&apos;s home in Tilburg, south of Amsterdam."], "title": "Blog details Libya plane crash survivor's safari with family", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/14/blog-libya-plane-crash-survivor", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "Libya", "Netherlands", "South Africa", "Blogging", "World news", "Europe", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-17T07:05:42Z", "article": " 7.52am: Heathrow and Gatwick partially reopened at 7 this morning, but there will be no arrivals at Gatwick until 1pm at the earliest. Heathrow will see reduced take-offs and departures as well as extended delays and cancellations.  On the strike front, BA will mount a legal challenge in the high court to block a 20-day stoppage, while talks are scheduled this afternoon to head off confrontation. BA&apos;s high court action is creating more bad blood between the head of BA, Willie Walsh, and union members. Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, says there was &quot;no justification&quot; for the legal challenge and maintained that the union had met all the requirements of running a proper ballot. He repeated on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme that an agreement had been reached in principle on the original cause of the dispute, but a settlement was being held up because of the row over travel concessions and disciplinary action against strikers. &quot;You cannot say in an agreement that you treat people with dignity and respect and then sack or discipline 50 people for just making comments on Facebook,&quot; he said.  8.26am: There will be a lot of meetings today as well as the high court hearing. Here are the timings passed on to me by Dan Milmo, our transport correspondent. Philip Hammond, the transport secretary, is due to meet Willie Walsh, the boss of BA, at 11.The high court hearing starts at 11.30. Hammond will meet Tony Woodley of Unite at 2 and Unite and BA will meet at 4 under the auspices of Acas, the conciliation service at 4. Peter Harwood, the chief conciliator, said last night: &quot;There is now an opportunity for the parties to seriously reflect on the issues and the implications of not reaching an agreement. We will be using all of our expertise in any way we can to help the parties reach a resolution.&quot; But Hammond told BBC TV news this morning, however, that he did not hold out hope for a &quot;miraculous breakthrough.&quot;  8.36am: The first flights to land at Heathrow this morning were long-haul ones that touched down at 7.07. Meanwhile, Hammond, the new transport secretary who is starting his job under huge pressure, told GMTV: &quot;We are gathering more evidence all the time. The aircraft manufacturers are looking at that evidence. They are looking at what inspection regimes they can put in place that would allow safe flying through a somewhat higher threshold of ash. If we can do that the likelihood of volcanic ash disrupting flights will obviously diminish.&quot; Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said: &quot;We do need to work with engine manufacturers to make sure we have the right solution for passengers. There is a certain tolerance (of ash) that aircraft engines can take.&quot;  8.44am: Virgin Trains say they are making 7,000 extra seats available today, mainly on routes between Birmingham and Glasgow and Edinburgh, and between London Euston and Glasgow. Eurostar are running four additional services today, offering an extra 3,500 seats at a special price of \u00a389 / \u20ac96 one-way.  8.50am: The Association of British Insurers has this advice: &quot;If you are due to travel to or from a UK airport then the first thing you should do is contact your airline or the airport you are travelling from to find out the latest information regarding your travel arrangements. Cover for delayed or cancelled flights will vary between travel insurance policies, so for clarification check your travel policy or contact your insurer for confirmation of the position.&quot;  The full statement is on the AIB website. AIB says travel insurers expect to pay around \u00a362m following disruption caused by the recent closure of airspace - that&apos;s 16% of the annual amount paid out by UK travel insurers.  At this point I should say that if you have been affected by stoppages or cancellations you can email me at mark.tran@guardian.co.uk.  9.02am: Here&apos;s the Guardian news story from this morning summing up the latest state of play.Here is a Guardian story explaining what your travel insurance will cover.Dan Milmo has this story about passengers - not surprisingly - turning to rail travel.       9.11am: PA has this traveller&apos;s tale.  A 36-year-old mother returning to her home in Los Angeles from Albania with her four-year-old daughter was amongst those sleeping in the terminal overnight. She said: &quot;We didn&apos;t get to Gatwick until 1am and then got a bus here, and they told us the flight was cancelled. Sleeping in the airport wasn&apos;t very fun. All the seats were taken but no-one brought around pillows or blankets. I just want to go home.&quot;Her rescheduled flight was due to leave later this morning.    9.25am: There are quite a few frustrated passengers at Liverpool&apos;s John Lennon airport as there are many cancelled flights despite a lifting of the flying ban. Robin Tudor, a spokesman for the airport, told PA: &quot;The restriction was lifted for this morning, but there is a difference between that and flights resuming as normal...Crews and aircraft could be in the wrong place. We&apos;re in the same situation as last time, and people should remember it took a number of days before things got back to normal.&quot;  9.44am: In answer to racquetdynamics below, Netherlands airspace is closed as well. Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency says about 1,000 flights will be cancelled today. &quot;There may be some continuing disruption in the greater London area,&quot; it said, adding that it expected 28,000 flights to operate, 1,000 fewer than normal.       10.10am: A Guardian reader has emailed me from his iPhone on his tale of frustration in trying to get to Marrakesh. Currently, I&apos;m sitting with my girlfriend in the greasiest of greasy spoon cafes at the National Express depot in Milton Keynes. Waiting for a bus to Manchester airport to attempt to salvage our two-week sun soaked holiday. Our trip started yesterday morning as our flight from Liverpool John Lennon airport to Agadir (Morocco) was cancelled by Ryanair at short noitice (two hours), we managed to change our flight to originate in Brussels and end in Marrakesh, however the bus we would have had to get for Brussels was unfortunately double-booked due to what we are told was a &apos;minor technical fault&apos; on the company&apos;s website, so we made our way to London to plead with all manner of transport staff, from Eurostar sales reps to National Express bus drivers but alas, no luck.A glimmer of hope was thrown our way by the discovery of an early morning flight to Marrakesh from Luton airport. So, under cover of night we made the short trip to St Albans and then caught a connecting train to Luton. After being blessed with one of the most kind-hearted sales reps on Ryanairs books, we managed to have our Brussels to Marrakesh flight changed to the Luton to Marrakesh flight, slated to leave at 06:45 this morning. So we waited and waited and well, you get the jist. 06:45 came and our flight had a green light on the departure board, BRILLIANT! I thought, so we head to the departures lounge where we are met by a small army of Ryanair reps, all assuring us that the flight would leave on time. five minutes before takeoff and a voice came over the tannoy announcing that the Marrakesh flight was cancelled due to the ash cloud, just as this was said, a Monarch flight hurtled along the runway and up into what I am quite sure is perfectly safe sky. So now, we are making our way, slowly but surely to Manchester airport, as I write this, yet more bad news has come; our bus to Manchester airport has been delayed indefinitely due to an accident on the M1. So here we are, around \u00a3200 down, no sleep for 29 hours and what seems to be a never ending streak of bad luck.  10.19am: Aer Lingus says it has been forced to cancel a number of flights despite airports reopening.It said services from Dublin would operate as normal after midday while flights to and from Cork and Shannon are running as scheduled except for services to Heathrow and Gatwick, Amsterdam and Manchester. Operations from Belfast will resume at 1pm.      Ash cloud map for Monday 17 May. Red and blue lines represent the cloud from the earth's surface up to 20,000ft. Green lines are from 20,000-35,000ft. Maps are for (top l-r) 6am, midday, (bottom l-r) 6pm and midnight. Photograph: Met Office    Taken from met office website  10.27am:  11.12am: Here&apos;s something cheering on the transport front. New double-decker buses, based on the old driver-and-conductor Routemasters, start running in London in 2012. They will have two doors as well as an open platform allowing passengers to hop on and off. This just in from Nats, the air traffic authority. All flight restrictions affecting Heathrow and Gatwick airports have been lifted. However, the no-fly zone remains in place in two key areas affecting operations in Northern Ireland and the Shetland Isles. Airports falling within the no-fly zones include: Belfast City, Londonderry, Shetland and Orkney. All other airports are open.  11.35am: As we await the high court ruling on the planned strike, Dan Milmo had this useful recapitulation yesterday on what separates BA and the unions.     Live blog: Dan Milmo    The airline and union have negotiated the outlines of a settlement that addresses the original cause of the dispute \u2013 a row over staffing cuts \u2013 but cabin crew have rejected the proposal because BA is refusing to fully reinstate staff travel perks that were withdrawn from the estimated 5,000 flight attendants who took part in seven days of strikes over consecutive weekends in March.  11.44am: A bit more background on the stoppages if they go ahead. The first wave of strikes cost BA an estimated \u00a343m but the airline is confident that contingency plans used in the March walkouts will again blunt the impact of industrial action. BA expects to operate a substantial part of its long-haul network from Heathrow and a number of flights to every short-haul destination from the same London airport.  11.52am: BA successfully blocked a strike over Christmas on the grounds that the union unlawfully balloted cabin crew who were leaving the airline, this time it will argue that the follow-up ballot was also flawed because Unite did not observe the precise rules of how to announce the result.  In the ballot, around 81% of the crew voted against the offer, in line with the union&apos;s recommendation. There was a turnout of 71%.  12.00pm: Willie Walsh - like transport secretary Philip Hammond (8.36) - is not optimistic about today&apos;s talks. He says he does not expect any progress from a face-to-face session between BA and the unions at the conciliation service Acas. He adds: &quot;We have contingency plans in place and I am optimistic that we will be able to build on that. Our aim is to make sure BA continues to fly.&quot; BA has trained 1,000 volunteers and leased eight aircraft, the Times reports. The airline expects its Gatwick and London City airport operations to be unaffected by the strike.  12.10pm: Mary Spaeth, a Swedish researcher who commutes to Scotland for her PhD, emails about her ordeal in finding alternative travel, when she was delayed by the ash cloud earlier this month.       I was delayed on 3 May trying to fly to Edinburgh. Ryan Air was excellent with providing seats on alternative routes. First Rail, however, was a disaster. They evidently are keen to sell tickets at Gatwick (for example) to unwary passengers like me who then arrive at Euston only to be told we&apos;d been sold &quot;unreserved&quot; tickets. I had to beg and plead with a fellow at Euston platform (at midnight) to finally secure what I believe was one of many available seats on this so-called &quot;sold out&quot; train. Very odd I think. (I paid \u00a3115, by the way, for the ticket from the seller at the Gatwick stand)... In the meantime, probably more than 30 other passengers - who like me who had come from Heathrow, Stansted or Gatwick due to ash - were turned away.  More from PA on this high court injunction.      BA argues that Unite has not &quot;properly complied&quot; with the requirement to &quot;send everyone eligible to vote details of the exact breakdown of the ballot result&quot;. At the start of proceedings in a packed courtroom, David Reade QC, for BA, told the judge that his application was for interim relief - an injunction - &quot;seeking to restrain the defendant trade union from inducing breaches of contract in respect of a strike&quot;.    Iceland, Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull - May 1st and 2nd, 2010 from Sean Stiegemeier on Vimeo.   12.23pm:  12.46pm:  Hello, Adam Gabbatt taking over while Mark goes for his lunch. Pasta I believe. A little recap... we&apos;re still awaiting the results of BA&apos;s efforts to secure a high court injunction. Amsterdam&apos;s Schipol airport is expected to reopen in about 20 minutes (at 1pm). In the meantime check out this stunning timelapse footage of the volcano. Almost makes the disruption worthwhile. Many thanks to Sean Stiegemeier.  1.00pm:  Most Irish airports have reopened, according to the Irish Aviation Authority. The only one to remain closed is Donegal, which is due to open at 2pm BST.  &quot;The outlook for the coming days is positive and the IAA does not anticipate any further restrictions relating to volcanic ash at Irish airports for at least the next 48 hours,&quot; the authority said on its website. The IAA is providing another update at 2.30pm.  1.04pm: Thank you Adam, especially for unearthing that spectacular video. Nats, the air traffic service has issued another update. The no-fly zone that was affecting flights at Heathrow and Gatwick has been lifted until 7 tonight. There are no restrictions at other English or Welsh airports during this period. From 1 to 7, two key areas remain affected - Northern Ireland and the Orkney and Shetland Isles. Airports in these areas include Belfast City, Londonderry, Kirkwall and Stornoway. All other airports will be open.  Finally - and this will bring some relief to passengers and airlines - the outlook for the coming days is positive and the Irish Aviation Authority does not anticipate any further restrictions at Irish airports for at least the next 48 hours.  1.17pm: Here&apos;s a lunchtime summary.\u2022 Flight restrictions at Heathrow and Gatwick airports were lifted this morning, as disruption caused by the Icelandic ash cloud eased for most of the UK.\u2022 No-fly zones remain in place in Northern Ireland and the Shetland islands.\u2022 The high court to decide this afternoon whether a strike ballot by BA unions will stand.\u2022 BA boss Willie Walsh sees little chance of progress at conciliation talks due at 4.             .  1.25pm: The Unite union has released this video called &quot;Brutish Airways.  1.37pm: A post from below is throwing up the same issues that emerged in previous disruption. This from Rxxx      My parents are trying to get to Iceland and are waiting at Glasgow; their flight is now scheduled for 0440 tomorrow: Icelandair &quot;don&apos;t want to know&quot; (i.e. won&apos;t provide accommodation or food vouchers, despite my mum waving a printed-off list of her legal rights). Home for them is a 6-hour drive away, so no way they can nip home for a rest or something to eat. Disgrace and illegal. (And before you say Iceland isn&apos;t in the EC it is subject to the directive).  1.43pm: Helen Pidd has just sent this from the high court, which has broken off for lunch. It&apos;s particularly good on the highly technical issue involved.     Helen Pidd    &quot;Thousands of travellers will know later today whether their holiday plans will be disrupted by a strike by British Airways cabin crew. Lawyers for the airline are at the high court in London to apply for an injuction to scupper the walkout, which would begin tomorrow. If it goes ahead, air stewards would strike from May 18-22 inclusive, then from May 24-28, May 30-June 3 and June 5-9. BA stands to lose around \u00a3100m if the strikes go ahead. If successful, this would be the second time the airline has succeeded in securing a high court injunction to prevent a strike, after it stopped a 12-day walkout in December. The airline&apos;s argument is very technical, but rests on the claim that Unite \u2013 the union representing the cabin crew \u2013 failed to carry out its statutory duties by making sure that everyone balloted was told the result. When balloting for strikes, unions should give those who took part a detailed breakdown of the result, as required by section 231 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, apparently. But the union says the airline has not been able to find even one employee who did not know the result of the ballot, which voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action. The benches of court 23 were packed with BA cabin crew waiting to hear whether theywould be forced to go to work tomorrow. This morning&apos;s session was taken up with David Reade, QC, making BA&apos;s case. This afternoon it will be the turn of the union&apos;s silk, John Hendy, QC. A result is not expected until 4pm at the earliest.&quot;  3.00pm:  Hello there, Adam Gabbatt here again, home time for Mark. The no-fly zones have been lifted from the vast majority of the UK. Flight restrictions only remain in Orkney and the Shetland Isles, after Northern Ireland airspace was re-opened at 1pm. All Irish airspace is now open, according to the Irish Aviation Authority. (Donegal had remained closed into this afternoon). Flights are landing and taking off at London&apos;s Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol Airport, but all three have warned travelers it will take time for airlines to clear the backlog of delayed flights.  4.15pm:  RyanAir chief executive Michael O&apos;Leary has called for an end to the volcanic ash concentration charts.  &quot;Today&apos;s reopening of Heathrow and Gatwick airports removes any shred of credibility that the charts may have had.&quot;Airlines have known for some weeks now that there has been little evidence of any volcanic ash in the atmosphere over Ireland, the UK or continental Europe.&quot;The fact that Heathrow and Gatwick airports have reopened this morning, despite the fact that the charts shows this imaginary black plume (or no-fly zone) directly over these major London airports, shows that the charts have no credibility.&quot;There cannot be one safety model for busy London airports, and a different safety model for smaller regional airports. It should, and must be, the one safety rule for all.&quot;&quot;It is frankly ridiculous that the flight plans of millions of air passengers across Europe are being disrupted on a daily basis by an outdated, inappropriate and imaginary computer-generated model and it is time that these charts were done away with.&quot;    4.57pm:  All UK airspace will be open from 7pm tonight, Nats has announced. Airspace above Orkney and the Shetland Isles is the only area closed, but the restrictions there will be lifted between 7pm and 1am Tuesday. Earlier restrictions in south east England, Northern Ireland, Ireland and the Netherlands were all lifted.  5.12pm:  That&apos;s it for today. Thanks for the comments.  A verdict is expected on BA&apos;s High Court challenge to the cabin crew strike not long after 5pm. If the High Court does impose an injuction on Unite&apos;s plans for 20 days of industrial action, then in theory BA would be able to operate a full schedule during Unite&apos;s planned four five-day strike periods \u2013 the first of which is due to start at midnight tonight. BA is arguing that Unite did not properly comply with a legal requirement to send everyone eligible to vote in the recent ballot a letter detailing the result. The airline was successful in a similar court application in December, preventing the union from holding a planned Christmas and New Year strike.

No-fly zones remained in place in Northern Ireland and the Shetland islands, but passengers&apos; respite from travel disruption may be shortlived, withBritish Airways cabin crew poised to start a series of strikes tomorrow. &quot;The decision comes following further information from the Met Office about the nature and location of the ash cloud,&quot; a CAA spokesman said. &quot;The no-fly zone remains in place in two key areas affecting operations in Northern Ireland and the Shetland Isles. Airports falling within the no-fly zones include Belfast City, Londonderry, Shetland and Orkney. All other airports are open.&quot; Europe&apos;s air traffic management agency said it appeared the cloud was beginning to disperse, although Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport was expected to remain closed until 1pm (BST). Charts published by Brussels-based Eurocontrol showed the latest ash cloud gradually breaking up and retreating during the day. Large regional airports, such as Manchester, Glasgow and Stansted, were open this morning, but passengers were being urged to check with their airlines before leaving for the airport. The latest disruption comes a month after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcanic eruption cancelled flights across Europe, and as talks continued to try to avert a strike by BA cabin crew. Up to 11,000 BA flight attendants are due to start the first of four five-day strikes tomorrow. Attempts to halt the walkout were due to take place today: BA was to seek a high court injunction followed by face-to-face talks with the Unite union, and discussions with the transport secretary, Philip Hammond. &quot;Our primary objective is to minimise disruption for passengers,&quot; Hammond told BBC News, adding, however, that he did not want to hold out hope for a &quot;miraculous breakthrough&quot;. As the BA chief executive, Willie Walsh, arrived at the Department for Transport in London to continue talks with Hammond, he criticised blanket bans on flying as &quot;a gross over-reaction to a very minor risk. I am very concerned that we have decisions on opening and closing of airports based on a theoretical model,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no evidence of ash in the skies over London today yet Heathrow was closed.&quot; Walsh said the safety of passengers and aircraft was paramount, but &quot;a much better and more sensible&quot; approach to dealing with the ash problem needed to be adopted. Forecasters were expecting the north-westerly wind to change direction today and blow the &quot;high density&quot; cloud away from Britain tomorrow.Earlier revisions to the no-fly zone meant airports in the north of England reopened from 1am, after being closed for most of yesterday. But Manchester airport warned: &quot;It is absolutely essential that people contact their airline before travelling to the airport for any flight because there are still high levels of ash contamination above parts of Britain which may bring further disruption.&quot; Luton and East Midlands airports were operational, while in Scotland, Prestwick airport was no longer in the no-fly zone but a spokeswoman said it would not be receiving any flights until 12.45pm. Aberdeen airport would be shut until at least 1pm. Flights in and out of Dublin were grounded until at least midday. EasyJet said it was cancelling all flights to and from Edinburgh and Belfast until at least midday. BA told passengers that if their flights were cancelled they could re-book on the next available flight or claim a full refund. The Virgin Atlantic president, Sir Richard Branson yesterday described the closure of Manchester airspace as &quot;beyond a joke. All the test flights by airlines, aircraft and engine manufacturers have shown no evidence that airlines could not continue to fly completely safety,&quot; Branson said.", "sentences": ["All other airports are open.&quot; Europe&apos;s air traffic management agency said it appeared the cloud was beginning to disperse, although Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport was expected to remain closed until 1pm (BST)."], "title": "Ash cloud flight restrictions lift as disruptions ease", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/17/ash-cloud-disruptions-continue-airports", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "British Airways", "Trade unions", "Transport", "UK news", "Scotland", "Wales", "Northern Ireland", "Heathrow", "Travel", "Flights"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-18T00:08:00Z", "article": "The Civil Aviation Authority promised flight cancellations due to volcanic ash will be &quot;significantly&quot; reduced, as it unveiled new regulations last night. The UK&apos;s air safety watchdog doubled the safe limit for flying through ash plumes following intense discussions with aircraft and engine manufacturers, after another day of airspace closures. British skies were fully reopened last night after further eruptions from the Icelandic volcano closed Heathrow and Gatwick in the morning, and Belfast City, Derry, Shetland and Orkney for much of the day. The CAA said the new regime starting today will allow airlines to fly in contaminated air corridors for a set period of time once they have reached agreement with aircraft engine manufacturers. The regional airline Flybe said that under the new guidelines it would have had to cancel only 21 flights last weekend due to ash, instead of 380 services under the restrictions then in place. Andrew Haines, the CAA&apos;s chief executive, who has faced criticism over how long it has taken to introduce changes, said: &quot;I&apos;m pleased that the huge efforts we&apos;re all making across aviation to keep flying safe while minimising the disruption from the volcano have resulted in further progress.&quot; A CAA spokesman added: &quot;We think there will be significantly fewer cancellations.&quot; Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency, said about 1,000 flights out of a total of 28,000 in Europe had been cancelled yesterday as Heathrow and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport were closed temporarily. Today&apos;s changes represent the second big overhaul of safety guidelines in a month, following a six-day shutdown of UK airspace in mid-April under international aviation rules that banned all flying in areas affected by the ash cloud. Revised guidelines introduced on 20 April allowed flights through volcanic ash for the first time. But many airlines believed these rules were still too conservative. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, said blanket bans on flying were &quot;a gross overreaction to a very minor risk&quot;. He added: &quot;I am very concerned that we have decisions on opening and closing of airports based on a theoretical model.&quot; Referring to the closure of BA&apos;s main base at Heathrow yesterday morning, he said: &quot;There was no evidence of ash in the skies over London, yet Heathrow was closed.&quot; Walsh urged the CAA to adopt the US system that gives airlines a greater say in whether it is safe to fly through volcanic ash, relying upon first-hand evidence rather than computer modelling. Ryanair yesterday criticised projections issued by the Met Office and its volcanic ash advisory centre (VAAC). Michael O&apos;Leary, Ryanair&apos;s chief executive, said the CAA should adopt US guidelines limiting no-fly zones to within 60 miles of an erupting volcano. He said the CAA had appeared to sanction flights to and from Heathrow after 7am despite VAAC maps showing an ash cloud over the capital. &quot;The fact that Heathrow and Gatwick airports have reopened this morning, despite the fact that the VAAC charts shows this imaginary black plume (or no-fly zone) directly over these major London airports shows that the VAAC charts have no credibility. There cannot be one safety model for busy London airports and a different safety model for smaller regional airports,&quot; said O&apos;Leary. The Met Office said its ash advice was based on aircraft observations, computer models and scientific opinion. &quot;Recent Met Office observations over the south-east of the UK have shown ash is present, but [in] sufficiently low concentrations to allow airspace to reopen in these areas. Yesterday, research aircraft observations clearly showed a thick and extensive layer of ash across the north of the UK,&quot; said a spokesman. BA is also using an alternative monitoring system by the US firm WSI, which relies on satellite images to locate dangerous ash concentrations. Dr Colin Brown, of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, agreed that the ban was overwrought: &quot;It is perfectly acceptable to fly.&quot; The EU estimates that the six-day airspace shutdown last month cost the industry \u00a32.1bn.", "sentences": ["Andrew Haines, the CAA&apos;s chief executive, who has faced criticism over how long it has taken to introduce changes, said: &quot;I&apos;m pleased that the huge efforts we&apos;re all making across aviation to keep flying safe while minimising the disruption from the volcano have resulted in further progress.&quot; A CAA spokesman added: &quot;We think there will be significantly fewer cancellations.&quot; Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency, said about 1,000 flights out of a total of 28,000 in Europe had been cancelled yesterday as Heathrow and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport were closed temporarily."], "title": "Airports reopen after another day of frustration", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/18/volcanic-ash-uk-flight-disruption", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Iceland", "British Airways", "Ryanair", "World news", "UK news", "Weather", "Flights", "Travel", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-18T09:42:00Z", "article": "Foreign correspondents covering the Middle East are the first to admit that it isn&apos;t an easy beat: partisan views, authoritarian regimes and marginalised opposition movements are routine hazards. Add in issues as divisive as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, al-Qaida, oil, the US invasion of Iraq and theocracy in Iran \u2013 and the word &quot;minefield&quot; conveys just how treacherous the territory can be. Real war-zones and men with guns are part of the landscape too. And so are expectations and agendas back in the newsroom. Two excellent new books describe some of the tricks and dilemmas of this trade. Hugh Pope left the field after nearly 30 years reporting for British and US news agencies and papers. Hello Everybody! Dutch journalist Joris Luyendijk tells the story of his five years in the region in a breezy but self-critical account of &quot;one journalist&apos;s search for truth&quot;. Pope&apos;s book Dining with Al Qaeda is terrific on spice-scented bazaars, maddening border crossings, sinister secret policemen and sexual mores in unlikely places \u2013 as well as Islam, democracy and other staples. But he is also thought provoking on the difficulty of conveying the reality of the &quot;dysfunctional backyard&quot; that is the Middle East to western, especially American, audiences who are used to a diet of infotainment and familiar, easily digestible narratives. In his final media job at the Wall Street Journal he battled to keep his stories &quot;out of the ruts of traditional coverage of good &apos;moderates&apos; versus bad &apos;radicals,&apos; a misleading focus on an Arab-Israeli &apos;peace process&apos; that has yet to proceed anywhere, and the way many people overemphasise the role of &apos;Islam&apos; as an analytical tool in assessing the Middle East&quot;. An editor at the Los Angeles Times urged him not to use the word &quot;Kurd&quot; if he wanted his stories published. It reminded me of the joke of hard-bitten American correspondents in Lebanon in the hostage-taking 1980s: &quot;What&apos;s a Druze and who gives a shit?&quot; This can be a frustrating and dangerous craft: not only did Pope struggle to explain Saudi Arabia to suddenly interested readers after 9/11 but had to draw on his Quranic knowledge to convince a jihadi interviewee it was not his duty to kill him as an infidel. His Jewish WSJ colleague Danny Pearl was not so lucky when he encountered al-Qaida in Pakistan. Changing technology is part of this story: Pope is old enough to have filed copy by telex and fiddled with those crocodile clips used to attach early laptops to hotel phone lines. Luyendijk, using mobile phones and the internet from the start, recalls how Syrian censors blocked his Hotmail account and moved on to YouTube a few years later. Facebook and Twitter helped the opposition in last summer&apos;s Iranian presidential elections. Both fretted about how to deal with the pressure to deliver stories that filter, distort and manipulate reality. Notebooks bursting with hard-gained insights can count for little if the item has been pre-scripted according to stock assumptions and prejudices back at base in New York, London or Amsterdam. Pope is an accomplished linguist with Arabic, Persian and Turkish under his belt: he wears his learning lightly but it shows in the quality of his writing \u2013 short on pyrotechnics but long on understanding. Luyendijk is good on bridging the gap between the modern standard Arabic most foreigners study and the different dialects spoken in every country and region. Too little ability to speak means over-dependence on local fixers and translators on the payroll of the ministry of information. Pope bravely tackles the reputation of his onetime Independent colleague Robert Fisk, for many a cult figure who &quot;manages to step around the cautious conventions of Middle Eastern reporting and drive home at an emotional level the injustices of the dictators and the cruel side of US policies&quot;. But he is not the first journalist to wonder with envy and irritation how Fisk &quot;managed to get an amazing sounding story from a dull day we all spent staking out Israeli anti-insurgency troop movements in south Lebanon&quot;. Drama and colour may be easier to deliver than accuracy, analysis and insight: &quot;Our readers were too far away, physically and mentally, to grasp the emotional context of careful reporting,&quot; he gloomily concludes. Reporting on the run-up to war in Iraq for the WSJ, he says, was a depressing time: a carefully researched article warning of &quot;unintended consequences&quot; for foreign conquerors had no effect on the pro-war juggernaut: it was published a few days before the tanks began to roll. Shortly afterwards Pope got his first call from the paper&apos;s baffled opinion page editor who wanted the correspondent to explain why Iraqis were resisting their American liberators. It was a short conversation. Pope&apos;s book, acclaimed in the US, has yet to be published in Britain. Luyendijk&apos;s, now out in English (Profile Books), sold an extraordinary 250,000 copies in the Netherlands. It&apos;s just as well neither heeded the advice one old hack offered the young Dutchman. &quot;If you want to write a book about the Middle East, you&apos;d better do it in your first week,&quot; he counselled. &quot;The longer you hang around here, the less you understand.&quot;", "sentences": ["Notebooks bursting with hard-gained insights can count for little if the item has been pre-scripted according to stock assumptions and prejudices back at base in New York, London or Amsterdam."], "title": "Two journalists ponder the hazards of reporting on the Middle East", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/18/journalists-middle-east-reporting", "tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Al-Qaida"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-19T06:34:05Z", "article": " 7.15am: The worst fears about the situation in Thailand appear to be being borne out today as the Thai army move in against thousands of redshirt protesters in central Bangkok.  Using armoured vehicles they broke through make shift barricades in an operation that killed at least four people. Two journalists were among 50 people wounded and one western journalist, identified as an Italian is believed to dead. Here&apos;s a graphic account from Associated Press:  Surreal scenes of warfare erupted in one of the ritziest parts of the capital, as troops armed with M-16s marched through the central business district past upscale apartment buildings to retake the area around manicured Lumpini Park, which has been under the control of protesters camped there for weeks. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn declared the first stage of the army operation to secure the area around Lumpini Park successful and said that some protest leaders had fled.  He asked the public to inform police if any of the leaders were spotted. However, two of the three key leaders remained in the protest zone giving defiant speeches and singing on a stage, as troops drew closer. An AP reporter who followed the troops into the protest camp saw the bodies of two men sprawled on the ground, one with a head wound and other apparently shot in the upper body. They were the first known casualties in the assault that began before dawn on a 1km square stretch of downtown Bangkok that protesters have occupied. Troops fired M-16 rifles at fleeing protesters and shouted: &quot;Come out and surrender or we&apos;ll kill you.&quot; An AP photographer saw three foreign journalists shot. One was an Italian photographer shot in the chest. His eyes were rolled back and he showed no signs of life. A Dutch journalist walked into the hospital with a bullet wound in his shoulder. The third journalist was a 53-year-old American documentary film-maker who was treated for a shot in the leg  .

Here&apos;s a background Q&amp;A to the protests.Our correspondent in Bangkok, Ben Doherty, will be providing regular updates today, but if you are in Thailand and have news please post a comment below or email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk      Ben Doherty    7.42am: Bangkok has descended into chaos, writes Ben Doherty.  &quot;Troops are moving into the redshirts central city protest camp firing indiscriminately, as they seek to take back control of the capital&apos;s streets. Shortly after 6am, fierce fighting broke out as troops began moving on the redshirts fortifications, four-metre walls of bamboo staves and tyres. As armoured personnel carriers, backed by heavy fire from soldiers, pushed into the barricades, protesters set fire to them, sending huge plumes of black smoke into the sky.Many protesters turned and fled, but troops met fierce resistance from a hardcore element within the red shirts group. I saw protesters armed with assault rifles firing on troops as the soldiers made their way north up Ratchadamri Road. Outnumbered and lacking firepower, however, the protesters suffered serious casualties. As the fighting intensified, shot demonstrators were being rushed to waiting ambulances.  I saw a Thai man shot as he crouched behind an ambulance which came to rescue him. After coming under fire the ambulance retreated leaving the man stranded in the street. Soldiers also moved through the adjacent Lumpini Park, the biggest park in central Bangkok, backed by personnel carriers. Moving up Ratchadamri Road, troops fired indiscriminately. Journalists, ambulances and paramedics all attracted fire. The army moved slowly and deliberately early, pausing after breaching the redshirts&apos; fortifications to check for bombs and booby traps. Protesters offered determined early resistance, but many then retreated and troops were able to progress more quickly through the camp. Retreating redshirts&apos; set fire to shelters and the hastily-constructed barricades behind them. By midday Thai time (it&apos;s now 1.42pm) soldiers had managed to push nearly a kilometre into the camp. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn has appeared on Thai TV saying the operation to take control of the southern section of the protest site had been &quot;successful&quot;. He told protesters remaining in the middle of the sprawling protest camp that troops were moving on the site and they needed to leave now. He said the government had positioned buses on the western flank of the protest, and urged those who wished to leave peacefully to go to the buses where they would be evacuated. He alleged the reds&apos; protest leaders had escaped, but this has not yet been confirmed.It is estimated there are still some 3,000 protesters within the red-shirt protest zone.&quot;   7.44am: The redshirt leader Jatuporn Prompan has been shown on Thai television surrendering to the police, according to a Reuters live blog of the crackdown. Another leader has been shown under arrest. AP has this:  Thailand&apos;s Red Shirt protest leaders say they are formally ending their anti-government protest and will surrender to authorities to prevent more deaths. Seven Red Shirt leaders went on stage in the core protest zone to announce their decision, which was greeted with shouts of dismay from the men and women gathered around. Protest leader Natawut Saikua said &quot;we have done our best.&quot;  Weng Tojirakarn said &quot;we want to prevent further losses of our Red Shirt brothers and sisters.&quot; He said &quot;let us first prevent further losses of lives,&quot; and urged supporters to leave the area.   8.02am: Associated Press has footage of the troops moving in. The caption on YouTube reads: &quot;Thai troops opened fire at a fortified encampment of anti-government protesters in central Bangkok. It came amid reports of a final assault on the area the protesters have occupied for weeks.&quot;             8.22am: Bangkok has descended into open warfare, says Ben Doherty reporting from the Foreign Correspondents Club amidst the gunfire in central Bangkok.  You can hear shots firing as he says: &quot;This has been the day that Bangkok has feared for weeks now \u2026 this is the end game.&quot;      Thaksin Shinawatra Photograph: Apichart Weerawong/AP    8.28am: The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whom the redshirts back, said he feared the crackdown could lead to guerrilla warfare across the country.  &quot;There is a theory saying a military crackdown can spread resentment and these resentful people will become guerrillas,&quot; Thaksin told Reuters in a telephone interview, declining to say where he was.  He also denied an accusation by a top aide of the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, that he was the stumbling block to the failed talks between the government and the redshirts.      Ben Doherty    8.40am: Ben says the violence is set to continue.  &quot;Smoke continues to billow from a pile of tyres set alight at the Chitlom railway station near the middle of the reds protest site. Since redshirt leaders have conceded their protest is lost, the gunfire has decreased in recent minutes, but there are still volleys being fired at the camp, and by reds protesters at advancing troops. It will take several hours before troops can be confident they have central Bangkok under control. Undoubtedly, there will be pockets of resistance from within the redshirts. Many in the paramilitary wing of the redshirts remain armed and have vowed to fight to the death. But even if this protest site can be brought under control, and peace restored to Bangkok, serious questions remain about Thailand&apos;s political future. This is a deeply divided country, and while this protest might be soon to end, the sentiment for democratic reform in Thailand, and for the removal of this government, will not go away. Prime minister Abhisit, and his country, face difficult weeks and years ahead. The antigovernment movement has massive support across the country. Across regional Thailand, redshirt supporters and sympathisers staged their own rallies. The Khon Kaen town hall was captured by protesters, in Ubon Thani they torched it.&quot;   8.59am: A curfew is to be imposed in Bangkok  tonight, the defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwon, has announced according to the Nation.       9.03am: Geoff Peace, a Bangkok resident, emails this:  The real story in Bangkok now is outside Rachaprasong. Just before lunchtime fires and rioting started all around the edge of the main part of the city. Although most of the redshirt leaders have surrendered the rest seem to have splintered all over the city and are bent on destroying the place. Just to be clear, the Army did what they needed to do very effectively today but it now looks like there will be random violence over the city and maybe in the regions too. That makes it more frightening than before.   9.10am: Thailand&apos;s Channel 3 TV station is seeking police protection from redshirt protesters, according to a tweet from a reporter from the Nation.  &quot;Cars have been smashed and building under siege,&quot; says an update.      Ben Doherty    9.24am: Ben has confirmed that report about the TV station being under siege.  &quot;Fleeing redshirts are torching Bangkok as they leave. Thai TV station Channel 3 is under attack from angry reds, and the Thai Stock Exchange building, a few kilometres from the protest site, has been set ablaze. Despite pleas from redshirt leaders for protesters to leave peacefully, many reds are angry and are looking to take out their frustration on anything they see as being representative of the ruling elite they have been protesting against.&quot;        9.31am: Staff at the Bangkok Post have been forced to flee their offices. Bangkok Post being evacuated, says its website.  The evacuation came after protesters have reportedly set fire on buildings around the Rama IV intersection. Reporters are heading to Wat Klong Toey Nai.   9.43am: The dead Italian journalist has been named as Fabio Polenghi. He was a 48-year-old freelance photojournalist, according to Newsolio.  9.46am: Images are circulating of the fire at the Thai Stock Exchange. &quot;Flames twice as bad since I&apos;ve uploaded this,&quot; says the caption to this photo.  10.02am: More media organisations have been forced to evacuate their offices. The Tan Network tweeted this: &quot;Due to immediate threats on our headquarters, TAN Network is evacuating our editorial/production crews.&quot; Thailand&apos;s Channel 3 has gone off air. AP reports: &quot;Staff at the Thai local TV station Channel 3 say their building has been attacked by redshirt protesters. One staffer said cars parked outside the building were set on fire and protesters then entered the Channel 3 building.&quot; There are reports that some staff are trapped inside the building.  10.21am: More details on that curfew, from Reuters:   Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva imposed a curfew in Bangkok on tonight from 8pm (2pm BST) until 6am tomorrow. The curfew \u2013 details of which were read out on national television \u2013 was meant to allow security authorities perform their duty, Abhisit said in the order.   10.27am: Andrew Marshall, a reporter for Time, is one journalist tweeting from Thailand.      Here are couple or recent updates:  I&apos;m on the 18th floor of a building about a mile from Rama 4. I can see at least 5 fires, from Ch3 building to (I think) Siam Square. Residents in expensive cars try to flee upmarket apartment block opposite. Can&apos;t. No power to lift the security gate.  Mark MacKinnon, east Asia correspondent for Canada&apos;s The Globe and Mail, is also worth following for his updates and mobile phone photos.  Ambulance attendees take cover in alley outside Wat Patum, Bangkok  Settling in for a long stay? Inside the Wat Patum temple where maybe 1,000 are now sheltering        10.44am: Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s lawyer Robert Amsterdam tweets:  The decision of #redshirt leaders to sacrifice themselves to prevent violence stands in stark contrast to a govt willing to murder its own.   10.55am: A Bangkok fire service official just told the BBC that up to 100 staff are trapped in the Channel 3 building. There also unconfirmed reports that the fire at station&apos;s offices has been put out.  11.09am: A helicopter has been photographed over Channel 3&apos;s building, in what is being seen as an attempt to evacuate staff. Meanwhile, the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation has announced that a government message is about to be broadcast on all Thai TV channels.  11.33am: There are reports that the protesters have set fire to government offices in the north eastern province of Udon Thani. This video appears to show a blaze in Udon today. Can anyone help verify this?             12.00pm: Ben Doherty says the street of Bangkok are emptying ahead of the curfew but there are still pockets of violence, gunshots and several burning buildings. &quot;I&apos;m looking now at smoke billowing from the stock exchange building,&quot; he says as he discusses attacks onThai media buildings, banks and shopping centres. Many redshirts have completely ignored a edict to surrender from some protest leaders, he says. &quot;Red Radio was broadcasting message like &apos;If you are near a bank set it on fire&apos;. There is an element that is refusing to abide by the surrender,&quot; Ben says. (The audio briefly cuts out, but stay with it)  12.22pm: Bangkok&apos;s Central World - South East Asia&apos;s second biggest department store has be destroyed by fire, according to Reuters. There are pictures of the blaze here and here For a British comparison, I&apos;m told this is the equivalent of a large swath of Oxford Street in London burning down.  12.31pm: Video has emerged purporting to show the aftermath of the shooting of the Italian journalist Fabio Polenghi. [Warning: very disturbing content].                 Redshirts are detained by soldiers inside their camp in Bangkok, Thailand. Illustration: Manan Vatsyayana/AFP/Getty Images    12.38pm: Our picture desk has put together a new gallery of some of the images from a very violent day in Bangkok. And here&apos;s a extracts from AP&apos;s latest report:  Downtown Bangkok turned into a flaming battleground today as an army assault toppled the redshirt protest leadership, enraging followers who fired grenades and set numerous fires that cloaked the skyline in a black haze. Using live ammunition, troops dispersed thousands of anti-government protesters who had been camped in the capital&apos;s premier shopping and residential district for weeks. Four protesters and an Italian news photographer were killed in the ensuing gun battles and about 60 wounded. After redshirt leaders gave themselves up to police, rioters set fires at the Stock Exchange, several banks, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, the high-end Central World shopping mall and a cinema complex that collapsed.  The government declared a nighttime curfew in Bangkok, and said army operations would continue through the night. An announcement signed by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and broadcast on television said nobody in the capital was allowed out of their homes from 8pm until 6am unless they have permission from authorities. Protesters also turned their rage on the local media, which they have accused of pro-government coverage. They attacked the offices of state-run Channel 3, setting fire to cars outside and puncturing water pipes that flooded the building. Cabinet minister Satit Vongnongteay described the chaos as anticipated &quot;aftershocks.&quot;&quot;There are violent-prone protesters who remain angry,&quot; Satit told a news conference.   1.19pm: More on those attacks against the local media, who according to AP, have been accused of pro-government coverage by protesters.  Channel 3 news anchor Patcharasri Benjamasa was tweeting for help from the television stations offices earlier today: &quot;At Channel 3 need urgent help from police, soldiers!!!&quot;, Benjamasa tweeted. &quot;News cars were smashed and they are about to invade the building&quot; AP said hours later the building was on fire. Channel 3 executives were evacuated by helicopter while police rescued other staff.  The Guardian has posted a video of the scenes in Bangkok, showing tanks moving into the redshirts camp.  2.03pm: The curfew has now begun but the fighting continues. Mark MacKinnon, from Canada Global and Mail is giving a running commentary on Twitter on fighting outside the Wat Patum temple in central Bangkok.      Here&apos;s a selection from the last two hours in chronological order:  Firefight outside temple escalating. Hundreds of people still sheltering inside. Air smells of fire. Twenty buildings around city said to be in fire, including Central World. At least one person inside temple has bullet wound. No idea what happened. Gunfire escalating. Fighting rages all around temple. Teargas in the air. At least three shot, either inside or just outside sanctuary. At least five wounded around me at makeshift medical centre in park behind Wat Patum temple, one a friend and colleague \u2026 gunfire continues. Somehow we&apos;re the only corros left in temple. People around us terrified. Red Cross can&apos;t get ambulance in to injured because of gunfire.   2.20pm: By opting to use military force against the redshirt protesters, the Thai government has lost the opportunity to craft a settlement for an orderly transition, writes Duncan McCargo.  Nobody should be fooled into thinking that this conflict is over. Whether the fires are quickly extinguished or continue to burn for many nights to come will depend on the willingness of the Thai authorities to act pragmatically, and to listen to voices of reason.  McCargo also narrates an powerful audio slide show on the background to today&apos;s events for the US Asia Society.  2.25pm: Scores of videos have been uploaded to YouTube today showing smoke over the Bangkok skyline. Here is footage from street level of that blaze at the shopping mall Central World (see 12.21pm).             2.33pm: Another disturbing update from the Canadian journalist Mark MacKinnon.  2.42pm: People are being shot at in Victory Monument, which surrounded by troops according to an unverified report on a red shirt Facebook group. It also links to footage of a fire at the city hall in Khon Kaen in north east Thailand.  2.52pm: Confirmation that violence is not confined to Bangkok \u2013 Reuters reports that the overnight curfew has been extended to 21 provinces across Thailand. The curfew extension was posted on TV channels, now under the control of the government. The provincial curfews followed arson attacks and protests in at least seven provinces, which included the torching of town halls in three major cities, all of which were strongholds of the anti-government protest movement.  3.11pm: Here&apos;s a summary of a very violent day in Bangkok \u2022 At least six people have been killed and 60 injured, after the Thai army stormed the redshirts camp in central Bangkok.  \u2022 One of those killed Italian photojournalist Fabio Polenghi (9.43am).  \u2022 There are fears that the death toll will increase sharply. For example medics reports that seven people are dead inside a temple in central Bangkok (2.33pm) and there numerous reports of shooting. \u2022 Several red shirt leaders have surrendered to police and urged followers to do the same. But many anti-government protesters have reacted violently to the army crackdown.  \u2022 Scores of prominent buildings have been torched including the stock exchange, shopping malls, and banks in Bangkok. Outside Bangkok offices and city halls have been attacked.  \u2022 Journalists have been forced to flee their offices after protesters took out their anger on the Thai media which is seen as sympathetic to the government. The Bangkok Post and Channel 3 television were both evacuated.  \u2022 The government has taken over broadcasting on all TV channels. \u2022 A night curfew has been imposed in Bangkok and 21 provinces. \u2022 Thaksin Shinawatra, whom the redshirts back, said he feared the crackdown could lead to guerrilla warfare across the country  3.25pm: ITN has this posted this report on today&apos;s events to YouTube.             3.34pm: The Nation is keeping a tally of the fires in Bangkok. It reports (via its Facebook group - it&apos;s own site is very slow to load) that out of the &quot;27 gutted spots&quot; 19 are banks. The redshirt radio station urges followers to torch the banks, according to Ben Doherty (12pm). Time magazine confirms this. &quot;A radio station aligned with the Red Shirt movement urged supporters to unleash &quot;all out arson.&quot;  4.06pm:  The Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva is giving a speech on television in the country. It&apos;s hard to get reliable updates of what he&apos;s saying but he seems to be explaining why the government felt it necessary to impose a curfew.  @tulsathit, who works for the Nation, is live-tweeting the speech. He says the PM has praised the rescue workers and urged residents to be vigilant. Here&apos;s a selection of his updates. \u2022 &quot;PM: Plesse cooperate with measures issued by Govt.&quot; 3 minutes ago via TweetDeck \u2022 &quot;PM: Please be our eyes and ears.&quot; 3 minutes ago via TweetDeck \u2022 &quot;Our security forces are doing the best they can to bring back normalcy.

His message has been retweeted by over 100 people, and seems to have had the desired effect - here&apos;s another tweet from Mark at around 4.15pm: @markmackinnon Thanks to all who Rt. we got all injured out in ambulances. Twitter may just have done this. 12 minutes ago via mobile web  4.36pm:  Reuters has more on Abhisit Vejjajiva&apos;s television address. It is reporting that the Thai prime minister said he believed his government could soon restore peace and order to the country. &quot;I am confident and determined to end the problems and return the country to peace and order once again,&quot; Abhisit said.  4.43pm:  Max Tunon, who has been working in Bangkok for the UN for the last nine months, is currently at the airport waiting to flee the city. While he was waiting he spoke to Matthew Weaver from an internet cafe in the airport.  &quot;Until last week I was living in an apartment near redshirts camp, so I was living in the middle of a rally for a month. It was relatively peaceful then. But when the violence broke out last week I moved out to a hotel on Sukhumvit.  It was about 1 km from the protesters encampment but until today the street had been totally unaffected. There were rumours since last night that a crackdown would start at dawn. It did. They moved slowly but steadily to the main rally site. Until around noon things were relatively straightforward. Then there was a small explosion near the Sheraton on the crossroads of Sukhumvit and Asok. It was serious enough to make the T-shirt vendors on the street finally pack up. It was the first time I was genuinely afraid since I&apos;ve been here. The violence was so indiscriminate. There was smoke all over the cityscape. This is huge. The fires are out of control all over the city, so what was just affecting the shopping malls - is now affecting everyone. I popped out to get some supplies as the curfew was announced. They were warning everyone to stay indoors. I saw smoke billowing from next to the Sheraton and some guys throwing rocks - either at the hotel, or at the police.  I had to walk about 2 kms before before I could get a taxi to the airport. Loads of people were trying to find taxis before the curfew started. I had a flight planned for tomorrow and didnt want to get stuck. I wanted to stay overnight in the airport hotel - but they are all fully booked. Then I managed to get on an earlier flight. I only felt relief when I found out I had a flight. I&apos;m hoping to return when the situation is bought under control.&quot;   4.58pm:  @tukky_nt has tweeted a link to the video below showing the Central World shopping mall ablaze.            @vaitor, a journalist, is defying the curfew to post updates from Bangkok. Earlier he reported Central World was unstable, and commented on &quot;dead silence&quot; on the streets. He&apos;s just tweeted: &quot;more ambulances leaving red area. central world is still standing, just some walls fall down...&quot;  5.06pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;The Independent&apos;s Andrew Buncombe was one of the foreign journalists who have been injured in the clashes. He was hit in the leg but is OK. His injuries were confirmed by the Independent, according to the travel writer Andrew Spooner \u2013 a reliable source. Meanwhile the press freedom campaign Reporters Without Borders has expressed dismay at the shooting of the photojournalist Fabio Polenghi. He is the second journalist to die in the crisis, following the death of Reuters cameraman Hiroyuki Muramoto. In a statement Reporters Without Borders said: &apos;With two journalists killed and five wounded, the toll on the media has been heavy, while many others have only narrowly escaped death. We are stunned and outraged by the indiscriminate nature of this assault, which shows that the Thai authorities made little attempt to protect journalists in their desire to suppress the red shirt opposition &apos;As in the case of Hiroyuki Muramoto, we call for an independent investigation into Fabio Polenghi&apos;s death, including an autopsy and a ballistic study carried out in a transparent manner and, if necessary, with the help of foreign experts.&apos;&quot;  5.21pm:  Witnesses say at least six more bodies from the Bangkok unrest are lying in a Buddhist temple in the protest zone, according to Associated Press. If true the deaths would bring today&apos;s toll to at least 12.  They say the temple, Wat Pathum Vanaram, was supposed to be a sanctuary for protesters from the street violence but troops have yet to secure the surrounding area.Hundreds of people fled there after the army launched a crackdown to end a two-month standoff in the Thai capital.Medical volunteer Anan Thongniem said the dead included two protesters, one protest &apos;guard&apos; and two medics.   5.30pm:  My Twitter list of people tweeting from Bangkok is still buzzing, and worth checking out. Obviously not all reports will be completely accurate but it offers a fascinating picture of what&apos;s going on.  Get in touch @adamgabbatt if you&apos;ve any suggestions of people I can add.  5.42pm:  A journalist called Igor Prahin has been updating his Flickr stream regularly today with shots of burning buildings in Bangkok. His series of photographs titled Bangkok on Fire is particularly impressive.  6.00pm:  That&apos;s it for today, thanks for reading and for all your comments. Our main news story has just been updated with details of today&apos;s events, and keep checking back on the site for more information.

So while the Global Reporting Initiative&apos;s (GRI) annual conference is not exactly the highlight of the annual social calendar, it is interesting to note that it has just sold out the week before it kicks off. That means that Amsterdam will be awash with 1,100 sustainability practitioners, consultants, academics and the like. In line with the previous two years, the Guardian has been invited to present. I will be talking at two sessions on Thursday 27th, the first being the role of media in shaping the future of a transparent economy. Later that morning I will be on a panel discussing the future of stakeholder engagement using interactive technology. At the session on the media, we will be be seeking to answer two questions: What is the role of the media in fostering transparency and accountability for sustainable development and how is it changing? Secondly, while the media encourages transparency and accountability of others, how transparent is it on its own sustainability impacts? On the first question, it is clear the media plays a powerful role in providing information and fostering debate. The distance that needs travelling to a truly sustainable society is so immense that most people find it difficult to even get their heads around how that would look, other than returning to some pre-industrial agrarian society, which we all know is not the answer. Giving voice to radical new ideas and starting to bring them into the mainstream debate will be critical. We don&apos;t yet have the answer, but people like Tim Jackson, in his book &apos;Prosperity Without Growth&apos; is starting to move us in the right direction. Anyway, let&apos;s see what comes out of the debate. On the second question, it would be fair to say that the media has trailed other industries in reporting on its impacts. While it has been happy to point out the failures of others, it has resisted turning the searchlight back onto its own behaviour. While we at the Guardian like to think we have blazed a trail in this area, we are aware of how few media companies around the world have followed us down this path, although in the last few years that has started to change. As I have mentioned in a previous blogpost, the Guardian is one of several media companies and other interested groups which are currently working on creating a GRI media sector supplement. At the heart of the debate so far is to what extent the media is unique in the sense that its core product, its content, or brainprint, is almost impossible to measure and report on because it is largely intangible. The week after the GRI conference, the media supplement group is meeting to try to deal head-on with this thorny problem. The Media CSR Forum in the UK did not find a satisfactory answer when it looked into this issue a couple of years ago, being unable to create a common reporting framework given the sector is so broad, incorporating as it does, everything from newspapers, radio, and TV to the internet and video games. The hope is that the GRI team, who think we are not so far different to other industries that have cracked this problem, will help us to get us out of this particular hole. A bit later this year our ruminations will be put out to public consultation and I will obviously highlight this on our website to encourage as many responses as possible. The other debate at the GRI conference, on the role of technology, is equally fascinating, given that it renders obsolete old forms of thinking and acting. What I think we can all be clear on is that old-style reporting is dead, and that companies will increasingly have to accept that the future is interactive. While many fear the walls crumbling down, there is a small but growing number of companies who are starting to engage. The panel is being chaired by Bill Baue, Co-Director of Sea Change Media, who has just co-written a report on the subject along with Marcy Murninghan, of Harvard Kennedy School of Government in the US. What they see ahead is a revolution in the way that companies will need to interact with their stakeholders that will transform long-held notions about the boundary of the firm, and, with that, an evolution in the concept of who is &quot;inside&quot; and who is &quot;outside&quot; the organisation.  They conclude: &quot;If current trends continue, interactive technology and corporate accountability will evolve independently toward deeper engagement and customisation. Greater promise, however, resides in weaving the two together to mutually reinforce their common roots in engagement and interaction. The Accountability Web holds the potential to transform traditional relationships, with companies and stakeholders now collaborating to solve problems and generate constructive new ideas and solutions that neither easily could imagine on their own.  &quot;More broadly, the convergence of concerns regarding corporate sustainability, accountability, and ethics with the rapid growth and use of interactive technologies can help to bolster existing checks and balances on companies. It can help to bind the immediate concerns of share owners and other stakeholders whose assets or welfare are at risk to the broader claims of the public interest, thereby contributing towards a rebuilding of trust in capital markets. By fostering an ethic of transparency, accountable performance, adaptation, and renewal, the Accountability Web also can play a role in connecting economic enterprise more directly with social, environmental, and moral needs in the 21st Century.&quot; Heady stuff!

But symbolic of what? For Thabo Mbeki, who as South African president was at the forefront of the bid to host the tournament, this is the moment when Africa finally arrives on the global stage. In African Soccerscapes: How a Continent Changed the World&apos;s Game, one of a number of recent books celebrating &quot;Africa&apos;s&quot; World Cup, Peter Alegi quotes the letter Mbeki sent to Fifa&apos;s president, Sepp Blatter, setting out his country&apos;s ambitions: &quot;We want, on behalf of our continent, to stage an event that will send ripples of confidence from the Cape to Cairo . . . We want to ensure that one day historians will reflect upon the 2010 World Cup as a moment when Africa stood tall and resolutely turned the tide on centuries of poverty and conflict.&quot; Even by the standards of the hyperbolic guff that always surrounds major sports events, this is setting the bar pretty high. In reality, sports tournaments rarely do much to transform the fortunes of the countries that host them \u2013 at least not for the better \u2013 let alone change the fate of whole continents. But they can tell us a lot about where power really lies. What the 2010 World Cup clearly shows is that Africa is now a serious player in the world of football. This represents a remarkable turnaround in a relatively short period of time. Africa had no real presence at the World Cup until 1974, when Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) became the first black African team to take part in the finals. (South Africa had planned to send an all-black team to Mexico in 1970, but that was vetoed on the same grounds as the plan to send an all-white team to England in 1966.) Zaire lost all three of their games, scoring no goals and conceding 14. In Brian Glanville&apos;s The Story of the World Cup, now in its fifth edition for 2010, Zaire barely get a mention, apart from Glanville noting that Scotland should have beaten them by more than 2-0, but the Scots wilted in the heat. Yet the African team&apos;s real mark on the tournament was made during their match against Brazil, when the Zairean defender Mwepu Ilunga ran out of a defensive wall at the sound of the referee&apos;s whistle to boot away the ball that had been placed for a Brazil free-kick, while the opposing players looked on with a mixture of amusement and horror. This became a defining moment for that long-standing clich\u00e9 of western football commentary: the charming &quot;naivety&quot; of African football. The players were assumed to be skilful, but hopelessly ill-disciplined and childish. When it was subsequently rumoured that Ilunga might have panicked because the Zairean dictator Mobutu had warned the team that if they lost to Brazil by 4-0 or worse he could not guarantee their personal safety (it was 3-0 at the time), this hardly helped the world to take African football seriously. Naivety, it was assumed, went along with deep and sometimes terrifying political consequences. These lazy assumptions persisted through the 80s and 90s, even as African teams started to win games and to suggest that they might one day even win the tournament. In 1990 Cameroon came within a few minutes of knocking England out at the quarter-final stage (in which case there would have been no tears from Gazza and perhaps no football boom on the back of them), before losing to two late penalties. David Goldblatt, whose superb The Ball Is Round (2006) remains the one indispensable guide to global football, simply records that &quot;in cup football the better team does not necessarily win . . . Cameroon were still the better team&quot;. But for Ron Atkinson, commentating on ITV at the time, the match confirmed that African teams were always likely to fall short at the highest level for all the traditional reasons \u2013 too excitable, not enough discipline. Lovely fellas, though. The fact that it is impossible to imagine someone like Atkinson commentating on this year&apos;s World Cup \u2013 especially not Atkinson himself, whose racist comments caught on an open mike a few years ago all but finished his career \u2013 is a sign of how far we have come. No one in their right mind would now dare to patronise African football or footballers, who include some of the best players to be seen anywhere (Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto&apos;o, Michael Essien). On planet football, Africa has become a force to be reckoned with, and South Africa 2010 is the ultimate symbol of this changing order. But still, the football world is not the same as the real world. For a tournament that is meant to signal how much has changed, there is still something curiously old-fashioned about the make-up of this year&apos;s World Cup finals. There will be six African teams taking part \u2013 Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and the hosts, South Africa \u2013 but the rest of the world&apos;s rising powers will almost all be absent. There is no China, who somewhat surprisingly failed to qualify, and no India, who as usual did not even come close. Indeed, of the BRIC countries, only Brazil will be there (Brazil are always there); Russia also missed out, in a play-off to little Slovenia. But nor will there be teams from many other of the world&apos;s most populous nations: no Indonesia, no Philippines, no Pakistan, no Bangladesh, no Vietnam, no Iran, no Iraq. If you add them all up, that&apos;s over half the world&apos;s population who will have to be supporting someone else&apos;s national team. Yet it is China&apos;s absence that is really noteworthy. This is an African tournament taking place without the continent&apos;s dominating force. Ironically, China had a much bigger presence at the Africa Cup of Nations, which took place in Angola earlier this year, than it will have at the World Cup. In Angola, it was the Chinese who provided the infrastructure (including building four new stadiums) in return for the usual raft of trade and mineral concessions. That probably offers a better glimpse of the future for the rest of the continent than anything that happens in South Africa this summer. By contrast, Fifa&apos;s showpiece still conjures up a vanished world in which Europe is at the heart of everything. This is not just because half of all the teams taking part are European. It&apos;s also because many of the leading South American players, and almost all the leading African ones, play in Europe. The fact is that the decaying powers of Europe remain the driving force behind the global game. Countries that are watching their real economies totter \u2013 Spain, Italy, England \u2013 are still sustaining vast, bloated football economies that fuel the planet&apos;s appetite for the sport. Africa is now a part of this money machine, but it has little or no control over it. As a result, this is a tournament shaped by, and for, the interests of the European elite. Having it in Africa means it&apos;s in the right time zone for European TV audiences. Having it in South Africa means that it&apos;s also got the right climate for European teams to thrive. Africa&apos;s first World Cup will also be the coldest on record \u2013 a genuine winter tournament for the winter game. The Europeans will be playing in conditions they feel comfortable in, staying in hotels they feel comfortable in, travelling to stadiums they feel comfortable in. Normally, home advantage, or at least continental advantage, is decisive in World Cup finals: Brazil is the only country ever to have won the tournament outside of its home continent (in Sweden in 1958 and South Korea in 2002). Therefore this should be Africa&apos;s moment, not just to host it but to win it. But that seems unlikely. Ivory Coast are currently the leading African fancies according to the bookmakers. But ahead of them are Portugal, France, Italy, Holland, Germany, Argentina, England, Brazil and Spain. Everything is being done to ensure that these teams will feel at home. However, the real obstacle to South Africa 2010&apos;s delivering on home advantage is the state of South African football itself. Were the tournament being held in, say, Nigeria, it&apos;s easy to imagine the home side romping to victory on a wave of local support and with the help of local conditions, as all the better-fancied sides wilted in their alienating surroundings. But those surroundings are one of the reasons why Fifa would never dream of holding a World Cup in Nigeria. South Africa will have passionate local support, but the comfortable setting means that the national team needs to be good to take advantage. Unfortunately, the team is not very good at all. The bookmakers rank Uruguay, Denmark and Serbia as more likely to win than the home nation. Instead, they risk becoming the first home side ever to fail to make it out of the group stages. Why has the hosting of the World Cup not done more to galvanise South African football? The answer, which is touched on by Steve Bloomfield in his entertaining travelogue Africa United: How Football Explains Africa, says a lot about why the transformative dreams of Thabo Mbeki are likely to be disappointed. During the apartheid years, South African football was treated as a &quot;black&quot; sport (though many whites played), in contrast to the exclusively &quot;white&quot; sports of cricket and rugby. That meant it was starved of resources, but it also meant that it had a great deal of autonomy, because the South African government was happy to let it organise itself. It&apos;s the autonomy that has subsequently been the problem. The South African Football Association (Safa) got used to treating itself as a state within a state. As a result, increasing resources have tended to be squandered by a deeply inefficient and corrupt organisation. &quot;It&apos;s jobs for life at Safa,&quot; Bloomfield is told. &quot;There is no accountability \u2013 it&apos;s nonexistent.&quot; The prospect of hosting the World Cup hasn&apos;t sorted this problem out. It&apos;s just made it worse. The great hope behind holding big sporting events in developing countries is that the glare of international publicity will drive the process of reform. But it doesn&apos;t work like that, because the incentive structure is all wrong. Corruption tends to become more entrenched, since everyone knows that only two things are certain: first, there will be plenty of money washing around, and second, everything will have to be finished on time, come what may. So rather than reform, the local organisers hold out for short-term injections of funds, often to bail them out of crises of their own making. The Athens Olympics of 2004, which may in the long run have helped to bring the global financial system to its knees, is the role model here. The Greek economy wasn&apos;t bankrupted by the cost of hosting the games. But Greece&apos;s promises to reform its way of doing business, to meet the criteria of euro membership, had to be put on hold in the desperate rush to get the facilities built on time. An unbreakable deadline, with the world watching, means more backhanders being paid, not fewer, more black-market labour, more dodgy accounting practices, more skimming off the top. Hosting the Olympics made Greece more Greek. The 2010 World Cup is unlikely to shake global capitalism to its foundations, but it is following a familiar pattern. Very recently Fifa injected an emergency $100m into Safa, to ensure training facilities are ready on time. The stadiums are magnificent, but as Alegi shows, most of the employment generated to build them has been short-term contract labour. There is little evidence of what their lasting legacy will be: so far, all that an event that has generated $3.3bn in revenue for Fifa has produced for grassroots football in South Africa is 27 artificial pitches. The stadiums themselves will probably have to revert to rugby or cricket to pay their way. A lot of people are going to become very rich as a result of the tournament. But once it is over, it&apos;s going to be hard for most South Africans to know where all the money has gone. In Why England Lose, and Other Curious Football Phenomena Explained, Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski describe why big sports tournaments rarely give the host country the economic boost that the organisers always promise \u2013 all those extra tourist dollars and investment benefits simply don&apos;t materialise. What these events do achieve is a short-term boost in national happiness \u2013 for a few months, people are cheered up by having something to distract them. Is that what South Africa needs? &quot;About a third of all South Africans live on less than $2 per day,&quot; Kuper and Szymanski drily note. &quot;These people need houses, electricity, holidays, doctors.&quot; Yet the perennial problems of spreading the wealth of vastly lucrative sporting events does not, by itself, explain why South Africa hasn&apos;t got a better national team. In 1996, in the first flush of the post-apartheid era, the country hosted and won the Africa Cup of Nations, which seemed to promise glory days ahead. The game began to prosper at the local level. But the problem is that South African football prospered too much at the local level, at least relative to the rest of the continent. It now represents one possible model of football development: the corporate model, where home-sponsored teams support a functioning league system, and home-grown players have an opportunity to make a living in their own country. The majority of the South African squad play in their own Premier League, for teams such as Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns. The league is competitive but also almost certainly corrupt \u2013 there was a major match-fixing scandal in 2004, which led to plenty of arrests but very few convictions. It has produced almost no internationally recognised players. South Africa now has a good enough league system to maintain the national game, but not a good enough one to improve it. The other model is the one that holds in the rest of Africa, including in more successful footballing nations such as Ivory Coast and Ghana. This is the raw free-market system of human trafficking, where entrepreneurs set up football academies to train up young African players and then trade them on to clubs in Europe. As Bloomfield describes, there are now hundreds of these academies scattered across Africa, and governments in weak or failing states often welcome their presence since they offer facilities and opportunities that the states can no longer provide themselves. They also offer players the prospect of serious riches if they can find their way to the top European sides. This is the route that most members of the Ghanaian and Ivorian national teams have taken. Both squads consist of players who play almost exclusively in Europe. The superstars \u2013 Drogba, Essien, the Tour\u00e9 brothers, Kolo and Yaya \u2013 make very considerable fortunes by European standards, and unimaginably vast ones by African standards. The fruits of this system will be on display at the World Cup, but so will its pitfalls. The best African teams have to be put together from players who are scattered more or less at random across Europe and often have few links back home. Some places get lucky and produce a small nexus of superstars: this is often because the arrival of one outstanding player breeds interest from agents sniffing around for the next big thing. But success also breeds greed and corruption, and leads the caravan to move on to look for untapped (and cheaper) sources of talent. Almost nothing gets put back into the infrastructure of the African game, so no country can plan for the future. Ghana could win this World Cup if the team had any halfway decent strikers, but Ghana has become known for its midfielders, so that&apos;s what the system has produced. African countries have to make do with what the rich world wants to extract from them. But there is another side to this system that will not be on display in South Africa. The vast majority of African players do not end up as superstars at Chelsea or Barcelona. They arrive in far-flung corners of Europe and then move around, traded for small sums by cash-strapped clubs looking for value. They are what Alegi, in African Soccerscapes, calls the lumpenproletariat of professional football, with few rights, fewer privileges and no security. Many arrive very young (in 2003 the average age of African imports to European leagues was 19, compared with 24.5 for imports from elsewhere in Europe) and wind up in deeply unfamiliar places where racism is still rife and the climate is often uncongenial. African footballers now make up the majority of professionals in Romania, and more than a third in countries such as Switzerland and Ukraine. In 2006, over a fifth of all transfers between European clubs were of African players. Cheap African labour is the now the staple diet of the lower reaches of the European game. Some of the more responsible clubs have tried to buck this trend. Ajax of Amsterdam have set up a feeder club in South Africa to try to produce players for their own first team in a more responsible and less exploitative way. But so far it does not appear to have worked \u2013 the general mediocrity of the South African league seems to be holding them back. Instead, the more exploitative system practised elsewhere on the continent suits the trend in world football, which is towards an ever greater focus on the tiny elite of superstars and super-rich clubs at the expense of the rest. Football is an increasingly individualistic game, in which clubs can make vast sums out of the image rights and merchandising of their best-known players (it is said that Ronaldo has already earned back the \u00a380m Real Madrid paid Manchester United for him in just this way), much of it from Asia. Africa offers the possibility of finding such stars for next to nothing. It is treated as a potential goldmine, which suggests that not so much has changed after all. All this is hard to square with Mbeki&apos;s hopes for a South African World Cup. Fifa is determined to put on a good show, and the expectation is that we will see the best of Africa, or at least Fifa&apos;s definition of it: an efficient, well-organised event that need frighten none of the sponsors or merchandisers or money-men for whom the game now exists. The facilities will be ready on time, the contractors will have been paid off, the corruption will have been swept under the carpet. There will be plenty of local colour and no doubt lots of attractive football. New superstars will be born, some of them African, maybe even some of them South African, whom the European clubs will snap up once the tournament is over. There will be a vast audience in Asia for the matches, among fans whose interest is not in any particular country but in seeing the stars of the European leagues, the Ronaldos, the Rooneys, the Drogbas. In the African countries that have a chance of doing well in the tournament there will be huge excitement and scenes of euphoria, which Fifa and the world&apos;s media will milk for all they are worth. Then, when it is over, Fifa will feel it has done its bit for Africa. No one\u00a0will be left in any doubt that the world now takes African football seriously. But the real power lies elsewhere. On the rotation policy, the tournament is due to come back to the continent in 2026. But there is already talk that by then India will be ready to make a bid.", "sentences": ["Ajax of Amsterdam have set up a feeder club in South Africa to try to produce players for their own first team in a more responsible and less exploitative way."], "title": "2010 World Cup: Is Africa football's unheralded star?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/22/football-south-africa-world-cup", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Africa Cup of Nations", "South Africa", "Football politics", "Culture", "South Africa", "Books", "Africa", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-24T23:06:02Z", "article": "It&apos;s been the most phenomenal 10 days of my life,&quot; Eoin Morgan says blissfully as he tries to absorb the reality that, as a cricketer born and raised in Ireland, he has just helped England to win the Twenty20 World Cup and, even more stunningly, been called into his adopted country&apos;s Test squad to face Bangladesh at Lord&apos;s this week. &quot;I&apos;ve not really got over it because everyone dreams of lifting the World Cup. But the Test call-up feels even more incredible.&quot; We first met at The Oval last Thursday, when Morgan was still lost in the jubilation of winning the World Cup the previous weekend and trying to motivate himself for a Clydesdale Bank 40 group match between Middlesex and the Netherlands in Amsterdam three days later. It was striking then that Morgan should stress how much he prized Test cricket over the Twenty20 and 50\u2011over formats in which he has made his name this past year. But he appeared equally realistic when arguing that his only chance of forcing himself into England&apos;s Test side was &quot;through sheer weight of runs in county cricket&quot;. Now, however, in sparkling sunshine at Lord&apos;s, he can hardly believe what has happened. &quot;I was at home in Finchley on Saturday morning and I got a call from Geoff Miller [England&apos;s chairman of selectors]. When I saw his name on my phone I thought he was checking something routine. But he then said: &apos;I&apos;ve got some good news for you.&apos; I was thinking, &apos;What could that be?&apos; I didn&apos;t have a clue.&quot; Who was the first person to hear from Morgan that he is set to become a Test cricketer this week \u2013 despite not having played a first class match for nine months? &quot;I told my best friend, Sean from Liverpool, who was in the house when I got the call. He was as gob-smacked as me \u2013 utterly delighted but really surprised.&quot; Morgan makes it sound as if there is no comparison between the weighty significance he attaches to Test cricket and the more fleeting exuberance of being a Twenty20 World Cup winner. &quot;It&apos;s huge for me,&quot; he says of his dizzying elevation. &quot;Even more than making it in Twenty20 or 50\u2011over cricket my real ambition has been to become a Test player. For me Test cricket is the ultimate. It&apos;s very rare that you get a chance to play in a Test and that&apos;s what makes it so special and prestigious.&quot; It is also uniquely challenging and the conundrum surrounding Morgan&apos;s selection is whether his icy temperament and ingenious batting can overcome his paucity of experience and success outside limited-over cricket. In some ways his remarkable eye and bold innovations at the crease are reminiscent of the methods that propelled Kevin Pietersen into the Test arena just before the 2005 Ashes. But Pietersen had already played some substantial longer innings and his talent was forged in South African cricket. Morgan&apos;s past is much more idiosyncratic. His entire career has also been channelled into developing an aptitude for one-day cricket. As a consequence he has often struggled in the four-day game, even in the second division of county cricket with Middlesex. Last season was notably disappointing. &quot;I did battle and felt a bit low,&quot; Morgan concedes. &quot;We were struggling as a team and that didn&apos;t help. But I don&apos;t think I was mentally well-prepared enough. The only high point was when I got 140 against Northampton.&quot; He averages 36 in first\u2011class cricket, after 48 games, a modest record that would normally not have brought him anywhere near Test consideration. His World Cup excursions, and before that his stint in the Indian Premier League, mean that Morgan&apos;s most recent first-class match was against Glamorgan last August \u2013 when he scored 16 and 17. How can he compensate for that lack of four-day cricket? &quot;I don&apos;t think it will be a problem. I feel really good about my game and I&apos;m in a great place mentally. I&apos;m still only in a 12-man squad but, if I play, I think it will be important to keep it simple and stick to a plan. I can&apos;t get carried away.&quot; Morgan has played some innings whose brilliance and tenacity should not be disparaged just because they unfolded in a limited-overs format. Anyone who saw him score 85 off 45 balls against South Africa at the Wanderers last November would not have been surprised that he used the same audacious technique against the seriously quick Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel when driving England to another win in the World Cup. His most recent innings against Bangladesh might seem even more pertinent this week. In early March England were in danger in Dhaka, on a turning wicket and in front of 30,000 expectant Bangladeshi supporters, but Morgan responded with a masterly display. Holding his nerve and playing with precision and imagination, he hit a century which secured England a series victory that, until he arrived at the crease, looked unlikely. Even more impressively Morgan remained composed throughout and did not even celebrate his maiden century for England. &quot;I honestly didn&apos;t even know when I got my hundred,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;The scoreboard was playing up and even the runs we needed to win weren&apos;t being updated. But I was so focused on what we needed it didn&apos;t matter.&quot; Morgan can resemble a whirring computer as he calculates the tightest of run chases; and it bodes well for his transition to Test cricket that he should be so deeply concentrated. Alongside Pietersen he was England&apos;s best batsman in the World Cup but Morgan highlights a cohesive team display. &quot;It&apos;s remarkable how we did it. We didn&apos;t just sneak over the line but we were in charge all the way through. It was only really against Ireland [in a rain-affected group game when England were saved by Morgan against many of his friends and former teammates] that we looked a little troubled. For the rest we were decisive and clear. &quot;It started from the moment we arrived in the West Indies and the first thing Andy Flower said to us was, &apos;We&apos;re here to win the World Cup \u2013 if we do anything less, we should be very disappointed.&apos; And we believed him because we&apos;re a quality side. We weren&apos;t fazed by anything and we stuck to our game all the way to beating Australia convincingly in the final.&quot; It all sounds very un-English, especially when set against some calamitous collapses in the past. Last June Morgan made his Twenty20 debut for England in the opening match of the 2009 World Cup against the Netherlands at Lord&apos;s. England lost, disastrously, to the Dutch part-timers. &quot;It seems a hell of a long time ago,&quot; Morgan says. &quot;I scored six and wasn&apos;t picked again in that tournament. We were devastated \u2013 especially because we had been played off the park.&quot; What has happened over the past 11 months to turn England from a joke team in limited\u2011overs cricket to world champions? &quot;It&apos;s down to confidence. A lot of belief has grown \u2013 especially in our batting. We&apos;ve tried to be positive and aggressive and some very good cricketers have been called into the side. But actually, in that last World Cup, we were quite unlucky to get knocked out. I think our bowling in that tournament was even better than in this month&apos;s World Cup. But we didn&apos;t have the confidence in our batting \u2013 or such a clear-cut strategy.&quot; England regained the Ashes last summer but their limitations in 50\u2011over cricket were exposed immediately afterwards \u2013 losing 6-1 to Australia in a series which marked Morgan&apos;s first sustained run in the team. &quot;It was humbling,&quot; he says. &quot;We were outplayed in all areas. We hit a massive low and there was only one way to go. But over the last seven months we&apos;ve come a long way. The big turning point was in the Champions Trophy in South Africa when we beat some good teams and reached the semi-finals [last October]. You could feel the confidence growing and then in the winter we beat Pakistan, who were Twenty20 world champions, in Dubai. We started to believe we could beat anyone.&quot; Morgan confirms that England celebrated mightily the weekend before last but he also admits that &quot;mentally, the World Cup took a lot out of us. It was quite draining.&quot; England&apos;s Test team will be considerably fresher, and led by Andrew Strauss, Morgan&apos;s Middlesex team-mate, who had a restful winter. Morgan himself will be fuelled by adrenaline and his weariness after a heady 10 days should be easily overcome. &quot;It also helps that my family are coming over. They were on the edge of their seats watching the World Cup on television and they&apos;re totally chuffed.&quot; Morgan explains that his family have been playing cricket for four generations and that Rush, his home suburb in north Dublin, &quot;has always been mad about the game. I&apos;ve never quite worked out why but people in Rush just like cricket. I was helped by the fact that my dad is a cricket fanatic and that my three brothers and two sisters all played. It&apos;s just part of our family.&quot; A Lord&apos;s Test debut will seem even more poignant for the 23-year-old. &quot;London has become a real home. I came to Middlesex nearly seven years ago and I remember my first year when I lived with an old lady in Finchley. She looked after me and gave me a home from home. I&apos;ve never forgotten them fry-ups she made \u2013 the mushrooms were amazing. I&apos;ve kept in touch and I know she&apos;ll have been following me in the papers. I&apos;ve lived in Finchley ever since then and I just feel so happy here.&quot; On Thursday Morgan will be even more elated \u2013 and his determination to succeed could also make him England&apos;s most astute selection since Pietersen was picked to play ahead of Graham Thorpe in 2005. &quot;It&apos;s down to me now,&quot; Morgan says, before rushing away to join his Test team-mates. &quot;I want to prove that this is where I belong.&quot;", "sentences": ["But the Test call-up feels even more incredible.&quot; We first met at The Oval last Thursday, when Morgan was still lost in the jubilation of winning the World Cup the previous weekend and trying to motivate himself for a Clydesdale Bank 40 group match between Middlesex and the Netherlands in Amsterdam three days later."], "title": "Eoin Morgan sees England Test debut as pinnacle after one-day heroics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/25/eoin-morgan-england-interview", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Eoin Morgan"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-25T17:41:16Z", "article": "     Carol Davis first moved to the Rose Hill estate in Oxford in 1949, she had her wedding reception in the estate&apos;s community centre and has done voluntary work there ever since.

These surreal sights are just some of the spectacles created on the estate by Amsterdam-based artist Maria Pask for her film called D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. The film was commissioned by the Modern Art Oxford gallery and is the latest in an ongoing Art In Rose Hill programme in which contemporary artists work closely with the estate&apos;s residents. Other projects have included Sarah Kenchington&apos;s Sound House, which saw a condemned semi turned into a giant musical instrument, and an art-based drop-in group for male carers, called Saturdads. Funding for the projects comes from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and Oxford city council. The estate expanded in the 1950s and 60s, housing workers from the nearby Morris car factory in Cowley. Today, there is a primary school, two convenience stores and a community centre. Inspiration for Pask&apos;s film came from the Roundabout, a community newsletter published and written by Davis&apos;s car-worker and union activist father, Norman Brown. Pask discovered a box of the newsletters at Oxford&apos;s Bodean library and in them uncovered a vivid social document of community life. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu is a 72-minute collection of &quot;re-imaginations of real-life events&quot;, performed by a mix of professional actors and local residents, such as a tiddlywinks competition and a tea dance. &quot;The feedback we&apos;ve had has been so positive,&quot; says Modern Art Oxford project manager Erica Burton. &quot;Each time I go to a residents&apos; meeting they are thrilled about the gallery&apos;s work on the estate. People are coming to visit the project and it is bringing back a sense of pride to the area.&quot; Beyond enhancing the reputation of the estate and getting residents to visit the gallery, the project has had other outcomes. Pask says: &quot;We brought out people&apos;s memories, they were happy to revive these things that happened in the past, and often said, &apos;Why don&apos;t we do it more?&apos;. Sometimes you need someone from outside to give a new or fresh view.&quot; And Davis is hoping the project will reawaken people&apos;s interest in the community centre. &quot;It&apos;s amazing how many people can live somewhere and not visit the community centre, but the tiddlywinks competition and the tea dance have opened their eyes,&quot; she says. \u2022 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and an exhibition of Rose Hill projects runs at Modern Art Oxford until 13 June.", "sentences": ["These surreal sights are just some of the spectacles created on the estate by Amsterdam-based artist Maria Pask for her film called D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu."], "title": "Estate sees contemporary art show roll into town", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/26/maria-pask-film-rose-hill-estate", "tags": ["Communities", "Housing", "Regeneration"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-05-26T14:35:23Z", "article": "Here&apos;s a quick list of some of the things Ryan Gander has produced over the years: a chess set, a new word, a children&apos;s book, jewellery, customised sportswear, glass orb paperweights and maps. Then there&apos;s the stuff that you&apos;d fully expect to find in a gallery: photography, films, drawings and sculpture. Gander&apos;s varied output keeps his imagination nimble. Often described as a storyteller as much as an artist, his work is packed with narrative prequels and subplots spun from cultural history and personal anecdotes. This is most overtly the case with the work that shot the Chester-born Gander to art-world attention: his Loose Associations lecture, first performed at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, when he was a student there in 2002. Gander&apos;s talk rambles from &quot;desire lines&quot; (imaginary paths across public spaces) to outlining fake furniture, touching on Christine Keeler&apos;s connection to Homer Simpson, Inspector Morse, morse code and much else en route. Often, though, Gander&apos;s stories are more secret. His Alchemy Boxes, begun in 2007, contain models of work by other artists, alongside personal items such as Truffaut DVD sleeves and books. Or so the wall text says. What does it all mean? Gander&apos;s convoluted puzzles never come with easy solutions. Bauhaus Revisited, one of the works shown when Gander was nominated for Becks Futures 2005, was a chess set based on Josef Hartwig&apos;s 1924 egalitarian rethink of the game, in which the shape of the pieces helped players understand how to move them. But Gander&apos;s version, carved from mottled brown-and-white wood, looked deliberately confusing. He invites us to take part in mysteries where the plot is ever-thickening. Why we like him: You Walk Into a Space, Any Space (2010) features a reproduction of Degas&apos;s Little Dancer Aged 14, but the bronze girl has escaped from her plinth to wreak havoc with a bunch of Bauhaus-inspired geometric objects scattered over the gallery floor. Give us a clue: Gander has a passion for figures such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes, who often make elusive appearances in his work. British actor Roger Lloyd-Pack, who stars in the artist&apos;s film Man On a Bridge, might be best-known as Trigger from Only Fools and Horses \u2013 but according to Gander, he has also played Holmes more times than anyone else.

Neither my passport nor my accent nor the fact that I had spent virtually my entire life in Britain qualified me, in this woman&apos;s eyes, as British. Since she appeared not to be persuaded by my honest answer that I was British I eventually explained that my family were originally from Pakistan, and this satisfied her. It was only after reading Who Are We?, Gary Younge&apos;s penetrating and provocative new book, that I realised the best response to her question would have been to turn the tables on my interrogator and demand to know where she was from. &quot;The more power an identity carries, the less likely its carrier is to be aware of it as an identity at all,&quot; Younge notes. &quot;Because their identity is never interrogated they are easily seduced by the idea that they do not have one.&quot; Among the great merits of Younge&apos;s book is that he reminds us \u2013 and them \u2013 of the falseness of that assertion. There\u00a0are few journalists better equipped to navigate this territory than Younge, not only because of his experience as a foreign correspondent for this newspaper but because his own biography demonstrates the fluid nature of identity. In the book he weaves his own story \u2013 the working-class son of a single mother from Barbados, who was raised in Stevenage and now lives in the United States \u2013 with powerful reportage from across the globe that reveals the changing nature of identity. There are fascinating tales, such as the black girl born to white South African parents and the son of a Jewish leader who was judged not to be Jewish. Younge correctly notes that identity is dependent not only on the individual but also the behaviour of the wider world. This helps explain why Barack Obama, the mixed-race son of the white mother who raised him, defines himself as black, and it is also a factor in the emergence of political Islamism across Europe. Younge cites compelling statistics that depict the weak position of Muslims in Britain: more than a third of Muslim households in Britain have no adults in employment, a third of young British Muslims leave school without any qualifications and those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent are eight times more likely to be victims of racial attacks on the streets than whites. That, coupled with what is happening to Muslims globally in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere helps explain, Younge suggests, the growth of Islamic identity among young Muslims: &quot;Muslims will be more likely to organise around their religious identity both home and abroad, so long as they feel attacked as a result of that religious identity.&quot; This, surely, is only part of the explanation. After all, the first generation of Muslims who came to this country suffered far more discrimination and yet they expressed far less hatred towards this country than some young Muslims today. Indeed they often urged their children towards education precisely so that they could prosper in this country. Moreover, the biographies of many British jihadi terrorists reveal that they were not especially the victims of discrimination. Thus the question of why some young Muslims assert a form of religious identity that runs counter to a British identity cannot be simply about economics or racism: it has to also be about a weakened sense of what it means to be British. Islam is a potent potential identity precisely because it offers clarity at a time when no one is quite sure what Britishness is. Younge is, of course, right that identity is formed in the crucible of politics and economics, but identity is also about having a sense of belonging, and that is not measured in pounds and pence; it is about having a stake in a country, feeling that it is a home and realising that the myth of return to the motherland is likely to remain only a myth. There is a lovely passage in the book which demonstrates how that sense of belonging can be subtly transmitted when Younge describes buying his nephew and niece England football tops emblazoned with David Beckham&apos;s name. Younge ends his book with a plea that we search for a common higher ground that lies beyond our conflicted and confused identities. To reach this promised land he suggests the familiar routes of greater equality and more democracy. That common ground would be likely to be reached sooner, I would suggest, if we had more in common with those who we elect to power. Of the 23 members of the new cabinet, 22 are white, 18 are millionaires, 15 are Oxbridge graduates and 13 went to private schools. It is not just those who run the country who are overwhelmingly from this background, but the media too. It is hard not to reflect on the privileged clique and conclude that although the world is becoming ever more mixed up, and identities ever more complicated, the identities of those in power are the same as they ever were.

This issue came up again the other day at the Global Reporting Initiative conference in Amsterdam in a session in which I was talking.  I have tended to brush these criticisms of the media aside, arguing that the vast majority of businesses are tinkering around the edges at a time when Rome and the rest of the world is very much in danger of burning. On that basis, it&apos;s not surprising that the media does not laud new initiatives, given they rarely represent a fundamental change in doing business and that Greenwash is very much still in evidence. Yet I paused for reflection after hearing the closing speech at the conference by the new head of Greenpeace International who spoke with passion about why he has decided to work in partnership with companies rather than only criticise them from the outside. Greenpeace is a powerful force for change but how best to wield that power? Kumi Naidoo, who is now six months in the job, spoke about his recent experience at the World Economic Forum. In his previous job he had had very little luck trying to see any CEOs at the annual gathering but was literally inundated in his capacity at Greenpeace to such an extent that he had to turn many business leaders away because he just ran out of time. When he asked one CEO why this was the case, the man replied something to the effect that companies would rather sit round the dinner table with Greenpeace than be on its &apos;menu.&apos; There is a price to pay for Greenpeace&apos;s engagement. Many members were none too plussed by seeing Naidoo pictured with Coca Cola executives after working with them to agree to eliminate HFCs in their coolers and vending machines. But Naidoo argues that given we have 65 months left to reduce carbon emissions before climate change starts to become irreversible, we have to work in collaboration in order to bring about the level of change that is needed. For evidence he points to the fact that several major companies followed Coca Cola&apos;s lead. The question is whether the media should be thinking along the same lines? I think that there is a case to be made that the media should take a more textured approach and start to give a little more leash to those companies that are making a genuine attempt to move towards a more sustainable footing. After all, we need to devise a radical new economic model and while these initial steps by corporates are unlikely on their own to get us there, they do represent the first and necessary step on that journey. The list of companies that are genuinely embedding new thinking and innovation into their operations is starting to grow and there are new names to add to the oft-repeated &apos;leaders&apos; such as Unilever and Marks &amp; Spencer. I interviewed the European head of sustainability at PepsiCo a few days ago and wrote a long interview that was generally supportive of their approach, because having met the people involved, I sense a genuine attempt to change their business model for the better, both in terms of the health of their products and their environmental impacts. At the same time, I am not so na\u00efve to fail to recognise that much of what they are doing is aligned with cutting costs, and that they are not yet taking more fundamental steps that may negatively effect either their cost base or their profitability. I was speaking at the GRI conference to Lara Toensmann, whom I did an MSc with a couple of years ago and is now doing sustainability training courses in Holland, and she suggested that there is a need to encourage companies, rather than complain every time they do something because it is not radical enough. She referenced the point that children are more likely to change their behaviour when their small steps are congratulated, and that if you criticise them, then they just lower their heads back below the parapet and go back to their bad old ways. Of course, it&apos;s a difficult comparison to make, because the corporate world has immense power, but behavioural change in a child may not be so different in principle from a business executive. What I do find a little hard to swallow is when companies positively expect to be lauded for taking the initiative. One delegate referred to some companies&apos; &quot;shameless&quot; parading of their sustainability-related activities at the GRI summit. I attended one session during which Mark Weick, from the Dow Chemical Company presented its sustainability credentials. This including quarterly reporting of their key emissions and a vision which describes success in terms other than just profit maximisation. So far so good. What I found a little difficult to swallow was when Weick positively crooned when he said that Dow would report on the good, the bad and the ugly, as though it were a revelation that a company would choose to publicly admit it was not whiter than white. Of course, from the company&apos;s perspective, it is probably a big deal because companies are so used to highlighting only the good, but from the outside it just looks like too little, too late. In fact, I asked Weick whether if an international court of justice for the environment were set up, how the company would plead on the basis that the facts of climate change have been known for decades and it is only now they are starting to take real action. To be fair to him, he did not duck the question and said the company would have to plead guilty, before pointing out that most other companies would have to do likewise. There is no doubt that companies are on a journey of change. When I started getting involved in the world of CSR around eight years ago, most businesses were still talking only of their community programmes. But we haven&apos;t got the luxury of waiting for companies to change at their own speed. It&apos;s fine to give positive support to those that are setting an example, but it is far more important to keep the pressure on the thousand upon thousand of companies that are still carrying on with business as usual. As Naidoo said, there is not enough time left to run a marathon. We may just have enough time for a sprint. Expecting companies to act on their own is similar to expecting an alcoholic to responsibly look after the wine cellar. The current financial crisis alone suggests that companies, left to their own devices, are more likely to damage society than to seek to heal it. But let us not also forget that businesses are full of individuals, who on the whole are good people who want the best for their families, communities and society. So it is clear that the system is at fault and the only way of turning that supertanker around is with government regulation. We need many more carrots and sticks in the form of regulation and tax measures if we are going to get the close to achieving the goal of a sustainable world. The issue about the relative roles of government, corporates and consumers in creating change will actually be the subject of discussion at the next Guardian Sustainable Business Quarterly Briefing being held later this month. Coming back to the role of the media, I would tend to agree with Naidoo, who says that just because Greenpeace supported Coca Cola on one initiative does not mean that it will not hold it to account for its other activities. So while the media could take a more active role in highlighting those companies that are making a difference, what is vital is that it maintains its independence to do what it does best; hold power to account, challenge the status quo and give a voice to the voiceless. So in that sense we need all the George Monbiots we can muster to constantly remind us of how long the journey ahead is and how little of it we have so far travelled.", "sentences": ["This issue came up again the other day at the Global Reporting Initiative conference in Amsterdam in a session in which I was talking."], "title": "Should the media be more supportive of corporate moves towards sustainability?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/blog/7", "tags": ["Sustainability: living our values", "Commercial", "Editorial"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-01T19:09:31Z", "article": "The London-based oil trader Trafigura faced criminal charges for the first time today, over the environmental scandal which caused international uproar last year and forced it to compensate thousands of Africans made ill by toxic waste. At the start of a trial in Amsterdam \u2013 at which Trafigura is accused of an initial attempt to get rid of the waste cheaply in the Netherlands \u2013 prosecutor Look Bougert told the court the company had put &quot;self-interest above people&apos;s health and the environment&quot;. He said Trafigura first tried to conceal how dangerous the waste was, then pumped it back on board its tanker and left the Netherlands with hundreds of tonnes of oil residue, contaminated with foul-smelling sulphur mercaptans and toxic hydrogen sulphide. Instead of paying for specialist disposal, Trafigura &quot;dumped it over the fence&quot; in Abidjan, the main port of poverty-stricken Ivory Coast in west Africa. &quot;Cheap, but with consequences,&quot; Bougert said. Trafigura lawyer Aldo Verbruggen said the charges were based on an unfounded moral judgment. He said: &quot;Trafigura is a company that takes responsible entrepreneurship very seriously.&quot; The Dutch charges, if upheld, could lead to a large corporate fine and prison sentences of up to six years for two relatively junior individuals, the tanker&apos;s Ukrainian captain, Sergey Chertov, and a London-based Trafigura employee, Naeem Ahmed. Evert Uittenbosch, director of the Dutch waste disposal firm Amsterdam Port Services, and the Amsterdam city authorities also deny charges of &quot;leaving dangerous waste in the hands of someone not qualified to process it&quot;. It has been ruled that the company&apos;s chief executive, Claude Dauphin, should not face personal charges. Nor does the prosecution cover the events after the tanker, the Probo Koala, left Amsterdam, and the subsequent dumping in Abidjan, which sent 30,000 people choking, retching and seeking medical treatment. Instead, the trial, which is expected to last two months, focuses on the relatively technical question of Trafigura&apos;s behaviour in Amsterdam when the tanker made its first attempt to dispose of the contaminated waste. The prosecution says it was misdescribed as routine &quot;slops&quot; from ordinary tank-cleaning. When the disposal company received protests from residents about the foul smell and demanded payment for specialist disposal, Trafigura was allowed instead to pump the waste back aboard and leave the port. It is illegal to export hazardous waste from a European location to be dumped in Africa. Trafigura gained notoriety last year when it hired British lobbyist Bell Pottinger, and libel lawyer Carter-Ruck, to threaten European media organisations which sought to investigate the firm&apos;s behaviour.

In its recommended reading section it naturally included Simon Schama&apos;s classic study of Dutch culture, The Embarrassment of Riches. But the author introduced this by explaining that before he was on television, Schama was a &quot;proper&quot; historian. What a snobby guidebook, I thought. The Embarrassment of Riches was published in the year I got my history degree. Prior to that, history seemed harshly divided between the British model of empirical political history (with its counter-culture of Marxism) and the more imaginative but &quot;very French&quot; ideals of the Annales school. Schama&apos;s book was unquestionably Anglophone \u2013 exhibiting his extraordinary English prose \u2013 yet liberated by new European, and anthropological, understandings of culture. It was, and is, a beautiful work. History writing has not been the same since \u2013 although all manner of jealousies stop the intellectual achievement of Simon Schama, as opposed to his fame, being honestly acknowledged. The Embarrassment of Riches is anything but conventional \u2013 and yet plays it straight in comparison with the twisting paths Schama then took. It is, after all, what it says on the cover: &quot;an interpretation of Dutch culture in the Golden Age&quot;. His next book, Citizens is a narrative of the French revolution \u2013 but often a joyously meandering one, journeying through byways of culture and memory. And Landscape and Memory reveals Schama as a genius of digression: it is simply a journey through what interests him. Much of what interests him is art, which is why he has remained very much at the forefront of my reading: his section on Anselm Kiefer is tremendous. Schama&apos;s abilily to weave cogent arguments out of striking anecdotes and pungent images has been imitated so widely that its originality might be forgotten until you actually compare his books with those of others. Most popular history books, in his wake, start with a great anecdote, or a compelling word picture \u2013 then collapse into a hundred pages of highly orthodox stuff, before dutifully wheeling out the next picturesque incident. Schama never does that. There are no safe moments in these books or his more recent ones \u2013 he alone creates a river, a fountain of narrative and interpretation. Television has been a relatively late element in his work: all the books I&apos;ve mentioned appeared before he made his BBC History of Britain.

Britain&apos;s largest &quot;zombie&quot; insurance fund manager, which buys up insurance funds that have been closed to new business, wants to move from a secondary listing to a premium listing to raise its profile and boost its share price. It is also keen to go on a buying spree next year, which will further cut the cost of managing the insurance policies. &quot;In due course, we believe that we will be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the consolidation of the closed life sector, thereby enhancing value for our shareholders,&quot; said chief executive Jonathan Moss. The company, the brainchild of pizza and pub entrepreneur Hugh Osmond, has reached a deal to remove contingent share rights that, if approved by investors, will clear the way for the group to obtain a premium listing on 5 July. It expects to be included in the FTSE&apos;s UK indices from September. Phoenix announced today that it had agreed to buy out the contingent rights held by two of its main shareholders, by swapping nine shares for every 10 contingent rights. These entitlements promised shares in the business if the share price hit a certain level. They were issued to private equity investors Osmond and Manjit Dale&apos;s buyout firm TDR Capital to compensate them for giving up 70% of their stakes in the group as part of a restructuring a year ago, when the firm was in financial trouble and was acquired by an Amsterdam-listed vehicle. Share re-rating At today&apos;s London share price of 632.5p, up 7p, the new shares are worth about \u00a3200m and Phoenix is set to have a market value of \u00a31bn following the capital restructuring, up from the current \u00a3840m. Phoenix hopes the premium listing will bring improved liquidity, wider analyst coverage and ultimately a re-rating of the share price, which it believes is undervalued The group has 6.5 million policyholders and \u00a369bn of assets under management. &quot;If we get this re-rating it will become much easier to think about acquisitions,&quot; said a spokesman. &quot;The closure to new business of much of the traditional life sector is not good news for millions of policyholders,&quot; said Ron Sandler, the chairman, who is also nonexecutive chairman of state-owned Northern Rock. &quot;There is a clear and growing need to consolidate such closed life funds so that they can be run off efficiently to deliver better outcomes for their policyholders. Phoenix is the natural home for these funds and the premium listing will accelerate our ability to bring this about. We believe this will benefit consumers, the industry and our shareholders.&quot; Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove welcomed today&apos;s deal. &quot;If passed by shareholders, it will leave a stock with a much simplified capital structure, delivering very strong cash flow.&quot; They said the likely impact is &quot;significant share price upside potential, due to a lower share count; and over the medium term, improved liquidity in the shares and, hopefully, a consequent re-rating&quot;.", "sentences": ["They were issued to private equity investors Osmond and Manjit Dale&apos;s buyout firm TDR Capital to compensate them for giving up 70% of their stakes in the group as part of a restructuring a year ago, when the firm was in financial trouble and was acquired by an Amsterdam-listed vehicle."], "title": "Phoenix's \u00a3200m restructuring deal paves way for full stock market listing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/04/phoenix-group-capital-restructuring-deal", "tags": ["Insurance industry", "London Stock Exchange", "Business", "Stock markets"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-08T15:32:47Z", "article": "Dutch voters are expected to elect their first liberal prime minister in almost a century tomorrow in an election dominated by the age of austerity looming over Europe. As in Britain and Germany, the liberals are tipped to prosper at the expense of the two big parties that traditionally command the centre-right and the centre-left in the Netherlands: the Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour (PvdA). Opinion polls indicate a triumph for the VVD, rightwing free-market liberals campaigning for swingeing public spending cuts, tighter rules on immigration and pragmatic scepticism towards the EU. The election was called a year early after the collapse of the Christian Democrat-led coalition in February over the presence of Dutch troops in Afghanistan. But neither the Afghan war nor the explosive issue of Muslim immigration has played a prominent role in the campaign, meaning the anti-Islamic populist Geert Wilders has failed to capitalise. Wilders and his Freedom party are nonetheless predicted to double their share of seats to 18 in the 150-seat second chamber in The Hague, while coming in fourth. Only a few months ago, he was being tipped to win the election. There was little doubt in The Hague today that Mark Rutte, the VVD leader, would be the new prime minister. In a highly fragmented proportional representation system, however, he will struggle to cobble together a coalition of the right. Tomorrow&apos;s vote will be followed by weeks, perhaps months, of horse-trading over possible coalitions. One big question is whether the maverick Wilders will be offered a cabinet seat for the first time. Rutte&apos;s party is predicted to get 36 seats. His logical coalition partner, the CDA, are polling at 24. They need 76 for a majority. Wilders&apos; seats would enable a majority for a rightwing coalition. Unlike in neighbouring Flanders, in Belgium, there is no cordon sanitaire erected by the mainstream around the extreme right, but the Dutch centre-right remains reluctant to go into government with Wilders. The Islam-bashing leader wants a total stop to Muslim immigration and mosque-building, and a tax on Islamic headscarves. He has offered tacit support in parliament for a VVD-CDA minority government in return for tough immigration policies. A similar arrangement exists in Denmark, where the far right props up a rightwing government. While Rutte looks certain to be the big winner, the main loser is expected to be the prime minister, Jan-Peter Balkenende. The CDA leader has headed three governments since 2002, all of which fell. The polls suggest a heavy defeat for his party, from 41 seats to around 23. The PvdA, under the new leadership of Job Cohen, the former mayor of Amsterdam, is also expected to lose a couple of seats. The election is the first national ballot among the 16 eurozone countries since the eruption of the Greek debt crisis, which then escalated into a full-blown single currency emergency. The campaign has highlighted the degree to which voters&apos; economic worries have hijacked the agenda. Rutte is promising spending cuts of \u20ac20bn (\u00a316.5bno) euros to balance the budget over four years from a deficit currently of almost 7%. In what has become almost routine in Dutch politics, he is also bashing Brussels, demanding, British-style, a slimming down of EU powers and their repatriation to member states, the possibility of British-style &quot;opt-outs&quot; from areas of EU legislation and a British-style big fight over the EU budget when it comes up for review from next year.", "sentences": ["The PvdA, under the new leadership of Job Cohen, the former mayor of Amsterdam, is also expected to lose a couple of seats."], "title": "Dutch poised to elect rightwing liberals as economic fears dominate", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/08/dutch-elect-rightwing-liberals-vvd", "tags": ["Netherlands", "The far right", "Politics", "Euro", "World news", "Geert Wilders", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-08T16:00:55Z", "article": "The question: Who&apos;s your favourite heretic? I can still remember the face of Rav Kauffman, the hapless Chasidic Hebrew teacher who made my Monday and Wednesday afternoons a torment when I was growing up in Philadelphia: bushy red beard, angry scrofulous red skin, and bright blue eyes above a veined, commanding nose and thin lips turned down in a permanent sneer of disdain. We were the sons and daughters of parents who had been raised as Orthodox Jews, and though unable entirely to keep the faith themselves felt compelled to subject their children to a similarly stringent religious education. Very few of our families observed the dietary laws, or refrained from using electric lights on the Sabbath. Because my father worked for a Jewish social service organisation and had all the religious holidays off we did spend a lot of time in synagogue \u2013 where even now I find I feel oddly at home. But apart from learning the Hebrew language, and a lingering familiarity with the first five books of the Bible, what we mostly were acquiring was a sense of our own shortcomings \u2013 and perhaps a certain defiance. G-d (as we were schooled to write the divine name) wanted us to abjure bacon, and shrimp cocktail, and cheeseburgers! \u2013 and not to drive to the movies on Saturdays. (As an adult I was amused to learn that apocheris, the Jewish word for an apostate, derives from the Greek &quot;epicure&quot;.) Yet we did all these things \u2013 in my case with great delight. And the world did not end. We weren&apos;t even expelled from the ranks of the faithful. So to learn that there had once been a Jew who, not because of any terrible deed, but merely because of what he wrote and thought, had actually been excommunicated \u2013 cast out from our people \u2013 that was impressive! Rav Kauffman was sadly unable to tell us exactly what Baruch Spinoza had done to warrant such extreme punishment. All we knew was that he was Dutch, and had asked too many questions. A couple of years ago I visited his parents&apos; grave in the Jewish cemetery outside Amsterdam. But I still don&apos;t know as much about this great transgressive thinker as I should \u2013 though Jonathan Israel&apos;s magisterial A Revolution of the Mind is on my summer reading list. While Spinoza remains the religious heretic for me, I can&apos;t say he&apos;s my personal favourite. Even among religious heretics I&apos;ve always been more drawn to the figure of Shabbatai Zevi, the 17th-century mystic who had much of the Jewish world convinced he was the messiah. Zevi&apos;s fame spread so widely, even among non-Jews, that the Ottoman sultan, who viewed Zevi as a threat to his authority, offered him the choice between a martyr&apos;s death or conversion to Islam. Zevi embraced Islam \u2013 and there the story as I&apos;d heard it in childhood ended. Actually there is a wonderful 1000-page account of all this by the great scholar Gershom Scholem. I&apos;ve always wanted to write a more accessible version of Zevi&apos;s amazing story, and perhaps one day I will. But since religion isn&apos;t such a big part of my life, my favourite heretics tend to depart from other kinds of received wisdom. I spent 18 years writing the biography of IF Stone, who although he described himself as a &quot;proud Jewish atheist&quot;, was a much more heretical figure in relation to the pieties of mainstream journalism. Practically single-handedly Stone exposed the lies behind Lyndon Johnson&apos;s escalation of the Vietnam war; he also defiantly insisted that the Soviet Union, far from being an all-powerful evil empire, was strangling under the weight of its own orthodoxies and deceits. This is still regarded as heretical by historians who like to credit Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan for &quot;winning&quot; the Cold War. Admirable as he was, Stone is not actually my favourite heretic. Politically I&apos;d prefer Emma Goldman, the anarchist who knew that personal and political freedom were inextricably intertwined. She may never have actually said &quot;If I can&apos;t dance I don&apos;t want to be in your revolution,&quot; but the sentiment is close enough to the life, and thought, of the feminist known as &quot;the most dangerous woman in America&quot;. And because there is more to life than politics, my personal favourite champion heretic would have to be Albert Einstein. Politically Einstein was impeccably radical \u2013 during the Truman/McCarthy Red Scare he urged &quot;the revolutionary way of non-cooperation&quot;, arguing that unless intellectuals refused to serve as informants they would fully deserve &quot;the slavery which is intended for them.&quot; But unlike those we usually think of as heretics, Einstein set himself against the workings of the physical universe.

Wilders&apos; Freedom party looked to have taken third place in a close-fought election which in the end was tied between rightwing free-market liberals and the centre-left Labour Party, according to the projections. Wilders, campaigning for a halt to Muslim immigration andmosque-building, and to a tax on Islamic head gear, increased his party&apos;s seats from 9 to 23, according to exit polls. The result is far better than predicted, but left Wilders trailing behind the rightwing liberal VVD party and the centre-left Labour Party who were said to take 31 seats each. Wilders is due in court later this year to face charges of inciting racism, Prime minister Jan-Peter Balkenende, leader of the Christian Democrats who have dominated for decades, was the big loser. His party was halved in parliament, from 41 to 21. He promptly resigned his party leadership and said he would not take his seat in parliament after leading the Christian Democrats to a historical low in the 150-seat second chamber in The Hague. The election was called a year early after the Balkenende coalition collapsed in February over disputes about participation in the war in Afghanistan. The deadlock left the shape of future government utterly unclear last night, and presaging weeks of haggling \u2013 it appeared that a four-party coalition would be needed to assemble a majority. Wilders is a potential kingmaker, with both the liberals and the Christian Democrats not ruling him out as a coalition partner. But the three parties together would barely muster half the seats, not a stable majority in a parliament split almost equally between right and left. Pundits predicted the core of a government would be a coalition between the two winners, the VVD led by Mark Rutte and Labour under the new leadership of Job Cohen, mayor of Amsterdam until earlier this year. The campaign was dominated by the economy and public spending, with the free-market VVD pledging fast and deep cuts and Labour urging a gradualist approach. A quick coalition deal between the two will be difficult. The VVD has notched up its best result. But the Netherlands has weathered Europe&apos;s crisis better than most, and voters appeared to get cold feet over the austerity urged by Rutte.

Then, to my alarm, I could see the visitor walking around the house looking through the windows. I hid under the dining room table. That afternoon Dr Schmidt, Christina&apos;s very frightening mother, came home from work and told me she&apos;d left her key behind and had needed to pick up some papers from the house. &quot;But you didn&apos;t hear me,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, I must have been in my room.

Suddenly I became overwhelmed with the need to retreat home, a 20-minute walk outside the village. I mumbled excuses and lurched away down the main road. As the village ended, I got the idea that the hippy might be following me. I deduced that he was going to attack me and started to panic. Loss of motor control meant every urgent step took me closer to the ground, until I was literally crawling on the road. He must be getting closer. I had a plan. I&apos;d roll into the ditch and he&apos;d walk past. I woke to sharp rays of sun and various insects making friends with my face.

That included holidays. I remember my poor brother being sent off to canoe down the entire length of the Thames with a cousin, when they were both just 12 years old. They had a miserable time, were almost murdered by some hooligans from Maidenhead, and neither has ever really recovered from the experience. I was allowed to wait until I was 15 for my first adventure. What are your plans for half term, I was asked. Dunno, I&apos;ll probably sit around watching TV and picking my spots, I said. Oh no you&apos;re not, you&apos;re going to hitchhike to the Lake District with a tent, you&apos;re going to camp, up in the mountains, for a week; and then \u2013 if you&apos;re still alive \u2013 you&apos;re going to hitchhike back again. The only consolation was that I too was allowed to take a cousin with me. And that&apos;s what we did. We hitchhiked the length of England, we camped (by Stony Tarn, I remember it well), we got cold and wet and scared, and couldn&apos;t afford to buy enough food. But, against the odds, we survived. I don&apos;t recommend it at all. If your parents try it, make sure you steal some money from them and at least stay in a Travelodge. Sam Wollaston is the Guardian&apos;s TV critic Tanya Gold: Stoned (and grounded) in Amsterdam My first holiday abroad without adults was with my boyfriend Matthew in 1990. We were suburban teenagers who were developing a love of hash. So of course we went to Amsterdam. When we arrived we jumped straight into a hash cafe. Look \u2013 menus! Of different kinds of hash! Three hours later we fell into the street, which now seemed to be upside down. And we set off for our lodgings, which were, catastrophically, at a friend of my mother&apos;s, whom I had known since babyhood. Aunty Michelle opened the door with her arms outstretched. Big hair. Big smile. Love. &quot;Hello!&quot; she shrieked, &quot;How are you?&quot; We both giggled at the big-haired apparition until tears leaked onto our shoes. Matthew fell over and slid down the wall. We were put to bed. I could hear Aunty Michelle on the telephone to my mother through the wall. &quot;Yes, they&apos;re here. I think they are stoned. Tanya&apos;s boyfriend fell over and slid down the wall.&quot; We were allowed out the next day, but we went back to the hash cafe. Look \u2013 menus! Of different kinds of hash! Outside, everyone seemed so busy. Matthew kept pulling me out of the way of trams and bicycles. We tried to go to museums, but it is hard to sightsee when the floor is on the ceiling. When I got home, I was grounded indefinitely. Tanya Gold is a writer for the Guardian Emma Kennedy: Campsite japes My mother, arms folded, had finally agreed to let me go to Cornwall after protracted negotiations during which she warned me that &quot;getting pregnant six months before your A-levels would be really stupid&quot;. When I pointed out that I was going away with my best friend (a girl) who couldn&apos;t make me pregnant, she relented. But only just. We had taken the train and arrived in Truro only to realise that neither of us was able to take any money out. We had \u00a320 to last four days. Getting our priorities right, we bought three two-litre bottles of cider and concluded we could live on that and possibly chips. We had arrived quite late at night and simply wandered onto the first campsite we could find. Except it wasn&apos;t a campsite, it was a caravan park from which we were turfed off the following morning. We ended up pitching the tent behind some bins in a field. We lived like tramps for the next three days. It wasn&apos;t quite the bucolic idyll we&apos;d been hoping for. Still, at least I didn&apos;t get pregnant. In fact, though, my first holiday without my parents was a school trip when I was seven to Cuffley Camp Outdoor Centre, near Potters Bar. I was stuck in a tent with four other girls, one of whom wet herself with anxiety within the first 10 minutes. I was unable to open my suitcase and decided that, rather than ask for help, I would just spend the week in the clothes I was standing in. With no adults around, the four of us entered into a lengthy discussion about the proper meanings of swear words during which our leader, Jane, proudly announced that a &quot;fuck means doing a poo&quot;. We believed her. Later that night, Jane grabbed me and told me to drag a lad called James up to the dreaded Night Toilet. She wanted to lock him in it. Seeing us slope off, a suspicious teacher stopped us and asked what we were doing. I looked up, panicked and said the first thing that came into my head, &quot;We&apos;re going to the toilet for a fuck, Miss.&quot; Emma Kennedy is the author of The Tent, The Bucket and Me (Ebury Press, \u00a310.99) Terry Alderton: The boys in Ibiza It was 1989, Marrs&apos; Pump up the Volume had changed music and acid house had kicked in. The Essex boys were 17 and on their way to the coolest place in the world, Cafe Del Mar, Ibiza. My friends had booked the holiday weeks before but I was under the thumb or, as my friends would have it, &quot;a love wank&quot;. A label that I could never get my head around, but strangely understood its connotations. At 11am on the actual day of the trip I gave in and went down to the travel agent (pre-internet days, you understand) and booked my summer of love. At the hotel I was sharing with Jeff, the kind of fella that would go out with a fiver in his pocket, get pissed, buy no one a drink, and come back with a tenner. First day in the sun I lay on the beach, surrounded by half-naked girls, believing that we were &quot;the nuts&quot;. I drifted off. My friends, knowing I was quite obviously burning, thought it funny to let me sleep. I awoke feeling a little sore. The moment my so-called mates fell about laughing is when I removed the round mirrored sunglasses I had been wearing as they had left two clear white rings around my eyes! That night I went out in jeans and waistcoat to Pacha and, of course, had to keep wearing the same sunglasses. We went onto Space at 9am to continue the party. At noon I&apos;d had enough and was sober enough to feel my sunburn again. But rather than wait 20 minutes for the next bus from Ibiza Town, I thought, sod that, and walked 17km along busy highways being tooted. When I finally arrived back at the hotel, all my friends were already there, sitting around the pool, even though I had left Space well before them.

I&apos;m surprised that no one asked if we were runaways since neither of us looked more than 12. One night we slept rough in Plymouth, but apart from that it was straightforward camping and walking. The weather was superb, the sea aquamarine. We had almost no money and lived on sandwiches and tea. In fact, one of the first things I learned was that a fire and a mug of tea can make the world seem right. Second thing: the amount of money spent does not alter the amount of fun to be had. What really counted was talking to people. I had to do lots of chatting, negotiating, entertaining, discussing and questioning. Travelling forced me to engage with strangers in a way that I had never done before, and I learnt to be far more self-reliant. Strangers, I discovered, could be very helpful and endlessly fascinating. They could also be dangerous, boring and stupid, or any combination of those three \u2013 it was up to me to evaluate and decide. I wrote it all down, which was a very good idea, but subsequently lost the notebook \u2013 which was not so clever. My advice is simple: avoid travel agents, tour groups and rabid animals, embrace the unexpected and enjoy the unplanned.

We took a cross-channel ferry and went camping in the Ardennes: a beautiful wooded part of Europe. We cooked badly, but it was then I that realised everything tastes wonderful under canvas, thanks to the fresh air ... and starvation. We walked a bit, but what we mainly did was drive around in circles playing music loudly. We didn&apos;t even mind that we were in deeply unexciting Belgium.

A suited man rests his head on one hand, his left elbow on the arm of his chair; he wears an inward stare of meditative immersion in the music. Next to him, a little girl sits on a low chair, feet tucked in beneath her. A couple are seen from the rear, sitting on a bench, the man&apos;s arm around his lady&apos;s shoulder. The musicians&apos; faces are hidden, but nevertheless, something in this picture communicates the poignant beauty of whatever they are playing, along with their audience&apos;s rapt attention. The clue to what sets this scene apart from the idyll it appears to be is that the suited man has the star of David sewn on his jacket. The people gathered for this intimate private concert are living in the ghetto of Terez\u00edn, or Theresienstadt, as their German captors called it; a former 18th-century garrison town in northern Bohemia, just north of Prague, which was commandeered by the SS in 1940 and transformed into a transit hub for the extermination camps, usually Auschwitz. This is music performed in the antechamber of genocide, soundtrack to the Shoah, as it happened. The image was drawn and coloured in watercolour by the hand \u2013 now wrinkled, but delicate and steady still \u2013 of Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. Now 82, Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 was 12 when she did this drawing. &quot;Maybe those two are myself and my father,&quot; she says of the figures on the left, with that charged, elegant detachment with which so many Holocaust survivors communicate. She lets on that &quot;I didn&apos;t know how to draw a violin, so I hid the instruments behind the music stands&quot;. All Nazi camps were diabolical, but Terez\u00edn was singular in ways both redemptive, at first, and later grotesque. It was the place in which Jews of Czechoslovakia were concentrated, especially the intelligentsia and prominent artistic figures, and, in time, members of the Jewish cultural elites from across Europe, prior to transportation to the gas chambers. And as a result \u2013 despite the everyday regime, rampant fatal disease, malnutrition, paltry rations, cramped conditions and the death of 32,000 people even before the &quot;transports&quot; to Auschwitz \u2013 Terez\u00edn was hallmarked also by a thriving cultural life: painting and drawing, theatre and cabarets, lectures and schooling, and, above all, great music. Among the inmates was a star pupil of Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek; another was one of the most promising composers from the circle of Arnold Schoenberg. &quot;Many of us came from musical families, and there were very great musicians among us,&quot; recalls Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. &quot;Each person was allowed 50 kilos of luggage and many of them smuggled in musical instruments, even though it had been forbidden for Jews to own them. So no wonder the beauty of music and art bloomed in that real-life hell. My father told me,&quot; she says, &quot;that whatever happens, we must remain human, so that we do not die like cattle. And I think that the will to create was an expression of the will to live, and survive, as human beings.&quot; Perhaps this is why Terez\u00edn has commanded surprisingly little attention compared with the infamous extermination camps: it is a complex story of dichotomies, a ghetto camp of which survivors have curiously happy \u2013 as well as nightmarish and painful \u2013 memories; Terez\u00edn was a place of resilience and art in defiance of death, and does not fit in to any simplistic narrative of the Third Reich or Holocaust. At first, after the ghetto was established and the first &quot;transports&quot; arrived on the 90-minute train journey from Prague, in November 1941, Terez\u00edn&apos;s cultural life sprang from the irrepressibility of the talent imprisoned there, in remonstrance of \u2013 and often in hiding from \u2013 the SS, which ran the camp. With time, the concerts, cabarets, plays, schooling and adult lectures came to be tolerated by the Nazis, as a means of pacification; then, around 1943, even encouraged. In 1944, the SS actually &quot;beautified&quot; the horror they had created at Terez\u00edn and invited the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the camp and see a performance of the children&apos;s opera Brundib\u00e1r, written by one of the camp&apos;s leading prisoner-composers, Hans Kr\u00e1sa. A propaganda film was made, entitled The F\u00fchrer Gives a City to the Jews, featuring the performance. But the shocking truth behind the film of the production of Brundib\u00e1r, which was applauded by the Red Cross, is that apart from two, all the children in the cast were sent, soon after the concert and photograph, to the gas ovens of Auschwitz. Out of some 15,000 children who passed through the gates of what is now a beautifully curated memorial in an uncannily lovely town, only 130 survived. Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 is one of them. &quot;There were four phases in the cultural life of Terez\u00edn,&quot; she says. &quot;First, that of great creative resistance; second, that of the Nazi toleration of the cultural life; third, the manipulation of our art by the Nazis; and finally, when it was all over, the mass killing of almost everyone involved.&quot; Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 is among the guests at an unprecedented series of events at London&apos;s Wigmore Hall next weekend, at which the ever-pioneering chamber music group the Nash Ensemble will perform music written in Terez\u00edn. Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1&apos;s drawings, done with materials stolen from the Nazi propaganda workshops within the camp, will be exhibited. Other survivors will join her to talk about suffering, death, art and the joy of music-making in Terez\u00edn. Films will be screened and presented by the director of one of them, Simon Broughton, a leading expert on world music. Next weekend&apos;s event is a landmark, not just in this year&apos;s cultural calendar, but in the long history of how and why the Holocaust should be forever taught. The views of those participating are articulate and passionate, summed up in a remark by the great aesthetic philosopher Walter Benjamin, who took his own life while a refugee from the Nazis: &quot;Every image of the past that is not recognised by the present as one of its own concerns is one that threatens to disappear irretrievably.&quot; Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 says: &quot;I tell the story of my life in Terez\u00edn and Auschwitz to children, because they know nothing about it, and they must know, so that it does not happen again.&quot; Simon Broughton hopes that the events will &quot;capture the entire narrative of cultural life in Terez\u00edn&quot;, in a comprehensive way which has, perhaps oddly, never hitherto been attempted in Prague, or, for that matter, New York or Berlin \u2013 places to which these performances really should proceed after next weekend. The series is the brainchild of the indefatigable Amelia Freedman, who founded the Nash Ensemble in 1964 and was for years director of classical music on London&apos;s South Bank. She describes next weekend as &quot;not an occasion about the Holocaust but about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. It is a chance to hear the work of composers who would have gone on to achieve heaven knows what had they lived. There are moments in the works when you wonder: &apos;Could this composer have become another Shostakovich or Stravinsky?&apos; If you look at the history of Czech music after the Holocaust, you see something that was in bloom just before the war, but which simply failed to materialise because it was cut down and killed, literally \u2013 the composers murdered.&quot; And there is another point, of extreme urgency: &quot;Some survivors are still with us to tell the story for themselves,&quot; says Freedman. &quot;Of course, we wish them a long life, but the truth is that this will not be possible much longer. Before long, we will live in a time, tragically, when it will be impossible to hear this horrific story, and about this creative resilience, first-hand. With them will die the first-hand accounts of these terrible events, and of the triumphs.&quot; Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 lives on the fourth floor of a drab but homely apartment block in the working-class Liben district of Prague. Climbing the four flights of concrete stairs that she still negotiates each day, I consider the fact that interviews with survivors of the Shoah, and in her case Auschwitz, are like no other. Charlotte Delbo, a French survivor and one of the greatest writers about life after Auschwitz, wrote a poem which communicates this truth beautifully: &quot;I came back from the dead and believed / this gave me the right / to speak to others / but when I found myself face to face with them I had nothing to say / because I learned over there / that you cannot speak to others.&quot; There may be no language for Auschwitz and the camps, but there is memory (or what the Holocaust scholar Lawrence Langer calls &quot;the ruins of memory&quot;) and there is survival. Delbo discriminates between two workings of memory among survivors: there is memoire ordinaire, which recalls the &quot;self&quot; of now, according to whom &quot;the person in the camp at Auschwitz is someone else \u2013 not me, not the person here facing you&quot;. Then there is memoire profonde, &quot;deep memory&quot; \u2013 according to which Auschwitz is not past at all, nor can it ever be. Between the two is a skin, says Delbo, which &quot;deep memory&quot; can sometimes pierce: &quot;The skin covering the memory of Auschwitz is tough,&quot; she writes. &quot;Sometimes, however, it cracks and gives back its contents.&quot; In interviews with Holocaust survivors one does not know personally, there can be no cracking of the skin. When one knows a survivor well, there can be talk of details and feelings at certain moments. Otherwise, these conversations are charged with code, understatement, omission and dignifying, self-protective detachment. When I reach the fourth floor, Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 stands in the already open doorway. The aura is immediate, her smile warm but wise, her paintings on the wall. &quot;I will, of course, not tell you every detail,&quot; she says, early in our conversation. &quot;I was surrounded by musicians all my life,&quot; she tells me. &quot;I was the only one who painted.&quot; Her father, Otto Weiss, was a pianist by passion and bank clerk by trade. Her late husband, J\u00edr\u00ed Ho\u0161ek, whom she married after the war (therefore taking the name Ho\u0161kov\u00e1), played double bass in the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra: there is a portrait of him on the piano in the apartment, the instrument being now, says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, &quot;just a memory&quot;. A picture of her granddaughter, Dominika Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, playing the cello adorns a bookcase. &quot;I was born in this apartment,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. &quot;It is not much, there are better places to live, but I belong here, my roots are here.&quot; It was from here that she was taken to Terez\u00edn in January 1942, and to here she returned in 1945. She talks of life leading up to Terez\u00edn; she painted a poignant depiction of her father writing a ledger of the family&apos;s possessions for confiscation by the Nazis, while her mother scours the drawers, as decreed after the occupation of 1939 and establishment of the Protectorate of Moravia and Bohemia, under the Third Reich. &quot;It happened slowly and with determination,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, who had been born a decade earlier. &quot;One thing after another was forbidden: employees lost their jobs, we were banned from the parks, swimming pools, sports clubs. I was banned from going to school when I was 10. I was always asking my parents, &apos;What&apos;s happening?&apos; and became angry at them if I thought they were trying to hide something, to protect me.&quot; Eventually, the apartment was allocated to a German family, and the Weiss family transported by railway cattle truck to Terez\u00edn. Once in the camp, young Helga Weissova was separated from her father to live in quarters with her mother, and later in a children&apos;s barracks. There she painted a picture of two children adorning a snowman, and smuggled it to her father in the men&apos;s barracks. His reply came in the form of a note: &quot;Draw what you see&quot;. It was an onerous instruction from father to daughter: make a record, use your talent to testify to the Holocaust, the extent of which no one in Terez\u00edn knew, even as the transports began, with trains &quot;to the east&quot;, as the prisoners of the ghetto put it. Her drawings, exhibited next weekend to accompany the music, compel on so many levels. In style, they resemble early work by the masterly war artist Edward Ardizzone: deft lines and colour wash, with an almost comic-like means of vivid narrative, with attention to vernacular detail. &quot;I think I saw things the adults didn&apos;t see,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. &quot;I loved to look at the buttons the ladies wore, the hats, the little things.&quot; So that when a party of elderly German Jews arrived to discover that they were not, after all, in the health spa which they had paid the Nazis to visit, Helga drew their fine hats and tailored coats. There are scenes of lice being removed, of washrooms, and even dark lavatory humour: there was no privacy in the filthy latrines, people forever barging through doors that would not lock, so that a lady had to try to keep the door shut while sitting on the toilet. The child painted disease, gaunt, drawn faces, she painted poignant gift cards: one for her parents&apos; wedding anniversary and another for the 14th birthday of a girl called Franzi, which shows the two of them together as babies, then as prisoners, and again in some projected future, pushing their babies in prams. Only the final chapter never came to be: Franzi was murdered in Auschwitz. But there is one drawing in the series which Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 calls &quot;the one&quot;. It shows children pushing a hearse loaded with loaves of bread and on it the word jugendf\u00fcrsorge \u2013 welfare for young people. &quot;The picture encapsulates the wretched life in Terez\u00edn,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, &quot;and the Nazis&apos; terrible way with words. Here we have a hearse, the means of transport in Terez\u00edn, for reasons of psychological warfare against us: to demonstrate that we were already dead. They were used to transport everything apart from the dead, and instead of being pulled as they should, by horses, the animals were children.&quot; And there is that word: jugendf\u00fcrsorge. &quot;The welfare of children who would, all of them, perish in Auschwitz.&quot; Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1&apos;s face stiffens, and her soft voice hardens with the survivor&apos;s polyphonic entwinement of rage, sorrow and contempt. &quot;This was the essence of Terez\u00edn.&quot; Terez\u00edn was run, on Nazi orders, by a Council of Jewish Elders, whose task on the high wire of their captive responsibility was to carry out the diktats of the Nazis while making the lives of their own people as bearable as possible. Horrifyingly, it was the council&apos;s duty to make selections for transports to the east, according to quotas the Nazis gave them. They also organised a cultural life, under the auspices of the Freizeitgestaltung (free-time administration), who could draw from the inmates of the camp an enormous \u2013 a disproportionate \u2013 number of talented musicians, who had managed to smuggle in banned musical instruments (or at least parts of them, for reassembly). Czech music during the inter-war period of the brief and proudly democratic Czechoslovak republic stood at a crossroads of electrifying creative potential. As part of the Austro-Hungarian empire which collapsed in 1918, Czech music had been subject to two influences epitomised by the glowing dualities in the work of its great ancestor, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: the Slavonic folk tradition and the Viennese classical and romantic traditions. At the beginning of the 20th century, the former was driven to new levels of sophistication \u2013 and on a bold emotional, psychological, political and chromatic adventure \u2013 by Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek, to forge a deeply and singularly Czech musical timbre. In Vienna, Schoenberg, Webern, Berg and the expressionist movement had meanwhile embarked on an atonal, modernist revolution. What might have followed in Czechoslovakia as these movements collided and entwined could have become every bit as important as what Shostakovich, Stravinsky and Prokofiev did to Russian music out of the rubble of 1945, had not its authors been taken to Terez\u00edn and eventually murdered in Auschwitz. There were four composers of note in Terez\u00edn, and foremost among them was Viktor Ullmann. A great talent from the circle of Schoenberg and his brother-in-law Zemlinsky, Ullmann wrote some of the most important music to be played next weekend, and a masterpiece opera \u2013 The Kaiser of Atlantis \u2013 which wasn&apos;t actually performed until 1975, in Amsterdam. Often, concerts and compositions in Terez\u00edn would express suffering and resistance. &quot;They wrote in codes,&quot; says Simon Broughton, &quot;coded phrases, key codes, Czech folk and Jewish tunes, references to melodies like Smetana&apos;s &apos;M\u00e1 Vlast&apos; (My Homeland) with specific associations in the minds of the audiences that the Nazis were too stupid to spot.&quot; Not, however, with The Kaiser of Atlantis, which \u2013 although it was originally conceived by its leftwing librettist, Peter Kien as an allegory about the evils of capitalism \u2013 is pure pastiche of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler, and even contains a parody of &quot;Deutschland \u00fcber alles&quot; itself. In the opera, the figure of death refuses to lead a war of glorification for Emperor Uberall, and in the tumult that follows, death only agrees to return to duty if the Kaiser himself is the first to die. The production in Terez\u00edn reached dress-rehearsal stage, at which point it was banned by the SS. Pavel Haas was a star pupil of Jan\u00e1\u010dek and already an established composer when he arrived at the Terez\u00edn ghetto in 1941. Haas&apos;s development of the authentic Czech sound, rooted in folk song, reached a peak of creative output in the ghetto, before he was transported to and murdered in Auschwitz. Gideon Klein was another ghetto inmate, influenced by the symbolist movement and poetry of Baudelaire, and his searing, beautiful string trio piece forms part of next weekend&apos;s programme. Alice Herz Sommer, a survivor who played hundreds of piano concerts in Terez\u00edn, and who is now living in London, says it may have been intended as a quartet, but that Klein&apos;s second violinist was transported to Auschwitz, as was Klein himself soon after. Hans Kr\u00e1sa was the composer of Brundib\u00e1r. The children&apos;s opera was first performed at a Prague orphanage run by a keen amateur musician called Moritz Freudenfeld, who at his 50th birthday party, in July 1941, insisted that it be premiered on his premises. By the time of the premiere Kr\u00e1sa was in Terez\u00edn, soon to be joined by everyone else who was at Freudenfeld&apos;s birthday gathering. Eventually, Brundib\u00e1r would be performed 55 times in the ghetto \u2013 the cast of children perpetually changing, as they were transported to Auschwitz and replaced on stage by others. Conductor Karel An\u010derl was also pivotal to the musical life of the ghetto, He survived not only Terez\u00edn but Auschwitz too, and after the war returned to Terez\u00edn, where he recovered much of the discarded music written in the ghetto. As musical director of the Czech Philharmonic, An\u010derl went on to establish himself as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, alongside Furtw\u00e4ngler, Mravinsky, Karajan, Bernstein and Solti (with all the kaleidoscope of political allegiances and narratives evoked by that roll call of genius). &quot;It&apos;s hard to place what was happening in Terez\u00edn within the narrative of the Holocaust,&quot; says Broughton, the anchor of next weekend&apos;s events. &quot;The conditions were appalling, tens of thousands of people died of disease, hunger and malnutrition. Yet it was not an extermination camp; people were free, relatively speaking, inasmuch as what the Germans had prohibited as &apos;degenerated art&apos; across all Europe thrived in Terez\u00edn. There was jazz played by a band called the Ghetto Swingers, there were cabarets, there was theatre. Of course, on this occasion at the Wigmore, we&apos;re playing the music firmly from within the ghetto. But it is good music in its own right, sometimes very good \u2013 if not always great \u2013 music, and deserves to be part of the mainstream repertoire.&quot; Alice Herz Sommer is sitting in an armchair at her flat in Belsize Park, north London. &quot;Music is mankind&apos;s greatest miracle,&quot; she says. &quot;From the very first note, one is transported into a higher, other world, and that is how it was when we played or listened in the ghetto.&quot; Mrs Herz Sommer is 106 years old, but effervescent with life, and to talk to her is to converse with history itself. &quot;My mother&apos;s family played with young Gustav Mahler,&quot; she will drop casually into conversation, or &quot;Franz Kafka, whom I knew well as a dear friend\u2026&quot; Mrs Herz Sommer was an accomplished international pianist by the time she arrived in Terez\u00edn with her husband and son, in 1943, on one of the last transports from Prague. &quot;The main thing was to protect my son from what was happening,&quot; she recounts. &quot;He would keep asking: &apos;What is war? Who is Hitler? Why are we here and hungry?&apos; And when we came to write a book together, the part which gives me most pleasure is when Rapha\u00ebl wrote that thanks to his mother, he remembers very little about life in the camp.&quot; Rapha\u00ebl Sommer grew up to be a pupil of the great French cellist Paul Tortelier and a great cellist himself. Sadly, he died suddenly in 2001. It was into the musical life of Terez\u00edn that 40-year-old Alice threw herself. She accompanied, as a pianist, a famous performance of Verdi&apos;s Requiem. &quot;We were criticised for not doing Handel, or something from the Old Testament,&quot; she recalls, &quot;but so what? We wanted to perform a requiem, and Verdi&apos;s is the greatest.&quot; Was it a requiem for the dead of the ghetto, for the Jews? &quot;Why not?&quot; replies Mrs Herz Sommer. &quot;I am by nature an optimist,&quot; she continues, her mind as sharp as a scalpel, &quot;but I am pessimistic about future generations&apos; willingness to remember and care about what happened to the Jews of Europe, and to us in Terez\u00edn.&quot; Her optimism is that of the silver lining in the dark cloud: &quot;I think that great art can only come from tribulation and suffering, and that wealth is something of the spirit. Rich people are ridiculous \u2013 they think they have everything, but they have nothing!&quot; she laughs. &quot;We who survived the ghetto have our suffering, and the music which lifted us out of suffering, and that makes us richer than any wealthy man.&quot; Her husband&apos;s cryptic parting words to his wife as he was taken away for &quot;transport&quot; were, she recalls: &quot;Never volunteer for anything.&quot; Alice was unsure what he meant, but obeyed. Sure enough, three days later, many women and children were among those transported, having volunteered to journey &quot;to the east&quot;, in the hope of joining their menfolk. Alice, instead, was among the few who remained in Terez\u00edn until the end of the war, playing concerts even after her mentor in the camp, Rafael Shaechter, had also been taken and murdered. He was, she says, &quot;such a motivator, always encouraging us to overcome our surroundings, to sing and play.&quot; Shaechter had &quot;discovered&quot; young Alice when he heard her give a performance to fellow inmates of Beethoven&apos;s Appassionata piano sonata, which, she says, &quot;I performed more than 50 times in Terez\u00edn and hundreds of times since&quot;. When she returned to Prague after the liberation of Terez\u00edn, &quot;I sent a telegram to Palestine telling my relatives: &apos;Tonight, I will play the Appassionata.&apos; That is how I told them I was still alive.&quot; On 7 February 1945, while the last members of the Freizeitgestaltung were shipped to Auschwitz, she gave a recital, an all-Chopin programme which she repeated several times until 14 April, five days before Hitler, in his bunker, declared to his generals that the war was lost. For the ears of those few remaining in Terez\u00edn as the Red Army stormed Berlin, Alice then switched to performances of works by Beethoven and Schubert, including a Beethoven violin sonata for which Alice was accompanied by her brother, Paul Herz. &quot;We made music,&quot; she says, &quot;and of those evenings I have very fond memories.&quot; &quot;Would you like a cup of tea?&quot; she now asks, on a sunny morning in Belsize Park. Yes, I reply, but please remain seated, madam, I&apos;ll make it. &quot;No, sir!&quot; she retorts. &quot;You remain seated while I make tea,&quot; which she does. And after some hours of discourse, mostly about music rather than the Holocaust, she says suddenly: &quot;Thank you for our conversation. Now I must play. I must begin my playing every day with one hour of Bach. I have come slowly to appreciate German culture. Because of Hitler, obviously. But what could be more wonderful than Bach, Beethoven and Schubert, the greatest of the Romantics? But it all begins with Bach, the philosopher of music.&quot; And she moves, slowly but steadily, to the piano; the sound of the &quot;Well Tempered Clavier&quot; played by a 106-year-old Holocaust survivor drifting out across London NW3. Fragments of the Nazi propaganda film The F\u00fchrer Gives a City to the Jews have survived, and they are appalling to watch: a football match, gymnastics, wholesome growing of vegetables in allotments, the production of Brundib\u00e1r \u2013 and happy children playing and eating. &quot;But watch how they eat, the children,&quot; says Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, her usually calm voice trembling with rage. &quot;Watch how they devour the food. They are made to say: &apos;Oh no, not sardines again!&apos;, but watch their eyes, see how they eat the food, and when you watch the film or see the photographs the Nazis took, tell yourself that soon afterwards, when they had fulfilled their purpose for Hitler&apos;s propaganda, those children were all sent on the transports to Auschwitz and murdered.&quot; Of all the children in a famous photograph of Brundib\u00e1r&apos;s cast, only two are known with any certainty to have survived: one was Mrs Herz Sommer&apos;s son, Rapha\u00ebl; the other is dressed in black, as a cat, next to the main character. Her name is Ela Weissberger and she lives in the United States. &quot;She is a dear, dear friend of mine,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, &quot;and she is coming soon to Prague to visit me.&quot; Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1&apos;s early work is hallmarked by strong lines and bright colours. But later, it dims into flurries of hurried line, and darker hues. &quot;I literally used a wash of dirty water,&quot; she says, &quot;and there was certainly no shortage of that!&quot; Towards the end of her time in Terez\u00edn, in 1944, she drew the arrival of children from Bialystok, Poland, who, diseased and malnourished, were taken to the showers and panicked in fear, shouting &quot;Gas! Gas!&quot; &quot;They knew what we did not know about the east, but had begun to suspect,&quot; says Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. &quot;They were terrified; they understood.&quot; After that of the Polish children, there follow two more terrifying pictures in a similar, dark palette: both of the separation of those departing on the transports and those remaining behind, who were forbidden to speak to those &quot;selected&quot;. &quot;We know now what we did not know then what these are pictures of,&quot; says the artist. &quot;They are the moment of final farewell.&quot; Even before her beloved father&apos;s transport to Auschwitz, and later her own, teenaged Helga Weissov\u00e1 was obsessed by these moments, writing in her diary that the &quot;thunderous steps, the roar of the ghetto guards, the banging of doors and hysterical weeping always sound \u2013 and foretell \u2013 the same&quot;. On 4 October 1944, Weissova and her mother were transported to Auschwitz, and arrived to face &quot;selection&quot; by none other than Dr Josef Mengele himself, directing arrivals on the platform either left towards the gas chambers or right towards the barracks and forced-labour dispatches. &quot;The rows in front of us are moving,&quot; the 15-year-old Helga wrote in her journal, realising immediately that children were being sent left to the ovens. &quot;It&apos;ll soon be our turn\u2026 the rows are quickly disappearing, the five people ahead of us are on their way\u2026 just two more people, then it&apos;s us. For God&apos;s sake, what if I&apos;m asked what year I was born? Quick, 1929, and I&apos;m 15, so if I&apos;m 18\u2026 &apos;28, &apos;27, &apos;26. Mum is standing in front of the SS man \u2013 he sends her to the right. Oh God, let us stay together! &apos;Rechts&apos;, the SS man yells at me, and points the direction. Hooray, we&apos;re on the same side.&quot; Eleven days later, another train from Terez\u00edn pulled up in Auschwitz, carrying Hans Kr\u00e1sa, Viktor Ullmann, Gideon Klein, Rafael Schaechter and Karel An\u010derl, to face the same &quot;selection&quot;. The latter was separated from his wife and child, who were sent to the gas ovens, along with the others, the creative core of Czech music. &quot;How did you survive?&quot; I ask Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. &quot;Is that a question?&quot; she retorts. &quot;There was no way to know. It was sheer luck \u2013 or was it providence, or what? This way, left, to the gas chambers. That way, right, to the labour camps and the rest of what then happened to me, that I had to go through. There was no reason or\u2026 there is no answer to that question. Who knows why or how anyone survived. As I say in the painting: &apos;WHY?&apos;&quot; Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 was transferred from Auschwitz to a labour camp that formed part of the complex of Flossenb\u00fcrg, the only concentration camp which fully carried out Heinrich Himmler&apos;s orders at the very end: to exterminate every single inmate. But Weissov\u00e1 survived a second time: before Himmler issued his order, she was forced on a 16-day &quot;death march&quot; (of which she has drawn terrifying images) to the Mauthausen labour camp, which she endured until liberation, returning then to this very flat in Prague 8, on Kotlaskou Street, in which she was born and still lives. She points to a painting which she says &quot;I consider my most important of all. It hung a while above the piano, but I took it down.&quot; It shows a pile of children&apos;s shoes, from which ascend plumes of smoke in which eyes are set, asking \u2013 no, screaming \u2013 &quot;WHY?&quot; Primo Levi wrote: &quot;Do not think that shoes form a factor of secondary importance in the life of the Lager [concentration camps]. Death begins with the shoes.&quot; The removal of the shoes, before the gas chamber, is a scene recalled in his memoirs by Filip M\u00fcller, a member of Auschwitz&apos;s sonderkommando, prisoners commandeered to assist in the death camps. &quot;I was watching a young mother. First she took off her shoes, then the shoes of her small daughter,&quot; M\u00fcller wrote. &quot;Then she removed her stockings, then the stockings of her little girl. All the time she endeavoured to answer the child&apos;s questions readily: &apos;Mummy, why are we undressing?&apos; &apos;Because we must.&apos;&quot; Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 turns to another picture of hers. It shows her granddaughter, the cellist Dominika, when she was a baby in a cot, asleep. But underneath the cot lies a pair of little red slippers: &quot;The thing is that, for me,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1, &quot;I cannot see those slippers of a safe, secure child without thinking of the other shoes. These shoes,&quot; and she turns back to the picture of the shoes and the smoke. We sit for a while in silence, eating the sandwiches she has kindly made: it is mid-afternoon, and summer, but one of those grey days that never really dawns. A drizzle falls, the trams clank outside and music drifts from a distant radio. Before I take my leave, Helga wants to show some last works. One is a painting in which, behind a fallen autumn leaf in what looks like a cracked skull, or egg, a curtain is drawn and spring flowers bloom in a blue sky of redemption, some form of resurrection from the ashes, regeneration from the shattered egg. But then she opens a file of her prints from etchings into lino or wood. Most of them are prints of the same themes as her paintings, but in black and white, and they are like the spine-chilling monochrome of Auschwitz itself. Walking around Terez\u00edn now, one visits a place of colours: a curiously &quot;normal&quot; \u2013 albeit haunted \u2013 town and carefully arranged monument to both the suffering and the creativity; the grass is green, the sky blue and the wash on the walls of the buildings where Alice Herz Sommer and Helga Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 lived is a burnt sienna ochre. Late prints by Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1 recall the place for which Terez\u00edn was the transit point for the &quot;transports&quot;. These prints convey that feeling, when one visits Auschwitz, that only they \u2013 and no words \u2013 can express: Auschwitz, where even the ghosts are dead and the colours silent, and everything seems, like these prints, black and white, metal and snow. Black, spidery watchtowers with slanting roofs and long, black stilts for legs behind the black fencing, attached to black poles, silhouetted against powdery white across the ground. Black and white, but not like in photographs, not even photographs of Auschwitz, where there is penumbra. In Auschwitz (in winter, at least), the black is too black and the white is too white, as they are in Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1&apos;s heart-stopping prints. &quot;I am still inside,&quot; says Mrs Weissov\u00e1-Ho\u0161kov\u00e1. &quot;Once a prisoner in the camps, you are always inside. In fact, the older you get the more inside you go. Every time we meet, friends who have survived, we talk, we laugh, we joke, we are alive together, we exchange news and talk about music, children, grandchildren, our lives now. But we always return to the same thing. The camps. Terez\u00edn, Auschwitz. We always go back inside.&quot; The Nash Ensemble&apos;s Music in Theresienstadt-Terez\u00edn 1941-45 runs next weekend, 19-20 June.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    We have been talking for 10 minutes when Gillian Martin stops. She wants to explain something. &quot;This is really unique: for me to sit here and think and talk about my physicality. It&apos;s not on my mind 24/7.&quot; She says it pleasantly, but it&apos;s easy to see what she means: she would rather the media had a broader interest in people of restricted growth. &quot;I&apos;d love to see a small person in a soap opera, having trouble meeting the bills,&quot; Martin says with a chuckle. &quot;Or having an emotional crisis that has nothing to do with their physicality. Because that is my life on a day-to-day basis: I have the same quarrels with my husband, I have the same issues with raising my daughter \u2013 the same crap that everyone else has.&quot; Her dream may be realised \u2013 or not \u2013 when BBC2 airs the pilot episode of Life&apos;s Too Short, the new sitcom from Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and Britain&apos;s best-known actor of restricted growth, Warwick Davis. &quot;We don&apos;t know what it&apos;s going to be like,&quot; Martin says calmly, but she feels small people are unfailingly represented as either comic sidekicks or magical freaks. &quot;That&apos;s all society is exposed to,&quot; she says. &quot;All you see is the stereotype, or the buttend of jokes.&quot; Indeed, Gervais and Merchant first collaborated with Davis on an episode of Extras in which Merchant&apos;s character calls Davis a &quot;midget&quot; \u2013 a term Martin says &quot;is in line with the word nigger for me&quot;. The sketch ended with Gervais, provoked, kicking Davis in the face, primetime on the BBC. So Martin knew what to expect when she went to see Jimmy Carr a few years ago. &quot;When he asked the audience if there were any dwarfs in [the audience], I announced myself. These guys nearby were going to do it for me if I hadn&apos;t. He asked me what my name was, what my age was, how tall I was. He commented that I&apos;m a giant in the dwarf world, which was very funny, and true, because I am quite tall for a person of restricted growth. Then he asked me about [my average-sized husband] Steve, and quipped that we were &apos;the acceptable face of paedophilia&apos;.&quot; Martin says &quot;the whole crowd erupted into laughter, and we laughed along too&quot;. When she met Carr afterwards, he was very polite, apologetic even, but Martin walked away &quot;worrying about the other 2,000 people in that room. The joke reaffirms that being small is weird, and that having a relationship with somebody who&apos;s small is weird.&quot; She and Steve had met through a mutual friend at Bolton University, where Martin studied art. &quot;We just used to hang out, so he kind of got to grips with how I went about my daily life, and it was never an issue,&quot; she says. &quot;I was extremely lucky; I think there are lots of cases where people struggle to find a lifelong partner, because of the prejudices, perception and because people care far too much what other people think.&quot; Had Steve known others with restricted growth? &quot;I don&apos;t think he had. I ask him even now, years down the line, what is it about me, and he just says, &apos;Your personality, and you&apos;re gorgeous to me.&apos; And that was it.&quot; Within 18 months they married, and then Martin became pregnant with their daughter Sophie. It was a tense time. If the baby did not inherit Martin&apos;s condition, she knew she would soon be caring for a toddler who was nearly as big as she was. And if the child did inherit it . . . well, that would not be easy either. &quot;There was no sense of rejection in me at all,&quot; she says, as she remembers finding out, quite late, that her daughter did indeed have achondroplasia, the genetic disorder that causes around 70% of the world&apos;s cases of dwarfism. &quot;I just thought, gosh, she is going to have to go through everything that I&apos;ve gone through.&quot; Now Sophie is 10 and coping well. And Martin, who has just qualified to be a primary school teacher, is now looking for her first job. As for married life, &quot;13 years down the line we&apos;re as strong as ever. And the looks we get when Steve bends down to give me a kiss are hilarious.&quot; Luke Barrett, 21Business student, Birmingham     Luke Barrett: 'I don't see my size as a disadvantage.' Photograph: Fabio De Paola    &quot;Some people would not explore the world,&quot; Luke Barrett says. &quot;But I didn&apos;t want to stay in Birmingham for university, and come home at the end of the day. I wanted to go and do what a normal student does.&quot; So Barrett, who is one of many small people happy to refer to himself as a &quot;dwarf&quot;, plumped for Liverpool, where he has just resat the first year of his business degree, and is thinking about what comes next. &quot;In a few years, if I can build up some money, I would like to go into renting out houses, maybe for students,&quot; he says. &quot;This year, I was junior manager at the Dwarf Games [he is a powerlifter], and I&apos;d like to interact with teenagers, or small people like me. Perhaps coaching football, for example . . . I&apos;d just like to be a helper in any way.&quot; Not that people of restricted growth always need help. &quot;I just don&apos;t see it as a disadvantage.&quot; Indeed, nosing around the family home, the lowered sinks and kitchen worktop are the only clue to the adjustments that have been made to accommodate his, his mother&apos;s and his sister&apos;s achondroplasia (Barrett&apos;s father is average-sized). As a black man, Barrett might be expected to get a double helping of prejudice. Yet he says he has never received any abuse about his race, only his height. &quot;I don&apos;t mind children looking, because children are always inquisitive. But I went shopping in the city centre once, and these lads just pulled over, had 10 seconds full of laughter, and drove off. For them that will be a good little joke, but it will put me on a downer all day. And if there&apos;s more than one dwarf \u2013 say I went out with one of my mates \u2013 then it&apos;s more of a problem.&quot; This weekend he plans to go bowling with a group of friends and his girlfriend Naomi, who studies childcare in Amsterdam, and whom he met by chance at last summer&apos;s Dwarf Games in Belfast (she wasn&apos;t competing, she was visiting friends). &quot;When we are all together, it&apos;s a nightmare. It&apos;s not a nightmare, but it&apos;s something I can&apos;t deal with, because you&apos;ll have at least one person try to take a photo.&quot; His friends of average height, on the other hand, don&apos;t even notice: &quot;Once I was walking with my mate from secondary school and this kid must have walked past me, pointing. And my mate was all confused. He said, &apos;Luke, why is he staring at you?&apos; And I went [he points his hands down at his body] like that to him. And he went, &apos;Oh yeah.&apos; Then I was laughing at him. And that made me feel good, because he doesn&apos;t see me in that way.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know what [the fascination] is.&quot; He grins and shrugs again, dragging a hand through his tied-back hair. &quot;But my mum always says, &apos;Put on your good clothes, because people are going to look at you every day.&apos;&quot; Jo Osmond, 23Presenter and performer, Cardiff     Jo Osmond: 'There's a lot more awareness of small people in the US.' Photograph: Gareth Phillips    &quot;I get ID-ed everywhere,&quot; says Jo Osmond, &quot;even for 15-rated films. And I get talked down to like I&apos;m 10 years old.&quot; She speaks with a bubbly kind of exasperation. &quot;It is annoying,&quot; she agrees, &quot;but my mum just says to me, &apos;When you&apos;re 50, you won&apos;t be annoyed about it.&apos;&quot; To this day, no one knows why Osmond&apos;s mother Lisa has never grown taller than 4ft 4in. No gene for any recognised form of dwarfism has been found in the family, but it does seem to be a genetic condition, as both Jo and her brother Ed inherited it too. &quot;When we go to the little people convention the first thing people will say is, &apos;What condition have you got?&apos;&quot; Osmond laughs. Her stature put an end to her first showbiz dream when she was 16, and &quot;it got to the point where I knew I couldn&apos;t be a dancer. The entertainment business is what you look like,&quot; she says simply. The early disappointment did not put Osmond off entirely, but displaced her ambitions to other forms of performance. &quot;If you don&apos;t look like a part, you won&apos;t get the part.&quot; And if you look like a child, you get parts as a children&apos;s stunt double. And as a goblin in two Harry Potter films. And as a &quot;child mannequin&quot; in Doctor Who. And as Baby Bop in the Barney the Dinosaur roadshow. Indeed, it was during this last job that Osmond had her big idea for a new show. &quot;It&apos;s for under-fives and it&apos;s called Fruit Pot,&quot; she begins. &quot;The four fruits are all little people, and I&apos;m a raspberry called Flo.&quot; Osmond has already financed, filmed and sold a pilot show, and is looking for international distribution. The genius of using small people, she explains, is that &quot;children are often scared of costume characters because they&apos;re so big. You&apos;ve got the seven dwarfs in Disneyland,&quot; she splutters, scandalised, &quot;and they&apos;re all 5ft 8in.&quot; Osmond&apos;s first break came when she won a competition, aged 11, to present awards on the Disney Channel. (Her submission was a poster on world peace, and the judges had no knowledge of her restricted growth when they chose it.) Since then, besides her film and television work, she has been a Bluecoat at Pontin&apos;s, and spent the last two years presenting entertainment on cruise ships. She doesn&apos;t offer jokes about restricted growth in her own work, and draws a clear line on what kind of jobs she is prepared to do. &quot;There are people who will dress up as Oompa-Loompas and work in nightclubs,&quot; she says. &quot;The money is so good. I know from being offered work in the past, and I can see why people would do it: you can get \u00a3700-\u00a3800 for two hours.&quot; She won&apos;t do it herself. &quot;But I have a lot of friends in the business who do those jobs,&quot; she says. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m not their friend.&quot; In the US, she says, there is more interesting work to be found. &quot;There are a lot more serious parts [for actors of restricted growth], and a lot more awareness of small people. Whereas it seems over here, and in Europe, that people are so rude. It&apos;s human nature to look, I&apos;d do it myself, but I wouldn&apos;t be rude about it . . .&quot; Her passion is beginning to overtake her eloquence, so she stops and collects herself. &quot;Being small is a bit like being famous,&quot; she says finally, distilling the point, &quot;only famous in a way which isn&apos;t good.&quot; James Coyle-King, 19Automotive design student, Lincoln     James Coyle-King: 'I thought, I'll have a go at that.' Photograph: Lorne Campbell/Guzelian    Born with diastrophic dysplasia, which causes widespread malfunctions in the body&apos;s growth of cartilage and bone, James Coyle-King underwent a dozen operations during the first 12 years of his life. &quot;It didn&apos;t really bother me. Most of my bad ones were done when I was younger, and when I was older I saw it was necessary,&quot; he says. His tone is matter of fact, though he admits not everything was easy. &quot;I was away from school and my friends. But I&apos;m quite competitive, to be honest, so I always try to recover as quickly as possible.&quot; Diastrophic dysplasia is the third most common cause of dwarfism, and those who have it are generally the smallest of all. At 3ft 6in, Coyle-King is quite tall for someone with the disorder. He also suffers from several other joint problems, such as permanently dislocated thumbs and fingers that are fused solid at the knuckles. Which makes it seem incredible \u2013 perhaps almost wilful \u2013 that the passion he has developed is for drawing cars. &quot;It all started when I was 10, recovering from an operation, and my brother John came in and he&apos;d brought a pack of Top Trumps of cars. And that&apos;s when I saw a McLaren F1. It was so different, so well designed. I got home and decided to draw a car, and it stemmed from that, really. Now I still draw two or three [cars] a week, mostly from my imagination. There are bits of paper everywhere.&quot; At first using a pencil &quot;was a pain, because I can&apos;t bend my fingers [except] where they meet my hand. Ever since I can remember I&apos;ve always held the pencil the same way, which is threaded between my fingers.&quot; There are other physical challenges for Coyle-King, such as standing still, which can hurt his ankles. And walking can quickly become tiring as well, so he often uses a wheelchair to get about. Though even this limitation became a focus for ambition when, quite by chance, he observed a game of wheelchair basketball while he waited for his archery class to start. &quot;I always thought of people in wheelchairs as disabled, and I didn&apos;t consider myself disabled back then. When I accidentally turned up to basketball, I saw all the other people in wheelchairs playing very well, and thought, ooh, I&apos;ll have a go at that. So I got my mum to go home and get my wheelchair, and started playing.&quot; Now he competes nationally, training three times a week. &quot;Before that I didn&apos;t like using my wheelchair,&quot; he says. Would it be fair to say that he is actually proud of having diastrophic dysplasia? &quot;Kind of, yes,&quot; he says. Glad even? &quot;Yes.&quot; This time the word is spoken as though it were obvious. &quot;Because if I didn&apos;t have this condition it wouldn&apos;t be me, would it? I wouldn&apos;t be like I am.&quot; No, but if he could just press a button and grow, would he do it? Coyle-King thinks. &quot;I&apos;d like to try it,&quot; he says eventually, &quot;but I wouldn&apos;t want it to be permanent.&quot;", "sentences": ["And if there&apos;s more than one dwarf \u2013 say I went out with one of my mates \u2013 then it&apos;s more of a problem.&quot; This weekend he plans to go bowling with a group of friends and his girlfriend Naomi, who studies childcare in Amsterdam, and whom he met by chance at last summer&apos;s Dwarf Games in Belfast (she wasn&apos;t competing, she was visiting friends)."], "title": "Little Britain: what is life like as a small person?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/14/small-world-people-of-restricted-growth", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Disability", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-15T11:28:00Z", "article": "There was a time when the groom-to-be had a night out with his friends the night before he got hitched and it was called a stag night. Times have changed. Sensibly, the stag is nowadays rarely insensibly drunk the night before he gets married. He&apos;s also much less likely to spend just an evening with his mates. I&apos;ve been on a lot of stag dos, but only the first was of the traditional variety. Since then it&apos;s been a roll call from Amsterdam to Alicante, Ibiza to Ljubljana, and more British towns and cities than I can remember, never for less than 36 hours, and sometimes much longer. The stag night has become the stag weekend, and occasionally the stag holiday. As NickBown said last week about celebrating overseas (weddings rather than stag dos, but the theory holds true): &quot;The people who care about you the most will come and those which aren&apos;t so bothered have an excuse not to.&quot; Although there is a rider to that: it is also possible that some would like to come but can&apos;t afford to go abroad. The cheaper it is, the more inclusive. Personally, I&apos;m more than happy to stump up the cash for a tip-top weekend. You want something memorable. Overseas can often be so, but so can stag dos at home. You just need to show some imagination to make it &quot;yours&quot;. As a cricket-lover, the 99 World Cup was perfectly timed and offered trips to sports stadiums where I had spent much of my youth. Plenty of other sports and activities are great for a stag weekend: without stag dos I would probably never have been clay pigeon shooting, go-karting, surfing or paintballing. These are good for team bonding too, given that stag dos throw together friends from different parts of life who often don&apos;t know each other. And then there are impromptu sporting events, such as glove puppet rugby, beach cricket and imaginary grand nationals. And walking, because there is always a long, unplanned walk on a stag weekend: either someone thinks that walking back to the hotel at 7am is a good idea, or you are lost, or that cathedral on top of a mountain seems like a good place to visit. While on the subject of getting about, my advice would be that public transport, or professional transport, is the best. Certainly not one of the stag team. And absolutely not a mate of a mate who offers to drive. On one stag weekend, a friend of a friend had access to a minibus and offered to drive for a small consideration.

I do, however, remember one stag throwing up out of the taxi window, minutes before he was given a shotgun to discharge. Shared rooms are another stag do issue (remember how even England footballers used to share rooms?). As I&apos;ve got older I&apos;ve noticed that stag weekenders tend to sleep more/eat more/behave more sensibly than when we were younger - probably something to do with kids and lack of sleep at home. We stay in nicer hotels too. Thrown into a young men&apos;s stag weekend a couple of years ago, I found myself sharing a hostel room full of bunk beds with half a dozen others bouncing around at 5am. But that&apos;s enough from me, what are your stories/tips/advice? Of course, some of you may wish to debate whether there should even be a stag event.

His poetry, which strikingly balanced abstraction with realism, was informed by what he described as &quot;a continuing sense of inquiry and curiosity&quot;. His design work included a consultancy for the department store Harvey Nichols from 1981 to 1993. His roles as poet and designer each benefited from David&apos;s amiability, lively mind and unfailing openness of spirit. David was the son of a rural labourer and a former undermaid in the village of Mottram St Andrew, in Cheshire. He spent his early years dreaming of escape. He left Broken Cross community school in Macclesfield aged 16 and entered a local textiles factory. He was put to work at the drawing board because he was considered too delicate for shopfloor work, and so began his career in design. I first knew him in Manchester&apos;s lively underground scene in the 1960s, when his work was featured in two major paperback anthologies and he contributed to a Granada TV arts programme on Manchester nightlife. In 1965, he met Andrew Crozier, then at Keele University, who published David&apos;s first, mimeographed, book, Dark Pages Slow Turns Brief Salves, in 1969. Their friendship was born of a shared interest in stripping poetry of formal devices and self-conscious poeticisms. David&apos;s early poems \u2013 such as those in the collection Chocolate Sauce (1973), which was published with a cover by Patrick Caulfield \u2013 were each dated, suggesting daily life to be a continuous creative process. The poems suspended a series of word-groups in front of the reader, creating a verbal theatre rather than functioning as description: lines of colour across the table  salvaged morning  it could have rained it didn&apos;t  relief? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I&apos;m unsure  space opening out inside here  the room is quietly  bursting  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 24th April 1972 David&apos;s mature poetry, of which there is a lot \u2013 the Collected Poems (Salt Publishing, 2005) runs to 430 pages \u2013 is work of extended breath and deepened tone, wide-ranging in its effects. He developed a technique of rhythmic, chant-like repetition, which enforces a meditative calm and stasis on the narrative. The late sequence Art for Others (1998) offers an almost apocalyptic anger in a series of relentless monologues concerning the 1990s recession, from which he suffered greatly. David moved to London in 1973. He ran his own design business there from 1980 to 1995, eventually opening another office in Amsterdam. He worked with the Conrad Design group from 1995 to 2004, and was retail director of Conran and Partners from 2004 until 2006. He was a design ambassador for the British Council, lectured on design, wrote for magazines such as Vogue and Drapers, and was a judge, and then chairman of the judges, at the Design Week awards. His design work for retail outlets, notable for its use of light and colour, typically managed to guide and accommodate the consumer while also signaling the store&apos;s identity. From his base in Amsterdam, he designed for the Dutch supermarket Albert Heijn and worked on the redesign of the Jopie Huisman Museum, in Workum. A final unfinished project, which might have united the two strands in David&apos;s life, was Void Heaven, a multimedia collaboration that was to involve the musicians Vince Clark and Martyn Ware and some of David&apos;s film work.

With his wife, Madeline Gins, he designed houses and public spaces that were supposed to help stop us from ageing. His death, at the age of 73, is a flaw in his philosophy of transhumanism, or\u00a0reversible destiny. &quot;This mortality thing is bad news,&quot; Gins said after he died, adding that she would now increase her efforts to prove that &quot;ageing can be outlawed&quot;.     Shusaku Arakawa     For Arakawa and Gins, the ideal form of a house was one that kept residents in a &quot;perpetually tentative relationship with their surroundings&quot;. The more our homes challenge us, architecturally, the more likely we are to stay young, grappling with their complexities and, in the case of Arakawa and Gins&apos;s flats and houses, their sheer oddity \u2013 even perversity. Their most extreme design, the Bioscleave house (2008), in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, took eight years to build and cost the couple $2m of their own money. Before this colourful and bewildering home was finished, Arakawa and Gins lost the small fortune that they had accumulated since the early 1960s. They had invested money through Bernard Madoff, the American conman they had met at an art exhibition in New York, and the resulting loss led them to close their office in Manhattan. The Bioscleave house boasted at least three dozen shades of\u00a0paint. The\u00a0building features sloping floors in\u00a0the guise of\u00a0cartoon-like sand dunes, windows placed where no window is normally placed, level changes aimed at\u00a0conveying a feeling of being in two places at once, no doors, no privacy, curiously shaped rooms and any number of other surrealist tricks. The house was designed to keep residents and visitors on their toes \u2013 they are hard pushed to even remain vertical. A number of floor-to-ceiling poles were provided, which can be grasped if the inevitable sense of\u00a0disorientation gets a bit too much. These curious devices were intended to stimulate us in ways conventional homes do not. A state of comfort, according to Arakawa and Gins, creates anxiety because, although cosseting, it can only ever be finite \u2013 and thus shortens rather than prolongs life. Arakawa rarely used his first name. He was born in Nagoya, studied maths and medicine at the University of Tokyo and attended Musashino art school in Tokyo, where he made surrealist prints. He set off for New York in 1961 with, he claimed, just $14 and the artist Marcel Duchamp&apos;s phone number in his pockets. He took a course at Brooklyn Museum art school where, in 1962, he met and married Gins, a fellow student. In 1987 they started the Containers of\u00a0Mind Foundation together, which later evolved into the Architectural Body Research Foundation. These were the hard-to-place philosophical stepping-stones of their lifelong attempt to create buildings that would enable us to defy death. They began to paint a series of 83 large paintings on the theme of the mechanism of meaning which were exhibited around the world and, over the years, paid for Arakawa and Gins&apos; architectural experiments. To date, these are a project for a city of reversible destiny on 75 acres of Tokyo wasteland (it never happened); the Bioscleave house; and nine reversible destiny lofts in Mitaka, Tokyo, completed in 2005 at\u00a0a\u00a0total cost of around $6m. The reversible destiny lofts boast colourful rooms in the form of cylinders, cubes and spheres and are known for being interesting and challenging, rather than comfortable, to live in. They are dedicated to the memory of Helen Keller, the American author and political activist who lost her sight and hearing as a child. Keller was a role model for Arakawa and Gins because by relearning how to communicate, she somehow proved that reversible destiny was possible. The pair believed that the ideal residents of their homes should, following the same principle, be blank slates so that their experience of architecture was continually novel. In this way, explained Arakawa, they would forget that they had to die. Arakawa had exhibitions of his work around the world, including at the Angela Flowers Gallery in London, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Galerie Maeght in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also wrote poetry, animated by such thought-provoking sentiments as &quot;when I am away from you, I feel like a\u00a0watermelon seed&quot;, and\u00a0&quot;he is elegant between his toes&quot;. He published several tantalising books with Gins, notably The Mechanism of\u00a0Meaning (1971), Reversible Destiny: We Have Decided Not to Die (1997) and Making Dying Illegal (2006).

Gerbrand Bakker&apos;s The Twin (Boven is het stil), in which protagonist Helmer is forced to return to his family&apos;s small farm in the bleak Dutch countryside after his twin brother dies in a car accident, was named winner of the \u20ac100,000 Impac prize in Dublin this evening.

Acclaimed English author Anne Fine sat on this year&apos;s judging panel, which said The Twin &quot;convinces from first page to last&quot;. &quot;Though rich in detail, it&apos;s a sparely written story, with the narrator&apos;s odd small cruelties, laconic humour and surprising tendernesses emerging through a steady, well-paced, unaffected style,&quot; said the judges. &quot;With quiet mastery the story draws in the reader. The writing is wonderful: restrained and clear, and studded with detail of farm rhythms in the cold, damp Dutch countryside.&quot; The Twin is the third debut novel in a row to win the Impac, following Michael Thomas&apos;s Man Gone Down last year, and Rawi Hage&apos;s De Niro&apos;s Game in 2008. The idea for the book came to Bakker on a holiday in Corsica in 2002. Hiking through the mountains, he had the idea of a son &quot;who was going to do something terrible to his father&quot;. &quot;It stayed in my mind for months and I got so frustrated \u2013 nothing was happening with the idea. Then I just sat down and got writing. I didn&apos;t know where I was going, I just started \u2013 for me that&apos;s a good way to write,&quot; he said. Bakker became a licensed gardener in 2006 and also works during the winter as a skating instructor, but says that these days he makes enough money to be a full-time writer. &quot;I became a gardener in 2006 when I thought I had to learn something so I can always make money, and I still do as much work as I can,&quot; he said. &quot;The two things work well together. In the autumn when I rake the dead leaves I can do it for hours \u2013 once I even disturbed a pile I&apos;d made so I could go on raking. The sound is so wonderful: it lets you think in a subconscious way, in the back of your mind.&quot; As for the huge cheque he&apos;ll be taking away this evening, Bakker thinks he might buy a horse. &quot;Not a race horse, but a cart horse, a work horse. In Holland we&apos;ve got these huge grey horses which are very sweet and I would like to own one,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not a rider but I just love these big beasts. They&apos;re so kind.

If this woman writer is such a good novelist, why doesn&apos;t she create characters from scratch?&quot; Dogar, who said that she &quot;might be in shock&quot; after the Sunday Times accused her of &quot;sexing up&quot; Anne Frank, said that she was &quot;worried herself&quot; about being exploitative as she wrote. &quot;The problem is that a writer doesn&apos;t always choose what they write,&quot; she said. &quot;The idea of this book plagued me for 15 years. I tried quite hard not to write it, mostly because I had similar concerns; I couldn&apos;t do it justice, I wasn&apos;t sure it was legitimate, I didn&apos;t believe I had the talent to portray the horror of the Holocaust. But sometimes stories just come and you can&apos;t stop them.&quot; &quot;How it might have felt to be written about by her is central to the novel,&quot; she continued, &quot;and so perhaps it&apos;s no surprise that the question of how she might have felt to be written about has arisen. I often wonder what she might think.&quot; Dogar says she made every effort to portray the events and characters accurately, citing a correspondence with Frank&apos;s only surviving relative, Buddy Elias, in which she says she assuaged his initial doubts over the book, and he finished by wishing her well with it. &quot;I&apos;m certainly sad that many people&apos;s first view of my book doesn&apos;t reflect the truth of it,&quot; she said. Her editor at Andersen Press, Charlie Sheppard, said that they had been in touch with Elias for many months, and had sent him an early version of the book to look at. &quot;We spoke to Buddy, we spoke to [Anne Frank&apos;s] biographer, we spoke endlessly about each word,&quot; she said, &quot;because the last thing anyone wanted was to cause any offence.&quot; The novel, which opens with Peter on the point of death, is told as a series of diary entries interspersed with the thoughts of the dying boy, charting the story of the time he spent hiding with the Franks in the Annexe at 263 Prinsengracht, his discovery and his time in the Mauthausen concentration camp. But it is the small part of the book that concerns Peter&apos;s teenage sexuality that has angered Walnes, and led her to accuse Dogar of &quot;putting 21st-century mores on to young people&quot; from a different era. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why this story has to be sexualised,&quot; she said, &quot;and why Peter&apos;s character has to be changed.&quot; Dogar rejects the accusation of anachronism, countering that there is nowhere in the book where they come close to breaking the taboo around sex, and that &quot;in the book the reality of just one truly intimate touch was enough to stop them&quot;. &quot;Whilst it&apos;s true to say that children of the war years lived according to different cultural mores and social strictures,&quot; she said, &quot;it&apos;s also true that there are some fundamental and universal human feelings that are biological rather than social. The state of adolescence existed before &apos;teenagers&apos; were invented. Adolescent hormones have always been in conflict with social rulings. This is why some of Anne&apos;s thoughts remain as powerful and meaningful today as they were 60 years ago.&quot; Although Peter does worry in the novel that he &quot;will never make love to a girl&quot;, and there is a scene in which Anne and Peter kiss, Sheppard rejects the accusation that the book is mainly concerned with sex. &quot;The sexual awakening of Anne plays more of a major part in her diary than this book,&quot; she said, citing moments in the diary where Anne discusses her periods. The diaries were first published in the face of some opposition from relatives and acquaintances in 1947, in a version edited by Anne&apos;s father Otto which did not include these passages. For Dogar the inspiration for Annexed &quot;was not really Anne herself, but Peter van Pels&quot;. She acknowledged the responsibility that novelists have to real characters but suggested that &quot;there is no one truth alone&quot;. &quot;Otto Frank remarked, upon reading Anne&apos;s diary, that he did not recognise his daughter as she described herself,&quot; she continued, &quot;and that &apos;from this&apos; he could only conclude that &apos;as parents we do not really know our children&apos;. Historical novelists are, in a sense, in loco parentis to their characters, and like parents, they have a duty to try and understand their subjects.&quot; The children&apos;s writer John Boyne, whose controversial novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas tells the story of two boys divided by a concentration camp fence and was made into a film in 2008, defended the role of children&apos;s fiction in dealing with subjects as charged as the Holocaust, as long as the writer employs &quot;an accessible and intelligent style to engage the young reader and to make him or her question the world in which they live&quot;. &quot;There are those who would say that a strict adherence to the facts is crucial,&quot; he said, &quot;but fiction by its nature distorts reality while nevertheless reflecting it. Place a fictional character into a historical setting and that world is already corrupted; accept that and move on to examine what the novelist is trying to say.&quot; According to Boyne, novels can play a &quot;huge role&quot; in educating young people. &quot;Children will switch off if they are lectured,&quot; he continued, &quot;but tell them a good story with characters they can relate to and you&apos;re halfway there.&quot; Dogar called on people to focus on the book itself rather than articles written about it in the press. &quot;I&apos;ve done my best with Annexed,&quot; she added, &quot;and it&apos;s now for readers to decide whether or not I&apos;ve succeeded.&quot; With the media storm surrounding her generating rather more heat than light, Dogar may come to regret the power of the written word.

They carried away computers and hundreds of files, amid rumours that church leaders were continuing to cover up abuse cases despite a public plea for forgiveness last month. Belgian officers today sealed off and searched the headquarters of the church at Mechelen, north of Brussels, where the Belgian bishops&apos; conference was in session, with the papal nuncio taking part. They also searched the home of Cardinal Godfried Danneels, until last year Belgium&apos;s most senior prelate, who enjoys a reputation for being a liberal. In nearby Leuven, east of Brussels, police also searched the premises of the independent church commission investigating hundreds of cases of alleged molestation by clergymen. They took all 475 files belonging to the commission, prompting bewilderment and panic among investigators and victims of sexual abuse. &quot;The police have a number of accusations connected with the sexual abuse of children within the church,&quot; said Jean-Marc Meilleur, a Brussels police spokesman. &quot;The searches are the result of the investigation we started recently. We are collecting evidence material.&quot; The raids centred on the palace of Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard, head of the Catholic church in Belgium, on the ancient town&apos;s St Rombout&apos;s cathedral, and on the residence of the former head of the church in Belgium, Cardinal Danneels. The long-running but moribund commission in Leuven was resurrected this year to investigate the torrent of allegations that have surfaced, especially since April when one of the most senior clergymen in Belgium, Archbishop of Bruges, Roger Vangheluwe, resigned after admitting he had been abusing a boy for years. Police declined to say whether any of the individuals at the centre of today&apos;s raids were direct suspects or whether the searches concerned evidence affecting other cases. The commission of inquiry is well-respected and is led by Peter Adriaenssens, one of Belgium&apos;s top child abuse experts, whose office has received hundreds of complaints this year and who has threatened to resign should his work be impeded by the church hierarchy. He emerged as a national figure following the notorious Marc Dutroux paedophilia and murder case in 1996 and runs one of the country&apos;s most respected child abuse centres. He voiced outrage and shock at the police actions, saying he had been given no warning, and would now struggle to deliver a report on clerical sexual abuse he was preparing for October. Adriaenssens was in Amsterdam in the Netherlands on Wednesday when his offices were raided. He said that all files in his investigation, concerning 475 cases, had been taken away by the police. &quot;All day we&apos;ve been getting mails and calls from victims in panic,&quot; he said. &quot;They agreed that we do a report, but they did not want others to see the material \u2026 No one asked us a single question. We have no idea why this happened now.&quot; Adriaenssens suggested that a wave of &quot;paranoia&quot; had developed around the flood of allegations coming to light in recent months in Belgium. &quot;There were rumours that the commission was having secret talks with the bishops. Perhaps the investigating magistrate let himself be led by this paranoia.&quot; He added that the raids had thrown into question whether his commission would be able to continue its work. It was set up years ago but had vegetated until this year when the sexual abuse allegations and revelations spread rapidly across the world. The commission&apos;s previous head had complained of a lack of co-operation from the church authorities. Police sources told the Flemish newspaper De Standaard that the raids were carried out because of suspicions that church leaders were failing to hand over all the necessary materials to the commission of inquiry. That was not confirmed by Adriaenssens. Last month the Belgian bishops&apos; conference issued a pastoral letter pleading for forgiveness both for the sexual abuse by many clergy and for the cover-ups and &quot;silence&quot; that then followed. &quot;Through the silence priority was given to the reputation of the church institution or the clergyman over the dignity of the child as victim,&quot; said the letter.", "sentences": ["Adriaenssens was in Amsterdam in the Netherlands on Wednesday when his offices were raided."], "title": "Catholic headquarters in Belgium focus of police raids in sex abuse cases", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/24/belgium-catholic-church-sex-claims", "tags": ["Catholicism", "Belgium", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-24T20:52:05Z", "article": "Though by no means as ambitious as Ton Koopman&apos;s previous project to record all of Bach&apos;s cantatas, this is the first volume of a projected survey of all 12 of Haydn&apos;s London symphonies with the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra.

The holes in the budgets of the world&apos;s poorest countries seldom garner such attention. But the decisions of a meeting currently taking place in Amsterdam could offer these nations a historic opportunity to replenish public coffers, by cracking down on the corruption and state-looting that is too often enabled by the world&apos;s most respected banks. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body that sets international anti-money laundering standards and assesses laws designed to keep dirty money out of the financial system. It meets largely under the radar, but the processes it recommends have major implications for how the world&apos;s financial system works. Items on the agenda this week include how to deal with terrorists, drug lords, tax havens and corrupt politicians. So far, the task force has been effective in getting banks to implement better controls against the financing of terrorism. This includes checking that their customers are not terrorists. But efforts to ensure that banks do not accept the proceeds of corruption have been far less impressive. This may be changing, thanks to a steer from the G20, which at its summit in Pittsburgh last year, told FATF to get serious about stamping out corruption and plugging the gaps in the regulatory system that allow corrupt politicians to hide behind a veil of corporate secrecy. This must happen if we are to have any hope of stopping billions of dollars from flowing out of the world&apos;s poorest countries. In 2008, Africa received $44bn (\u00a329.5bn) in international aid. In the same year, the continent exported oil and minerals worth $393bn. Many of the poorest countries could lift their populations out of poverty with their natural resource revenues. One of the biggest things stopping them is the willingness of the international financial system to accept looted funds. The flow of corrupt funds into the banks of the developed world is a disaster for the world&apos;s poor. Some estimates put this transfer of wealth as high as $40bn a year. Earlier this month, in a small London court, the sister and the mistress of James Ibori, a Nigerian state governor, were both sentenced to five years in jail for helping him to launder millions of dollars of stolen national funds. Ibori is just one of a number of Nigerian governors accused of using the UK&apos;s financial system to hide stolen assets: Diepreye Alamieyeseigha and Joshua Dariye have both had their assets frozen and returned to Nigeria. The former pleaded guilty to money laundering in July 2007, while the latter faces trial in Nigeria. The UK is not the only destination of choice for those looking to hide and launder looted funds. The US continues to play host to Teodorin Obiang, playboy son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, another African country whose oil should make it comfortably off, but whose population languish in poverty because of corrupt rulers. Major US bank Riggs \u2013 once used by Abraham Lincoln \u2014 collapsed in 2005 following a Senate investigation into its banking for the Obiangs. Yet the American government has still not taken action against Teodorin, who, despite his official salary of only four or five thousand dollars a month, owns a $35 million mansion and is building a 200ft luxury yacht complete with a shark tank. Since Pittsburgh, FATF has restarted its process of naming and shaming countries that aren&apos;t making the grade in stopping flows of dirty money. But much more needs to be done. With G20 support, FATF should push for every country to have a register of the ultimate &quot;beneficial ownership&quot; of all registered companies. This would mean knowing who was ultimately behind a chain or group of companies \u2013 and would make it easier to track where the money is coming from and who it belongs to. Effectively, it would become much harder for terrorists, proliferators and corrupt politicians, to hide their dirty money behind a veil of corporate secrecy. The message from the meeting this week must be clear and strong: that FATF is ready and willing to act to stop banks from facilitating corruption that is keeping millions of people poor. If it does not act soon the world&apos;s poorest people will continue to be robbed blind by their political leaders with the full complicity of the western financial system.", "sentences": ["But the decisions of a meeting currently taking place in Amsterdam could offer these nations a historic opportunity to replenish public coffers, by cracking down on the corruption and state-looting that is too often enabled by the world&apos;s most respected banks."], "title": "West's financial system must stop flow of dirty money | Anthea Lawson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/25/west-financial-system-dirty-money", "tags": ["World news", "G20"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-26T16:14:00Z", "article": "After all the talk of Brazil and Argentina, perhaps it is time we started taking Uruguay more seriously when it comes to potential South American champions. Oscar Tab\u00e1rez&apos;s side may not play with the same flair and commitment to attack, but Luis Su\u00e1rez demonstrated here why he is so revered and the draw has been as inviting for La Celeste as they could possibly have dared hope. Sixty years after their last triumph, the two-time winners will certainly fancy their chances in a quarter-final against Ghana on Friday, their first appearance in the last eight since 1970. Uruguay might not be particularly attractive to watch but they are compact, organised and disciplined. They do not go in for little backheels or stepovers but they are drilled in the art of togetherness, and it makes them a tough side to crack, given that they are also blessed with one of the more prolific strikers in the competition. Su\u00e1rez was the scorer of both Uruguay goals and the second, nine minutes from the end, is guaranteed its place on the shortlist for goal of the tournament. He now has 55 goals in 61 games for club and country and with a record like that it is no surprise so many of Europe&apos;s leading clubs are retracing well-worn steps to the Amsterdam Arena and fluttering their eyelashes in the direction of the Ajax striker. It was an extraordinary goal in an otherwise ordinary match. The strange thing was that the rain in Port Elizabeth was so torrential at that stage that most of the fans in the lower sections had already deserted the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. They may love football in South Africa, but not if it means getting soaked, it seems. Even when the game kicked off in fading sunshine there were large expanses of empty seats, and when Su\u00e1rez celebrated by running behind the goal, it was to an almost deserted end. No matter. Those who braved the conditions witnessed why Su\u00e1rez was named Eredivisie&apos;s footballer of the year last season and, at the age of 23, is already entrusted with the captaincy of Holland&apos;s biggest club. A counter-argument says that Afonso Alves and Mateja Kezman scored goals for fun in the Netherlands before failing spectacularly in England, but what cannot be disputed is the explosive quality attached to that moment; with the game threatening to slip away from Uruguay for the first time in the afternoon, the ball fell to Su\u00e1rez on the corner of the penalty area and he conjured up a goal out of nothing. This was the moment Su\u00e1rez came to life. He knew where he wanted to shoot from, turning outside a couple of challenges, making the angle that little bit more obliging, then unleashing a diagonal shot of power and precision. The ball had come to him from a partly cleared corner and the penalty area was still packed. His shot dipped and curled its way through everyone and in off the far post. &quot;The most important goal I have scored,&quot; he said later, &quot;and one of the most beautiful.&quot; Tab\u00e1rez described the match-winner as &quot;touched by something very special&quot;. Su\u00e1rez&apos;s first was far more mundane and will have to be marked down as yet another goalkeeping mistake - the story of this World Cup - because of the way Jung Sung-ryong misjudged the trajectory of Diego Forl\u00e1n&apos;s low cross. The Korean defenders, to a man, had expected Jung to gather the ball and were rooted to the spot as Su\u00e1rez arrived at the far post to score into an exposed goal. That was after eight minutes and the early breakthrough meant Uruguay could sit back and try to hit their opponents on the counterattack. It did not help the match as a spectacle but the tactic was understandable. They had not conceded a goal in the group stages and if they had held out here their goalkeeper, Fernando Muslera, would have gone into Friday&apos;s quarter-final knowing another clean sheet would equal the World Cup record, set by Walter Zenga for Italy in 1990, of five in a row. Instead, Muslera was culpable for South Korea&apos;s equaliser - not with a mistake as bad as Jung&apos;s but a mistake, nonetheless. The goalkeeper made a bad call trying to reach a high ball after a misdirected attempt by Mauricio Victorino to clear a free-kick and he was left stranded as Lee Chung-yong, the Bolton player, headed in. South Korea will reflect on several other chances during a second half in which their opponents attacked only in flashes. In particular, they will look back on Lee running clear two minutes after his equaliser, only to shoot weakly at Muslera and the chance, three minutes from the end, when the substitute Lee Dong-gook saw a shot squirt beneath the goalkeeper only for the ball not to have enough pace to creep over the line. The Koreans, though, were too naive in their defending throughout the entire tournament, conceding an average of two goals per match, and Su\u00e1rez was ruthless enough to punish them.", "sentences": ["He now has 55 goals in 61 games for club and country and with a record like that it is no surprise so many of Europe&apos;s leading clubs are retracing well-worn steps to the Amsterdam Arena and fluttering their eyelashes in the direction of the Ajax striker."], "title": "Uruguay 2-1 South Korea | World Cup 2010 match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/26/world-cup-2010-uruguay-south-korea", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Uruguay", "South Korea", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-06-28T21:24:01Z", "article": "The French team was booked to fly home in economy class after its early exit from the World Cup, while the Italians were greeted with cries of &quot;Shame on you&quot; when they arrived home after they were booted out.

It was the 1974 World Cup in Germany that gave the Dutch a glimpse of football at its breathtaking best and the world, seeing such a spectacle for the first time, christened the flurry of orange: total football.  \u2022 Follow the Guardian&apos;s World Cup team on Twitter\u2022 Sign up to play our daily Fantasy Football game\u2022 Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player\u2022 The latest quarter-final news, features and more  It was a combination of formation, tactics and team mentality that caught the world off guard. Total football did not strike the legendary manager Rinus Michels like a bolt from the blue but was, in fact, a style of play that emerged originally through two rival teams: Ajax Amsterdam and Feyenoord Rotterdam. While Michels and the peerless Johan Cruyff formed their strategy in Amsterdam a similar pattern was emerging in Rotterdam under the guidance of the equally legendary Ernst Happel. It was Ajax, however, who supplied the definitive changes and true innovation while Happel&apos;s Feyenoord played a supportive role in providing players who were technically able to fit into the system Michels and Cruyff had devised. The recipe settled upon for what became known as total football consisted of (1) Two wingers running alongside the central forward providing maximum width (2) A compact defensive unit using the offside trap \u2013 the game against Uruguay in 1974 featured some outrageous moves to catch the opposition offside near the halfway line \u2013 to deny any space at all for the opposition (3) Offering maximum space when attacking while retaining complete possession of the ball (4) Players interchanging positions to offer attacking options from unexpected places on the pitch. The full-backs, in particular, were vital as they were often critical for breaking down defensive teams by overlapping their winger. The &quot;total&quot; in total football came from the idea that the whole team attacked as one, defended as one and that the players were completely interchangeable. As with all ideal situations there is often a key component or circumstance that&apos;s required in order for the plan to function. In this case the successful implementation of total football was a direct result of the success of Feyenoord and Ajax in the early 1970s. The starting line-up for the Dutch against the West Germany in the 1974 final included three players from Feyenoord, five players from Ajax as well as Cruyff who had only just departed Ajax for Barcelona. The other outfield player, Rob Rensenbrink, played in Belgium and notably found it difficult adapting to the style and system that the other players seemed to understand instinctively. It was the familiarity of the system that provided the launchpad for the incredible displays in 1974. Total football is not a formation but a mentality that requires all the players on the pitch to be fully aware of their team-mates&apos; movements and intentions in order to fill in correctly as needed or create a successful scoring opportunity. Ajax predictably faltered once Cruyff and Michels left. The Oranje still made the final in 1978 but total football, as the world knew it, was on the decline as those who took the idea to heart were separated by age, money and desire. The delicious attacking displays the Dutch had gifted to the world were in essence a perfect storm and indeed continue to warm the hearts of those who can recall them. In truth total football has not been seen in a long while and has become a sort of Dutch football utopia to which we always aspire. As with almost every utopia, however, the realisation that we must make do with the people we have around us often defeats the joy and hope. The 2010 incarnation of the Oranje arrived in South Africa with the typical buzzwords accompanying them. It&apos;s hard to fault those supporters who thought they were in for a treat as the Dutch trounced not only Hungary but also fellow quarter-finalists Ghana in warm-up matches. It&apos;s also natural that supporters would want a team to play the way &quot;they know they can&quot;, in this case referring to total football. Most serious footballing nations have a clear notion of what kind of football they play. If you&apos;re Brazilian the sele\u00e7\u00e3o should play as they did in 1982. In the Netherlands it&apos;s common to hear someone console themselves after losing by saying : &quot;At least they played well.&quot; This isn&apos;t an uncommon reaction for a Dutch supporter but at some point the next step is required. Bert van Marwijk wants to win the World Cup with Holland. This statement shouldn&apos;t create too much of a stir but expanding on it makes the Dutch uneasy: the coach will do what is necessary to win the World Cup. If Van Marwijk is anything at all it is a pragmatist. He will be the first person to recognise that within his squad of 23 players he has no one who matches the quality or versatility of Johan Neeskens or Cruyff or the other stars of 1974. It is unreasonable to expect the current generation of Dutch players to play total football. Regrettably, it simply isn&apos;t possible unless one is willing to accept inevitable defeat \u2013 particularly with Brazil looming. The way in which Brazil brushed aside the wonderfully attacking and free-flowing Chile should serve as a warning to those who maintain the Dutch are honour-bound to play unrestrained attacking football. True, their performances need to improve \u2013 but to expect the impossible from the current group is to invite disappointment.

Across the net was the world No82, Tsvetana Pironkova, and the prize at stake was a place in the final. There was a time when Zvonareva would likely have buckled under the pressure. She has long been seen as a talented flake. In her only other grand slam semi-final, at the Australian Open last year, she lost in straight sets and then petulantly put all the blame on the fact that the organisers had closed the roof. Yesterday she simply dug deeper and battled back. She took the next two sets, winning 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, and will play the red-hot favourite Serena Williams in Saturday&apos;s final. &quot;I don&apos;t care what everyone says,&quot; Zvonareva said when asked how she felt about being such an underdog. &quot;I know if I play my best tennis I can beat anyone on the other side of the net. That&apos;s what I am going to try to do on Saturday. I never look at odds. It is not important to me.&quot; After that Australian Open semi-final Zvonareva reached a career-high ranking of No5. Shortly afterwards she tore two ligaments in her ankle, and while she was back playing when Wimbledon came around that summer, her form had slumped. She was ranked 21 coming into these Championships. In the US Open last September she collapsed in spectacular fashion after squandering six match points against Flavia Pennetta. She burst into tears, smashed her racquet, tore the strapping off her knee and swore at the umpire. The following winter she received intensive physio and fitness work alongside Arsenal&apos;s Robin van Persie at a medical centre in Amsterdam. The persistent ankle problems have finally been shrugged off, but better still she has discovered new depths of resilience. This was the second match in succession in which she has come back from a set-down. She did it against Kim Clijsters in the quarters, and, while Pironkova may not have been such a tough opponent, the way she bossed the first set suggested that Zvonareva would struggle to come back. &quot;I started really well,&quot; agreed Pironkova, &quot;but Vera started to play amazingly in the second set and in the third one.&quot; Pironkova played cannily at first, taking pace off the ball and waiting for opportunities to unleash her majestic forehand. But Zvonareva stepped it up. &quot;Her strokes were so powerful,&quot; said Pironkova. &quot;Forehand, backhand ... her serve was consistent as well.&quot;", "sentences": ["The following winter she received intensive physio and fitness work alongside Arsenal&apos;s Robin van Persie at a medical centre in Amsterdam."], "title": "Wimbledon 2010: Vera Zvonareva dispels choker tag to reach final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/01/vera-zvonareva-wimbledon-final-tennis", "tags": ["Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport", "Wimbledon 2010"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-01T20:00:31Z", "article": "Peter Mandelson promises frank revelations when his memoirs are published in two weeks&apos; time. Well he would, wouldn&apos;t he? The book&apos;s self-aware title, The Third Man, plays to the attention-seeking part of his personality as well as to the secretive side \u2013 and not, as far as I am aware, to any unsatisfied taste for cricketing reminiscences. But like those other third men, Harry Lime and Kim Philby, Mandelson is a man of parts, some of them underestimated strands of the full picture, which is still too easily dismissed as an overriding obsession with the high life and the political black arts. One of these strands is Mandelson&apos;s longstanding effort to get the Labour party and the social democratic parties of Europe to speak frankly to each other about common problems and strategies. This is harder than you may suppose; the big parties often think they have nothing to learn, though lessons to teach, at international gatherings. But a collective downturn has taught some humility. This week, though with Mandelson absent, his Policy Network group met in Amsterdam to discuss social democracy&apos;s plight. It was a sobering reality check for a political tradition and a group of parties which today all face problems of electoral marginalisation and political eclipse. The historic decline of social democratic parties across western Europe has converged very strikingly in the past year. Twelve months ago, the parties of the left polled just 25% overall in the European parliamentary elections. Since then, especially in northern Europe, the same pattern has continued at national level: 22% in the Luxembourg general elections, 23% in Germany, 29% in the UK two months ago, 20% in the Netherlands and 14% in Belgium. Even in Sweden, once the iconic bastion of northern European social democracy, polls put the social democrats on 30% in advance of September&apos;s general election. True, there have been better performances in southern Europe \u2013 where parties of the left won poisoned-chalice victories in Portugal and Greece on 37% and 44% respectively \u2013 while the social democrats&apos; 35% score in Norway&apos;s general election last year confirmed them as the country&apos;s largest single party. French socialists also have hopes, especially under Dominique Strauss-Kahn, of ousting Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012. Even taking these exceptions into account, it is a notably consistent pattern. Parties of the left are in retreat across most of Europe. The parties&apos; majoritarian ambitions are mocked by a succession of recent election results that show most of them with the support of fewer than one in three voters, and in several countries \u2013 including the important example of Germany \u2013 less than a quarter. In most cases, the historic electoral hegemony of the social democratic parties has been in decline for years, its forward march fragmented by the rise of greens, liberals, nationalists and the militant left. It is true that a similar process has been happening on the right, but not to the same extent. Parties of the right have shown a greater capacity to reinvent. Think Berlusconi, Cameron, Sarkozy. Hopes that the financial crisis and the recession would generate a social democratic moment have proved to be fantasies. The excited talk of two years ago on the left that the state was back, that the era of big government and strong regulation was poised to resume, and that the late 20th-century unravelling of equality would now go into reverse has proved a chimera. Yet this experience does not seem to have lessened the attractions of a revived social democratic political economy in many of these parties. Quite the contrary. In Germany, the response to the party&apos;s electoral humiliations has been to push the debate in the party to the left, with an emerging programme based on restricting markets and promoting the virtue of the welfare state. Here in Britain, meanwhile, the debates between the Labour leadership candidates have had a similar dynamic. This week Ed Miliband put a revived &quot;21st-century social democracy&quot; at the heart of his own leadership campaign. Miliband has always seen himself as a social democrat, even in the years when the term was almost as unfashionable as socialism in Labour circles, and in this week&apos;s speech he called on his party to &quot;turn the page on New Labour orthodoxy&quot;, with a different kind of economic model based around industrial policy, stronger regulation and the promotion of &quot;responsibility&quot; in the boardroom. In many ways the most striking part of his speech was the passage in which Miliband mounted an unapologetic defence of the state. The coalition&apos;s &quot;campaign to denigrate and deride the state is wrong&quot;, he said. As plain political speaking goes, this could hardly get plainer. Yet I suspect that if the former Dutch Labour leader Wouter Bos had been listening to Miliband, his response would have been equally direct. &quot;What about the middle class?&quot; he would have asked. Social democratic parties no longer understand middle-class voters, Bos warned this week. They don&apos;t grasp how much of the working class thinks of itself as middle class, think of themselves as payers not beneficiaries where government fiscal policy is concerned, think of themselves as people with a lot to lose from too much state intervention, and regard fiscal prudence as a virtue. Appeals to solidarity and the state, says Bos, do not address middle-class anxieties. That&apos;s why we lose elections. It is a fair response to Bos to say that if he is so right, how come his party ended the recent Dutch election with the support of only one in five voters? Not much evidence of middle-class support there. But it is a fair response to Miliband and many in the German SPD who think like him, to say that, while a newly calibrated 21st-century social democracy may be nobler than the compromises favoured by Bos, there is little evidence that it is any more electorally successful. If that is correct, then maybe the real choice for social democrats in the 21st century is a more modest one than Labour, in particular, is used to \u2013 a choice between being a party which is essentially defensive of the welfare state, employment rights and redistributive principles, and a party which exists essentially to participate in coalitions of modestly ameliorative compromise with greens and social liberals. The two are not always at odds with one another, of course, but each is based on a recognition that, for European social democrats, the era of majority single-party rule is running out. That&apos;s a tough lesson. Labour, like several of its sister parties, is still struggling to come to terms with it.", "sentences": ["This week, though with Mandelson absent, his Policy Network group met in Amsterdam to discuss social democracy&apos;s plight."], "title": "A tough lesson: Labour may never win alone again | Martin Kettle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/europe-social-democrats-elections", "tags": ["Labour", "Politics", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Angela Merkel", "Germany", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "France", "Luxembourg", "Belgium", "Sweden", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-02T11:41:01Z", "article": "Drake has cancelled his British and European tour, citing his mother&apos;s medical problems.

They have designer printed shoes and also basic ones: black, white and dark blue for \u20ac15 (12.40) - or \u20ac4 (\u00a33.30) on sale. As you all know, Slovenia was once a part of Yugoslavia. In those days things from the west were either hard to get or outrageously expensive. Because of that young folks didn&apos;t drink Coca-Cola but Cockta (which you should try because it&apos;s great) and they also didn&apos;t have (well\u2026 at least the majority didn&apos;t have) All Star sneakers. But they had Startas shoes, made in Croatia. They were really popular in the 80s but people forgot about them in the 90s when Yugoslavia felt apart. Thanks to designer Mauro Massarotto the brand got a fresh design in 2006. I&apos;m a kid of new post-communist Slovenia, so before the renaissance I had no idea about Startas. Now that I know about them and own a pair (or two or three) I would just like to say: thank you Croatia! \u2022 Borovo (see on map), Tav\u010darjeva ulica 1.

In the hands of young Dutch artist Sem\u00e2 Bekirovic, however, this double act seems an endlessly fascinating, human quirk. The 32-year-old Amsterdam-based artist tackles the ongoing struggle between culture and nature with wit and offbeat intelligence. Though her work includes sculpture, video, photography and drawing, it often feels more like an experiment with chance. She&apos;s made a sculpture from smoke contained in a glass box, and she&apos;s used snails to mess up the simple order of a geometric drawing with a random trail of slime. What looked like a series of abstract geometric spray paintings were actually incinerated wooden shelves, rescued from a house fire. Bekirovic brings a touching sense of futility to these attempts to harness disorder, summed up in her photographic series, Maps. This depicts large paper maps crumpled into the shape of mountains, or draped like waterfalls \u2013 their cartography an even paler imitation of the real thing than the artist&apos;s ad-hoc sculptures. Ideas from the realm of physics have recently caught Bekirovic&apos;s interest. Her current exhibition, at London&apos;s Hayward Project Space, riffs on the relationship between matter, space and the friction between the two. Here those classic instruments of chance, white dice \u2013 fresh from the factory, paint-free \u2013 have been configured into an ethereal-looking sculpture, hanging from the ceiling like a wisp of cloud or an atomic model. In one of the show&apos;s video works, a man dressed as a black hole walks towards the camera until the big circle of nothingness on his chest seems to swallow everything. The world might be chaotic, she suggests, but that doesn&apos;t stop us trying to give it shape. Why we like her: In Koet (2007), an ingenious piece of animal art, , Bekirovic collaborated with coots, coaxing the water birds into building their nests with her own possessions. Realised as a photobook and slide show, the work shows the birds making off with money, bits of comic book, pink ribbons and photos, and weaving them into hippyish, ragtag nests. It&apos;s an endearing experiment in letting go \u2013 both of your material belongings and artistic control. Daddy cool: Bekirovic says her romantic image of science goes back to her dad: a trained physicist and backyard inventor. His greatest creation was a magic carpet, which he explained to his children in a series of highly detailed diagrams. If challenged on its veracity, he would claim that the only thing preventing him making it were the materials \u2013 far too expensive. Where can I see her?

Images come in media ranging through performance-based video, snapshot photography and cartoon animation.

QUAD, Sat to 5 Sep Robert Clark Alice Neel, London Alice Neel&apos;s considered one of the 20th century&apos;s great portraitists, yet success came late for the single mum who pioneered her unfashionable figurative painting for decades unnoticed, while the boys&apos; club of abstract expressionism and then minimalism and pop art held sway. As this first survey of her work in a UK public gallery makes clear, whether painting her family or neighbours in Spanish Harlem, pregnant women or the New York art world, for Neel, portraiture was an act of revelation. Her famed painting of Andy Warhol as a pallid martyr, half-naked with bullet scars, is one of 60 works here, tracing how Neel became adept at mining her subject&apos;s inner life, laying it bare with unsettling acuity. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Thu to 17 Sep Skye Sherwin Russell Mills And Ian Walton, Ambleside It&apos;s 62 years since exiled German artist Kurt Schwitters died in Ambleside, yet the influence of his radical cut-and-paste works pervades all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Here Russell Mills and Ian Walton pay joint homage to the great dadaist with an exhibition titled Forward To Far, Telescoping Time From Schwitters To Now. Mills and Walton update Schwitters&apos;s use of collage and assemblage to a world in which we&apos;re all bombarded by an overdose of multimedia, so much of it seemingly alluding to the terminal mess we are collectively making of the environment. Yet for all Mills and Walton&apos;s air of dreadful concern, the overall effect of their installations is of a fragmentary charm. Deeply romantic art that is ultimately celebratory. The Armitt Collection, to 30 Oct Robert Clark Paul Sietsema, London Paul Sietsema makes sculptures, drawings and films, but his chief material seems to be uncertainty. A previous ruse included a paint-blotted cutting of a newspaper review of his work that turned out to be his own meticulous ink drawing. Sietsema&apos;s painstakingly realised art-about-art may be chock-full of theory, but it can be as physically compelling as it is brainy. In his latest film, what could be aged footage of primitivist paintings turn out to be the scarred work surfaces of his studio, while a seemingly candid lecture on his work is partly culled from the thoughts of Jean Dubuffet. Interpretations slide around; time becomes an illusion; art changes shape as it&apos;s passed from the artist to its audience. Cubitt Gallery, N1, Sat to 8 Aug Skye Sherwin Urban Origami, London Future megalopolises are built from junk as city limits evaporate and people disappear in this show of work by six artists rethinking what the urban landscape can be. Former air steward Gaia Persico imagines a global city in her drawings where horizons snake across the page, binding landmarks from San Fran&apos;s Union Square to Darling Harbour in Sydney. A film by Elisa Sighicelli conjures urban spectacle, as a Shanghai skyscraper sends out a rainbow kaleidoscope of lights, while in one of her photographic lightboxes familiar scaffolding becomes a fantastic structure. Matthew Houlding recycles household flotsam into maquettes of jazzy modernist apartment blocks, while Jools Johnson turns yesterday&apos;s tech, like upturned old computer screws, into tomorrow&apos;s skyscrapers. PM Gallery and House, W5, to 29 Aug Skye Sherwin Spencer Tunick, Salford Spencer Tunick is the artist who has notoriously photographed large groups of astoundingly unselfconscious naked souls at sites ranging from an Amsterdam car park through to the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. It is interesting to see him now posing his participants in compositions that refer to the work of another artist and at sites that are far from obviously noteworthy. While LS Lowry&apos;s exploited masses of weary mill workers could not be more culturally at odds with Tunick&apos;s liberated naturists, Lowry&apos;s swarming compositions here provide a potent framework for cloudy day gatherings in such local landscapes as Peel Park and the Concorde hangar of Manchester Airport. The Lowry, to 26 Sep Robert Clark Andrew Cross, Birmingham A series of colour photographs shows an apparently common English field as it passes from dawn to dusk. It turns out that the subject of the images, collectively titled Hats Off To Roy Harper, is the site of the 1970s&apos; renowned Knebworth rock festivals. An accompanying twin-screen projection features an elaborate drum solo specially performed for Cross&apos;s camera by Carl Palmer (yes, he of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer prog supergroup fame). As Palmer builds his solo from single snare, through brushes, cymbals and felt beaters into a full drum onslaught, Cross&apos;s close-up focus and minimalist editing defiantly and almost provocatively rescues a musical genre from cultural obsolescence. Ikon Eastside, to 25 Jul Robert Clark Surreal Friends, Chichester The reappraisal of women surrealists gathers more steam with this show focusing on the lives and work of three friends: the British artist Leonora Carrington, the Hungarian Kati Horna and Spaniard Remedios Varo. Variously escaping personal and political traumas in war-torn Europe where Varo and Carrington had worked in the shadow of their surrealist lovers, these women pioneered their own vision in Mexico City. In one of Varo&apos;s best-known paintings, an owl-woman conducts an alchemical art experiment bringing painted birds to light by moonlight, a sister to Carrington&apos;s menagerie of mythic creatures. As a photographer, Horna was as attuned to real-world hardships as she was to a surrealist sensibility. Here her extraordinary images of women refugees from the Spanish civil war complement symbolic photomontages where female eyes peer out from barred windows.

They employ a dedicated chef, a head of apparel, even a &quot;mechanic of the mind&quot;. But yesterday, as the Tour de France got underway with a 5.5-mile individual time-trial around the streets of Rotterdam, it emerged that one thing the team could not control was, well, the sky. The gamble to send out their team leader Bradley Wiggins in an early time slot backfired, as the rain and brisk winds that were predicted for later in the day arrived ahead of schedule. The 30-year-old recorded a disappointing 10min 56sec, leaving him in 76th place, almost a minute behind the prologue winner, Fabian Cancellara. In the initial skirmishes for the overall classification, Lance Armstrong inflicted a satisfying five-second deficit on last year&apos;s champion Alberto Contador. David Millar, riding in his ninth Tour, was the highest-placed Briton in third. A silver lining for Team Sky was the performance of Wiggins&apos; track team-mate Geraint Thomas, who spent much of the afternoon in second place before dropping to fifth. After crossing the line, he was stoic about the treacherous conditions. &quot;You can&apos;t affect the rain,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s just bike racing, that&apos;s the risk you take. We decided to go off early and that&apos;s that.&quot; The Welshman, who recently became the British road race champion, even had the good humour to deal with a Dutch version of Dennis Pennis. The reporter started by asking Thomas if he was enjoying Amsterdam \u2013 which Thomas corrected \u2013 before advising him to avoid the Dutch capital because &quot;you won&apos;t pass the doping test&quot;. Thomas replied, &quot;I don&apos;t party anyway, I live like a monk,&quot; before pedalling off to the sanctuary of the team bus. Despite the conditions, the Rotterdammers were certainly in good spirits, screaming for three hours like they were experiencing a sudden flashback to Wesley Sneijder&apos;s goal against Brazil. Their trademark orange was replaced by walls of yellow plastic macs handed out by the Tour caravan and they bashed branded rumble sticks against the barriers. Cancellara&apos;s comprehensive victory was no great surprise, having won the equivalent time-trials in 2007 and 2009. It does not seem to matter if the course is hilly or flat, short or long, the Swiss rider is so dominant he has recently had to deny charges that he has a tiny motor fitted in the frame of his bike. This might sound outlandish, but &quot;motorised doping&quot; has become a hot topic. An unnamed French rider claimed to have heard a &quot;strange noise&quot; rumbling from Cancellara&apos;s bike, while a YouTube video showing how it could be done has 2.6 million views. It is serious enough for the International Cycling Union to have decided to scan bikes randomly before each stage in the 2010 Tour. When asked to respond, Cancellara spluttered: &quot;It&apos;s so stupid, I&apos;m speechless.&quot; Cancellara also showed his superstitious side, with his intention of riding the whole of the three-week Tour wearing his bib, No13, upside down because he thinks the number might otherwise bring bad luck. Doping of a more conventional nature was also on the agenda as the Wall Street Journal published further allegations from Floyd Landis, the disgraced 2006 Tour &quot;winner&quot; and former team-mate of Armstrong. His claims range from Armstrong entertaining strippers and personally supplying Landis with testosterone patches in front of his wife, to detailed descriptions of blood transfusions that have the pace and subterfuge of film plots. The question is why we should now believe Landis, who lied for many years about his own use of performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong, who has never failed a drugs test and who revealed last week that this would be his final Tour, issued a trademark robust denial. &quot;Landis&apos;s credibility is like a carton of sour milk,&quot; he said. &quot;Once you take the first sip, you don&apos;t have to drink the rest to know it has all gone bad.&quot; It is hard to know if the new allegations inspired the 38-year-old Texan \u2013 he always rides like a man with a feud \u2013 but after the prologue he revealed he felt in much better shape than year, when he finished third. &quot;That was the best time-trial I have done since the comeback,&quot; he said. &quot;If you had told me before the start, &apos;Sign up right now for fifth and put time on your rivals&apos;, I would have grabbed it with both hands. But let&apos;s not get ahead of ourselves. It was a good ride, I felt good, the team went good, but this a long three weeks, beginning tomorrow.&quot; That stage, which covers 139 miles from Rotterdam across the Zeeland polders to Brussels, could be a nervy one for the 197 riders. Cancellara will start in the yellow jersey, and is likely to hold on to it until next weekend, while Millar will wear the green points jersey Mark Cavendish so covets.

Holland were as far from the gilded generation of Cruyff, Neeskens, Krol and Rensenbrink as Dunga&apos;s Brazil were from the team of Pel\u00e9, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o and Clodoaldo. Both teams played football in which pragmatism was the watchword, the heart of each side to be found in the pair of defensive midfielders shielding the back four. If Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong did a better job than Gilberto Silva and Felipe Melo (who made Brazil&apos;s opening goal but then, imbecilically, got himself sent off), then that was probably what swung the match. The memory of Cruyff&apos;s famous goal against Brazil in 1974, volleyed at full stretch on the run from Krol&apos;s cross in a moment of surpassing virtuosity, had accompanied some idealists into Port Elizabeth&apos;s Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, but it soon faded in the light of cold reality, particularly after half-time, when Holland took the sort of grip on the match that they will hope to exert throughout their meeting with Uruguay in Tuesday&apos;s semi-final in Cape Town. Van Marwijk is a realist who has undoubtedly assembled the best team available to him. Unlike the Brazilians, who will now confront Dunga with the charge of having unreasonably neglected the young Santos forwards Neymar and Ganso, no Dutch fan appears to be mourning the absence of a teenaged genius wantonly left behind in Amsterdam. Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben represent the cream, although the skilful and adventurous young forward Eljero Elia, brought on as a substitute in a couple of matches, hints at the heritage of Ruud Gullit and Clarence Seedorf. &quot;A couple of years ago at the European Championship we played two or three good matches, but we also gave opportunities away,&quot; Van Marwijk said, looking back to the previous regime of Marco van Basten, who resigned after elimination in the quarter-finals of Euro 2008. &quot;So when I took this job I stated clearly to the Dutch federation that I wanted to teach the team to defend better \u2013 and that starts with the attackers.&quot; This is a very different conception \u2013 perhaps even an inversion \u2013 of total football, which in its pristine form saw all the defenders at liberty to become attackers when the opportunity presented itself. Although the current head coach may not win the sort of acclaim accorded then and by posterity to Rinus Michels, who refined the original concept and managed the Dutch team to the 1974 final against West Germany, his results are certainly speaking eloquently on behalf of the effectiveness of his philosophy. But the orange shirts of the Holland players and their supporters are generally associated with a more joyful and creative approach to the game than we have seen from them in South Africa, where they seem happy to achieve results by any means. &quot;We still want to achieve the same thing,&quot; Van Marwijk said. &quot;In our last matches before the World Cup we scored 13 goals in three games. But we haven&apos;t scored as many in the tournament, and if you win matches without scoring many goals then the perception of you is different. We don&apos;t want to depend too much on chance. We want to rely on good organisation that doesn&apos;t concede too much to our opponents.&quot; His captain, the enormously experienced 35-year-old Giovanni van Bronckhorst, did not need to italicise the contrast with past tournaments when he spoke of the closeness of the squad. &quot;The atmosphere in the squad is very good,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re a tight group. We&apos;ve been playing for four or six years together and we know each other&apos;s strengths. We fight for each other. It&apos;s good to be part of a team you can trust.&quot; Van Marwijk prepared his players for the Brazil match by telling them to ignore temptation and remain faithful to the steady approach that had taken them to an unbroken string of victories in competitive matches: eight in the qualifying competition and four \u2013 now five \u2013 in the tournament itself. &quot;It&apos;s very important to play our own game and that we don&apos;t go along with Brazil&apos;s way, as some have done,&quot; he said. &quot;We are keen to put a lot of pressure on them. We want to be relaxed, but also tense, which is the way it should be.&quot; But as Brazil cruised through the first half, neglecting several opportunities to increase the 10th-minute lead given them by Robinho, but looking as if they felt they could widen the gap any time they really concentrated, Holland were a bit of a shambles, particularly in attack. Van Persie was failing to make headway against the big Brazilian centre-backs, Sneijder was exerting no influence, and Robben was outnumbered and overpowered whenever he tried to attack down the right. One mark of a good coach is that his team play better in the second half of big matches, and Van Marwijk certainly did something to focus the efforts of his players on Friday. Their most significant success was in getting Robben into direct confrontations with Michel Bastos, the Brazil left-back, who had fouled him several times before the interval. Suddenly Robben was a threat every time he had the ball and his willingness to go to ground at the slightest contact became a significant tactical weapon. Robben&apos;s tricks can be as irritating as Brazil&apos;s trips and nudges, which had started in the very first minute with an unpunished nudge by Juan on Van Persie inside the penalty area and continued throughout the match, greatly reducing any residual sympathy for the losers. They reached their nadir with Melo&apos;s dismissal, the moment at which all hopes of a Brazil comeback evaporated, giving Holland a win from just the sort of performance \u2013 organised, combative, functional \u2013 that Van Marwijk has been seeking, and which may take them further yet.", "sentences": ["Unlike the Brazilians, who will now confront Dunga with the charge of having unreasonably neglected the young Santos forwards Neymar and Ganso, no Dutch fan appears to be mourning the absence of a teenaged genius wantonly left behind in Amsterdam."], "title": "World Cup 2010: Dutch learn to put function above flair | Richard Williams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jul/04/world-cup-dutch-flair", "tags": ["Holland", "Brazil", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-04T23:05:48Z", "article": "Rhum Martinique Saint James produces a civilised range of drinks on an island 4,000 miles from France \u2013 which did not stop it receiving more than \u20ac1m in agricultural subsidies from the EU last year.

We know this thanks to the dogged work of a small organisation, farmsubsidy.org, which has dragged hidden data from 27 EU government websites and collated it online. The evidence both strengthens the case for scrapping the CAP and confirms the impossibility of doing so. Too many people benefit for an agreement on what should be done. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, once promised reform &quot;without restrictions or taboos&quot;. Last year, a draft EU document retreated from change. It was too early to &quot;determine the contours or the exact intention of future reform&quot;, it concluded. Since then, European governments have only grown weaker. None is strong enough to stand up to vested interests. The next EU budget round is more likely to see an assault on the British rebate than real reform of the CAP. Everyone admits there has to be change, but they then disagree on what change means. The CAP is harmful as well as unfair in a multitude of ways. France, Spain and Germany thrive while poorer EU entrants in the east get less. It eats up half the EU budget, but its consequences often harm the environment. Farmers in the developing world also suffer, as last year&apos;s subsidised dumping of milk powder showed. Attempts to steer money towards landscape management, rather than food production, must go further. The Commission for Rural Communities suggests cash would be better spent on producing peat carbon sinks than intensive sugar production. The CAP should be replaced by a smaller, targeted scheme serving green and social goals. One day it will collapse under the weight of its own illogicality.

Scientists have found that a type of EEG (electroencephalography) brain wave is slightly different in people who have siblings with schizophrenia, compared with that seen in the general population. The researchers believe the information could be used to identify those at highest risk and pre-emptively treat them before they develop a full-blown mental disorder. &quot;Unlike in general medicine where we have lots of reliable [biological] markers, such as blood sugar for diabetes, in psychiatry we still rely very much on the behaviours and symptoms a person reports when they go to see a clinician,&quot; said Maddie Groom of the University of Nottingham, who led the work. She said markers of mental illness would not only help predict who was likely to be at risk but also how severe someone&apos;s condition is and how well they are responding to medication. &quot;[Markers] would give us a really big handle not only on what&apos;s causing the disorder but also how best to treat and diagnose it,&quot; she said. In her study, she took EEG recordings from 30 teenagers whose siblings had developed schizophrenia and compared these with EEGs from 36 controls. Schizophrenia is thought to be at least partly inherited, so the siblings of people who have the condition have a slightly increased risk of also developing the disorder. &quot;Their risk is still very small but, nonetheless, when you compare them with people with siblings who don&apos;t have schizophrenia, their risk is still greater than in the general population,&quot; said Groom. The volunteers were asked to perform a task where they had to press a button every time they saw a particular image on a computer screen. They then had to inhibit that response and not press the button when a different stimulus appeared on the screen in its place. &quot;This is a really difficult test to do and people without any mental health problems find it difficult,&quot; said Groom. &quot;But when we measured the brain activity of the siblings of the people with schizophrenia, their brain activity was reduced at the time when they needed to pay attention towards the stimulus and also when they needed to inhibit their response to that stimulus.&quot; While they performed the task, a particular electrical signal known as the P300 wave was significantly reduced in the siblings of schizophrenia patients and in the patients themselves whenever the stimulus they had to ignore appeared on the screen. The p300 marker is thought to reflect attentional and inhibitory control aspects of brain processing. When someone needs to focus on something that is particularly important, and when that something requires an inhibition of a motor response, the P300 marker tends to be larger in people with good mental health. However, Groom stressed that the brain activity of the siblings was not radically different from healthy people and that the marker may be related to the risk of the disorder rather than the disorder itself. &quot;The difference on a case-by-case basis from our healthy group was very small and you wouldn&apos;t be able to pick them out from a crowd, measure their P300 and say that this person is related to someone with schizophrenia,&quot; said Groom. The researchers are also investigating P300 in people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Groom presented her work today at the Forum of European Neuroscience (Fens) conference in Amsterdam. Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge, said: &quot;If we could identify [people at risk of mental disorders] early with biomarkers and treat them early, we could probably get in there before any damage is done and they become relapsing and chronic.&quot; In a separate study, also presented today at Fens, Seth Grant of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge created a catalogue that linked brain disorders to malfunctions in genes involved in making synapses, the junctions between nerve cells. &quot;What we found, in terms of disease, was quite striking \u2013 defects in the genes that encode these human synapse proteins are really a major cause of disease,&quot; he said. &quot;There are over 135 nervous system diseases, psychiatric and neurological, that arise because of defects in these synaptic proteins. These are common and rare diseases \u2013 schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism.&quot; He added: &quot;We recognise that these synapse proteins are the molecular basis for many brain diseases. We know no other molecular structure that is responsible for more brain diseases ... Clinically, there is a wide spectrum of brain diseases and it is unclear how some of those are related to one another and if they are related at all. We can now see that many of them are related to one another because the molecular underpinnings of those diseases are in the synapse proteins which are physically binding to one another. There is a unifying mechanism that underpins a large number of brain diseases.&quot; The findings will help target drugs for mental conditions more accurately in future, said the scientists. When the synapses and their role in disease are fully understood, said Grant, scientists will have scores of new targets to develop drugs against. In addition, a drug would no longer be used to treat, say, only schizophrenia or autism, but would instead treat individual characteristics related to the malfunction of particular genes, which might be common to several diseases.", "sentences": ["Groom presented her work today at the Forum of European Neuroscience (Fens) conference in Amsterdam."], "title": "EEG test may help predict who will develop schizophrenia, claims scientist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jul/05/brain-scans-predict-schizophrenia", "tags": ["Neuroscience", "Medical research", "Science", "Mental health", "Health", "Society", "World news", "Schizophrenia", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-05T23:06:44Z", "article": "&quot;There are countries with more footballers than we have people,&quot; Oscar Tab\u00e1rez said last night while assessing the chances of Uruguay, the team he coaches, making it through today&apos;s World Cup semi-final against Holland. But out of their tiny population the Uruguayans have conjured a wonderful football history studded with remarkable individuals. One of them, a key figure in their early international success, was Jos\u00e9 Andrade. When Andrade was born in Salto, Uruguay&apos;s second city, in 1901, his father was said to be 98 years old, an expert in African magic who had escaped from slavery in Brazil. In the team photograph of the first winners of the World Cup in 1930, Jos\u00e9 stands out: his is the only black face. He began his working life as a carnival musician, shoeshine boy and newspaper seller before becoming a key member of the team that made Uruguay the dominant force in world football in the years when the game&apos;s great international tournaments were coming into existence. With Andrade at right-half, Uruguay won the South American championship in 1923, 1924 and 1926, and the gold medal at the Olympic soccer tournaments in Paris in 1924 and Amsterdam in 1928. The first World Cup, usurping the status of the Olympic competition, was held in Uruguay and it was no surprise when the hosts emerged victorious, coming from behind to beat Argentina 4-2 in the final in front of 93,000 spectators in Montevideo&apos;s newly completed Centenario stadium. They might have enjoyed further success before the second world war had they not declined to travel to Italy in 1934 on the grounds that so few European teams had bothered to cross the Atlantic four years earlier. In 1938 they also boycotted the third World Cup, in France, because the organisers had reneged on a promise to alternate between Europe and South America. The next time they entered, in 1950, they won it again, beating Brazil 2-1 in Rio&apos;s new Maracan\u00e3 stadium. Alcides Ghiggia&apos;s winning goal gave the host nation a new word \u2013 Maracanazo \u2013 to describe any sudden catastrophe. Uruguay is the smallest country to have won the World Cup, with a population of 1.5m in 1930 and just over twice that now, and the smallest in the Conmebol federation, from which its team qualified for this year&apos;s competition after winning a play-off against Costa Rica. Now they have outlasted all of the four continental neighbours \u2014 Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile \u2014 who finished above them in the table. Today&apos;s game \u2013 against opponents they have met on four occasions and beaten three times \u2013 is their third semi-final since 1950, and their performances so far in this tournament have encouraged the hope that they can go one better than their semi-final defeats by Hungary in 1954 and Brazil in 1970. If you want to know what football means to Uruguay, and about the richness of the game&apos;s historyin a country that gained its independence in 1828 and whose current president, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, is a former guerrilla fighter, try to find a copy of Eduardo Galeano&apos;s Football in Sun and Shadow, published 15 years ago. A leftist journalist and novelist, Galeano is his country&apos;s best-known contemporary writer. In childhood he had hoped to become a footballer, and his writings portray the glory and decline of the game in a country where it belongs to no single social class and where the fans still cling to a concept of la garra \u2013 fighting spirit \u2013 which gradually, as the golden years drifted to an end, became synonymous with ruthless physicality. As well as Andrade and Ghiggia, the great names of Uruguayan football history include Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi and Obdulio Varela, the captains of 1930 and 1950; the great striker Juan Schiaffino, who became a hero at Milan; the goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz; the centre-half Jos\u00e9 Santamar\u00eda, a pillar of the great Real Madrid side of the 1950s; and Enzo Francescoli, known \u2013 in several languages \u2013 as the Prince when he wore the No10 shirt of River Plate, Racing Club de France, Marseille and Cagliari in the 1980s and 90s. The best-known figure in Tab\u00e1rez&apos;s squad \u2013 before Luis Su\u00e1rez&apos;s handball against Ghana on Saturday, at any rate \u2013 is Diego Forl\u00e1n, whose 27 goals in 62 appearances for the national team threaten the record held for 80 years by H\u00e9ctor Scarone, a member of the first World Cup-winning team, who plundered 31 goals in 52 games and played for Barcelona and Internazionale. Virtually all Uruguay&apos;s best players have sought their fortune abroad, and although Forl\u00e1n failed at Old Trafford, a move to Spain re-established his reputation as a prolific goalscorer. His father, Pablo Forl\u00e1n, spent many years as a full-back with S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and was a member of Uruguay&apos;s 1966 and 1974 World Cup squads. Not surprisingly, given the intimate proportions of the country, Uruguayan football is full of continuities and coincidences. In 1930, for example, the World Cup-winning side was coached by Alberto Suppici, nicknamed the Professor, while Tab\u00e1rez, his latest successor, is known as the Teacher, acknowledging his first occupation. A quiet 63-year-old whose extensive CV includes spells with Pe\u00f1arol, Boca Juniors and Milan, Tab\u00e1rez talks about his team&apos;s &quot;modest chance&quot; of success and has worked with some success to restore the original definition of la garra, which once meant trickery with the ball rather than brutality. This is his second spell in charge of La Celeste, the first coming in 1990, when the teacher learnt useful lessons. On that occasion he had taken the squad to Europe well before the start of the tournament, beating England 2-1 on a glorious summer evening at Wembley, with Francescoli in full flow, and drawing 3-3 with a full-strength West Germany, the future champions. The tournament itself, however, was a different matter, and they were eliminated by Italy in the second round. &quot;We came up against a problem that arose from the long time that the players were away from the things that for Uruguayans are very significant, like their loved ones, their everyday habits,&quot; he told World Soccer recently. So he decided to keep the team in Montevideo, taking advantage of a climate similar to that of South Africa and virtually forgetting about arranging warm-up matches. &quot;I&apos;ve been working with these players for four years,&quot; he added, &quot;so I just had to make sure they were fit and that they&apos;d recovered after a long season. I didn&apos;t need to play friendlies to draw conclusions.&quot; It seems to have worked, as has his attempt to get his players to enjoy the experience of being at the tournament, whatever the outcome. &quot;A World Cup is a party, a celebration,&quot; he said last night. &quot;What&apos;s happened here is having a very positive impact back home, particularly among young people, children and teenagers and even people in their thirties, who&apos;ve never seen anything like this before. Looking at the other three teams, it&apos;s almost as if we&apos;re at a party to which we haven&apos;t been invited. We haven&apos;t played brilliant football, but we&apos;re here and I don&apos;t think luck is the only reason.&quot; History, too, might have something to do with it.", "sentences": ["With Andrade at right-half, Uruguay won the South American championship in 1923, 1924 and 1926, and the gold medal at the Olympic soccer tournaments in Paris in 1924 and Amsterdam in 1928."], "title": "World Cup 2010: Uruguay is a small nation with a great football history | Richard Williams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jul/06/world-cup-2010-uruguay-history", "tags": ["Uruguay", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-06T14:14:00Z", "article": " Preamble: Here it is, the biggest of the semi-finals: the clash between the tournaments last two unbeaten teams. Holland are favourites, primarily because of their inventive forward players \u2013 with Wesley Scheijder in refulgent form and brittle Arjen Robben and Robin Van Persie set to make a record two consecutive starts, the Uruguayan defence will surely be stretched \u2026. and it&apos;s already perilously close to breaking point, what with injury having claimed captain and centreback Diego Lugano and suspensions ruling out left-back Jorge Fucile and auxiliary goalkeeper Luis Suarez. But Uruguay do still have Diego Forlan, and doubts persist about that Dutch defence, especially with Nigel De Jong no longer on hand to protect it, and Uruguay have also been an admirably contrary presence in this tournament, hammering the hosts and then fiendishly ousting the darlings of the moment, Ghana. So this is no gimme for the Dutch. Nevertheless, I&apos;m saying 2-1 to Holland, with Dirk Kuyt scoring at least once.

But there is one thing that even now no man feels comfortable doing \u2026 one boundary that, even in his sarong-and-nail-varnish-wearing pomp, David Beckham never dared to over-step \u2026 one convention that no shock-rocker has ever had the courage to defy. So we need a pioneer, a ground-breaker. Who amongst ye will be the first man to be seen knitting in public? Here are the teams Uruguay: 1-Fernando Muslera; 3-Diego Godin, 6-Mauricio Victorino, 5-Walter Gargano, 16-Maximiliano Pereira, 22-Martin Caceres, 15-Diego Perez, 11-Alvaro Pereira, 17-Egidio Arevalo, 7-Edinson Cavani, 10-Diego Forlan. Netherlands: 1-Maarten Stekelenburg; 12-Khalid Boulahrouz, 3-John Heitinga, 4-Joris Mathijsen, 5-Giovanni van Bronckhorst; 7-Dirk Kuyt, 6-Mark van Bommel, 10-Wesley Sneijder, 14-Demy de Zeeuw, 11-Arjen Robben; 9-Robin van Persie.Referee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)  Match pointers \u2022 These sides have met on four occasions in total, with Uruguay winning three times and the Dutch one \u2022 The two sides&apos; only previous meeting in the World Cup came in 1974 when the Dutch won 2-0 in a group game, with Jonny Rep netting both goals. Diego Forl\u00e1n&apos;s father, Pablo, was on the losing side \u2022 Wesley Sneijder has now scored five goals in his last seven internationals \u2022 Uruguay have already broken their own record, set in 2002, for games played in a single World Cup, including qualifying rounds. The South Americans have played 25 games, and are guaranteed to play two more including tomorrow&apos;s match \u2022 Three of Diego Forl\u00e1n&apos;s four goals in World Cup finals history have come from outside the box  7:10pm: As ITV&apos;s panel prattling on about how surprising it is to see harmony in the Dutch camp - exagerrating the divisions of the past and reinforcing the view that English society remains stubbornly anti-intellectual (and anti-male knitting), afraid of anyone who does not fear to speak his mind - let&apos;s see what&apos;s happening in Uruguay. &quot;There could be some unhappy brides here in Montevideo right now,&quot; writes Nick Foster of www.uruguaynow.com. &quot;The main Registry Office in the Old Town will close its doors at 3 pm local time (so in a few minutes), so a number of weddings scheduled for this afternoon had to be rushed through this morning. Meanwhile, there has been a run on tranquilizers in local chemists and city hospitals are primed for a spike in heart attacks later today. As you can imagine, there is tension and excitement here in equal measure. And there still may be a few neutrals cheering on Uruguay: British novelist Martin Amis, who is a regular visitor, told local paper El Pa\u00eds that Uruguayans are the &quot;most charming and civilized&quot; people he&apos;s ever met. Of course, this was pre-Su\u00e1rez...&quot;  7:13pm: &quot;I watched Spielberg&apos;s &apos;Munich&apos; again yesterday - a film about a gang of men travelling across continents to avenge a despicable act of grotesquery,&quot; reveals Steven Hughes. &quot;I wonder if it&apos;s in Luis Su\u00e1rez&apos;s DVD collection? Please, everyone, send all of your spare false beards, monocles and latex fake noses to Holland, care of AFC Ajax. Thank you.&quot;  7:16pm: &quot;I can&apos;t think of a single team that has benefited even once by sticking with underperforming starters, especially the star non-goal-scorers,&quot; carps Michael Clarke. &quot;They&apos;ve all been burnt. Spain: Torres. Holland: van Persie. USA: Altidore. England: ehem... Brazil: Kaka. Portugal: Ronaldo. Argentina: Messi. So how many goals in total have this group come through with in the end, two? On the other hand, a team like Paraguay that had the sense to sit some non-performers did unusually well in the quarterfinals and suddenly found much greater punch. It will be very interesting to see whether Spain sticks with Torres. Shame to see van Persie on the field again, however.&quot; Your point is a fair one - except for the implication that Argentina should have dropped Messi, who performed well even if he didn&apos;t score - and I agree that it would be a major surprise if Spain didn&apos;t drop Torres because they, unlike Holland, have excellent replacements. By contrast, Van Persie at 80% is better than Huntelaar at 100%, I reckon.  7:20pm: &quot;My mate Fred (RIP)&apos;s brother Tom pioneered knitting for men,&quot; claims Dan Smith. &quot;Used to bang out a few stitches in Chesterfield pubs in the early 90s if I remember rightly. Lent me a Fugazi tape once, though I&apos;m not sure the two were connected - straight edge being more about not drinking in difficult spectacles than a bit of &apos;knit one, pearl one&apos;.&quot;  7:23pm: Out trudge the players, looking tense - perhaps because of the stakes of the match, or maybe because of all the formalities Fifa make them endure before kick-off.  National anthems: We all know them by now and Uruguay&apos;s remains more lovable - a sprightly number with menacing undertones. The Dutch one is a grim dirge.  Omen: You may or may not be aware that Uruguayan national team often refer to themselves as &quot;Los Charruas&quot;, who were an indigenous people in South America. Wikipedia tell us that &quot;In situations in which Uruguayans display bravery in the face of overwhelming odds the expression &quot;garra charr\u00faa&quot; (Charr\u00faan claws) is used to refer to victory in the face of certain defeat.&quot; Will there be garra charr\u00faa tonight?  1 min: Within seconds of kick-off Van Bommel crunches into Pereira to win possession for Holland.  2 min: It&apos;s an enterprising start from Uruguay, contrary to expectations. But, also contrary to expectations, Holland have defended solidly so far, notably Mathijsen, who has just nicked the ball off Forlan with a fine challenge. &quot;I have no clue why you brought it up, but if you want to see a man knitting in public, look no further than to the Green Party of Germany, for example Chris Michalak from Bochum,&quot; tips Radbet Grimmig.  4 min: Kuyt goes close! The Uruguayan keeper flapped at a Robben cross and the Liverpool dynamo pounced on the ball 14 yards out but, under pressure, banged his shot over the bar.  6 min: Pereira clearly has a low opinion of Holland&apos;s goalkeeper .... because he&apos;s just tried to beat him from 45 yards. And it was such a wayward effort that billions of viewers all over the world now have a low opinion of Pereira. So it goes.  8 min: Kuyt chugs down the left and hoists in a decent cross. Robben, of all people, tries to out-jump the defender but fails. &quot;In Toronto on Queen Street West (oh the irony) there is a shop that has knitting classes for men,&quot; reports Peter Corway. &quot;You&apos;d want to be one heck of a man to do it though, as there is huge windows at the front of the shop so passer-bys can gawk in and shame the menly-men knitting &apos;til their hearts content.&quot; Reactionaries.  11 min: It&apos;s open stuff so far. Holland threatened to make a breakthrough at one end and then Uruguay hirtled down the other and Cavani picked out Forlan with a beautiful chipped pass ... but it turned out that Forlan had ventured fractionally offside. &quot;Paul, I must protest against your description of our national anthem as a &apos;grim dirge&apos;,&quot; bellows Frank Futselaar. &quot;Not only is it the oldest national anthem in the world, it&apos;s contents are also appealing in that they barely mention the Dutch at all. It was a revolutionary song during the Dutch revolt against the Spanish empire and mentiones both how our founding father was a German and how much we respect the king of Spain. This could be a bit of an issue if we make it to the final.&quot; Thanks for the knowledge. But while it seems the sentiments are laudatory, the tune is still funereal.  14 min: Maxi Pereira races down the right from his right-back berth - epitomising Uruguay&apos;s surprising can-do spirit - but on this occasion it was misguided, for Periera was dispossessed as soon as he entered the Dutch box. &quot;Did I just see that Suarez has a bandage on his finger?&quot; gasps Graeme McNeil. &quot;Did he injure himself while making the save of god? Or is he simply protecting the appropriate digit to give the world the bird when he holds up the world cup on Sunday?&quot;  16 min: A mistake by Vitorino gifts the ball to Van Persie wide on the left. The Arsenal man tricks his way past one defender before Maxi Pereira charges to Uruguay&apos;s rescue. &quot;I was obviously comfortable with my masculinity - or a little confused - as a boy growing up in a mining village in the North-Eastm&quot; admits Robert Spencer. &quot;I learnt to knit from my gran at the age of 6, and attempted to knit my Action Man a scarf. Got bored after a while so had to sew it on to him as it was way too short (my sewing skills came in handy though).&quot;  GOAL! Holland 1-0 Uruguay (Van Bronckhorst 18&apos;) That is an absolute screamer! The full-back collected the ball wide on the left and then simply let fly from 35 yards .... past the keeper&apos;s desperate dive ... and straight into the top corner! If you happened to see Holland&apos;s 2-2 draw with the Republic of Ireland in Amsterdam in September 2000, you&apos;ll know it&apos;s not the first time he&apos;s done that. Here it is, in fact.  20 min: Holland are seeking a second and Uruguay are not coping well with the pressure. Maxi Pareira is booked for a dangerous tackle on Sneijder.  22 min: Holland are denying Uruguay any chance to settle themselves, pressing them high up the pitch and forcing their opponents to fling long hopeful long balls towards Forlan. &quot;I have a friend in Ireland who knit his Action Man an entire kit, including a tent,&quot; exults Meg Fairfax-Fielding. &quot;Of course, he was about 10, and lived in rural Ireland (is that redundant?), so it wasn&apos;t like the whole village was watching and laughing.&quot;  24 min: Maxi Pereira hurls a long cross into the Dutch box and Heitinga looks less than assured under it, scrabbling the ball behind for a corner. &quot;I can&apos;t be the first one to point out that it&apos;s Holland who scored, not Uruguay as it says at the top of your article?&quot; says Alice Elliot, who is, in fact, about the 666th person to point that out. I, in turn, have pointed it out to our technical folks here - because it&apos;s not something I have any control over, would you believe.  25 min: Fight! Fight Fight! After Holland clear a corner, there&apos;s some naughtiness of the ball ... at least that&apos;s what the reactions of both sets of players suggest, and the ref is having a hard job pacifying them. No replay yet so all I can tell you is that De Zeeuw is down in need of treatment having received a boot in the face clearing an attempted overhead kick by Caceres, who&apos;s booked for dangerous play, which seems harsh.  27 min: Sneijder cops a booking do, for his part in the kerfuffle that followed the high kick. His part seemed to entail a lot of gesturing and trash-talking.  29 min: Lovely turn by Van Persie to create space for a clever pass to Robben. As he makes to shoot, Caceres puts in a potentially goal-saving tackle.  31 min: More controversy! This is turning into quite a spiteful encounter. Van Bronckhorst seemed to catch Cavani in the face with his hand as the Uruguayan awaited a cross. The ref saw nothign awry but many fans did, and their booing vociferously as the failure to award a penalty.  33 min: Cavani skitters into the Dutch box and all the way to the by-line. Forlan is awaiting the cut-back ... but Holland get enough defenders in place to block it. &quot;You can&apos;t scoff at sewing and it&apos;s practicality,&quot; asserts Dave Montez. &quot;And I swear it actually helped me get play back in undergrad. The DIY punk girlies totally dug a guy who could sew his own pants or shirt. At least I wasn&apos;t rug hooking. God help Western Civilization once men pick that up.&quot;  35 min: Caceres hurls a mighty throw into the box - Rory Delap would have been proud of that one - but Heitinga heads it clear. Meanwhile, here&apos;s a good point from Malcolm Cullen. &quot;Uruguay have not been getting the rub of the green from the officials - three times in the first 15 minutes incorrect offside decisions cost Uruguay when they had players clear through on goal. As for the Netherland&apos;s goal, van Bommell had a shocking challenge on Gargano, aiming his studs at the Uruguayan&apos;s shin. It&apos;s only because the &apos;dirty, cheating&apos; Latin American got straight up and got on with the game rather than shriek and lie stricken on the floor, like Robben just did.&quot;  37 min: Alvaro Periera crosses from the left. Forlan gets ahead of his marker and nuts just wide. The threat from Uruguay is growing ...  39 min: Kuyt cuts in from the left and shots straight at the keeper.  GOAL! Holland 1-1 Uruguay (Forlan 41) That&apos;s another fine goal! But the keeper&apos;s part in it was embarrassing. Forlan picked up the ball some 32 yards out, swivelled quickly and fired straight at goal with his left foot. It swirled a little, but not enough to justify the keeper allowing the ball to fly into the middle of the goal. Uruguay deserve that.  43 min: Van Bommel perpetrates another foul and again escapes without a booking. It is, at least, a freekick to Uruguay, from wide on the lefte ... but perhaps not too far wide for Forlan to shoot. Indeed not - he sends a powerful curler goal-ward ... but this time the keeper got his body behind it and clutched it competently to his chest.  45 min: Maxi Pereira, who has been haring down the right flank for most of the match, charges forward again, but Kuyt, somehow managing to keep up with him, pokes the ball out for a throw-in. &quot;Does this semi-final represent the most hirsute team in the world cup against the least?&quot; wonders Oliver Dungey. &quot;And does the Jabulani-like shininess of the Dutch heads allow them to travel quicker at altitude?&quot;  45+2 min: Excellent tackle by Godin to nick the ball off Robben at the edge of the Uruguayan box.  Half-time: It&apos;s been an intriguing if not spectacular half and the score is just. Uruguay responded well to falling behind and have exposed the fragility at Holland&apos;s core. Sneijder, Robben and Van Persie have all been quite constrained. Van Bommel is lucky to be on the pitch. As for for Forlan, well, my colleague James Dart tells me that Opta are saying he&apos;s the first player to score three goals from outside the box in a single World Cup since Lothar Matth\u00e4us in 1990. So there.  Half-time thoughts: &quot;I know that the Uruguayans are the designated villains, but don&apos;t the names of the entire Dutch team sound like those of villains fromgothic novels?&quot; gnashes Karl Tulinius. &quot;Vampires: Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Robin van Persie, Demy de Zeeuw. Werewolves: Dirk Kuyt, Wesley Sneijder, Mark van Bommel, Arjen Robben. Mad scientists: Maarten Stekelenburg, John Heitinga, Joris Mathijsen. And to top it all, Khalid Boulahrouz is already called The Cannibal.&quot; &quot;For the Dutch, any game above sea level is at altitude,&quot; tuts William Hawxhurst. &quot;Ian Johnson, a former Boise State, All-American, Running Back, in American Gridiron Football, used to crochet all the time,&quot; reports Scott Davenport.  ITV intrigue: A surprising number of you have written to ask why Clive Tylsdley is all on his lonesome in the gantry tonight. Know that the man himself explain at the start of the evening that habitual accomplice Jim Beglin was taken ill earlier today. Nothing serious, apparently, so don&apos;t go worrying yourselves. Knitting intrigue: &quot;Jacques Plante, who was a famous hockey goalie about 50 years ago, and who was the pioneer of the face mask, knitted to relax,&quot; hollers Doug Campebll. &quot;As a boyhood fan of Les Canadiens, it impelled me to try knitting, but I was totally unsuccessful (and bored).&quot;  46 min: Holland appear to have realised they need to find more creativity so they&apos;ve made a change: Van der Vaart is on for De Zeeuw.  47 min: Kuyt slips a nice ball through to Van Bronckhorst ... who had lumbered offside.  48 min: Holland circulate the ball for the sake of it. Uruguay let them. But as soon as Robben receives it in a potentially dangerous location, two converge on him and dispossess him.  50 min: Cleared off the line by Van Bronckorst! Holland had had all of the ball this half but done nothing with it thanks to Uruguay&apos;s diligent defending. Eventually Boulahrouz suffered a concentration lapse and sent a weak back-pass towards his keeper. Forlan tried to intercept, Stekeleneberg managed to prod it out wide, where Cavani collected and lofted towards goal. Which is where Van Bronckhorst came in, nodding to safety. &quot;Like Johnny Giles, van Bommel is a skilful player who is so late with his so nasty fouls that he gets away with them,&quot; reckons Gary Naylor before having a vision: &quot;It&apos;ll be great to see his career end tonight.&quot;  52 min: Victorino launches a long ball for Cavani to chase. He&apos;s got the jump on Mathijsen, but not on the keeper, who surges off his line to clear. &quot;It&apos;s not whether, but what you knit that is the true measure of the man,&quot; hollers Zachary Howard. &quot;Beer cozy: huzzah, chaps! Tea cozy: Oh, matron!&quot;  54 min: Sneijder whips in a freekick from the left. Mathijsen leaps to meet it but donks his header high and wide.  56 min: Fine work down the left by Alvaro Pereira, who forces Boulahrouz into the concession of a corner. Forlan delivers. Stekelenberg punches 25 yards clear. &quot;Rosey Grier, the rather large professional American football player, did needlepoint,&quot; divulges Kat. &quot;In fact, he wrote a book in 1973 - Rosey Grier&apos;s Needlepoint for Men. It has patterns for, among other things, fishing equipment and teeth related items.&quot;  58 min: Holland are looking stolid and unimaginative. Uruguay have more vim and ideas at the moment ... and just as I&apos;d finished typing that, Robben scurried down the right, past two defenders and into the box before winning a corner. All that ensues is a free to Uruguay, as Heitinga dumbly pushes Alvaro Pereira to the ground in a bid to win the ball.  60 min: Holland attempted to thread their way through the middle like manly seamstresses, but they shall not pass Uruguay, who had got the garra charr\u00faa tonight and no mistake (for those of you joining us late, that&apos;s Uruguayan speak for &apos;the battle fever&apos;). &quot;Each time I see a close-up of Victorino, I think that he has got the funkiest beard that I have seen in this World Cup (Rigobert Song&apos;s blonde dreads and beard were a bit too &apos;Neptune&apos; - Copyright &apos;Lawro&apos; - for me),&quot; strums Khalid Majid. &quot;I am sure he plays bass guitar for a &quot;Nu Metal Linkinpark&quot; wannabe band.&quot;  62 min: Cavani heads a Van der Vaart corner clear at the front post.  64 min: Freekick to Uruguay after yet another late tackle by Van Bommel ... who yet again escapes a booking. What, precisely, is going on? Still, Forlan may exact retribution because this is certainly within his range ...  65 min: Forlan sends an arching freekick over the wall. Stekelenberg bats it away to safety.  68 min: Ooooh! Van der Persie took down a long ball into the Uruguayan box and played a canny reverse ball to Van der Vaart, who fizzed a shot goalward from 14 yards and a slight angle. Muslera saved .... but the ball rebounds to Robben, who could score .... but instead blazes the ball over the bar! It was a tight angle, but still very scorable.  GOAL! Holland 2-1 Uruguay (Sneijder 69) Uruguay are outraged that that goal stands! Sneijder shot from the edge of the area, it took a nick off a defender and then flew through the legs off Van Persie, who was standing in an offside position. The keeper seemed slightly unsighted so dived too late to prevent the ball nestling in the bottom corner of the net.  70 min: The Dutch goal should not have stood - Van Persie was clearly interfering with play as he dummied the ball - but it will hardly be rememebred as one of football&apos;s great injustices, as the striker was only offside by about a centimetre so it is understandable the officials missed it. Luis Suarez, this was not.  GOAL! Golland 3-1 Uruguay (Robben 72) And there is no debate about that goal. Neat Dutch interplay culminated with Kuyt clipping an inviting cross into the six-yard box. Robben met it with a powerful header that he directed low into the net from six yards.  75 min: Uruguay have been knocked for six here. There&apos;s no sign of a comeback. &quot;Anyone else have the misfortune to be listening to BBC 5 Live commentary?&quot; asks Nick Carter. &quot;According to the near-hysterical Alan Green, the match is utterly terrible, the presence of empty seats is a disgrace that undermines the success of the tournament, Van Bronckhorst&apos;s goal was purely due to bad goalkeeping, the stadium has no atmosphere, etc etc, each fresh outrage conveyed in the tones of a maiden aunt who&apos;s just discovered a jazz mag under her pew in church. I&apos;m sorely tempted to switch to Talksport, against all I&apos;ve previously held dear.&quot; Alan Green is an irritating noise.  76 min: Uruguay substitution: Alvaro Pereira, who has played well, trundles off, to be replaced by Abreu, author of that splendid winning spotkick against Ghana.  77 min: Boulahrouz booked for a bad late challenge on Caceres, and because he&apos;s not Van Bommel.  79 min: After a Uruguay attack breaks down, Holland feed Robben, who gallops into space down the right ... but fails to halt in time to avoid the ball running into the hands of the keeper. &quot;So it looks like Holland are going to the final,&quot; surmises Ben Hendy. &quot;If they manage to win the world cup it will be like a lifetime achievement award or Martin Scorsese&apos;s Oscar for The Departed: it won&apos;t necessarily be a victory merited on their performances this year (though they&apos;ve risen to the occasion when they&apos;ve had to), but it will be just reward for how well they have frequently played over the last 40 years without just reward...&quot; It&apos;ll be like France&apos;s victory in &apos;98, then.  81 min: Several of you are telling me that upon repeated viewing of the Holland&apos;s second goal, Van Persie was not offside when Sneijder took his shot. Not having seen replays, I can&apos;t confirm that. But for what it&apos;s worth, Clive Tyldlsey still reckons it was a scandal.  83 min: Here&apos;s a pity: Forlan is coming off, to be replaced by Fernandez. There&apos;s no visible trace of an injury, but presumably he is not fully fit, otherwise there is no reason to withdraw him. He has looked lively all night.  85 min: Holland should have scored a fourth but Robben made a mess of it. They cut Uruguay apart with a lightning break, Van Persie providing a lovely touch through to Robben. But as the forward tried to manoeuvre the ball onto his left foot, Godin stretched out a leg to deflect the ball back to the keeper.  86 min: Van der Vaart&apos;s shot from 25 yards trundles into the arms of Muslera.  88 min: Holland substitution: a beaming Robben jogs off, high-fiving his team-mates on the way, and on bounces Elia.  89 min: Van Bommel clatters into Fernandez to abort a Uruguayan counter-attack. The ref awards a freekick .... but again no card. Bizarre.  GOAL! Holland 3-2 Uruguay (M Pereira 90+1) A lovely goal, but is it too late? Gargano nudged a short freekick to Pereira, who from the edge of the area sent a delicious low curler into the far corner.  90+3 min: Frantic defending from Holland as they repel a Uruguayan bombardment.  90+4 min: Hilarious! The Dutch fans rejoice as they think the ref has blown the final whistle ... but in fact he was awarding a freekick to Holland. Van Bommel, too, thought it was the end of the game so kicked the ball away in celebration .... and cops a booking!  Full-time: Holland are into the World Cup final. There&apos;s a bit of a ruckus as they celebrate and some Uruguayan players express their displeasure with a few of them as well as with the referee. No doubt they&apos;re unhappy about Van Bommel&apos;s persistent fouling and Holland&apos;s second goal. They can be reasonably satisfied with their performance, however, as, despite key absentees, they gave the Dutch a true test. And Holland only scraped through it. They won&apos;t be favourites in the final.", "sentences": ["If you happened to see Holland&apos;s 2-2 draw with the Republic of Ireland in Amsterdam in September 2000, you&apos;ll know it&apos;s not the first time he&apos;s done that."], "title": "World Cup 2010: Uruguay v Holland - as it happened | Paul Doyle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/06/world-cup-2010-holland-uruguay-live", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Holland", "Uruguay", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-07T07:44:15Z", "article": " Good morning and welcome to day 27 of the guardian.co.uk&apos;s daily live World Cup blog, wherever you are in the world ... We hope this blog will provide news, predictions, pontifications, colour from our team in South Africa, plus lots of pointing outwards; to your comments below the line, to the best things we&apos;ve seen on the web and to various World Cup randomania. The plan is to update the blog from now until around 5pm UK time, with our minute-by-minute coverage of Spain v Germany coming up at 7pm this evening. And let&apos;s get things started off with your predictions: I believe in the octopus and go Spain 2-1, potentially after extra-time.  9am: So, Mark van Bommel. Misunderstood genius or lucky player who only seems able to pick up a yellow card when he&apos;s mistakenly celebrating the final whistle and hoofing the ball away?  9.10am: For anyone asking: Jim Beglin - ear infection.  9.15am: Our morning paper view has arrived, with Simon Burnton having thumbed his way through tomorrow&apos;s fish and chip wrapping:  While Dutch newspapers are predictably cock-a-hoop this morning about developments in South Africa \u2013 &quot;FINALE!&quot;, matter-of-facts the best-selling De Telegraaf on their front page \u2013 headline of the day comes from German tabloid Bild, who greet Holland&apos;s semi-final victory over Uruguay with &quot;Sonntag sehen wir uns&quot; \u2013 &quot;We&apos;ll see you on Sunday&quot; \u2013 something a few Spaniards might disagree with, you&apos;d have thought.        9.30am: &quot;My name is Paul and I have a problem,&quot; writes Paul Jaines. &quot;I find myself in the strange position of actually cheering for Germany tonight - yes, I know I should want Spain to win with their wonderful passing football, but deep inside I just want to see in the final a full-blooded man-game - a nasty, full-blooded match full of nasty tackles and vengeance and rivalry bordering on malice. Holland v Germany would be a proper blood and guts final - Spain v Holland would be like a girl&apos;s tea party by comparison.&quot;             9.40am: If you haven&apos;t had the chance to see Giovanni van Bronckhorst&apos;s goal against Uruguay last night, sit back and enjoy this. Unless you&apos;re a Uruguay fan (though you&apos;d still have to sit back and admire it).  9.50am: Some of your Van Bommel posts from below the line: SidFord Van Bommel did his job last night pretty close to perfection. In the second half the Dutch played with a back four - him - and five attackers. If you are going to do that, your holding midfielder has to do everything he possibly can to stop the opposition. He did that to perfection. walked the tightrope to getting booked (obviously), but it wasn&apos;t his fault he wasn&apos;t booked earlier. If only our own holding midfileder (HA!) Gareth Barry knew what his job was meant to be as well as Van Bommel obviously does. GoldenAxe I remember Van Bommel elbowing Messi in the side of the head during Bar\u00e7a&apos;s 4-0 win in the Champions League last year. Deliberate and vengeful. Utterly disgraceful (the ref missed it). Oh, YouTube has a shot of it. HubbleWatch Van Bommel couldn&apos;t hold a candle to the likes of Chopper Harris, Norman Hunter, Nobby Stiles, Andoni Goikoetxea and Claudio Gentile. Still, I wouldn&apos;t mind mind some of that personal stealth technology he seems to be wearing so I could avoid people in authority. I suppose he must have switched it off when he thought the game was over and then got booked for kicking the ball away.       10am: &quot;Hi from a German living in the Netherlands,&quot; begins Bj\u00f6rn Lubbers. &quot;Please don&apos;t take anything Bild writes seriously. They grossly underestimate Spain, and I&apos;m sure all of Germany are ashamed of their yellow press. The truth is that this semi-final is the game of the two best teams of the tournament, and that we might be witnesses to a real classic, with attack moves up and down. I&apos;ll be cheering for Germany, and should we advance, hide my Germany-hat as deeply as possible in my backpack on the way home ... the Dutchies are a very friendly, hospitable and tolerant people, but humans will be humans and idiots will be idiots ... my cousin, also living in the Netherlands, is taking off his German license plate off his car and parking it deep inside an underground garage ... Anyway, enjoy the game everybody!&quot;       10.05am: &quot;I agree with SidFord regarding Van Bommel&apos;s performance last night,&quot; writes Ewan Dunnett. &quot;He pushes the envelope when it comes to discipline but if England had a player who competed with such a dogged and determined manner he would surely be applauded.&quot; Then again, we all remember his role in this.  10.15am: Anyway, looking ahead to tonight&apos;s second semi-final, Paul Hayward has been mulling over the fact that Miroslav Klose could well leave this tournament as the World Cup&apos;s leading scorer. Ever:  Romantics might riot if Miroslav Klose finishes this World Cup as the leading scorer in the tournament&apos;s history, ahead of Brazil&apos;s Ronaldo, who moved like a popped champagne cork until injuries and the good life stole his speed. Sentimentalists are already building barricades against the notion that Klose, an unspectacular penalty-box finisher, could leave South Africa as the nonpareil of strikers. All-time greatest World Cup goal\u2011getter is a title for billboard idols, not penalty\u2011area bureaucrats. However grudging the judgment sounds it will stick to him in the pantheon. Klose has narrowed the art of scoring to simply changing the ball&apos;s direction close-in so that the score is registered through a little stab of effort that requires no elaboration. All 14 of his World Cup goals have come in open play and from inside the box. Half have been headers. Naturally Germany&apos;s supporters are indifferent to aesthetics as a new national identity forms around those who supply Klose with his chances. If they get to see Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lukas Podolski and Thomas M\u00fcller (who is suspended against Spain) ignite the sky with their approach play why should they care if the scorer is a throwback to a more mechanical age? Their top finisher&apos;s front\u2011flip celebration offers self-expression lacking in his play. You could read it as an apology (or a rebuke) to the dreamers.  He adds:  The fresh bucks in this German side have revived an old man&apos;s career. &quot;A few years ago people kept saying it was a shame there weren&apos;t any new generations coming through,&quot; Klose says. &quot;They said we have no forwards and no creative midfielders. Everybody deplored that. But time has proved these people wrong.&quot; In Yokohama in the 2002 final he played for 74 minutes before giving way to Oliver Bierhoff in the defeat to Brazil: &quot;I spoke with Ronaldo after the game. At the time I wouldn&apos;t have dreamed of ever coming this close to him, needing two more goals to surpass him.&quot; If he gets there, at 32, in two such daunting matches, acclaim will have to flow, but there will be trouble from the purists.             10.25am: Our video man in South Africa, John Domokos, has caught up with Raphael Honigstein for a German perspective ahead of today&apos;s second semi-final. Raf explains why &quot;people are celebrating like Germany have already won&quot;.       10.30am: &quot;If Van Bommel doesn&apos;t make the team of the World Cup, it will be a travesty,&quot; insists Graeme Neill. &quot;Yes, he is a completely dirty fecker but he has been utterly immense at breaking up the opposition and shielding a rather weak defence. Holland would be as lost without him as Sneijder or Robben.&quot;  10.40am: A brief stats interlude from Fifa, which notes that Holland have now set a new record for consecutive World Cup qualification and finals victories, totalling 14. And the only time a team has won as many matches, all six, en route to the final was Brazil in 2002.  10.50am: Giovanni van Bronckhorst has been reliving that 41-yard exocet last night and discussing how he can barely believe that Sunday&apos;s World Cup final will be his last competitive match. The Holland skipper, who is due to retire from professional football on Sunday night, said:  &quot;There were no tears, just joy. The last game in my career and it&apos;s a World Cup final, what can you say? It could not be more beautiful. I hope it will be the most beautiful game of my life. For everyone, it will be the game of their life.&quot;   What a way to go out. Of the goal, Holland assistant coach Frank de Boer said: &quot;It was incredibly beautiful, it was really a perfect shot. To strike a ball like that happens maybe once in a lifetime.&quot;       11am: &quot;Now dubbed &apos;The Battle of Beglin&apos;s Ear&apos;, last night&apos;s game was typical ITV fare: 95% total dross, 5% passable entertainment,&quot; harrumphs Justin Spencer. &quot;Tonight&apos;s game (hopefully dubbed &apos;The Battle of Lawrenson&apos;s Larynx) will be a much better spectacle as: a) it&apos;s on the BBC; b) it will not feature Arjen &apos;Dorian Grey&apos; Robben; and c) Mark van Bommel will not be committing state-sanctioned murder and getting away with it.&quot;      Jogi L\u00f6w and the sweater. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters    11.10am: Rather brilliantly, as reader Barry Wilcox notes, &quot;Sueddeutsche Zeitung reports that stocks of Jogi L\u00f6w&apos;s lucky blue sweater have sold out in Munich. All three of the city&apos;s branches of the Strenesse fashion chain, stockists of official Nationalmannschaft clobber, have run out of the slinky kashmir number (just \u20ac299 to you), and there&apos;s now a waiting list, but new stocks aren&apos;t expected until August.&quot; Tenuous/shameless link plug: you can still get your &apos;lucky&apos; I Belong to Jimbo T-shirts ...  11.20am: Reuters reports that Dutch airline KLM has scrambled to put on extra planes to South Africa after Holland reached the final:  KLM&apos;s website was quoting \u20ac4,000 for an economy ticket leaving on Friday and returning on Tuesday, but seats were available for about \u20ac1,450 with a longer stay ... KLM said it would add four flights offering a total of 1,000 seats to Johannesburg, three from Amsterdam and one from Paris. KLM partner Air France already operates the Airbus A380 superjumbo daily from Paris to Johannesburg and could bring in another 250-seat Boeing 777-200, a spokeswoman said. Lufthansa flew the German team to South Africa on its newly delivered flagship A380 last month and is hoping the world&apos;s largest airliner will bring luck to the youthful German squad. &quot;If they win the Cup, we have promised to bring the team back again on the A380,&quot; said spokesman Jan Baerwalde.    11.30am: Courtesy of the ever-excellent 101greatgoals.com, Xavi shows why his footballing skills don&apos;t stretch to the vuvuzela.       11.45am: &quot;I am puzzled by something you might be able to help me with,&quot; writes Thomas Krantz in Sweden. &quot;Almost everyone seems to be watching a different world cup than I am. How exactly are Spain favourites tonight? They barely made it out of the group, they insist on playing with a traffic cone as their third striker and they barely squeaked past a couple of half-decent teams in the knockout stage. Germany, on the other hand, have played brilliant football (except for one game), have a great team of young players filled with confidence and trounced two other great teams 4-1 and 4-0 in the knockout stages. I just can&apos;t understand it. It&apos;s the squid, isn&apos;t it? I just know it&apos;s the squid. Please help me see the light.&quot; Fair points, Thomas. I think that because Spain have got to this stage without playing to their best capability makes bookies and pundits alike believe they&apos;ve got more in their locker. The question is whether they can open it. In almost every game, Spain have started slowly (the first 10 minutes against Portugal apart) and haven&apos;t yet had a first half to write home about, in my view. Germany, meanwhile, still could have won the game they lost, having missed a penalty and still frittered chances away against Serbia with 10 men for a lengthy part of the game. And I just can&apos;t see Spain falling into the tactical trap that England and Argentina tumbled into. It will be interesting to see if or how much Germany change their approach to the game, knowing that every single one of Spain&apos;s opponents thus far have sat back and defended in vast numbers, subsequently frustrating them.  Midday: The latest edition of our daily football email, The Fiver, has arrived (sign up now and you can win signed World Cup shirts). It includes the unofficial letter of the day which firmly puts Paul the Octopus in his place:  &quot;What&apos;s got eight arms, no spine and makes wild predictions about football matches without having a clue? The Match of the Day panel&quot; - Alan Gernon.   12.15pm: &quot;I&apos;ve only just looked this morning but am very surprised that there seems to be absolutely no mention that Holland&apos;s crucial second goal was, in fact, offside,&quot; writes Nick Archard. &quot;Would it be remiss of me to suggest that Sepp Blatter&apos;s desire to employ referees from all over the world, rather than the best referees, has resulted in under-qualified and inexperienced people making mistakes in the biggest matches? The linesman got two offside calls completely wrong before the goal last night. The goal itself was a tight call, but since Robin van Persie was not on the run and just standing in a clearly offside position, the call really should have been made.&quot; Interestingly, Graham Poll has recently joined Twitter. Here was his verdict last night:  So RvP in offside position not interfering with play as no contact with ball. Not gaining an adv as ball didn&apos;t rebound to him. But ...  # RvP definitely interfering with opponent as he steps over ball putting keeper off. Tough call for officials.  As for your assertion about under-qualified officials, I&apos;m of the opinion that the general standard of officiating at this tournament hasn&apos;t been too bad (certain high-profile instances aside).       12.25pm: &quot;Bj\u00f6rn Lubbers mentioned in his email you posted at 10am that &apos;the Dutchies are a very friendly, hospitable and tolerant people, but humans will be humans and idiots will be idiots ...&apos;, emails Karin Prill. &quot;I think that fits to the Germans, too. We are living near the border and when I talked to some Germans this Monday, they told me they want to rent a tractor and a trailer for Sunday evening and drive through Vaals and some other Dutch cities and villages to celebrate their victory (being the future world champions was already a fact for them, of course ...) And that&apos;s exactly what I do not understand about the football hype - people can cheer for their sides and I think all fans can be proud of this young but very enjoyable German team. But there is no need and no reason to express superiority regarding the losers of a game - especially not for the fans, who didn&apos;t do anything (except for creating a good mood, perhaps) to achieve the victory. Look at how the team itself talks about their opponents, even after winning a game: they still show respect for the other team&apos;s performance. And if they do, the fans, the yellow press and all the others are even less in the position to show an outstretched tongue and say:&apos;Haaa-haa! Loser!&apos; Or am I too rational or naive for this bad, serious (football) world? Anyway, I&apos;m looking forward to the game this evening and hope you all will enjoy it, too.&quot; Meanwhile, Jerry Purcell reckons that &quot;Alan Gernon [midday] forgot to add &apos;incredibly slimy&apos; to his MOTD panel gag. Please amend accordingly.&quot;  12.35pm: Having opened the whole shebang some 27 days ago, Shakira will be back at Soccer City to perform at the closing ceremony. Organising committee spokesman Jermaine Craig says Sunday&apos;s show (due to start at 5.30pm BST) will be &quot;more youthful and a bit more technologically advanced&quot; than the opening ceremony. So no giant dancing dung beetles then. Shame.       12.45pm: More of your emails: Simon Butler: &quot;On the subject of Mark van Bommel, I went on a tour around the Allianz Arena in April, home of his employers, Bayern Munich, of course. They have a fancy tunnel that raises up out of the ground to provide access to and from the changing rooms but it&apos;s closed after the start of the match and not opened again until half-time. However, pragmatists that they are, the Germans installed a couple of side doors near the dugouts for anybody going for an early bath, which are, as our tour guide told us with a Teutonic titter, nicknamed the &apos;Van Bommel Doors&apos;...&quot; Paco Gand\u00eda: &quot;Just a line to tell you that Spain midfielder Xavi Hernandez confirms/corroborates/adds to your 11.45am judgement on the games Spain have played so far, in today&apos;s interview in El Pais: it&apos;s in Spanish, but so there. I thought I should share it with you.&quot; Ashley Shaw: &quot;I really can&apos;t see the problem with the Dutch&apos;s second goal. No one can doubt RVP was interfering with play but that&apos;s a non-point as he was level anyway. The ITV pictures showed him level when the ball was played, then the computer showed his leg was sticking out but, even if you accept it was accurate modelling, doesn&apos;t that mean he was level except a teeny weeny bit of him (what happened to the &apos;daylight&apos; rule?). Video evidence or not, how would you asses that during a live game: would you wait 10 minutes for the model to be completed? The ITV commentator got very excited to create controversy and has clearly succeeded by sucking in everyone else. Fuss over nothing really.&quot; Sam Tomlinson: &quot;I&apos;m finding the whole &apos;RVP offside&apos; issue hard to take at the moment. He, quite clearly, has been shown to be onside for the second goal, I think a foot had strayed beyond the defender. Whatever happened to benefit of the doubt to the striker? That seems to have been completely forgotten about this year, not that there was any doubt in that case. Congrats to the linesman, great decision in a fraction of a second, it seems most people still can&apos;t get it right with freeze frames and replays.&quot;  12.55pm: Despite still having the third/fourth-place play-off on Saturday night, the party is well and truly over in Uruguay. According to AP:  Thousands of football fans crammed around giant screens in Montevideo on Tuesday to watch Uruguay play the Netherlands in its first World Cup semi-final in 40 years ... As defeat began to sink in, most fans made their way home quietly as a sombre atmosphere replaced the chanting and dancing. A few partygoers stayed on in the city centre until the early hours of the morning with a few minor disturbances reported. Luis Mendoza, coordinator of the security operation mounted by Montevideo police, said &quot;around 15 people were detained, after drinking alcohol, for causing disorder.&quot; However, there were no major incidents to report, Mendoza said. &quot;The dream is over,&quot; said Oscar Umpierrez, a newspaper and magazine stall owner, who closed his business for 90 minutes before the match. President Jose Mujica said the match should have lasted five minutes longer because &quot;we were winning it.&quot; Watching the game on a giant screen installed at a theater in the center of Montevideo, Mujica said &quot;we lost, but with lots of dignity.&quot; Sports Minister Hector Lecano said there were plans for a big celebration to welcome the team back to Uruguay on Monday.        1pm: And more of your emails: James Kenny: &quot;Holland v Spain would be distinctly underwhelming. Am I the only one who thinks a final that involves two teams that have chugged along past varying states of opposition without showing much passion or ability will be a huge anti-climax? The German team deserve the right to walk out in the final as one of the few teams to ignite this rather pallid tournament. If Spain&apos;s ability to churn out underwhelming results continues tonight we could possibly see one of the least-deserving of World Cup winners in recent memory.&quot; Andrea Amegliese: &quot;Given his impressive track record, international experience, modest wage demands, media handling skills, and, to top it all, English birth certificate, I would be very surprised if the FA isn&apos;t considering Paul the Octopus as next England manager.&quot; Bj\u00f6rn Lubbers: &quot;Karin [12.25pm], you&apos;re absolutely right. While I love football (as a beautiful sport), I can&apos;t stand stupid people (origin irrelevant), so I hardly ever go to the games. There&apos;s also a reason (or 10) why I left Germany, and I hope I&apos;ll be able to explain the German position correctly: Germans are born and raised with an inferiority complex. They want to be important in and to the world, but not be regarded as cocky or &apos;old-style-Germans&apos; (we all know what that means), so they&apos;re having a hard time accepting criticism, while they literally bath in appreciation (as is happening right now). My advice: just treat that kind of fans like spoiled brats - ignore them.&quot;  1.15pm: Reuters reports that &quot;Peruvian drug dealers have found a novel use for the vuvuzela ... hiding their marijuana. Two Peruvian women were arrested in front of a school in Lima on Tuesday for trying to sell 100 small bags of marijuana that they had stuffed into their plastic horns, police said.&quot; And here&apos;s Sadique Ali with perhaps the final word on Mark van Bommel: &quot;I don&apos;t understand why a player who has been hugely successful as a defensive midfielder capable of winning the ball, and controlling the midfield be termed as &apos;dirty&apos;. Paul Scholes&apos;s tackling ability is not the best in the world, he gives away a lot of free-kicks, and yet nobody calls him a &apos;dirty&apos; player. The same applies to stellar defensive midfielders of today - Javier Mascherano, Marcos Senna, Jeremy Toulalan, Xabi Alonso, Owen Hargreaves (when he is fit, that is). Why do people have a problem with Van Bommel? He did not cheat and he did not fake injuries. He dished out tackle after tackle and disrupted the opponents&apos; rhythm. It is not because of him the referees did not find it fitting to show him yellow cards.&quot;       1.30pm: Some more of your lunchtime emails: Mark O&apos;Neil: &quot;I wonder what exactly James Kenny (1pm) expects Spain to have done in this tournament? Unlike Germany they haven&apos;t played three teams with non-existent defences so far who played far too openly and gave their creative players space to exploit. They&apos;ve played a Paraguay team who only conceded one goal up to the quarters (and had the best defensive record in South American qualifying), a Swiss side who have conceded one goal in the World Cup on their last two visits, a Portugal side who played ultra-defensively and had conceded one goal in their previous 10 matches and a very good Chile side. Germany have been great against the teams who&apos;ve let them play, and far less impressive against the two teams who&apos;ve done the uncharitable thing of trying to stop them from doing so. Yes we&apos;d all love to see them open up teams at will and score lots of goals, but the conditions need to be there to allow it. Spain have played mostly teams who have parked the bus, and I fancy them to make the most of a more open game tonight by beating Germany. They&apos;ve been below their best, but if they can beat this Germany side they will absolutely deserve their place in the final.&quot; Ivan Milatovic: &quot;The reader who says that Spain have ground out underwhelming results should look at their games: of the four games that I saw Spain play, each of their opponents played what we in Serbia call &apos;a bunker&apos; - 10 men behind the ball and hope for a 0-0 draw or, like the Swiss, a goal on the counter-attack. The only time Germany faced anything similar was against Serbia, and they lost 1-0. Spain will, for the first time in this tournament, have an opponent tonight that will try to play football and not be contented with total defence.&quot; Guy Hornsby: &quot;Re: Bj\u00f6rn Lubbers (1pm). Wasn&apos;t he talking about England fans there as well? 1) Born and raised with an inferiority complex? Check. Well, you could say it&apos;s as much a latent colonial superiority complex coupled with a &apos;we invented the game&apos; add-on. Either way, we definitely see ourselves as important, even though our standing in the game - not to mention the world - is dimishing year-on-year. 2) Hard time accepting criticism - see the &apos;blame Fabio&apos; angle just as much as the &apos;blame the players&apos;. It couldn&apos;t be our &apos;lions&apos; that lost it, surely? To be fair to Germany, I spent the weekend there when we went out to Jogi Low&apos;s team, and it was a great atmosphere. The press - even Bild, which we bought for the flight home as a laugh - was pretty contrite, referring only to post-&apos;66 justice, and far from gloating. Perhaps now they&apos;re eyeing the prize again it&apos;s changed, but I think the average German isn&apos;t quite as brattish as you&apos;d think.&quot; Matt Ayre: &quot;Re: the RvP offside. Ashley Shaw and Sam Tomlinson (12.45pm) need to check the offside law. The &apos;daylight&apos; rule is an urban myth, akin to people seeing handball as a foul regardless of whether it was intentional or not. The rule is that a player is offside if any part of his body with which he can legally score is beyond the second-last defender; in this case, RvP&apos;s famous &apos;chocolate leg&apos; was off. Whether he was interfering in play is more subject to debate.&quot;  1.35pm: &quot;Living in Spain (near Huesca) I have so far during the tournament spotted a grand total of three national flags and only one of those was attached to a vehicle,&quot; reports Justin Horton. &quot;What&apos;s right with these people?&quot; Don&apos;t get me started on the flags, Justin. Meanwhile, Sky Sports News&apos;s yellow ticker of doom is reporting that &quot;William Gallas blames Raymond Domenech for France&apos;s World Cup exit at group stage&quot;. Slow day out at Osterley.  1.45pm: So, more of those Gallas comments, then. Speaking to Les Inrockuptibles magazine (really), he said:  &quot;If it was a fiasco, then there are reasons for it. And for me there is no need to draw a veil over why. The real problem is the coach. OK I wasn&apos;t good, we weren&apos;t good. But the coach wasn&apos;t up to scratch either. I was appalled that we didn&apos;t play with two strikers. Even the training sessions weren&apos;t up to the level required. You can have the best players in the world in your team, but if you don&apos;t have the coach you need, then the results will not be achieved. &quot;Domenech was not open. A lot of players were unable to talk to him and it was certainly my case. Anelka&apos;s incident was a case of him [Anelka] being fed up for a few weeks prior to that. Domenech hammered into us time and again: &apos;Put your egos to one side&apos;. But I believe that he forgot to do that himself.&quot;  Une soucoupe de lait pour table trois, s&apos;il vous pla\u00eet.       2pm: More of your emails: Kevin Porter: &quot;Fed up with controversy about Holland&apos;s second goal? Try the third one, then. From the quickly throw-in that the Dutch scored from, Robin van Persie stole at least 10 yards (use the halfway line to make your judgement) and should have been made to take it again. As a Wolves fan, I&apos;ve rewound matches for 10 minutes to find some reason to invalidate an opposition goal.&quot; Robin Hazlehurst: &quot;Several people have commented that tonight we should see the real Spain because so far they have only faced bus-parkers, but Germany will play a more open style and give the Spanish lots of space and consequently get ripped apart. If I was in Jogi L\u00f6w&apos;s position I would tell the German team tonight to park the bus - it works against Spain. Why on earth would they play an open style if they will lose that way? And Germany can defend and play on the counter, isn&apos;t that what they did against England? (Yes I know there&apos;s a big difference between Spain and England, but even so.). I for one am expecting a much tighter, cagier and more claustrophobic game tonight, probably 1-0 Germany, maybe AET, and maybe even all the way to 0-0 and penalties. At least I&apos;m less likely to be disappointed in the match by expecting that.&quot;  2.10pm: Senior Cameroon football federation officials told state radio that they have begun the search for a new coach to replace Paul Le Guen. Fecafoot president Iya Mohammed said:  &quot;I&apos;ve never met Lothar Matth\u00e4us but his candidature has been forwarded to us as well as that of former Ivory Coast coach Vahid Halilhodzic and some 10 others. Already, I think we need a new coach who will accept at least a four-year contract. We must end this series of recruiting coaches on short-term contracts and demanding immediate results. We need a trainer that will spend enough time with the players, know them and build a formidable, strong team.&quot;   2.15pm: Staying in Africa, goal.com reports that Ghana&apos;s players are all due to receive $20,000 for their efforts in reaching the last eight, with the rest of the travelling staff all due to pocket $10,000 each. President John Atta-Mills said:  &quot;You did not win the World Cup but, through your performance, you carried high the flags of not only Ghana, but Africa. Football brought all of us together. My brothers and sisters, there may be slight differences between us and let&apos;s remember we have an ultimate goal. We are Ghanaians first and foremost. So even though we may disagree at the end of the day just as we did to support the Black Stars, let&apos;s support all efforts we are being made to make Ghana a better place for us all.&quot;        2.20pm: &quot;I thoroughly agree with Robin&apos;s email (2pm) about Germany v Spain,&quot; writes Sam Cutting. &quot;Spain have looked ropiest when faced with a quick counter - just look at the Switzerland goal or some of their (albeit rare) shakier moments against Portugal. Germany have been the best counter-attacking side at this World Cup - although Brazil should gain some plaudits there - and I can&apos;t see the likes of Carles Puyol coping. I suppose the question is, can Germany &apos;park the bus&apos; convincingly enough against an in-form David Villa?&quot;  2.25pm: A press release arrives. And it&apos;s the one you&apos;ve all been waiting for: &quot;BeautifulPeople.com reveals the most attractive and the ugliest World Cup players of 2010. Over 200,000 members have cast their vote ... Most beautiful World Cup players of 2010 (in order of attractiveness) 1) Fabio Cannavaro, Italy2) Fernando Torres, Spain3) David Villa, Spain4) Landon Donovan, USA5) Thierry Henry, France6) Edinson Cavani, Uruguay7) Kaka, Brazil8) Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal9) Didier Drogba, Ivory Coast10) Keisuke Honda, Japan11) David James, England The ugliest World Cup players of 2010 1) Wayne Rooney, England2) Franck Ribery, France3) Carlos Tevez, Argentina4) Vladimir Stojkovic, Serbia5) Benjamin Huggel, Switzerland6) Zdenko Strba, Slovakia7) Rafik Saifi, Algeria8) Scott Chipperfield, Australia9) John Terry, England10) Ryan Nelson, New Zealand11) Daniel Agger, Denmark Robert Hintze, founder of the site said: &apos;There is a direct correlation between being attractive and being a great football player. Many of the &apos;most attractive&apos; players are also the best players. Many of them however have been let down by their worse-looking team-mates.&apos;&quot; I&apos;m dubious. But then I&apos;m ugly.  2.30pm: &quot;Here&apos;s a tidbit for you,&quot; points out Neil Bennun. &quot;From the website of The Times in South Africa. It&apos;s front-page news there that the Mirror hack Simon Wright is to go to one of the special World Cup courts on Saturday to answer the charge of colluding to make the South African security forces look really silly, or something. You have to read the comments under the article. They want him tried for treason!&quot;  2.35pm: West Ham co-owner David Sullivan has admitted that a deal to land Miroslav Klose is unlikely to go through following the striker&apos;s star performances in South Africa. &quot;We had a deal in place before the World Cup, after he had a bad season in Germany. However, as a result of what he has done at the World Cup, it&apos;s unlikely to happen,&quot; Sullivan told Soccernet.  2.40pm: I know I wasn&apos;t able to sleep in the knowledge that Holland&apos;s hotel booking had run out last night, but mercifully they&apos;ve found new accomodation. Reuters reports that:  [They] have found a new home at the Sunnyside Park Hotel in Johannesburg, a Dutch FA spokeswoman told Reuters on Wednesday. The modest Dutch only had reservations until 5 July at the Sandton Hilton hotel in Johannesburg because they probably did not expect to make it to the last week of the tournament. World soccer&apos;s governing body Fifa accommodates all teams the night before and after a match but they must make their own arrangements for the other nights. After beating Brazil in the quarter-finals, [they] extended their stay for a week but their accommodation is fully booked ahead of the final at Soccer City on Sunday.        2.45pm: Several more emails: Dan Boomy: &quot;Who would&apos;ve though the most successful Premier League player of the tournament would be Dirk Kuyt. One goal and three assists. In fact has any other Premier League player performed? Kevn-Prince Boateng was alright but that is pretty much it.&quot; Duncan Smith: &quot;Beautiful footballers? Piffle I say. I think one of the things that drives certainly the English to great talents is being ugly. If at school you can&apos;t be popular due to social grace or good looks, hours of practice training created Beardsley, Le Tissier and Gascoigne. I would mention Rooney, but now doesn&apos;t seem the time!&quot; David Wall: &quot;Mark van Bommel has been wrongly vilified and miscast as a serial fouler. As your photo at the top of this blog clearly shows, he&apos;s trying to help his tardy opponent keep up with play in an effort to even out the imbalance in the skill level of each team and to provide a better spectacle for the fans. The man deserves a Fifa medal. At least the officials recognise this even if he&apos;s unappreciated by the majority of the ingrate public.&quot;  2.50pm: Here&apos;s a rather nice tactical overview of today&apos;s game, courtesy of Jonathan Wilson.  2.55pm: Terribly depressing news from Greater Manchester police, which reports that domestic abuse incidents shot up on the day England went out of the World Cup. The force recorded 353 incidents on 27 June, the highest number in a single day this year, other than New Year&apos;s Day, and also 15.7% higher than the same day in June last year. It also launched a campaign to urge victims of domestic abuse to seek help during the tournament, and 653 people phoned a special helpline in June. Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said:  &quot;I am pleased at how many people have responded to the campaign so far and found the courage to come forward. I want to send a clear message to offenders that there is no excuse for domestic abuse at any time and we will look to ensure that those responsible are caught and brought to justice.&quot;   3.05pm: Fifa has revealed that tonight&apos;s semi-final should see the overall attendance in South Africa pass the 3 million mark, making it the third highest behind the US in 1994 and Germany in 2006. Thus far, the average attendance has clocked in at 49,134. USA &apos;94 totalled 3.59 million supporters, while the last World Cup drew 3.36 million.  3.20pm: Holland&apos;s Robin van Persie has his eye on some interior furnishing amendments once the World Cup is over, providing the Oranje can see off the winner of tonight&apos;s game:  &quot;I have a really big picture of Maradona on the wall at home in my games room. It is an unbelievable picture of him holding the World Cup. He is on his team-mates&apos; shoulders and he is holding that trophy with passion. If we win I want that picture with me holding the World Cup, having hopefully scored in the final. &quot;I spoke to two friends of mine in Rotterdam and they were trying to explain what it is like. Holland is just upside down. It is unbelievable. Everybody is drinking, having fun, swimming in the canals. It is crazy. Everyone is so happy. That is what is really nice. With the game we all love we can make people so happy. We just need to push on one more time. Then I don&apos;t know what will happen.&quot;   3.35pm: This When Saturday Comes piece picks up on Sara Carbonero&apos;s latest Marca column. In it, Iker Casillas&apos;s better half writes:  &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Deutschland. Germany are one of the best teams around, along with Holland and Brazil. But good sides like that suit us down to the ground. They won&apos;t be parking the bus. They&apos;ll be trying to play us at our own game.&quot;   3.40pm: There&apos;s a mad rush for the media heading to tonight&apos;s game in Durban, after journalists were held up for around two to three hours due to an increased number of chartered flights into the airport, chartered flights packed full of VIPs. Expect plenty of frustrated journo copy tomorrow.       3.55pm: &quot;Germany 1-2 Spain: why should the once-&apos;dour Germans&apos; (TM) suddenly be rewarded for their lively play against over-hyped opposition?&quot; asks Lou Roper. &quot;More importantly, England supporters (always fierce competitors for the World Self-Delusion Cup) must not be permitted the &apos;what if ...&apos; luxury that a German victory would provide.&quot; Very true, Lou. &quot;Even more importantly, a Spanish victory will enable the Dutch support to sing their song honouring Admiral Piet Heyn&apos;s capture of the Spanish treasure fleet in 1632.             4pm: Some videos to set you up for tonight&apos;s game: Spanish TV present a compilation featuring the battle of the No8s: Xavi v Mesut Ozil.

Poor Schweini.  4.10pm: A couple of posts from below the line as to how this tournament will be remembered: shedendexile I think a lot of us are guilty of looking back on the past with rose-tinted specs. Also, it depends on who you follow. If your team has not been involved in any great or dramatic games, it will tend to seem a bit pallid (see the English view). I am sure the Dutch, Germans, Uruguayans, Ghanaians and Spanish will look back at this as a classic WC. Another reason so many are underwhelmed is that the best football has come from an unlikely source in Germany ... ie if the Dutch and Brazilians don&apos;t sparkle, the football must be crap. ChinnyChinChin I&apos;m in the US, and I&apos;m sure if you asked most of the football fans over here, they&apos;d tell you this has been a great World Cup full of dramatic moments and great games. Reading some of the English press, it&apos;s clear there&apos;s a far less positive take on it, which could have a lot to do with the England team&apos;s failure. Or, as with the Vancouver Olympics recently, the English press are just grumbling for the sake of it. It&apos;s been a very good World Cup, in my opinion. And it&apos;s been great to see some of the less obvious contenders providing the entertainment and drama. And Matt Judd emails: &quot;As far as &apos;what if \u2026&apos; luxuries go, Australia can compete there. We were eliminated (some say harshly) by the eventual 2006 Cup winners, Italy. And now, unlike last time, we&apos;re all likely silently barracking for Germany for the same self-delusion that England has going on. For every four-goal German scorecard, we feel just that little bit better about ourselves.&quot;       4.20pm: &quot;Being from Germany, my wife and I would have loved to see Germany out as early as possible \u2013 to avoid all the hype and a neighbour watching the TV so loud to serve the entire unwilling house,&quot; admits Frank Latour. &quot;And all the flags. And fireworks \u2013 after every goal! It&apos;s ridiculous. There is a, let&apos;s say, certain gap (1,000,000 miles) between reasonable people and football-only fans here, believe me. I was always pleased by a good game and therefore did like Ghana and Uruguay also. And btw: Spain sadly lacked the certainty and firepower of the European Cup, I wished, they&apos;d done it better in the World Cup now.&quot;  4.25pm: South Africa&apos;s finance ministry, alongside the country&apos;s auditor-general, is to investigate World Cup ticket purchases by government agencies amid concerns about &quot;wasteful expenditure&quot;. Reuters reports that &quot;struggling state-owned firms have spent 110 million rand ($14.3 million) on World Cup tickets, according to government answers to a parliamentary question, angering labour unions and sparking cries of executive greed.&quot; A finance ministry spokesman said:  &quot;While there may be legitimate reasons for buying tickets to advance the business case of public enterprises and government departments, concern has been raised as to what action may be taken should the Auditor-General deem this expenditure wasteful. The Minister reiterates his call for civil servants to live up to their moral contract with citizens and for restraint and discernment to be exercised in the use of public funds.&quot;   4.30pm: Sunday&apos;s World Cup final will be broadcast live on both the BBC and ITV \u2013 but which channel will you choose?

It&apos;s not my specialist subject, Johan. &quot;The &apos;Wilhelmus&apos;, the Dutch hymn written in the 16th century, mentions both Germany and Spain - the hymn&apos;s second line, &apos;Ben ik van Duitsen bloed&apos;, literally translates as &apos;I am of German blood&apos; (although &apos;Duitsen&apos; here refers to the people living in the area that&apos;s now Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Germany, not to the current Germany). It also says &apos;The king of Spain whom I have always honoured&apos;. No mention of the Netherlands in the Dutch hymn, though.&quot;  5pm: OK, that&apos;ll do for today&apos;s blog.

In 1980s Moscow, everyone had an avoska: a shopping bag that you&apos;d permanently carry about just in case something good turned up in the erratically stocked shops. Wandering through the city today, Chernysheva is always on the lookout \u2013 though now her &quot;avoska&quot; is a camera rather than a bag. In addition to videos shot on the spur of the moment, she produces photographs, watercolours and drawings which record everything from parades to buskers, bathers, tramps and security guards. What she captures is not simply life at street level but a post-Soviet state of mind. Born in 1962, Chernysheva came of age after the Soviet Union&apos;s demise, a time she recalls as extraordinarily intense. Following a decade when conceptual artists largely made work behind closed doors, Chernysheva was invited to study at Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksakademie \u2013 the first Russian artist to do so. Moscow was caught up in the beginnings of a capitalist revolution; amid the sweeping change, what Chernysheva has focused on are people apparently cut off from the flow of history. The recent watercolour series Blue-Yellow (2009) depicts typical Moscow market traders flogging pickles, vegetables and ladies&apos; clothes from little blue and yellow tents. They look more like medieval travelling players than people at the cutting edge of modern commerce. It&apos;s a sense of isolation reflected in On Duty (2007), which comprises photographic portraits of guards on the Moscow metro. Sealed up alone in glass booths, with their eyes raised as if in religious contemplation, they might as well be invisible to the passengers filing by. Chernysheva&apos;s photographic light-box series, The Cactus Seller (2009), presents another kind of inner withdrawal: a bespectacled man tending plants among the dimly lit displays of a natural history museum. One to watch: Included in this year&apos;s Artes Mundi prize exhibition, her 2003 video, The Train, follows a man Chernysheva found reciting poetry on the railway system out of Moscow. Walking back and forth through the carriages, he intones an obscure early work by Pushkin, while the train speeds on. Old and new worlds collide. Looney tunes: Rather than study art \u2013 which in the Soviet era meant painting and sculpture more often than not \u2013 Chernysheva initially trained in animation at Moscow&apos;s film academy. Here she discovered the work of the 19th-century Russian realist Pavel Fedotov, whose final painting is the basis for her recent video, Intermissions of the Heart, in which a dog performs a trick over and over, caught in an endless loop.

Known for its top-notch political connections, Washington-based Carlyle has had Sir John Major, George W Bush, and former US secretary of state James Baker on its payroll over the years, and manages $90bn (\u00a360bn) of funds. Its British assets include IMO Car Wash, the child car seats company Britax and an investment in Boots. In a potentially embarrassing legal confrontation, liquidators allege that Carlyle abdicated its duties in managing the mortgage arm by failing to act when losses began to accumulate in 2007 on toxic mortgage-backed securities. They want to recoup more than $1bn for creditors. &quot;The defendants operated CCC [Carlyle Capital Corporation] in reckless disregard of the overt and manifest risks that had arisen from the well-publicised changes in the market and economic conditions,&quot; says the suit, filed in New York, Washington, Delaware and in Guernsey, where the mortgage spin-off was incorporated. Alan Roberts and Neil Mather, of the corporate recovery firm Begbies Traynor, allege that Carlyle disregarded guidelines intended to set a minimum 20% liquidity cushion and to limit mortgage-backed securities to 85% of the fund&apos;s capital. When problems emerged, the suit says, Carlyle avoided selling down assets. &quot;The Carlyle Group&apos;s corporate interests dictated that no such steps be taken, so as to avoid the recognition of losses by a Carlyle-branded investment, to maintain the illusory prospect of impressive dividends and to pay themselves fees.&quot; The failure of the Guernsey-registered venture is a significant blot on the private equity group&apos;s financial record. The Carlyle Capital unit raised $945m from clients and floated in July 2007 on the Amsterdam-based Euronext exchange, raising a further $345m. Eight months after going public, the fund went into liquidation. Notable victims of the unit&apos;s collapse include a former Republican congressman, Michael Huffington, who sued Carlyle last year saying he had lost $20m. Huffington is the former husband of the internet media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington. A spokesman for Carlyle Group, whose US investments include Dunkin&apos; Donuts and Hertz car rental, said: &quot;This suit is without merit. We will vigorously contest all claims and are confident we will prevail.&quot; Carlyle pointed out that the failed venture invested in triple-A rated mortgage securities and was not involved in subprime loans. The private equity firm sees the loss as a result of &quot;unprecedented, extreme volatility&quot; that caused the collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds at around the same time. The Washington-based company said it was among the victims, as it lost $150m by providing an emergency line of credit in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue Carlyle Capital, while individual financiers at Carlyle lost tens of millions of dollars of their own money in the debacle.", "sentences": ["The Carlyle Capital unit raised $945m from clients and floated in July 2007 on the Amsterdam-based Euronext exchange, raising a further $345m."], "title": "Carlyle faces $1bn lawsuit over failed Guernsey arm", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/07/carlyle-1bn-dollar-lawsuit", "tags": ["Private equity", "US news", "Channel Islands", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-07T23:05:51Z", "article": "We always say that what we do\u00a0is shoot human beings, whether it is for fashion, which is a glorification of a certain aspiration, or showing an internal experience that means more in the art\u00a0world.

We have never questioned our artistic collaboration: our lives are so much about each other that we want to\u00a0spend them together as much as we can. If I had to work alone, for whatever reason, I could \u2013 but I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t want to. Our assistant took an initial series of Polaroids on the terrace of our house in New York. It was obviously easy for us to kiss; we chose a time when the light would hit my face in the right way and make my neck look really long. Removing Vinoodh from the picture\u00a0on the computer afterwards showed how I would be destroyed emotionally without him. For us, the big moment is when we are at a screen, manipulating the image. That feeling of seeing that it works and has emotional value is very exciting.

The English, you see, are experts at inventing sports then wallowing in anger and frustration as everyone else trounces them at the same, and Holland look set to suffer a similar fate, as Spain prepare to batter them with Totaalvoetbal. The English media, meanwhile, sing in unison that England must copy the Spanish style. Ian Ladyman in the Daily Mail, for instance, bugles that &quot;Spain progressed to their first World Cup final playing like the very best five-a-side teams. It looks simple and effortless but it isn&apos;t. It involves understanding angles and running selflessly off the ball and moving possession to a team-mate quickly. It is exhausting to play against as it largely entails chasing ghosts ... And it is foreign to some European teams, certainly to England. It is not about hitting channels and winning second balls. If you keep possession like Spain then there aren&apos;t any second balls.&quot; England could also learn lessons from Germany, of course. Consider, for example, this declaration from Lothar Matth\u00e4us, who reckons Michael Ballack should not bother returning to the national team after injury because the country&apos;s kids are better. &quot;There is no doubt that Ballack&apos;s absence has helped Germany in this World Cup, he should show true greatness and step down,&quot; said Matth\u00e4us. &quot;I don&apos;t mean that in a spiteful way but he was holding up players who have now blossomed.&quot; How did the English tabloids miss the opportunity to construe that as a German legend BLASTING or SLAMMING or STICKING THE JACKBOOT into England&apos;s useless senior stars, too? Oh yeah, it&apos;s because there isn&apos;t really much young talent for them to get in the way of. Who, for example, would seriously suggest that 32-year-old Emile Heskey should step down so that Wayne Rooney can keep his place? At least Rooney may be getting some lessons from a Dutch master next season. Because Sir Alex Ferguson reportedly wants to bring Wesley Sneijder to Old Trafford and will fork out \u00a329m to make that wish come true. Manchester City, meanwhile, may scupper that deal, just because they can. Roy Hodgson has identified left-back has a weak area for Liverpool. Unfortunately he has not yet identified anyone to take Emiliano Ins\u00faa off his hands, which he needs to do before being allowed to bid for Wigan&apos;s excellent Maynor Figueroa. Worse, Barcelona&apos;s financial absurdities mean that, despite all their posturing and pontificating about all the great players they want to sign, they can&apos;t even afford to liberate Javier Mascherano from Anfield. So Liverpool are stuck with their most overrated player. That, of course, is unlikely to have any influence on whether Shaun Wright-Phillips decides to respond to Liverpool&apos;s wooing \u2013 no, the fact that Arsenal and Spurs are also interested is likely to be more significant.

The team in the orange shirts are the Dutchmen. But the team labelled Spain are actually the ones playing Dutch football, the true heirs to a distinctive philosophy transmitted over a period of more than 20 years by Johan Cruyff and his successors to the players brought up in Barcelona&apos;s academy. The other team will actually be representing the Netherlands, but Bert van Marwijk, their head coach, has been assailed by suggestions that he is betraying the nation&apos;s golden heritage of Total Football, of which Cruyff has always been the most potent symbol and persistent advocate.  \u2022 Follow the Guardian&apos;s World Cup team on Twitter\u2022 Sign up to play our daily Fantasy Football game\u2022 Stats centre: Get the lowdown on the top scorers\u2022 The latest news, features and more on the final  &quot;Van Marwijk&apos;s team is playing the exact opposite of Total Football,&quot; David Winner, the author of Brilliant Orange, the perceptive study of Dutch football, declared in a radio interview the other day. &quot;This is not the free-flowing, adorable, romantic, slightly fragile, very inspiring and beautiful stuff that I fell in love with.&quot; But that &quot;stuff&quot; did not, he pointed out, end up with Holland winning the World Cup. A debate has been raging throughout the Netherlands since the tournament began over whether it is right to see their side playing with such an overt emphasis on the virtues of resolute defending, like the Germans of an earlier era. But Van Marwijk can point to a run of 14 consecutive wins in competitive matches \u2013 eight in their qualifying round and six since their arrival in South Africa \u2013 with his 4-2-3-1 formation and he knows that if his methods lead to his team beating Spain, they will have achieved something that Cruyff never managed. He is certainly clear about his priority, which is to banish Holland&apos;s reputation for falling at the last hurdle through an overdeveloped assumption of their own superiority. It happened in the World Cup finals of 1974 and 1978 and, he pointed out this week, it was still happening as recently as two years ago, when the team, under Marco van Basten, were unexpectedly knocked out of Euro 2008 by Russia at the quarter-final stage. &quot;We beat Italy and France and everybody thought we would become European champions,&quot; he said. &quot;But we didn&apos;t even survive the quarter-finals because we thought that we were already there. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve tried to make clear to the players, that this has to be different.&quot; Not that he entirely rejects the great figures of the past. &quot;They are an inspiration,&quot; he said after the semi-final victory over Uruguay. &quot;Over the last five weeks I&apos;ve talked with Ruud Gullit and for a long time with Johan Cruyff, and from the first day we started to train here Rudi Krol has been with us. He&apos;s been here every training session, sitting on the bench, and we have talked a lot about the past and about the way we play now. I&apos;ve had a lot of contact with those guys. It&apos;s inspirational. But we live in another time.&quot; It may be worth remembering that the romantic idealism of Total Football was born in Amsterdam, a city where Van Marwijk has never worked during his four decades as a much-travelled player and coach. He was born in Deventer, a picturesque small town in the middle of the Netherlands, and spent the first six years of his playing career with the local club, Go Ahead Eagles, who oscillate between the first and second divisions but still play in a stadium dating back to 1920 which holds only 6,700 spectators. An attacking midfielder, he moved on to AZ Alkmaar, MVV Maastricht, Fortuna Sittard and FC Assent, earning one senior international cap on the way. His coaching career began with small clubs in Meerssen, Herderen and Limmel before two good years with Fortuna Sittard brought him a call from Feyenoord. In 2002 he took them to victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Uefa Cup final, with goals from Pierre van Hooijdonk and Jon Dahl Tomasson, and two years later he had crossed the border to manage the German club. His time in Dortmund lasted only 18 months and did not end happily, and by 2007 he was back with Feyenoord, where he won the Dutch Cup before leaving the following year to take over the national side following Van Basten&apos;s resignation. That last year with the Rotterdam club, however, saw him establish a relationship with Giovanni van Bronckhorst, the 35-year-old veteran to whom he entrusted the captaincy of Holland and who rewarded him on Tuesday with the 40-yard thunderbolt that broke the deadlock against Uruguay. Other relationships are clearly important in setting the tone of the team, such as that with Mark van Bommel, his son-in-law, a European Cup finalist with Bayern Munich this year and a player who upsets purists by bringing an abrasive edge to the midfield. Or that with Dirk Kuyt, the Liverpool forward, with whom he worked in his first spell at Feyenoord and whose relentless energy and enthusiasm compensate for a lack of finesse. Those who do bring refined skills to the team, however, seem to have bought into Van Marwijk&apos;s philosophy. If he relies heavily on the trio of Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie to provide the side with creativity, in turn they seem to accept their reliance on his six-man defensive structure to provide them with the platform on which they can express themselves. Their highly strung temperaments, of the sort that might once have created conflagrations within a Dutch squad, have not been allowed to impede the collective effort. &quot;I love attacking football,&quot; Van Marwijk says, &quot;but I also love winning.&quot; Where Cruyff&apos;s Amsterdam, the home of the hippies, gave birth to Total Football, Van Marwijk&apos;s Deventer was also the place where Geert Groote, a 14th-century theologian, founded the Brethren of Common Life, a Catholic order devoted to simplicity and opposed to decadence.

The play doesn&apos;t reside in heaven, or in a library. As a dramatist, that&apos;s your instinct: without other people, the play doesn&apos;t exist.&quot; That may be true, but Brenton has not always written plays that are easy to watch. He first shot to attention in 1969 with Christie in Love, which depicts the serial killer John Christie masturbating in the garden where he buried his victims. Then there was The Churchill Play (1974), a snarling attack on the soft-focus sentimentality of postwar British patriotism, and Weapons of Happiness (1976), in which an executed Czech communist is brought back to life in the improbable setting of a London crisp factory. Later came The Romans in Britain (1980), which produced an offstage legal battle after Mary Whitehouse took exception to its depiction of a Roman soldier raping a Celt. I&apos;ve come expecting to meet a firebrand, but in the flesh there is little hint of the rabble-rousing revolutionary. The charming 67-year-old sitting in a rehearsal room at the Globe theatre in London is energetic, even defiant; but someone bent on theatrical self-immolation? Not really. &quot;I think there are different kinds of writers,&quot; Brenton says, simply. &quot;Some put themselves across the stage, dramatise their lives. John Osborne was a great example; Ibsen was always thinly disguising himself. But, by instinct, I&apos;m not that kind of playwright.&quot; Which raises the question: what kind of playwright is he? Looking across the full span of Brenton&apos;s career, it is genuinely difficult to say. For every brassy political satire (A Short Sharp Shock, 1980, with Tony Howard) there is a passionate study of romantic love (In Extremis, 2006); for every incendiary tract on religious intolerance (Iranian Nights, 1989, with Tariq Ali) there is a thoughtful examination of the nature of belief (Paul, 2005). Among the 40-plus plays Brenton has to his name \u2013 he claims not to remember the precise number \u2013 there are scripts devoted to the relationship between Percy and Mary Shelley (Bloody Poetry, 1984), and set on a modern-day British racecourse (Epsom Downs, 1977). Plus there&apos;s a novel, Diving for Pearls (1989), assorted screenplays and a volume of collected journalism. Brenton is surely unique in having divided the action of a play between the 1987 Conservative election victory and a utopian fantasy projected 700 years in the future (Greenland, 1988). He is certainly the only Marxist playwright I can think of who has written 14 episodes of a BBC spy thriller (Spooks, 2002\u201305). Whatever else he may be, Brenton rarely lets audiences emerge with their preconceptions intact \u2013 least of all when it comes to what he will do next. Michael Grandage, who is currently directing his revised adaptation of Danton&apos;s Death for the National Theatre, agrees. &quot;The perception is that Howard is one of our great political writers,&quot; he says, &quot;but he is also a writer who surprises, because he seems to go much further: he has a poetic mind, but he&apos;s also a sensualist; his writing is very funny, but he&apos;s also someone with humanity. In terms of where he fits in, that&apos;s a problem \u2013 it makes him, God forbid, versatile.&quot; Brenton was born in Portsmouth in 1942. His mother worked as a shopgirl at the Co-op, his father was a gentleman&apos;s outfitter who had aspirations to be an actor, but who ended up enrolling as a policeman. &quot;He joined because it was a time of terrible unemployment,&quot; Brenton remembers. &quot;It was the 30s, and if you could get that job, you could be secure and marry. But he hated the police, never functioned well in it.&quot; So during Brenton&apos;s teens his father took a surprise decision, to retire from the force and become a Methodist preacher. The family moved to Yorkshire, then to Wales. The young Howard picked up the theatrical bug from his father. And when he progressed from Chichester grammar school to St Catharine&apos;s College, Cambridge, his mind was focused not on his English course, but on theatre. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he didn&apos;t really fit in. &quot;I was a lower middle-class boy. I&apos;d never even drunk beer, so I was rather out of place. I sort of blew up as I went along. I ran a magazine, acted, drank a lot of wine, lost my way.&quot; But he was also, crucially, trying to write. &quot;And because of that, one of my tutors said: &apos;Look, I&apos;ll do a deal with you \u2013 don&apos;t do any work, but choose one thing and I&apos;ll teach you it.&apos; I chose Ulysses, and we read it virtually for a year. I thought I was blowing my education, but I wasn&apos;t: I was having the best education you could imagine.&quot; Joyce clearly left his mark on Brenton \u2013 you can sense it in the earthy, demotic language of his early plays \u2013 but other influences were less helpful. While still at Cambridge, he wrote an existentialist parable indebted to Genet called Ladder of Fools. It didn&apos;t work. &quot;It was truly dreadful,&quot; Brenton says now, guffawing at the memory. &quot;There was one speech that lasted for 20 minutes, and the walk-out record was 40 people. Every 30 seconds you could hear a seat going up.&quot; He laughs. &quot;It was the most terrible experience: your fellow students giving the bird to your play.&quot; He destroyed every copy. Salutary, though? &quot;Yes. The next play I wrote was very short, and I made sure there wasn&apos;t a boring moment in it. And because of the concentration, it was funny. The first audience we performed it to began to fall about laughing. When that happens, you&apos;re away. You suddenly engage with how great humour is in the theatre \u2013 its undercutting quality, the flash of recognition from stage to audience and back again.&quot; This is something not always fully recognised about Brenton&apos;s writing: while his plays have frequently traversed difficult, even painful territory, they are rarely less than exhilarating to watch. Danton&apos;s Death is B\u00fcchner&apos;s great meditation on the consequences of the French revolution, but in Brenton&apos;s recent adaptation (his second) the play acquires a whipcrack, caustic sharpness. Pravda, the celebrated Fleet Street comedy Brenton co-wrote with David Hare in 1985, may have trained its sights on the very real threat of Rupert Murdoch \u2013 it depicts an ogreish press baron attempting to take over the British media \u2013 but it was the play&apos;s sheer energy that audiences adored. Hare first met Brenton in the late 60s and brought him into Portable Theatre, a troupe producing work that focused on everything that was wrong with contemporary Britain. He remembers Pravda&apos;s reception well. &quot;Bernard Levin wrote the most vitriolic attack on the play,&quot; he recalls, &quot;saying we were two boys who must have thought everything was terribly funny, hugging ourselves with laughter for being so clever. He was right: we did hug ourselves. Those plays were fuelled by laughter. Howard&apos;s sense of humour is one of the most important things about him.&quot; Yet the humour \u2013 usually wild, sometimes literally explosive \u2013 is seeded with powerful themes. Brenton&apos;s plays have never been afraid to confront subjects that would make nervier playwrights run for cover. Arguably his first real masterpiece is Magnificence (1973), set among a communitarian group of squatters whose idealism decays almost as fast as their supply of fresh food. The squat is stormed by the police, a horrifying accident occurs and the ringleader is thrown in prison, where he becomes politically radicalised. The play culminates in a scene \u2013 eerily prophetic, it seems now \u2013 in which he fills his rucksack with explosives and sets off to blow up a cabinet minister. The play was inspired by two things, Brenton explains: his experiences in Amsterdam at the end of the 1960s, as peace and love were being replaced by something more politically sinister; and by the activities of the Angry Brigade, a group of youthful left-wing dissidents who planted bombs at a number of government targets in the early 70s. &quot;They were decent, perfectly bright students who decided to blow up the Ministry of Defence, and then went to jail,&quot; Brenton says. &quot;It was a tragedy of waste, really, and that became the play.&quot; Having been doing odd jobs in London, working backstage to support his writing, Magnificence was a breakthrough for Brenton: a Royal Court commission that brought the political awareness of fringe theatre into the mainstream. As well as being heavily influenced by Brecht, it also bears the hallmarks of the situationists, in particular Guy Debord&apos;s The Society of the Spectacle (1967). &quot;The book was a huge influence,&quot; Brenton says. &quot;It argued that society was like a printed circuit board that operates along certain channels, without which the economy won&apos;t work. Public life is a massive spectacle that everyone pretends to be part of, but no one is. I thought that this was a brilliant analysis, and very interesting for a playwright \u2013 after all, what do entertainments do but disrupt the spectacle?&quot; So playwriting was a form of terrorism? &quot;Disrupting the spectacle is a valid artistic aim; it can be enjoyed by writers and audiences. But I wasn&apos;t a bomber. There was a horrible psychodrama developing on the left at that time: middle-class Maoists telling you you&apos;re impure, bourgeois, because you won&apos;t go and kill someone. Horrible, but understandable. And interesting.&quot; For all that Brenton remains fascinated by the psychology of terrorism, he was never a sympathiser \u2013 a distinction that has sometimes been lost on observers. In 1975 Theatre Quarterly headlined an interview with Brenton &quot;Petrol Bombs Through the Proscenium Arch&quot;, while the fallout from The Romans in Britain saw him caricatured as a long-haired revolutionary. He still professes to be Marxist (&quot;I wish I wasn&apos;t, but once you&apos;ve seen the bare bones of the world in that way, there&apos;s no going back&quot;), but in all other ways the contrast between Brenton&apos;s public and private personas is striking. He and his wife, Jane, have been married for 40 years; together they have sons, now grown up, and live in a quiet part of south London. There have been genuine struggles en route, however. Having grown accustomed to major commissions at the National, the RSC and the Royal Court throughout the 70s and 80s, he later saw the work begin to dry up. As the 90s dawned, Brenton, like several left-wing playwrights of his generation, found himself out in the cold \u2013 left behind politically by the fall of the Berlin Wall, displaced theatrically by so-called &quot;in-yer-face&quot; playwrights such as Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill and Anthony Nielson. Despite the irony of being an arch-scandaliser who found himself out-scandalised, Brenton doesn&apos;t bear a grudge. &quot;They were terrific writers, and had their own directors,&quot; he says now. &quot;I was out of fashion, and the money began to run out.&quot; Perhaps it&apos;s significant that one of the projects Brenton found himself beached on was an ill-starred attempt to adapt Calvino&apos;s 1952 novel Il Visconte Dimezzato (The Cloven Viscount): a whimsically fantastical story about a 17th-century aristocrat who is cut in half by a cannonball. Owing to a spot of miraculous battlefield surgery, Calvino&apos;s hero survives, but his two halves decide to go their separate ways: one side taking on all the bad aspects of his personality, the other all the good. Hearing the tale now, it sounds rather like a metaphor for a writer struggling to keep it together. &quot;I was fascinated by the story. I even got a very nice letter from Calvino&apos;s widow. And the Deutsches Theater [in Berlin] commissioned it. What a gig! But I just couldn&apos;t do it; I got stuck, wrote this farrago of a play. They politely mumbled no, and that was it.&quot; If the story illustrates Brenton&apos;s maverick enthusiasm, it also hints that something deeper was happening beneath the surface of his writing. That play may have foundered, but the idea stuck. When it came to rewriting for the National Theatre the story of the biblical Saul \u2013 a man whose revelation on the road to Damascus sees him reborn, but also tears him apart \u2013 Brenton realised that the theme had mysteriously resurfaced. &quot;I finished Paul [in 2005], and my elder son read it, and said: &apos;Well, you&apos;ve written it at last.&apos; That&apos;s the theme, that&apos;s what I was going for: a man who is split in half, who goes from one extreme to the other.&quot; He pauses. &quot;In the end, it doesn&apos;t go to waste. Everything gets recycled.&quot; For Brenton&apos;s Saul/Paul, that Damascene epiphany isn&apos;t the final one. He is confronted by two further realisations, both shattering: that Jesus was married, and that the resurrection was probably faked. Yet, wary of endangering the rapidly expanding Christian church, tortured by self-doubt, Paul keeps both facts secret from his followers. The play attracted predictable headlines about religious controversy returning to the National, but there was plainly more going on than straightforward agitprop. Hare regards it as one of Brenton&apos;s finest works: &quot;The beauty of the idea \u2013 that Paul knew that perhaps Jesus hadn&apos;t risen from the dead, but that he wanted the idea of the resurrection to\u00a0transform humanity \u2013 is a metaphorical expression of everything Howard has always written about, which is the contrast between the need for a dream and the reality. I think it&apos;s one of the most remarkable plays of the new century.&quot; Brenton&apos;s first playscript for a decade, it also rekindled his interest in religion. &quot;One of the impulses behind Paul was the feeling that I couldn&apos;t write about Islam,&quot; says Brenton. &quot;How can I possibly write about a suicide bomber, or approach any of the issues in that religion? But in Christianity I can \u2013 I know it well, I came out of its culture, even believed in it once.&quot; Christianity has, indeed, begun to look like Brenton&apos;s late, great obsession \u2013 a cohesive theme at last, or at least a hint that his Methodist upbringing is staging a surprise comeback. Before Paul he wrote In Extremis (finally staged in 2006), a study of the relationship between Abelard and Heloise, which has been followed by a new play about Anne Boleyn that will open later this month, both at the Globe. Brenton is also in the middle of a follow-up on the life of Oliver Cromwell; a kind of companion piece, seen through the telescope of the other end of the reformation. He may move more slowly these days \u2013 he walks with a stick, a concession to osteoarthiritis \u2013 but Brenton&apos;s mind is energetic. &quot;Sometimes you look back at a scene and you can&apos;t remember writing it, you wrote it so quickly,&quot; he reflects. &quot;It&apos;s very odd. This is why some writers lose it and start talking about the muse, or become mystics.&quot; But you sense that, for all his anguished examinations of belief, Brenton is not about to become one of them. &quot;I&apos;ve moved towards \u2013 not parable exactly, but towards history,&quot; he says, then checks himself. &quot;For the time being, anyway. Who knows what will come out of the spinal cortex next month?&quot;", "sentences": ["The play was inspired by two things, Brenton explains: his experiences in Amsterdam at the end of the 1960s, as peace and love were being replaced by something more politically sinister; and by the activities of the Angry Brigade, a group of youthful left-wing dissidents who planted bombs at a number of government targets in the early 70s."], "title": "A life in theatre: Howard Brenton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/howard-brenton-life-in-theatre", "tags": ["Howard Brenton", "Theatre", "Books", "Culture", "David Hare"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-09T23:06:09Z", "article": "Sargent and the Sea, London This show looks back to John Singer Sargent&apos;s early days, tapping into a somewhat wilder side than the society portraitist is usually credited with. Like his friend Henry James, he depicted the upper crust, although his canvases were of a more flattering kind than his patron&apos;s novels. Before he became renowned for the debutantes and upper-class mamas, he honed his art with maritime inspiration from the French and Italian coasts, as this show reveals. Among the 80 paintings, drawings and watercolours are seaside idylls, including the glorious Neapolitan Children Bathing. More surprising is the fact that a transatlantic trip moved Sargent to produce tumultuous Romantic seascapes, such as Mid Ocean, Mid Winter where icy green and black waves swell ominously. Meanwhile, studies of dock life intimate his mature, sober side. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, to 26 Sep Skye Sherwin Book Show, Birmingham Central to this show of artists&apos; books is the work of Ulises Carri\u00f3n \u2013 artist, writer and founder of Amsterdam&apos;s Other Books and So bookshop which, between 1975 and 79, established the idea of artists&apos; books. To put it simply, artists&apos; books are books by artists rather than books about artists. Carri\u00f3n puts it less simply but probably more accurately: &quot;A book is a sequence of spaces. Each of these spaces is perceived at a different moment; a book is also a sequence of moments.&quot; So artists&apos; books are aesthetic and tactile artworks as well as just books in the literary sense. Here&apos;s a display of such work by those renowned in the medium, including John Latham and Marie Lund. Eastside Projects, to 4 Sep Robert Clark Sergej Jensen, London Sergej Jensen once described what he does as &quot;painting without paint&quot;. Using bleached, stitched and stained fabric, he creates elegantly spare abstract images in organic, oatmeal tones. This quiet, homespun stuff might seem too comfortable if it weren&apos;t for Jensen&apos;s wry take on art and consumerism. As well as canvas, he&apos;s made use of materials such as linen made from recycled money bags. As politely reticent as his work can appear, it comments on the way paintings can double as wall decor and other unseemly art-market side effects. His second London exhibition encompasses 1970s sci-fi from 2001 to Close Encounters, in silver-blues, greys and blacks, and includes experiments with paint. White Cube Mason&apos;s Yard, SW1, Fri to 28 Aug Skye Sherwin Tony Sinden, Bristol Up to his premature death last year, the early pioneer of British video art Tony Sinden was an experimenter. Dubbing the gallery a laboratory, he worked not only with moving images but also music, performance and, most significantly, installation. This show focuses on his quietly groundbreaking 1970s work. Nine TV sets take on a sculptural capacity for the brilliantly titled Behold, Vertical Devices. Arranged on a sloping plank, video footage of a running figure slides, flickers and jumps across the TV monitors in an alternative study of time and motion. Then there&apos;s Can Can, one of Sinden&apos;s very first video installations. Its double projection of out-of-sync footage has a humble beer can rolling up and down a train aisle. Picture This, to 7 Aug Skye Sherwin The the Things Is (For 3), Milton Keynes A mysteriously unnamed artist, referred to in the exhibition publicity as &quot;the artist&quot;, goes in for what he calls variations of &quot;hiddenness&quot;. Here, the artist presents strangely incongruous image combinations. WOMAN MAN MAN WOMAN WOMAN WOMAN MAN MAN GEORGE M HESTER (yes indeed, the artist goes in for titles that are blandly literal or impenetrably cryptic) is a series of hermaphroditic collages of photographic male and female nudes. Elsewhere, a rock band&apos;s instruments are plugged in and ready to play. Inane or enigmatic or what? Milton Keynes Gallery, to 12 Sep Robert Clark The Tightrope Walker, London With the Hayward Gallery&apos;s New Decor and the Barbican&apos;s Surreal House, it seems to be a time for shows about art and furniture. Making a triple threat, this exhibition channels the optimism and reflection of postwar Paris in work by 11 artists and designers. It includes such curious bedfellows as outsider art champion Jean Dubuffet and chic designers Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouv\u00e9. With the populist paintings of Bernard Buffet of sour-faced, angsty skinny men, the expansive ensemble captures the era&apos;s conflicted mood. Timothy Taylor, W1, to 27 Aug Skye Sherwin Liberation, Manchester The full title of this group show, Liberation: and Its Relative Meaning, reflects artist Liu Ding&apos;s ambivalent observations on the role of the internet in freeing up or closing down the potential for international communications. His installation, Gravestone for Rumour Monger, was inspired by a period in which the artist was made the defenceless target of online slander. There are weeping black clouds and a maze of dark corners behind which people can hide and whisper maliciously. Elsewhere, artists reflect on the fact that the self-publishing, individual voice enabled by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has been politically censored in China. Chinese Arts Centre, to 14 Aug Robert Clark William Morris, Bowness-on-Windermere Reacting to the experiential and environmental wastage of the industrial revolution, the Arts and Crafts pioneer William Morris posited a collective lifestyle in which like-minded socialists would live and work amid surroundings made special by their cherished creations. A treasuring of natural and architectural place was crucial to Morris&apos;s worldview. In the charming Blackwell Arts and Crafts House, this exhibition charts Morris&apos;s sense of place through graphic design, textiles, hand-printed books and photographs of the bearded back-to-nature genius himself. Morris&apos;s houses are well documented, including the Red House in Bexleyheath, which he planned to make &quot;the beautifulest place on Earth&quot;. While Morris&apos;s project might appear idealistic and economically unrealistic, his life may now read as an early warning of our present-day ecological alarm.

This is the way pre-match talk is heading as this World Cup final is portrayed as a battle of the clones. It falls to the European champions now to assert a non-Dutch identity. By Sunday night, the Spanish are likely to have shown a global audience that they have a few good ideas of their own. Vicente del Bosque&apos;s side are more tortured by history than their opponents. Their second continental title at Euro 2008 conferred a respectability on Spanish football that their record at world level lacks.  \u2022 Sign up to play our great Fantasy Football game\u2022 Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player\u2022 The latest team-by-team news, features and more\u2022 Follow the Guardian&apos;s Fans&apos; Network now  Fourth place, in 1950, had been their best finish before they recovered from an opening game defeat by Switzerland to reach this final. The Catalan press are saying La Roja are really an extension of Blaugrana: the folk name for Barcelona. In this nationalistic mood they would not want to cede the credit for a Spanish victory to a northern European power. If the theorising in Johannesburg is to be believed Holland have come up with an ingenuous solution to the ancient problem of underachievement. They are trying to win this final by fielding both teams. If the Oranje lose at Soccer City the Dutch will still win it with the country whose football they invented, or claim to have, the day Rinus Michels touched down in Barcelona in 1971 to be followed three years later by Johan Cruyff: the Camp Nou godhead from whom all subsequent beauty supposedly flowed. The theory that Dutch thinkers bequeathed the style Spain will bring to the field today has become so pervasive that the instinct is to search for flaws in that belief. Cruyff, a Bar\u00e7a idol in his playing days and architect of the Dream Team (1991-94), talks of the two cultures as if they are indistinguishable. &quot;I am Dutch but I will always defend the football Spain play,&quot; he says. &quot;If you play attacking football, like Spain do, you have more chances of winning. And if you try to play on the counter against a team that really wants the ball, you deserve to suffer. &quot;The fact is that if you try to outplay Spain they will kill you, and Holland now know they face the best team in the world. When you look at Spain, you see Barcelona, you see Xavi, [Andr\u00e9s] Iniesta, [Sergio] Busquets and Pedro [Rodr\u00edguez] in midfield, players who want the ball but then will put pressure on high up the pitch to win it back. Now, deservedly, Spain are in the final, a match that is only about winning, as I know. Spain have a great footballing generation, who may never get another chance like this.&quot; The premise, encouraged by Cruyff, is that the finalists are blood brothers. The lineage runs like this: at Ajax from 1965-71 Michels revolutionised Dutch club football, pioneered kaleidoscopic Totaal Voetbal (Total Football), exported it to Catalonia, handed it on to Cruyff, who then shaped the Barcelona raison d&apos;\u00eatre in the Ajax image, before Louis van Gaal and Frank Rijkaard kept it going, then passed the torch to Pep Guardiola, the current coach, who was a Barcelona player under Cruyff and Van Gaal. A startling statistic is that 17 members of both squads are graduates of the Ajax and Barcelona academies, and since seven of Spain&apos;s starting XI against Germany on Friday were Barcelona men you can see why this game is being sold as a contest between two incarnations of one philosophy. Unusually, though, only one of Holland&apos;s 23 \u2013 Rafael van der Vaart \u2013 plays in Spain, with Real Madrid, in contrast to the days when Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Van der Vaart and Royston Drenthe were drawing wages at the Bernab\u00e9u, and Van Gaal was flooding Barcelona with Dutchmen. &quot;Yeah, maybe Spain is influenced by Bar\u00e7a and Bar\u00e7a is influenced by Johan Cruyff and Rinus Michels. That&apos;s a big compliment for Dutch football,&quot; said Bert van Marwijk, the current Holland coach. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s a bit ironic but I don&apos;t think in that way. We respect Spain but we want to do it our way. &quot;At the moment I think Spain play a little bit more attractive than we do and we would like to play football as attractive as them. Spain are playing very well with the ball but without the ball they are reacting very quickly so it could be a very interesting game for two teams trying to play football.&quot; This subject is all the rage. Busquets told journalists: &quot;I can say about Van Gaal and Cruyff, who&apos;ve been at the club where I play, that they did a great job and brought through players from the academy because it&apos;s a philosophy they have. Rijkaard also introduced the 4-3-3 system [Busquets ought to have said re-introduced] and was the one who started this style of play at Barcelona. It was subsequently transferred to the national team. With Bar\u00e7a&apos;s philosophy they have helped [Spain].&quot; Cruyff, who talks often to Van Marwijk, has assumed a kind of emotional dual nationality. Loyalty to the old country competes for his affections with the sense he has that his greatest imprint, post-playing, is to be found on the Spanish game. He says: &quot;It&apos;s the Spanish players who are better to work with. Dutch players already start to say &apos;Yes, but&apos; when you open your mouth to speak.&quot; In both camps a tradition of feuding has subsided, and this, as much as stylistic innovation, may explain why there will be a new name on the trophy this weekend. In Spain the Catalan-Castillian schism has healed. Specifically both countries line up 4-2-3-1, with two screening players, one striker and a conductor. Holland have Wesley Sneijder and Spain use Xavi in the No10 position. But Spain have a second artist \u2013 Iniesta \u2013 in an attacking midfield role, and their two holding players, Busquets and Xabi Alonso, are vastly superior ball players to Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong. Spain&apos;s defenders are considerably more agile and expressive than Holland&apos;s rather more wooden back four. The Dutch have compromised on their history; the Spanish have slapped gold paint on theirs. To be strictly analytical, too, Spain&apos;s soft one-touch tippy-tappy passing is not identical to the classical Dutch method, in which the probing is sharper and more angular. But both teams aim to &quot;circulate&quot; the ball and &quot;think spatially&quot;: two requirements from the Dutch bible. Van Marwijk&apos;s Holland talk as if to match Xavi and Iniesta&apos;s passing is unfeasible, so some are raising the spectre of Internazionale&apos;s Champions League semi-final triumph over Barcelona, for which Sneijder was a catalyst. To contain Spain and apply more lethal finishing than Del Bosque&apos;s team have been able to demonstrate in three successive 1-0 wins may be Holland&apos;s deepest hope. There are other differences, too easily overlooked as this philosophical union is declared a fact. They are to be found in temperament, character, language, upbringing, deportment and tone. Dutch fans are not like their Spanish counterparts, and the flavour of games at the Bernab\u00e9u and Camp Nou is not interchangeable with those in Amsterdam or Rotterdam. After his team had knocked out Germany in Durban, Xavi boasted: &quot;The Spanish personality imposed itself.&quot; He said nothing about the Dutch.", "sentences": ["Dutch fans are not like their Spanish counterparts, and the flavour of games at the Bernab\u00e9u and Camp Nou is not interchangeable with those in Amsterdam or Rotterdam."], "title": "World Cup final: Spain and Holland fight it out for winning philosophy | Paul Hayward", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jul/10/world-cup-final-spain-holland", "tags": ["Spain", "Holland", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-10T23:04:11Z", "article": "Try to imagine Italians suddenly losing interest in food, Saudi Arabia becoming famous for its relaxed topless beaches, or Lady Gaga metamorphosing into a shy, unmusical nun. Even then you&apos;re not close to comprehending the scale of transformation the World Cup is wreaking on the Netherlands. For decades, the reputation of the country as a bastion of free thinking, creativity and fun was buttressed by its uniquely attractive football culture. The totaalvoetballers carved out a niche by playing daring, creative, attacking football \u2013 and usually lost their most important matches in tragic circumstances. Their tendency to self-destruction in major tournaments made the Dutch many people&apos;s favourite second team. Holland was the Lord Byron or Marilyn Monroe of international football. Now, despite reaching the World Cup final for the first time since 1978, oranje have lost much of their charm. The team relies on hard work, group loyalty, defence and counter-attack. The unique Dutch are now, like everyone else, playing for results. The sympathetic nation of Beautiful Losing is winning ugly. Just as Brazil has traded for decades on the image of Pele, the best-known modern Dutch people are not architects, artists, business people or politicians; they are fabulous but fragile footballers such as Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp. Dutch football as we have known it was born in Amsterdam in the late 1960s as the city was being transformed by social and cultural revolution. Playful Provos and anarchists were subverting the old, grey, sober Netherlands and turning the city into a centre of world hippiedom. Meanwhile, iconoclastic Ajax coach Rinus Michels and teenage genius Cruyff were laying down the blueprint for a revolution in football. Within a few years, Amsterdam went from backwater to world significance. In the early 1970s Ajax won the European Cup three years in a row with their dazzling cerebral style, and the official foreign policy of the radical government of Joop den Uyl was Nederland gidsland, literally Netherlands Guiding Country. In both cases, the idea was that the ever-moral Dutch would show the rest of the world how things were done. But Nederland gidsland bit the dust in the wake of the economic crisis that overwhelmed Holland following the Yom Kippur War and the Arab oil boycott. The football was never quite the same after the 1974 World Cup final against the West Germans in Munich, when Holland took the lead in the second minute, yet lost. The day is remembered in Holland with the sort of shudder still evoked in America by recollection of the assassination of President Kennedy. The Dutch convinced themselves they were moral winners because they played the more beautiful football. Now this view is being fundamentally challenged. The difference between old and new was vividly illustrated in the moments leading to Holland&apos;s first goal in their semi-final against Uruguay. The goal recalled the old days: Holland&apos;s captain, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, thumped in from long range just as Arie Haan did against Italy 32 years ago. Yet this beauty was made possible by a brutal foul a few moments earlier on a Uruguayan defender who was lucky not to have his leg broken. The man who perpetrated the foul was Mark van Bommel, son-in-law of Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk. Tellingly, it is Van Bommel rather than Van Bronckhorst who has become the new folk hero in Holland among the young orange-clad crowds partying and watching the games on big screens. Older fans, for whom the football of Cruyff defined an era much as did the Beatles, wonder if the Netherlands is losing its soul. Auke Kok, columnist for the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, went so far as to suggest a link between the pragmatism of Van Marwijk and the politics of Geert Wilders, the populist anti-Islam politician whose PVV party became the third-largest political bloc in last month&apos;s elections. Football has always been powerfully entwined with culture and politics in the Netherlands. It was no accident that the sudden rise of Wilders&apos;s predecessor, Pim Fortuyn, came in late 2001, just after Holland were shockingly beaten by Ireland in Dublin and therefore failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Fortuyn represented a darker side to Dutch liberalism. His eponymous party, the Pim Fortuyn List, exploited growing anxiety over immigration and identified a new enemy for the Dutch open society: Islam. When Fortuyn was assassinated in 2002 \u2013 by a Dutchman who claimed he was acting to protect Muslims from being &quot;scapegoated&quot; \u2013 it was clear that Dutch society and politics was developing a sharper edge. The famous coffee shops, where cannabis could be smoked freely, have come under scrutiny as politicians attempt to balance an easygoing approach with the demands of a vocal anti-drugs lobby. Amid concern at the level of criminal activity in Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district, half of the city&apos;s &quot;prostitution windows&quot; were closed in 2007. According to Paul Scheffer, one of the country&apos;s most perceptive cultural and political commentators, what we are seeing from the men in orange in South Africa reflects a more cautious and fearful nation. &quot;We are more insecure, conservative. You could also call it realism. We have become aware of our vulnerability, so have a more sober idea of what we can do, what we can be. The more free-floating, high-minded idea of what we represent in the world has got lost a bit in the last 10 years. Of course you lose something that was nice, but you lose also something that was irritating \u2013 I never liked all that moralism. &quot;You have something now that is less interesting because it&apos;s less distinctive. We focus on the result and don&apos;t worry if it&apos;s nice to watch. We&apos;ve become more average, and the paradox is that perhaps being average will win us the World Cup. People I talk to have very mixed feelings. There&apos;s enthusiasm and also disbelief. How did we manage to beat Brazil? The way Brazil lost was the way Holland used to lose: they imagined they were already in the semi-final and relaxed.&quot; The success of the Dutch team, which is notably less gifted than its predecessors, is connected to its sense of its own limitations. &quot;The brutal bargain of modern football is that is just impossible to win while playing really attractively. It seems you cannot be innocent and win. And that is terrible because winning represents power. There&apos;s no way you can become president of the United States and be moral. I don&apos;t think you can win the World Cup in an innocent way. &quot;And that&apos;s the sadness. Realism engulfs the creativity to some extent, and with it the joy. As fans in the past 40 years watching the Dutch team, we always liked to win but it was more important to play beautiful football. Now we see the goal of Van Bronckhorst is only possible because of the foul of Van Bommel. Winning comes at a price.&apos;&apos; David Winner is the author of Brilliant Orange: the Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football (Bloomsbury)", "sentences": ["Dutch football as we have known it was born in Amsterdam in the late 1960s as the city was being transformed by social and cultural revolution.", "Within a few years, Amsterdam went from backwater to world significance.", "Amid concern at the level of criminal activity in Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district, half of the city&apos;s &quot;prostitution windows&quot; were closed in 2007."], "title": "World Cup 2010: Holland's new football reflects a nation's changes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/11/holland-world-cup-final", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Holland", "World Cup 2010", "World news", "Europe", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-10T23:05:49Z", "article": "The song everyone in the Netherlands has been singing along to these past few days is Majesteit (Majesty). Written spontaneously by a singer and a cabaret artist while on safari in South Africa during the World Cup, it takes the form of an appeal to Queen Beatrix. &quot;Majesty, majesty, do you have some time next week?&quot; it starts, and then advises her that her team are about to become world champions, and she needs to get on board. &quot;You can prove your bravery/By putting on a Bavaria dress,&quot; they advise. However, if she does not join the fun, then, Majesty, majesty, you will have lost your job And the new queen is called Yolanthe. Yolanthe is Yolanthe Cabau van\u00a0Kasbergen, actress, TV presenter, and Wesley Sneijder&apos;s Wag. Together they are the most famous and most ridiculed celebrity couple in the Netherlands. The song is best understood as a cautious rapprochement from the Dutch people to the little playmaker: if he wins them the World Cup today, they may actually start to like him. Sneijder was born into a working-class family in Utrecht 26 years ago, part of a Dutch golden generation (in this case the phrase is not ironic). Arjen Robben, Rafael van der Vaart, Robin van Persie, Nigel de Jong and Johnny Heitinga \u2013 about half the team who will start the final \u2013 were also born in 1983 and 1984. But whereas Robben is a sui generis phenomenon, a Brazilian footballer born in the drab northern Netherlands, the others were shaped into typically Dutch footballers during childhoods spent at Ajax and Feyenoord. None is more typically Dutch than Sneijder. He is like a pocket-sized tribute to the nation&apos;s football tradition: a brilliant two-footed Ajax-raised passer with a big mouth. He shot through Ajax&apos;s youth teams, usually in tandem with De\u00a0Jong, who in the days before he became an enforcer fancied himself as a footballer. Little Wesley would curve in the free\u2011kicks, with either foot according to taste, and little Nigel would run in and head them home. Like many of the best central midfielders in this tournament \u2013 Xavi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta or Mesut Ozil \u2013 Sneijder would probably never have been given the position at an English club. After all, he is only 5ft 7in. Ajax, like Barcelona, never worried about height. Aged 18 he was promoted to the first team and three months later he was playing for Holland. The only problem was his personality. Even at Ajax, nobody could quite recall anyone so small and so young with such a big mouth since the waif-like &quot;Jopie&quot; Cruyff had made his debut in 1964. Amsterdammers call the style Amsterdamse bluf. Elsewhere it is called something else. When Ajax&apos;s then coach Ronald Koeman dared start the 20-year-old Sneijder on the bench, the kid came on as a sub, scored, and then swivelled to the bench and raised his middle finger at Koeman. Jaap Stam, who ended his playing days with Ajax, phrased it in the cliches mastered over a successful international career: &quot;Wesley is a bit of a controversial person and he really knows what he wants. He&apos;s not afraid to voice his opinion. He&apos;s a great guy and I kind of like players like him.&quot; Real Madrid briefly kind of liked him, too. In 2007 they paid \u20ac27m for him. There was talk of his younger brother Rodney coming along from Ajax, but Sneijder prohibited the move, saying: &quot;I am not a supporter of juniors increasingly going to top clubs. I have told him he must first try to break through at Ajax.&quot; Rodney, now 19, languishes in Ajax&apos;s reserves. Jeffrey, the oldest brother, played four professional matches for Stormvogels Telstar. Sneijder accepted Real Madrid as his due. He expects the world, and generally gets it. Yolanthe was voted sexiest Dutchwoman so regularly that one year she withdrew from contention to give others a chance. One day Sneijder texted her. They began going out. Soon afterwards, on an aeroplane, he grabbed a microphone and proposed. Thankfully, they have not yet accepted offers to star in a reality TV show, but the point is that Sneijder is confident. About a year ago, though, everything suddenly seemed to fall apart for him. Real began buying gal\u00e1cticos. Initially Sneijder was sure the club woule not sell him. &quot;My situation is clear,&quot; he reassured Dutch fans. He advised his buddy Van der Vaart to leave Real and go somewhere he was wanted. Then, to Sneijder&apos;s surprise, Real sold him and let Van der Vaart stay. &quot;The people who now run Real Madrid are not fine people,&quot; Sneijder lamented. Influential people inside Holland&apos;s camp were tiring of him, too. In one incident, at breakfast with the Dutch team, Sneijder had asked Piet Velthuizen, goalkeeper of Vitesse Arnhem (but perhaps soon of West Ham): &quot;Hey, Piet, how much do you earn?&quot; &quot;\u20ac400,000,&quot; Velthuizen had proudly replied. &quot;Don&apos;t you think it&apos;s funny,&quot; Sneijder said, &quot;that I make 20 times as much as you?&quot; After the exchange was leaked, Sneijder protested that he and Velthuizen had been joking. That may be true \u2013 footballers&apos; humour is no laughing matter \u2013 but the conversation was classic Sneijder. He was a disruptive force in the Dutch team, quarrelling with his enemy Van\u00a0Persie over who got to take free-kicks. In the end the Dutch assistant coach Frank de Boer ruled in favour of Sneijder. Challenged on this, De\u00a0Boer replies with impeccable logic: &quot;Well, where else am I going to put that Smurf when we get a free-kick?&quot; Sneijder does not typically rule the skies like Duncan Ferguson did. His header that slayed Brazil was such a surprise that he\u00a0ran off smacking his forehead and chuckling. But last summer, the people who run the Dutch team, knowing the damage the Dutch tradition of conflictmodel had done to their football, were thinking of not taking Sneijder to South Africa. Then Jos\u00e9 Mourinho saved his season. Much as Sneijder had wooed Yolanthe, the former Inter coach sent Sneijder daily texts expressing his love. As with Yolanthe, it was a meeting of souls. Sneijder joined Inter (a snip at \u20ac15m) and said of his cocky little manager: &quot;He could have been my father.&quot; Sneijder loved the way Mourinho sat at the back of the plane among the players, instructed Sneijder not to bother defending, and knew to attack through Xavi&apos;s territory when Barcelona lost the ball. Together the little men won Serie\u00a0A, the Italian Cup and the Champions League. Sneijder capped the season by making a celebrity conversion to Catholicism, inspired by the formidable duo of Yolanthe and Inter&apos;s captain Javier Zanetti. Their impending marriage is dreaded in the Netherlands as a likely reliving of the Posh and Becks union done in the manner of tragedy repeating itself as farce. Most English fans by now think it inevitable that footballers behave like celebrities, but Dutch supporters still like their players to be ordinary. Sneijder is not. Yet he set aside his exhausting personal schedule for a few weeks, flew to South Africa, and has been the best Dutch player here alongside Mark van Bommel. He has sprayed inch-perfect passes and scored five goals. Not everyone is overjoyed. David Winner, author of Brilliant Orange and a British custodian of the Dutch tradition, notes that three of Sneijder&apos;s goals were deflections. Henk Spaan, compiler of the authoritative list of the 100 best Dutch footballers ever, when asked where Sneijder now ranks, replies: &quot;He&apos;s so lucky I&apos;d advise him to play in every lottery. Against Spain he&apos;ll probably score off the referee&apos;s back.&quot; But nothing anyone says now can dent Sneijderian cockiness. Deflections aren&apos;t luck, he explains. &quot;You have to look for it, to force it. That&apos;s what I do. You have to have the horniness to go for goal.&quot; And he adds, in words not spoken by an England player in South Africa: &quot;I&apos;m enjoying every day here. That helps too. It&apos;s fantastic to be on the field.&quot; The old conflict with Van Persie (who also refers to Sneijder as The Smurf) is now merely simmering. When the striker was substituted against Slovakia, he allegedly shouted at Holland&apos;s coach Bert van Marwijk that he should have taken Sneijder off instead, but Van Persie denied saying it. Against Uruguay it was noticeable that Sneijder kept passing to a nervous Robben rather than to Van Persie, but nobody can build a strong case against Sneijder now. In any case, he has chosen to be deaf to the usual Dutch disparagement of his life and personality. In South Africa, he handed his laptop to Yolanthe for safekeeping to avoid the media reports. Now he is going about crowing. For once, who can blame him? As if on the sofa with his psychoanalyst, he told the Dutch wire service ANP about a dream he had on Wednesday night: &quot;Yes, it was about the final. Who won? Who do you think? It was a remarkably good game. Afterwards I was satisfied. I got another drum as man of the match. Ha, ha, ha. When I woke up, I was lying in the canal.&quot; (That last line is not some Freudian reworking of drowning anxieties. The Netherlands traditionally celebrates victories in big tournaments \u2013 at least, its one victory in a big tournament in 1988 \u2013 with a boat tour through the canals of Amsterdam. Drunks jump in the water.) Sneijder is the self-help guru&apos;s dream: the man with perfect confidence. He finds it &quot;not surprising&quot; that Manchester United want to sign him, but is talking about extending his contract at Inter until 2015. That everyone thinks Spain will win means nothing to a man who believes he has everything. &quot;Do you think they&apos;re not worried?&quot; he asked the ANP. &quot;Yesterday I had contact with Sergio Ramos, my old team-mate at Real Madrid. He texted, &apos;Will you take it easy, Wes? You&apos;ve already got three prizes.&apos; That says enough, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; Sneijder has heard he would be the first footballer to win the treble plus World Cup, and adds modestly: &quot;People are already talking about the Golden Boot. Who cares about the Golden Boot? I want the golden cup.&quot; If he does win it, it is possible he will\u00a0cease to be the most ridiculed man in Holland.

Because this is the THE WORLD CUP FINAL!!!!! So let&apos;s ramp up the hype and just go with it.  With no previous between Holland and Spain to drone on about, we might as well remember World Cup finals previous. Not least because Holland featured in two of them, in 1974 and 1978, and Spain made one, sort of, in 1950.

Here&apos;s Hector Castro - who only had one hand, having clumsily lopped the other off operating an electric saw while working as a chippy - scoring Uruguay&apos;s fourth. Winning keeper Enrique Ballestrero was only in the team because first-choice Andres Mazali had been thrown out of the squad for nipping off home to &quot;see&quot; his wife.

The Italians needed this late equaliser by Raimondo Orsi to force extra time, during which Angelo Schiavio scored the winner.

After the game, Hungary&apos;s defeated keeper Antal Szab\u00f3 said: &quot;I may have let in four goals but at least I saved their lives.&quot; Nice try, loser, but the note was just a rallying cry in the vernacular along the lines of &quot;win or bust&quot;.

Spain were in a final pool along with this pair and Sweden, but didn&apos;t win a game and got tanked 6-1 by Brazil to end up in fourth place, or bottom, depending on how charitable you&apos;re feeling. Anyway, this isn&apos;t about them: here&apos;s Alcides Ghiggia sending Brazil into the abyss, the most dramatic goal in a final, ever, no question.      West Germany's Helmut Rahn celebrates after tying the score Photograph: Getty    1954: West Germany 3-2 Hungary. Here&apos;s a story about some British officials cocking things up big style. The Germans had come from two down to lead hot favourites Hungary with five minutes to go; this is hero Helmut Rahn scoring his first. Ferenc Puskas equalised with seconds left on the clock, but referee Bill Ling and his linesman Mervyn Griffiths called it offside. Oh Britain! How could you!      Nils Liedholm scores the opening goal Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images    1958: Brazil 5-2 Sweden. Nils Liedholm put the Swedes ahead after four minutes. Much good the early lead did them: Brazil ran out 5-2 winners, Vava and Pele scoring two each at the Rasunda Stadium, Coronation Street, Stockholm.      Brazilian player Zito celebrates Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images    1962: Brazil 3-1 Czechoslovakia. Garrincha had got himself sent off in the semi, but for some reason was allowed to play in the final. Eh? He went on to achieve bugger all in the game, mind, but still. Not very memorable, this one, though Czechoslovakia keeper Viliam Schrojf did have a minor nervous breakdown midway through the second half.      1966 World Cup final Photograph: L'EQUIPE/Mark Leech Sports Photography    1966: England 4-2 West Germany. Here&apos;s a question: why doesn&apos;t Roger Hunt follow the ball in, instead of waving his arms around like a US car-lot inflatable? Saved everyone involved a whole lot of trouble and heartache, that would have, and then some.      Jim Baxter Photograph: Pa    1967: Scotland 3-2 England. Alf Ramsey&apos;s side couldn&apos;t hold onto their title for very long. His Scottish counterpart Bobby Brown took all of one match to mastermind this one-goal thrashing, Jim Baxter famously playing keepy-upp... OK, yes, this is pathetic.      1970 World Cup final Photograph: Popperfoto    1970: Brazil 4-1 Italy. This tournament should be remembered for the supernova genius of Clodoaldo, who scored in the semi, gave away a goal in the final with an insouciant backheel, set the move which led to the famous Carlos Alberto goal (sort of pictured) in motion, then did the square root of bugger all for the rest of his career. But it isn&apos;t. There&apos;s no justice.      Cruyff, Breitner and Vogts Photograph: Anp/EPA    1974: West Germany 2-1 Holland. The first of the Netherlands&apos; heartbreakers. They were outplayed in the final, though, no matter what the legend says: in the second half, the Germans had a good goal ruled out for a preposterous offside, and had a clear penalty turned down. Of course, Germany&apos;s first goal wasn&apos;t a penalty, so it sort of levels out I suppose. It was a British referee having a shocker, incidentally. Oh Jack Taylor! How could you!      1978 World Cup final Photograph: Peter Robinson/EMPICS Sport    1978: Argentina 3-1 Holland. Some serious bad luck for the Dutch here, Rob Rensenbrink hitting the post in the dying seconds of the game. No country has come closer to winning a World Cup yet failed to win one. Still, never mind Holland, it all meant Cesar Luis Menotti could become the coolest World Cup winning manager of all. I like to picture him sitting in one of these spherical white plastic chairs, fag and long G&amp;T on the go, bossa nova on the stereo, idly flicking through some socialist literature as he glances out of his apartment window over the River Plate, while beautiful women breeze past him in long billowing chiffon dresses, occasionally catching his eye. I digress.      1982 World Cup Final Photograph: POPPERFOTO    1982: Italy 3-1 West Germany. Bit annoyed I couldn&apos;t get a picture of Enzo Bearzot wearing his stunning white blazer with gold buttons. But all pictures of this World Cup are beautiful; it&apos;s got a certain cooked glamour no other tournament has. Shame hosts Spain were making a show of themselves at it.      Sergi Batista is stripped of his clothes by an excited Argentine fan Photograph: Alamy    1986: Argentina 3-2 West Germany. This isn&apos;t quite so glamorous, what with it being a picture of Sergio Batista being stripped to his grundies by a lunatic fan who should probably be up before the beak for reasons various. Still, what a final, eh.      1990 World Cup final Photograph: Simon Bruty/ALLSPORT    1990: Argentina 1-0 England. That would surely have been the score had Bobby Robson&apos;s side converted all their penalties against West Germany in the semi, Diego Maradona scoring a last-minute winner by strolling past Peter Shilton whistling, with the ball tucked under his arm like a newspaper. As it was, the Germans won the dullest final of all, 1-0.      1994 World Cup final Photograph: Mike Powell/ALLSPORT    1994: Brazil 0-0 Italy. Brazil won this one on penalties. Or did Italy lose it? Dreadful final, anyway, though if one man deserved to lift the World Cup this year it was Roberto Baggio. Such a shame the wonderful Barry Davies, commentating on the big one for the first and last time, was lumbered with this terrible affair.      1998 World Cup final Photograph: Antonio Scorza/EPA    1998: France 3-0 Brazil Holland, surely the best side at France 98, threw this World Cup away, losing to Brazil in the semi finals. Everyone was happy enough with this result, mind, as there was a new name on the trophy. There&apos;ll be more of this today, one way or the other.      2002 World Cup final Photograph: David Guttenfelder/AP    2002: Brazil 2-0 Germany. England beat Germany 5-1 in the qualifiers. Germany responded by reaching the final despite being hilariously useless. You have to hand it to them. Brazil were too good, though, Ronaldo scoring twice. He must surely regret that clown&apos;s haircut, though. What a way to tarnish your legacy.      2006 World Cup final Photograph: John Macdougall/AFP/Getty Images    2006: Italy 1-1 France. It wasn&apos;t very good, this, although you have to hand it to Marco Materazzi, who enjoyed the sort of emotional rollercoaster Brazil&apos;s Felipe Melo went on this year against the Dutch, only Marco&apos;s had more than one up. Great closing montage by ITV, though, and it&apos;s not often you can say that.  2010: Holland v Spain. Classic, please!  Kick off: 7.30pm.  The stadium: Soccer City, Jo&apos;burg.  What neither team should need to have on, what with this being the World Cup final and all: The battle fever.  The kits: Holland will be playing in their traditional oranje shirts, but with the same colour breeks as opposed to the normal black. Spain will be bowling around in blue shirts. Think all of this is for the best, in terms of a classic aesthetic. &quot;If Menotti epitomized the sexy 70s, and Enzo Bearzot was 80&apos;s chic, Italian-style, which coach would better represent the spirit of our age?&quot; wonders Justin Kavanagh. &quot;The Dutch Paul Weller lookalike or Spain&apos;s lugubrious, seen-it-all-before police inspector-type?&quot;  Holland, much as expected - and lining up 1 to 11, a World Cup final first: Stekelenburg, Van Der Wiel, Heitinga, Mathijsen, Van Bronckhorst, Van Bommel, De Jong, Sneijder, Robben, Kuyt, van Persie.Subs: Vorm, Boulahrouz, Ooijer, De Zeeuw, Braafheid, Elia, Schaars, Babel, Afellay, Huntelaar, Van der Vaart, Boschker.  Spain, much as expected too, with no Fernando Torres: Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Pique, Puyol, Capdevila, Busquets, Alonso, Xavi, Iniesta, Pedro, Villa.Subs: Valdes, Albiol, Marchena, Torres, Fabregas, Mata, Arbeloa, Llorente, Javi Martinez, Silva, Jesus Navas, Reina.  The referee: Do we need to tell you? It&apos;s England&apos;s Howard Webb, from Britain&apos;s England.  Alan Hansen: an absolute _________ [fill in according to taste, bias, how many children are at your computer reading, etc.]. Nelson Mandela has turned up at the stadium to wave a bit at the crowd. All very nice. In the BBC studio, Hansen opines that Mandela is &quot;an absolute legend&quot;. Football cliches don&apos;t really do service to decades of democratic struggle, do they?  In case you&apos;re having trouble filling in that gap: &quot;Quite frankly, we&apos;re lucky Hansen didn&apos;t follow up with &apos;he&apos;s got everything: pace, power...&apos;,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. David Wall adds: &quot;Will Alan Shearer ever have an original thought or independent opinion? First he copies Hansen&apos;s standard criticism of defences, then the black shirts, and now he follows him in choice of suit as well. There&apos;s a bit of a single-white-female thing going on there and i&apos;d be getting worried if I were the Scotsman. Shearer could probably do some damage with his pen.&quot; Right, that&apos;s enough criticism of the BBC for one evening. They&apos;ve come out second best in this World Cup to ITV. Second best to a panel with Andy Townsend on it. Riffing on their pain seems unnecessarily cruel.  Pre-match niceties #1: With ten minutes to go before kick off, Fabio Cannavaro, the 2006 winning captain, wanders out onto the pitch and waves Italy&apos;s trophy about for the last time. Then he pops it on a plinth in the centre circle. Remember Italy, anyone?      This is tonight's Kick Off Ball, not Howard Webb's head    Pre-match niceties #2: Howard Webb pluckity plucks Kick Off Ball from Kick Off Ball Plinth, and leads the teams out. &quot;Any word on what happens to the plinths after the tournament is over?&quot; asks Ted Lee. &quot;Do they go on holiday for four years or will they end up on eBay? They might come in handy for holding the odd melon, especially if you live somewhere that has issues with earthquakes.&quot; Sepp Blatter and Jacob Zuma turn up and shake a few hands. Six minutes to go!  Pre-match niceties #3: Both countries listen to their anthems. Both are OK, but I&apos;d have replaced them with a single rendition of Johan Cruyff&apos;s Oei Oei Oei, Dat Was Me Weer En Loei, what with the Brel wannabe linked to both camps in some way or another. It&apos;s got a proper shouting, fighting, drinking and whoring vibe going on, that track, one to soundtrack folk falling around Amsterdam streets at carouse o&apos;clock, if not necessarily the world&apos;s highest profile football match.  Pre-match niceties #4: The toss up. I have no idea who won what. We don&apos;t really need to know, tell the truth. We&apos;ll soon find out. &quot;It&apos;s been pointed out that if you lose to a team that then loses in the next round, your team sucks,&quot; begins the Reverend Sam Pussy Bailey, not his/her given name, I&apos;m saying. &quot;Therefore, I&apos;d just like to point out that not only will tonight&apos;s match decide who the best team is, it will also decide who was the worst team in the final sixteen. The loser combatants are of course both CONCACAF countries, with the US having lost to Ghana, who lost to Uruguay, who lost to Holland; and Mexico, who lost to Argentina, who lost to Germany, who lost to Spain. It&apos;s all a bit confusing and, frankly, a bit of rubbish, but there you have it. The US should stick to Padded Tackle Run and Chase, or Ball Stick Run in Circles.&quot;  The Dutch get into a huddle. The Spanish hang around in relaxed fashion. And we&apos;re off! Holland get things started. Within seconds Kuyt is chasing after a long ball down the left, but there&apos;s a wee bit too much on the pass, and it sails out of play. Nine seconds that took, and the gig&apos;s over for Kick Off Ball. Poor thing, already yesterday&apos;s news.  2 min: A couple of free kicks within a minute, Webb&apos;s first decisions of the game, like we should care. Both go to Spain, the first a bit of an old rake on Pedro&apos;s shin by Van Persie. Keep it calm, now, lads.  3 min: Pedro sends a clever reverse pass down the inside-right channel. Villa hares after it, but he&apos;s miles offside. &quot;A manager to epitomize the current World Cup and follow in such fashionable luminaries as Menotti? I believe Mr. Loew has that one wrapped up,&quot; suggests Ben Dunn. &quot;Blue t-shirt under black jacket with a vampire pale-face and hair that one suspects is not all quite natural. He has an Edward Scissorhands aesthetic about him.&quot;  5 min: Holland are doing nothing to change the minds of those who have them down as cloggers. Van Bronckhorst, in his final match, goes in hard on Xabi down the right. The free kick is swung in from the right towards Sergio Ramos, who heads powerfully goalwards towards the bottom left. Stekelenburg has to get down well to parry the ball out left; it&apos;s eventually hacked clear with Pique lurking. That&apos;s the first chance of the match, a fine header and a fine save too.  7 min: Alonso plays a suicidal blind reverse pass inside from the left wing. The ball rolls across into the centre towards Kuyt, who hits a lame shot towards Casillas from 25 yards. &quot;It was hardly worth putting Kick Off Ball on the plinth,&quot; suggests Karris Evans. &quot;I also really think Howard Webb should have been adorned Olympic style with a Kick Off Whistle.&quot; Named specifically for the point Van Bommel gets his chops up?  9 min: Villa chases a long ball down the inside-left channel. Spain seem happy to play it long as well as doing the Rich Man&apos;s Arsenal thing. Villa nearly gets on the end of it, but Stekelenburg is quickly off his line to claim the bouncing ball.  11 min: Lovely play from Spain, Villa and Busquets changing play from left to right. Ramos takes up possession and skates past a static Kuyt. His ball across is hacked behind by Heitinga. &quot;A nice ironic touch at the closing ceremony with the white elephants,&quot; reports Peter McGushin, who could be making this up, I didn&apos;t see any of it. &quot;Symbolising the surplus to requirements stadia that South Africa are now saddled with after the Beady Eyed Swiss Hobgoblin Circus leaves town.&quot;  12 min: From the corner on the right, Alonso swings a cross to the far post, where Villa volleys into the side netting. This is a magnificent start by the Spanish, a very shaky one by the Dutch.  14 min: Brief respite for Holland, as Spain stroke it around the back awhile. The vuvuzelas are droning in and out, at various rhythms. It&apos;s like a My Bloody Valentine b-side. &quot;You&apos;re really not up to date with the zeitgeist of the nation, are you Scott? I thought this was going to be an MBM of England&apos;s Brave Wise Faultless Hero Howard Webb,&quot; writes Phil Sawyer, mistaking the concept of &apos;nation&apos; for &apos;jingoistic media&apos;.  15 min: Speaking of England&apos;s Brave Wise Faultless Hero Howard Webb, he gets his cards out for the first time. And it&apos;s a no-brainer of a decision, a yellow for Van Persie&apos;s second terrible challenge of the match, a late and high tackle on Capdevila.  17 min: England&apos;s Brave Wise Faultless Hero Howard Webb gets his yellow out for a second time, Puyol coming through Robben&apos;s right foot in order to clear the ball. That&apos;s a fair enough decision as well. And the odds on this getting well out of hand are...?  18 min: From the free kick, 25 yards out on the right wing, Sneijder hammers one straight at Casillas, who swallows it easily enough. That&apos;s a clever effort, though, because Van Persie was running towards the line of flight, and if he&apos;d made up another few inches, might have been able to divert the free kick somewhere else, into the net even.  19 min: Last time round, it was 1-1 by this point. Classic, please!  21 min: Robben goes on his first run of the evening, skating past Alonso down the right at great speed, then nearly skinning Capdevila. Alonso comes back to hoick the ball out for a corner. The set piece is headed clear by Puyol, out for a throw on the left, from which Holland work it into the centre, allowing De Jong to launch a witless high ball straight down the middle. Danger over, but much better from the Dutch.  22 min: VAN BOMMEL BOOKED, AS YOU ALWAYS KNEW HE WOULD BE.  He slides in very, very late on Xavi, rather like the first tackle in this. That&apos;s a yellow, and no wonder.  24 min: Oh this is getting ridiculous now. Kuyt is upended down the left wing, Ramos catching the Dutch striker&apos;s foot a smidgen late. That&apos;s another yellow.  26 min: Busquets and Sneijder tussle in the centre. There&apos;s a case to be made for letting play continue, what with this being a contact sport and all, but instead Webb rushes in waving his hands around like someone who has been on fire for three minutes and is running out of ideas re extinguishing the flames. I know exactly how this is going to pan out, as I suspect you do too.  28 min: Another minute, another yellow, De Jong sticking his studs into Alonso&apos;s chest! That could easily have been a red. Spain were three on one down the right before the whistle went, so that&apos;s doubly fortunate for Holland.  31 min: Spain are beginning to see more of the ball again, but can&apos;t quite put it all together yet. Busquets tries to find Pedro down the left, but Van der Wiel and Van Bommel are quickly on the scene to bundle the ball away. &quot;Isn&apos;t the manager who best sums up this World Cup Jose Mourinho?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. &quot;Best in the world in his position, but just didn&apos;t turn up?&quot;  33 min: Mathijsen hoofs a long ball straight down the middle. Casillas comes to claim with Van Persie in attendance, clatters into Puyol, and puts the ball out so his defender can get treatment. And then...  34 min: ... the Dutch deliver the ball back, only for it to rear up on the turf and force Casillas to tip the ball out for a corner! That was the most risible goalkeeping misjudgement in a World Cup final since Gianluca Pagliuca let the ball spin out of his hands and onto a post in 1994! Holland take the corner, but roll the ball straight to the keeper, an act of sportsmanship not quite in keeping with the filthfest that&apos;s been panning out previously.  37 min: It&apos;s not much of a surprise, but Robben&apos;s been Holland&apos;s best player by a long chalk. He wins a corner down the right. And then, nearly, the cleverest goal in World Cup final history! Robben sidefoots the corner to Van Bommel on the right-hand edge of the area. Van Bommel rolls a diagonal ball to Mathijsen, ten yards out, level with the far post. He&apos;s got a clear shot on goal, the entire Spanish defence wrongfooted, but lets the ball run under his foot. That was very well worked.  38 min: Pedro has a lash from distance, a low shot skimming well wide right, even though the crowd get excited. Any chance Howard Webb has Chance cards from Monopoly in his pocket?&quot; wonders Tom Soule. &quot;That would make this more interesting. You have won second place in a beauty contest. Bank error in your favor. And - more appropriately - Go directly to jail.&quot;  40 min: Van Bommel concedes an etc, and so on, and so forth, 30-odd yards out on the left. The free kick&apos;s swung in towards Puyol near the penalty spot, but Heitinga gets his head there first, and the danger&apos;s mopped up quickly.  42 min: Sneijder plonks his studs on the thigh of Busquets. It looked accidental, though probably wasn&apos;t, so the referee, whoever he is, just gives the Dutch midfielder a talking to. Alonso takes a shot on goal from 40 yards. Come on, man, some respect here, please!  44 min: Suddenly the game opens up a bit. First Spain are this close to releasing Villa down the right, but Mathijsen steps in to intercept what would have been a killer pass. Then Van Bronckhorst swans down the left and finds Van Persie inside, on the edge of the area, with a clever ball; the striker runs the ball out of play as he tries to turn Ramos down the inside left.  45 min: Some panic in the Spanish defence. After some head tennis, the ball breaks to Robben on the right-hand corner of the box. He drops a shoulder, cuts inside, and lashes a low, hard drive towards the bottom-right corner. Casillas gets down well to Gordon Banks it round the post. The corner&apos;s wasted, much like nearly all of these 45 minutes.  HALF TIME: Holland 0-0 Spain. Oh dear. If it wasn&apos;t for the fouls, there&apos;d have been nothing there. Classic, please! It&apos;s not too late, now.  The best half-time analysis you&apos;ll get, though admittedly the BBC are not setting the bar very high, having left it lying on the floor and about to drift away on a puddle of water in the general direction of the swanny: &quot;After 10 minutes my American wife Amy turned to me and said &apos;This is so frustrating. The Spanish are just passing about and not making any progress up the field&apos;,&quot; writes Ewan Benson. &quot;Stereotypes about women, Americans and football put to bed there.&quot;  And we&apos;re off again! Spanish television already has Howard Webb down as a chancer. Join the club, folks! Anyway, they&apos;re arguing that both De Jong and Van Bommel should have walked, with Sneijder possibly also going for that gander down Busquets&apos; leg. Yellows all round sufficed for me, though there&apos;s a strong case for turfing out De Jong. Anyway, Spain get things moving.  46 min: Kuyt tries to free Robben down the inside-right channel, but the pass is way too strong.  48 min: Spain have put their foot on the gas a bit. Busquets nearly frees Xavi on the edge of the area. Spain win a corner down the right. It&apos;s swung in, Puyol flicking it on, level with the near post ten yards out. The ball glides over to Capdevila, free in front of the left-hand side of goal, six yards out. He goes to sidefoot, and completely Mathijesens the ball. What a chance spurned.  50 min: A half-arsed shout for a penalty by Spain as Alonso and Van Bommel go shoulder to shoulder down the left. Nobody&apos;s really feeling it. Then Holland go up the other end, Van Persie sliding the ball down the right for Heitinga, whose low whipped cross is missed by everyone. Except Casillas, who fingertipped the ball as it passed in front of his goal. That should have been a corner, but goal kick it is.  52 min: Robben has a swish from distance, Casillas smothering easily at his left-hand post.  53 min: De Jong and Xavi take turns to lose the ball in the centre circle. That&apos;s all! &quot;Ewan Benson&apos;s American wife Amy is right,&quot; writes Mike Hanton. &quot;Spain&apos;s performance this world cup has been the footballing equivalent of soft jazz. Very pleasant but not really going anywhere. Holland, in contrast, are more like punk- messy but effective. I can see Mark van Bommell being played by Gary Oldman in the biopic.&quot;  55 min: Van Bronckhorst, in his last ever game, is halfway to doing a Zidane, picking up a yellow card for blocking off Ramos as the Spaniard attempts a one-two around him. From the free kick, Xavi curls a not particularly good free kick towards the top-right corner; it sails behind with Stekelenburg covering it all the way.  56 min: Villa appears to be dead after being caught by Heitinga. The Dutchman is booked. That&apos;s probably the first yellow card that looks a bit harsh, given that he&apos;d clipped him slightly late and nothing more. Ah, Villa&apos;s OK.  58 min: Iniesta is late on Robben. There&apos;s not much in the challenge, but if the previous decision was anything to go by, it&apos;s a yellow. This time common sense prevails, not that Holland will see it that way. A free kick, from the right, finds the head of Heitinga at the far post, six yards out. He heads straight across the face of goal, a complete waste, though he&apos;s offside anyway. &quot;I&apos;m just hoping that the final minutes will be enhanced by one of the Spanish players carefully explaining to van Bommel that his name means &apos;Pom-Pom&apos; in German, thus resulting in a Zidanesque charging headbutt,&quot; writes Huw Alexander. &quot;And no second yellow card, of course.&quot; I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll need a sitcomesque series of incidents for this to get out of hand, Huw.  60 min: Pedro goes off, but he&apos;s not replaced by Torres; Nevas comes on. &quot;Today&apos;s final should be sponsored by Hallmark,&quot; suggests Brenda Ellison.  62 min: WHAT A MISS!!! Sneijder takes down a goal kick and slips a lovely pass straight down the centre, freeing Robben. He&apos;s onside, clear on goal with only Casillas to beat, and waits until the keeper commits. But he doesn&apos;t get any height on the ball as he goes to cliip it into the corner, allowing the keeper to stick out a leg and deflect the shot over and out for a corner. Robben puts his head in his hands, and no wonder. That chance was the stuff of dreams. The resulting corner, well, nothing comes of that, a frustrated Robben skying a shot miles over.  65 min:  Iniesta cuts in from the right. He lays off to Xavi and nearly gets the ball back in the area, free in front of goal. Heitinga and Stekelenburg combine to smother the ball. &quot;Howard Webb sucks,&quot; sings Bobby Otter, to the choir. &quot;He is calling things so tight that both teams are flopping like Italians in hopes of causing someine to pick up a second yellow.&quot;  67 min:  Van Persie looks to break down the right. Capdevila cynically clips his heel. He&apos;s booked, the 647th yellow card of the game. This is a total farce.  69 min:  Villa looks to tear clear down the inside-right channel, after a clever pass from Alonso. He&apos;s flagged offside, a borderline decision that should really have gone the way of the attacker. &quot;Any goodwill Holland built up in 1974 and 1978 has been well and truly dissipated by this dismal thuggery,&quot; preaches Father Gary Naylor. &quot;Holland&apos;s good players have been poor and bad players at their worst. They are pulling an average World Cup into the very average category. Both sides are lucky to have nil.&quot;  70 min: WHAT A MISS II!!! A save right up there with Jerzy Dudek&apos;s from Andriy Shevchenko in the 2005 Champions League final. Nevas slaps a low, hard cross through the Dutch six-yard box from the right. Heitinga swipes thin air as the ball passes, allowing it to reach Villa, four yards out, by the left post. He shoots first time, but Stekelenburg somehow parries the ball up and away in a nanosecond. Amazing save, terrible miss. From the corner, nothing except a weak Alonso shot easily gathered by the keeper.  72 min:  Kuyt comes off, flying machine Elia comes on. &quot;Hallmark, eh?&quot; asks Euan Barker of Brenda Ellison&apos;s sponsorship suggestion. &quot;Well I&apos;m certainly greeting,&quot; he quips, a joke in Scots patois for the ages.  74 min:  A free kick 25 yards out for Spain, just to the left of goal. Villa shoves it miles wide right and high. What a piss-poor effort, right in keeping with this final. &quot;On the BBC, Guy Mowbray just said &apos;we&apos;re certainly starting to see mistakes&apos;, in a nice happy voice, as if that&apos;s the best we couldve hoped for,&quot; writes Niall Harden, pouring himself a large gin, rummaging around in the drawer for the Gillettes, and running a hot bath.  76 min:  It&apos;s 0-0!  77 min: WHAT A MISS III!!! Lovely from Spain here, though, as Villa romps down the inside-left channel and rolls the ball inside to Xavi, who returns it into the area. Villa shoots, only to see his low shot deflected well wide for a corner on the left. From it, the ball finds Ramos&apos;s head six yards out. He&apos;s got a free header, and slaps it over the bar. That should have been the opener.  79 min:  Van Bommel leaves his foot in on Iniesta. Iniesta shoulder-barges Van Bommel. Oh for goodness sake, lads, calm down, this is embarrassing. Howard Webb comes over and wags the finger a bit.  80 min:  Spain just took a corner then, but you&apos;ll not be missing anything despite me failing to describe it.  81 min:  Alonso slips the ball inside from the left to Iniesta, who turns through 180 degrees and nips into the box. For a second, he&apos;s got a look at goal, but can&apos;t get his shot away before Sneijder comes across to make a very well-timed tackle. Great play all round. More of this, please!  83 min:  Another miss from Robben as he looks to break through straight down the middle again. He tussles with Puyol, the defender putting his arm around Robben&apos;s waist for a split second. Casillas comes out to claim at Robben&apos;s feet as the striker tries to round him. The Dutchman goes ballistic at the earlier grapple, earning himself a booking. &quot;Apropos soft jazz,&quot; writes Andrea Amegliese, &quot;Swedish TV just announced Eljero Elia is named after Al Jarreau.&quot;  86 min:  Alonso is replaced by Fabregas. &quot;I think England&apos;s Brave Howard Webb has missed a trick here,&quot; writes Ben Hendy. &quot;If he&apos;d sent everyone off (as he could almost have justified), as the last man standing on the pitch, couldn&apos;t he have taken the World Cup for England?&quot;  88 min:  Spain take a quick free kick. Fabregas, in the centre circle, looks up to see eight oranje shirts ahead of him, and two blues. He wonders why he bothered coming on, then rolls it backwards.  89 min:  Van Persie rounds Casillas on the right, then rolls the ball onto the left-hand post. None of it matters, the striker having been caught miles offside. No Rob Rensenbrink moment that.  90 min:  Three minutes separate us with extra time.  90 min +1:  Spain stroke it around a bit. Nevas bursts down the right. Iniesta looks to break into the area from the inside-right channel. Mathijsen steps up to stroll off with the ball.  90 min +2:  Spain stroke it around the back a lot. Holland seem perfectly happy with this.  FULL TIME: Holland 0-0 Spain. Sneijder attempts to score from the halfway line. Now that would have been quite a finish. The effort sails well wide left of the target, no Xabi Alonso he. And that&apos;s it for the 90 minutes. That was terrible. Not as bad as the first half, but awful all the same.  And so we begin again. Spain get it rolling.  ET 2min: Fabregas and Iniesta take wild fresh-air swipes at the ball on the edge of the Dutch box. Xavi kicks Heitinga&apos;s foot and goes down, claiming a penalty. Nothing doing, a good decision. Number of emails you&apos;ve sent in suggesting we give the trophy to Germany: 23.  ET 5min: WHAT A MISS IV!!! Fabregas breaks down the centre, clear of the Dutch back line, a lovely ball through by Iniests. He goes to stroke the ball into the bottom-right corner, but Stekelenberg smothers. &quot;Looking forward to WC 2014 already,&quot; writes Alistair Elder. &quot;2010 has really got my football tastebuds tingling. With cyanide.&quot;  ET 6min: WHAT A MISS V!!! Robben wins a corner down the right. From it, Fabregas blocks Casillas accidentally as the keeper comes for the ball, allowing Mathijsen a free header, six yards out, at the far post. It&apos;s sent sailing over the bar. This lot are both hapless. What a shower of bunglers.  ET 8min:  From a corner on the right, Puyol attempts to guide a header in the vague direction of goal. He fails dismally. &quot;Webb hasnt done too much wrong has he,&quot; opines Christian Holum, &quot;seeing that he comes from a football minnow?&quot;  ET 9min:  The Dutch are beginning to look ragged at the back, though. Iniesta breaks through down the centre. He&apos;s only got Van Bommel ahead of him - but runs straight into him with Nevas free just to his left. At this rate, surely Spain will score sooner rather than... no, I&apos;m not going to tempt fate. WILL ONE OF YOU CLOWNS PLEASE SCORE A BLOODY GOAL???  ET 10min:  Van de Vaart replaces De Jong.  ET 11min:  This is as close as we&apos;ve come. Nevas breaks down the inside-right channel and cuts into the area. He hits a low shot towards the near corner. The ball breaks off Van Bronckhorst. The keeper&apos;s on his backside and stranded, but the ball sails right of the post and into the side netting. Most of the stadium thought that was in. The corner... nah.      MBM Howard Webb Photograph: PA    ET 14min:  Fabregas strides down the middle, shifts the ball to the right, and unleashes a low shot that only just sails wide right of the post. &quot;Do you still have a copy of that picture of Webb as a clown?&quot; asks Oliver Pattenden. &quot;I think I&apos;d like to see it again.&quot; Happy to oblige, Oliver.  ET 15min:  Van Bronckhorst has kicked his last ball in anger. Don&apos;t worry, Dutch fans, he&apos;s not been sent off; he&apos;s been replaced by Braafheid.  EXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: You know exactly what the score is. That was better, though. No idea how Spain didn&apos;t score in that half. Surely they should put Torres on here? He might not be in form, but with his pace and the Dutch back line in tatters, something&apos;s got to give surely.  And, for the fourth time this evening, we&apos;re off! Torres does indeed come on, for Villa, who has been pretty poor this evening. &quot;Wonder what odds you&apos;d get on a penalty shoot out finishing 0-0?&quot; wonders Mark Walsh. For goodness sake don&apos;t tempt fate, we&apos;ll be here all night.  ET 16min:  Xavi crosses the ball into the Dutch area from the left. It hits Braafheid on the baack of his heid, looping comically back into the arms of Stekelenburg. &quot;Is van Bommel Dutch for battle fever?&quot; wonders Damian Spendel.  ET 17min:  Elia finds some space down the left but forgets to put in a cross and lets the ball run out of play. &quot;This game has sucked all the life out of me,&quot; says Eric Calhoun. &quot;All I&apos;m left with is a vague hope Spain win so that Paul the Octopus preserves his perfect record. I would chip in to buy him a little trophy to go in his tank.&quot;  ET 19min: FINALLY, IT HAPPENS! BUT IT&apos;S NOT A GOAL. HEITINGA SENT OFF!!! Xavi clips a clever ball down the inside-left channel for Iniesta. He&apos;s about to race into the area, so Heitinga puts an arm on his shoulder and brings him down. That&apos;s a second yellow - there were men covering - and two of those equals a red. He&apos;s the fifth player to be sent packing in a final.  ET 20min:  Xavi curls a hopeless free kick high over the bar.  ET 22min:  Van der Wiel is booked for clipping Iniesta as he bombs down the left. From the free kick, Stekelenburg punches powerfully clear. Nevas hoofs a useless shot miles into the top section of the stand behind the goal.  ET 24min:  Robben is lucky not to pick up a second yellow after punting the ball into the Spanish goal long after the whistle had gone for offside.  ET 25min:  A free kick for Holland, 30 yards out, dead centre. Well, OK, just a tad to the right. But not much. Robben takes a whack at goal, the ball ballooning off the Spanish wall and wide left of goal. For some reason, a goal kick&apos;s given. The Dutch go thermonuclear.  ET 26min: GOAL!!! GOAL!!! GOAL!!! Holland 0-1 Spain. Andres Iniesta has surely just won the World Cup for Spain. Torres clips the ball into the centre from the left. The ball bounces dead off a defender by the D. Fabregas is on hand to roll the ball wide right to Iniesta in the box, who takes a touch. The ball rears up and he hammers a shot past the keeper and into the bottom left corner. What an assured finish! But a touch of controversy, because that should have been a corner down the other end.  ET 28min:  Mathijsen is booked for smashing the ball into the ground in a fit of pique with the linesman. I wonder if he mentioned Robben&apos;s free kick and the phantom corner? There&apos;s also a suggestion Elia was fouled up the pitch. Iniesta is booked for taking his shirt off in the melee that resulted in the wake of the goal. Casillas is in tears.  ET 30min:  There are two minutes for Holland to save themselves.  ET 30min +1:  Robben crosses the ball into the box from the right. It&apos;s cleared for a throw. Robben flings it in. Cleared again, by Puyol. Torres chases a long ball - but his hamstring goes! He&apos;s in a heap in agony. He might not care too much in a few seconds. I wonder if that&apos;ll keep him at Liverpool for another season?  AND THAT&apos;S IT!!! SPAIN ARE THE WORLD CHAMPIONS!!! Van Bommel and Sneijder are screaming at the officials, but it&apos;s not going to matter. The whistle&apos;s gone, and Spain are the champions of the world. It wasn&apos;t much of a final, like the Spanish will give a flying one. They&apos;ve won the 2010 World Cup, to add to their Euro 2008 trophy. They now define an era like only an elite few sides in the entire history of football can claim to do. &quot;Paul the Octopus was right again,&quot; notes Kenn Fong. &quot;Put away the olive oil and garlic!&quot;  Spain are putting on their trademark red shirts as they wait to lift their prize. Howard Webb and his cohorts trot up the steps to pick up whatever they&apos;re given. A pen? A bookmark? A carton of fags? I have no idea. Webb&apos;s getting quite the bird from the Dutch fans.  Holland are now three-time World Cup final losers. Bitter rivals Germany have lost four. Problem is, of course, Germany have also won three. Holland have... well, there&apos;s no need to be riffing on their pain right now, they&apos;ll be feeling bad enough. A line of grim faces trot past Sepp Blatter and Jakob Zuma to pick up their loser&apos;s medals.  And now, up come the deserved winners of the 2010 World Cup: Espa\u00f1a!!! The red shirts trot past the dignitaries, medals hanging around their necks. They wait on a circular podium for their captain Iker Casillas to arrive. Which he eventually does. Blatter and Zuma edge across to the platform and give the keeper the prize. He lifts it into the air, screams with joy for a few seconds, then hands it over in order to sob awhile. Scenes of pure joy, as you&apos;d imagine. Congratulations to Spain!!!  Next stop Brazil 2014! Which is a meltdown for the hosts waiting to happen. See you all then for that one!", "sentences": ["It&apos;s got a proper shouting, fighting, drinking and whoring vibe going on, that track, one to soundtrack folk falling around Amsterdam streets at carouse o&apos;clock, if not necessarily the world&apos;s highest profile football match."], "title": "World Cup final: Holland v Spain - as it happened | Scott Murray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/11/holland-spain-world-cup-final-live", "tags": ["Football", "World Cup 2010", "Holland", "Spain", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-11T19:13:00Z", "article": "Two of Europe&apos;s hotbeds of football came to a near-standstill tonight as hundreds of thousands of fans jostled for space around outdoor screens showing the World Cup final to the faithful in Amsterdam and in Barcelona. In the sweaty hours before kick-off, the Dutch city was washed with an orange tide, as more or less everyone, locals, tourists, and even babies and the occasional dog, wore the national side&apos;s colour. As well as T-shirts, dresses, hats and earrings, even the countless vuvuzelas parping tunelessly throughout the streets were a uniform fluorescent amber. The crowds were shoulder-to-shoulder in sticky heat around a vast TV screen on the square adjoining the Van Gogh museum. There were similar scenes, in similar temperatures, around Barcelona&apos;s Pla\u00e7a Espanya. Here, the thousands of supporters bearing the Senyera, the four-barred yellow and red Catalan flag, were almost outnumbered by those carrying Spain&apos;s national flag, a rare sight in Catalonia. On Saturday, a million people had marched through the city to protest at Madrid-imposed restrictions on their new autonomy charter, but some of those same people had turned out to cheer on the national team. Miquel, a university student, said: &quot;Of course, I would like to see them playing for Catalonia, not Spain. But half the team is Catalan, and I&apos;m proud of that. This is like Barcelona winning the World Cup.&quot; Emotions in the Netherlands were more straightforward, if mixed with a realisation that their talented if occasionally workmanlike side were taking on a team playing in a manner once seen as typically Dutch \u2011 the so-called total football notion, developed at Amsterdam&apos;s Ajax club and then exported to Barcelona by the great Johann Cruyff and others. &quot;We&apos;re definitely the underdogs,&quot; admitted Axel de Koenig, a 23-year-old student. &quot;It&apos;s funny we&apos;re going against a country who play like the Dutch used to. They&apos;re more talented as individuals, but we have better team spirit, I hope.&quot; In a bar near the main square, teachers Shaum and Mindi Loewen, originally from Colorado but now based in Berlin, had orange T-shirts and pledged Dutch allegiance after finding a long-planned holiday coinciding with the final. &quot;We&apos;re glad it&apos;s not Germany playing instead of Spain,&quot; said Shaun. &quot;We&apos;d have had to support them, and it might not have been fun if Holland lost.&quot; Back in Barcelona, cooling off in a bar near Pla\u00e7a Espanya, were Oriol Quera and his Dutch friend Cristian. Oriol, a Catalan nationalist, said: &quot;I want Holland to win. I&apos;ll watch the match because I like football. But if Spain win it will be insufferable for us.&quot; &quot;One nil to Holland,&quot; was Cristian&apos;s hopeful prediction. &quot;But at least, if we lose, it will be because the Dutch taught Spain how to play good football.&quot;", "sentences": ["Two of Europe&apos;s hotbeds of football came to a near-standstill tonight as hundreds of thousands of fans jostled for space around outdoor screens showing the World Cup final to the faithful in Amsterdam and in Barcelona.", "This is like Barcelona winning the World Cup.&quot; Emotions in the Netherlands were more straightforward, if mixed with a realisation that their talented if occasionally workmanlike side were taking on a team playing in a manner once seen as typically Dutch \u2011 the so-called total football notion, developed at Amsterdam&apos;s Ajax club and then exported to Barcelona by the great Johann Cruyff and others."], "title": "World Cup 2010 final: Amsterdam and Barcelona come to sweaty standstill", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/11/world-cup-final-amsterdam-barcelona", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Netherlands", "Holland", "Spain", "Spain", "Sport", "Football", "World news", "Europe", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-11T23:06:06Z", "article": "No more all-European finals, thank you very much. The one four years ago that ended with Zinedine Zidane&apos;s head-butt and a penalty shoot-out was bad enough. But no one seriously expected a classic in Berlin that day. Last night&apos;s match was supposed to be a fascinating contest of stylistic nuances, a collision of rival philosophies featuring some of the finest attacking talents in the modern game. But as we had to wait until deep in extra time for Andr\u00e9s Iniesta&apos;s goal, 84,000 people in the stadium and a reputed 700 million television spectators were left wondering when the football was going to start. Didn&apos;t someone tell the players that Nelson Mandela was in the house, never mind Shakira, Charlize Theron and 16 heads of state? Football is about 22 men in search of a result, nothing more and nothing less, but a little entertainment never goes amiss. The previous night&apos;s third-place play-off had produced a match far worthier to be called a final. Germany and Uruguay, in a fixture popularly supposed to exist only to make a bit more money for the organisers, both went for victory from start to finish in what was very probably the best of the tournament&apos;s 64 games. There was high quality and unremitting excitement, and there were goals \u2013 plus that heart-stopping effort from Diego Forl\u00e1n that rattled the German crossbar with the last kick of the match. Oh, for anything half as exciting to warm the spectators on a winter&apos;s night in a spectacular arena set amid the ziggurats of the disused coal mines on the high plain between Johannesburg and Soweto. A tournament that began with the sizzle of Siphiwe Tshabalala&apos;s goal for Bafana Bafana against Mexico seemed to have had the vivacity drained out of it by a surfeit of Old World tactical sophistication. It would be amusing to report that the match started with a long period of Dutch possession, in which the Spanish were reduced to chasing shadowswhile trying to get a touch on the ball. Inevitably, however, the natural order asserted itself from the start, Spain teasing and testing the Holland defence while the men in orange waited for the mistake that might allow them to spring forward. Just as inevitably, there was a lot of unattractive caginess from both sides, a general nervousness making itself clear in inaccurate distribution and regular fouls from players intent on denying space to their opponents. By the time the match entered its second quarter Howard Webb had issued yellow cards to Robin van Persie, Carles Puyol, Mark van Bommel and Sergio Ramos, probably hoping to keep the temperature down. But when Nigel de Jong planted his boot squarely in Xabi Alonso&apos;s chest in the 28th minute, the Dutch midfielder was lucky not to see a card of a deeper shade. Van Bommel, who had tripped Puyol and brought down Xavi after his caution, went over to have a word with Webb as the players and officials left the pitch at half-time, and it was tempting to wonder if he was asking how many more offences he was allowed to commit before receiving the ultimate sanction. That was the level to which the match had descended. Long before the interval the vuvuzelas had virtually fallen silent. A couple of minutes before the interval, a Mexican wave broke out \u2013 perhaps in an attempt, or so one would like to think, to evoke the spirit of the Azteca stadium in the finals of 1970 and 1986, and a sense of drama and adventure sadly lacking from this encounter. The tedium of the first period was relieved by a single significant chance for each side, Maarten Stekelenburg brilliantly parrying Ramos&apos;s header in the fifth minute and Iker Casillas responding 40 minutes later with a sprawling stop to deny Arjen Robben. But the tenor of the match was more accurately expressed when Pedro Rodr\u00edguez attempted to drive through the Dutch rearguard only to be surrounded by five orange shirts. Little changed in the minutes after the interval there were boos as the yellow cards mounted, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, John Heitinga and Joan Capdevila being the next to earn Webb&apos;s disapproval. You had to feel sorry for the Englishman, who had probably hoped, on such a gala occasion, to be able to referee the match with a light touch. Even the harshest critic would admit that Xavi, Robben, Iniesta, Wesley Sneijder, David Villa and Van\u00a0Persie were doing their best to break the deadlock, but systems were strangling the match \u2013 particularly the system of defence devised by Bert van Marwijk, with two uncompromisingly destructive midfield players in front of the four-man defence. Even there it was possible to admire, in a detached kind of way, the discipline and intensity with which the Dutch defenders flew into their interceptions \u2013 as, to be fair, did their Spanish counterparts at the other end. Defending well is as much a part of the game as scoring goals, but if ever there was a final to lend credibility to the concept of anti-football, this was it. Goodness knows what the audiences in front of the big screens in Madrid and Amsterdam, places were they expect something different, were making of it.

The Rotterdam-based NRC Handelsband accused the team of playing &quot;un-Dutch football&quot; following the physical nature of the team&apos;s performance last night. It prompted Webb to issue nine yellow cards to Holland players, two of which were shown to the defender John Heitinga, whose dismissal left Bert van Marwijk&apos;s men to fight out the final 11 minutes of extra-time with 10 men. The general feeling in the Dutch press was that the best side won but that did not spare Webb from their wrath. AD Sportwereld wrote: &quot;The Dutch national team perished in the World Cup final - thanks largely to a chump of a referee. &quot;It was a riveting battle, emerging through the tension but the Philistines were helped by Howard Webb, a controversial referee from England. &quot;He hopped across the pitch, handing out cards, each time preceding the act with an irritating address of the culprit. &quot;Spain&apos;s winning goal was understandably celebrated passionately by the Spaniards but the blunder by Webb which came before - he missed an obvious corner for Holland, took the shine off it, at least for the Dutch.&quot; De Telegraaf noted: &quot;The referee failed to calm the mood in 120 minutes. That he was booed at the final ceremony by both the Dutch and Spanish fans was significant.&quot; De Telegraaf was disappointed with a final which was a niggly, fractious affair. &quot;The tone was often unpleasant,&quot; it said adding, &quot;it was not helped by referee Webb. The paper&apos;s front page said Holland&apos;s players &quot;fought like lions,&quot; alongside a picture of striker Robin van Persie and winger Arjen Robben both holding their heads in their hands.

They have the same hairdos and elegant dress sense. Time seems to have as little effect on Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin as on the mutant creatures they created for magazines. The two Dutch photographers, who have in the last 20 years established themselves as an essential pair in fashion photography, are temporarily back in the Netherlands from New York. The Foam Photography museum in Amsterdam has staged a large and slightly indigestible retrospective (until 25 September), featuring 300 works. There are all sorts of pictures here \u2013 fashion, advertising, celebrity portraits, self-portraits \u2013 but they are all provocative, sensual and unreal. Concern for resemblance is never part of the equation. Indeed the duo first came to media attention when they started tinkering with images on a computer. &quot;We learned to use Quantel Paintbox software at university,&quot; says Van Lamsweerde. &quot;At the time use of IT was marginal, like to put a sheen on a car, not to create pictures.&quot; In 1991 the pair saved a rainy photo shoot from disaster. For the background they used sunlit material taken while preparing the location, then superimposed studio pictures of the models. Then for a series for The Face in 1994 they used background material from a picture library for the first time. Their pictures were in step with the emerging digital revolution: bodies verging on science fiction \u2013 among their acknowledged influences \u2013 expressed the quest for physical perfection and the growing unreality of human relations on the net. &quot;We did not think time would prove us so right,&quot; says Matadin. &quot;People increasingly resort to plastic surgery to improve their physique, but their social life consists exclusively of their 5,000 friends on Facebook.&quot; The most successful early series adopted a critical stance towards the fashion industry. In Thank You Thighmaster, for instance, women expose perfect bodies but their genitalia and breasts have been erased. With time, however, the pair became more conventional. &quot;We had to decide if we wanted to go on being outsiders,&quot; Matadin says. &quot;We reckoned that even if we played it by the rules there was still plenty to do.&quot; The two have embarked on a partly autobiographical project that crosses the border separating art from fashion. They are represented by the Matthew Marks gallery in New York and their work has been shown at the Venice Biennale. &quot;We have never tried to make art,&quot; Van Lamsweerde says. &quot;We live together, we work together and we want to do incredible things, that&apos;s all.

And indeed did do, the last time we came fourth. Chelsea don&apos;t want to sign Mesut Ozil, mainly because they think he&apos;d join Bayern Munich even if they did.

Going round each others&apos; houses on BIKES?&quot; Cameron Kirk, 14, reckons he spends &quot;an hour, hour-and-a-half on school days&quot; hanging out with his 450-odd Facebook friends; maybe twice that at weekends. &quot;It&apos;s actually very practical if you forget what that day&apos;s homework is. Unfortunately, one of my best friends doesn&apos;t have Facebook. But it&apos;s OK; we talk on our PlayStations.&quot; Emily Hooley, 16, recalls a Very Dark Moment: &quot;We went to Wales for a week at half term to revise. There was no mobile, no TV, no broadband. We had to drive into town just to get a signal. It was really hard, knowing people were texting you, writing on your Wall, and you couldn&apos;t respond. Loads of my friends said they&apos;d just never do that.&quot; Teens, eh? Not how they were when I was young. Nor the way they talk to each other. Let&apos;s frighten ourselves, first: for a decade, the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project has been the world&apos;s largest and most authoritative provider of data on the internet&apos;s impact on the lives of 21st-century citizens. Since 2007, it has been chronicling the use teenagers make of the net, in particular their mass adoption of social networking sites. It has been studying the way teens use mobile phones, including text messages, since 2006. This is what the Project says about the way US teens (and, by extension, teenagers in much of western Europe: the exact figures may sometimes differ by a percentage point or two, but the patterns are the same) communicate in an age of Facebook Chat, instant messaging and unlimited texts. Ready? First, 75% of all teenagers (and 58% of 12-year-olds) now have a mobile phone. Almost 90% of phone-owning teens send and receive texts, most of them daily. Half send 50 or more texts a day; one in three send 100. In fact, in barely four years, texting has established itself as comfortably &quot;the preferred channel of basic communication between teens and their friends&quot;. But phones do more than simply text, of course. More than 80% of phone-owning teens also use them to take pictures (and 64% to share those pictures with others). Sixty per cent listen to music on them, 46% play games, 32% swap videos and 23% access social networking sites. The mobile phone, in short, is now &quot;the favoured communication hub for the majority of teens&quot;. As if texting, swapping, hanging and generally spending their waking hours welded to their phones wasn&apos;t enough, 73% use social networking sites, mostly Facebook \u2013 50% more than three years ago. Digital communication is not just prevalent in teenagers&apos; lives. It IS teenagers&apos; lives. There&apos;s a very straightforward reason, says Amanda Lenhart, a Pew senior research specialist. &quot;Simply, these technologies meet teens&apos; developmental needs,&quot; she says. &quot;Mobile phones and social networking sites make the things teens have always done \u2013 defining their own identity, establishing themselves as independent of their parents, looking cool, impressing members of the opposite sex \u2013 a whole lot easier.&quot; Flirting, boasting, gossiping, teasing, hanging out, confessing: all that classic teen stuff has always happened, Lenhart says. It&apos;s just that it used to happen behind the bike sheds, or via tightly folded notes pressed urgently into sweating hands in the corridor between lessons. Social networking sites and mobile phones have simply facilitated the whole business, a gadzillion times over. For Professor Patti Valkenburg, of the University of Amsterdam&apos;s internationally respected Centre for Research on Children, Adolescents and the Media, &quot;contemporary communications tools&quot; help resolve one of the fundamental conflicts that rages within every adolescent. Adolescence, she says, is characterised by &quot;an enhanced need for self-presentation, or communicating your identity to others, and also self-disclosure \u2013 discussing intimate topics. Both are essential in developing teenagers&apos; identities, allowing them to validate their opinions and determine the appropriateness of their attitudes and behaviours.&quot; But, as we all recall, adolescence is also a period of excruciating shyness and aching self-consciousness \u2013 which can make all that self-presentation and self-disclosure something of a perilous, not to say agonising, business. So the big plus of texting, instant messaging and social networking is that it allows the crucial identity-establishing behaviour, without the accompanying embarrassment. &quot;These technologies give their users a sense of increased controllability,&quot; Valkenburg says. &quot;That, in turn, allows them to feel secure about their communication, and thus freer in their interpersonal relations.&quot; &quot;Controllability&quot;, she explains, is about three things: being able to say what you want without fear of the message not getting through because of that humungous spot on your chin or your tendency to blush; having the power to reflect on and change what you write before you send it (in contrast to face-to-face communication); and being able to stay in touch with untold hordes of friends at times, and in places, where your predecessors were essentially incommunicado. But what do teenagers make of this newfound freedom to communicate? Philippa reckons she sends &quot;probably about 30&quot; text messages every day, and receives as many. &quot;They&apos;re about meeting up \u2013 where are you, see you in 10, that kind of thing,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s an awful lot of flirting goes on, of course. Or it&apos;s, &apos;OMG, what&apos;s biology homework?&apos;. And, &apos;I&apos;m babysitting and I&apos;m SOOOO bored.&apos;&quot; (Boredom appears to be the key factor in the initiation of many teen communications.) Like most of her peers, Philippa wouldn&apos;t dream of using her phone to actually phone anyone, except perhaps her parents \u2013 to placate them if she&apos;s not where she should be, or ask them to come and pick her up if she is. Calls are expensive, and you can&apos;t make them in class (you shouldn&apos;t text in class either, but &quot;lots of people do&quot;). Philippa also has 639 Facebook friends, and claims to know &quot;the vast majority&quot; (though some, she admits, are &quot;quite far down the food chain&quot;). &quot;I don&apos;t want to be big-headed or anything, but I am quite popular,&quot; she says. &quot;Only because I don&apos;t have a social life outside my bedroom, though.&quot; When I call her, 129 of her friends are online. Facebook rush-hour is straight after school, and around nine or 10 in the evening. &quot;You can have about 10 chats open at a time, then it gets a bit slow and you have to start deleting people,&quot; Philippa says. The topics? &quot;General banter, light-hearted abuse. Lots of talk about parties and about photos of parties.&quot; Cred-wise, it&apos;s important to have a good, active Facebook profile: lots of updates, lots of photos of you tagged. Sometimes, though, it ends in tears. Everyone has witnessed cyber-bullying, but the worst thing that happened to Philippa was when someone posted &quot;a really dreadful picture of me, with an awful double chin&quot;, then refused to take it down. &quot;She kept saying, &apos;No way, it&apos;s upped my profile views 400%,&apos;&quot; says Philippa. It&apos;s quite easy, she thinks, for people to feel &quot;belittled, isolated&quot; on Facebook. There are other downsides. Following huge recent publicity, teens are increasingly aware of the dangers of online predators. &quot;Privacy&apos;s a real issue,&quot; says Emily. &quot;I get &apos;friend&apos; requests from people I don&apos;t know and have never heard of; I ignore them. I have a private profile. I&apos;m very careful about that.&quot; A 2009 survey found up to 45% of US companies are now checking job applicants&apos; activity on social networking sites, and 35% reported rejecting people because of what they found. Universities and colleges, similarly, are starting to look online. &quot;You need to be careful,&quot; says Cameron Kirk, astute and aware even at 14. &quot;Stuff can very easily get misunderstood.&quot; Emily agrees, but adds: &quot;Personally, I love the idea that it&apos;s up there for ever. It&apos;ll be lovely to go back, later, and see all those emotions and relations.&quot; Pew&apos;s Lenhart says research [by Danah Boyd of Microsoft Research] has revealed a class distinction in many teens&apos; attitudes to online privacy. &quot;Teens from college-focused, upper-middle-class familes tend to be much more aware of their online profiles, what they say about them, future consequences for jobs and education,&quot; she says. &quot;With others, there&apos;s a tendency to share as much as they can, because that&apos;s their chance for fame, their possibility of a ticket out.&quot; The question that concerns most parents, though, is whether such an unprecedented, near-immeasurable surge in non face-to-face communication is somehow changing our teenagers \u2013 diminishing their ability to conduct more traditional relationships, turning them into screen-enslaved, socially challenged adults. Yet teens, on the whole, seem pretty sensible about this. Callum O&apos;Connor, 16, says there&apos;s a big difference between chatting online and face to face. &quot;Face to face is so much clearer,&quot; he says. &quot;Facebook and instant messaging are such detached forms of communication. It&apos;s so easy to be misinterpreted, or to misinterpret what someone says. It&apos;s terribly easy to say really horrible things. I&apos;m permanently worrying \u2013 will this seem heartless, how many kisses should I add, can I say that?&quot; He&apos;s certain that what goes on online &quot;isn&apos;t completely real. Some people clearly think it is, but I feel the difference. It&apos;s really not the same.&quot; Emily agrees: &quot;It&apos;s weird. If I have a massive fight on Facebook, it&apos;s always, like, the next day, did it actually matter? Was it important? I always go up to the person afterwards and talk to them face to face, to see their emotions and their expressions. Otherwise you never know. It&apos;s complicated.&quot; Emily is fairly confident that social networking and texting aren&apos;t changing who she is. &quot;I&apos;m the same online and in person. All this is an extension to real life, not a replacement.&quot; Olivia Stamp, 16 and equally self-aware, says she thinks social networking actually helps her to be more herself. &quot;I think of myself as quite a shy person,&quot; she says. &quot;So it&apos;s actually easier to be myself on Facebook because you can edit what you want to say, take your time; you don&apos;t feel awkward. I definitely feel more confident online \u2013 more like the self I know I really am, beneath the shyness.&quot; These new communications technologies, Olivia says, are &quot;an enhancement, an enrichment actually. They bring people even closer, in fact, without replacing anything. We&apos;re not socially abnormal. Look at us!&quot; And the experts seem to back that up. Valkenburg says: &quot;Our research gives no reason at present for concern about the social consequences of online communication \u2013 but it&apos;s early days. What if the constant self-confirmation teens experience online turns into excessive self-esteem, or narcissism? We don&apos;t know yet.&quot; Lenhart puts it another way. &quot;Our research shows face-to-face time between teenagers hasn&apos;t changed over the past five years. Technology has simply added another layer on top. Yes, you can find studies that suggest online networking can be bad for you. But there are just as many that show the opposite.&quot; We should, she suggests, &quot;Step back. The telephone, the car, the television \u2013 they all, in their time, changed the way teens relate to each other, and to other people, quite radically. And how did their parents respond? With the same kind of wailing and gnashing of teeth we&apos;re doing now. These technologies change lives, absolutely. But it&apos;s a generational thing.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 27 July 2010 to make clear the origin of research findings about class distinctions in teenage attitudes to online privacy. \u2022 Teenagers: how addicted to Facebook are you?

Mine \u2013 an hour&apos;s chat with the Guardian&apos;s Claire Armitstead \u2013 was on a Tuesday morning at 10am, the day after the bank holiday weekend at which Bill Bryson, Roddy Doyle, Kazuo Ishiguro, Nadine Gordimer, Tina Brown, Ed Milliband, Carlos Fuentes and Jeanette Winterson (the list goes on and on) had appeared. By Tuesday, both the writers and their fans had departed, and the walkways and common areas felt as desolate as a Welsh sheep farm on a rainy morning. I was surprised, and relieved, therefore, when almost 200 people turned up. God knows where they came from, but it was fun, and they seemed to go home (or to the next event) happy enough. Claire allowed me, after the necessary 10 minutes of stories and reminiscences, to abandon story-telling mode, and talk \u2013 sometimes light-heartedly, sometime not \u2013 about the structure of ideas in Outside of a Dog. I get a bit weary being branded with the old label of &quot;raconteur,&quot; which is usually accompanied in print by a manically jolly photo of me and Dame Edna partying on. I had promised, rather against my better judgment, to take part in a Guardian Books podcast, touring the bookshops of Hay, trawling about for material that might interest me as a rare book dealer. If my past experience of the place, and its shops, was anything to go by, it was likely to be a dispiriting experience. When I did the festival five years before there wasn&apos;t anything remotely interesting in the shops, confirming my belief that Hay is where books go to die. Wrong. There has been a distinct up-marketing of the Hay bookshops, and even the most jaded old bookman (that would be me) can find things to covet, if not necessarily to buy. The best of these was at the excellent Poetry Bookshop, the only shop in the UK to deal in nothing but poetry. On entry I showed them my business card and asked &quot;have you got anything that would interest me?&quot; I am a hopeless book scout, and can&apos;t bear all that kneeling, rooting around and shuffling books about, looking for bargains. I was handed, from out of the glass case, a dustjacket-less first edition of WH Auden&apos;s 1965 collection About the House, and opened it to find the inscription &quot;Chester with love from Wystan. These are public words addressed to you privately.&quot; On 24 pages of the text there were corrections or additions in Auden&apos;s hand, the best of which, surely, is appended to the poem The Common Life (for Chester Kallman) and reads: &quot;Postscript/Cosy to think/(though not for me)/There&apos;s a large cock about the house.&quot; Auden and Kallman had been lovers, but by this time lived together in chaste but loving companionship. The podcast team gasped in appreciation. I went uncharacteristically quiet. Great association, great book. The price of \u00a36,000 seemed reasonable, once you factored in the dealer&apos;s discount, but I found myself wondering to whom I might sell it. Auden is out of fashion, and I can&apos;t think of anyone who collects him at this level. I offered a bit less than the asking price, and was politely turned down. We trailed out of the shop, with this website&apos;s editor palpably trying to figure out how to raise the money to buy it herself. But when you are a dealer you see loads of great books at other dealers or at auction, and you can rarely buy them for stock. Insufficient margin is what we call it. You get used to it. You walk away and forget all about it. But I couldn&apos;t. When I got back to my office, I consulted my colleague Peter Grogan, who reluctantly agreed with my decision. That evening I had dinner with Declan Kiely, Keeper of Manuscripts at the Morgan Library, both a good friend and a shrewd judge of things. I told him about the book, the inscription, the changes to the text, the cock. He looked at me incredulously and with distinct disapprobation. &quot;And the problem is...?&quot; &quot;No one collects Auden.&quot; &quot;So what?&quot; The next day I rang the Poetry Bookshop, bought the book at their price, subject to them getting it into my hands the next morning (Saturday), which was the final day of The Antiquarian Booksellers Fair at Olympia, at which we display our wares like girls in an Amsterdam window. The Auden arrived in the post at 10am, and I spent the next 45 minutes writing a catalogue description of it. The Fair opened at 11am, and half-an-hour later the book sold, at what we call &quot;a reasonable profit,&quot; to a collector who had never bought an Auden first edition, but knew a great book when he saw one. Who says you can&apos;t make money going to a literary festival? But the experience left me feeling stupid. I have always believed that, if possible, you have to buy the really good books, the ones that have a little magic, generate a narrative, come right out of the creative factory. This one was, and wasn&apos;t all that expensive, and I faddled about thinking of the market rather than the object. I profited from others&apos; opinions, though I like to think I would have bought it eventually. But I&apos;m not so sure.", "sentences": ["&quot;And the problem is...?&quot; &quot;No one collects Auden.&quot; &quot;So what?&quot; The next day I rang the Poetry Bookshop, bought the book at their price, subject to them getting it into my hands the next morning (Saturday), which was the final day of The Antiquarian Booksellers Fair at Olympia, at which we display our wares like girls in an Amsterdam window."], "title": "A \u00a36,000 Auden bargain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jul/16/auden-bargain", "tags": ["Books", "WH Auden", "Poetry", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-17T23:01:24Z", "article": "From the circular main hall of the Sackler Library in Oxford, an unassuming corridor leads to a staircase that takes you down below street level. Through a door marked &quot;archive&quot;, office ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights stare down on a cheap blue carpet and a row of grey rolling stacks. The hum of the air-conditioning lets slip that this ordinary-looking room is hiding something special. The temperature is held at 18.5C (65F), several degrees cooler than the sunny July day outside, while a humidifier keeps the moisture level tightly controlled. For those grey stacks contain the forgotten secrets of the most famous find in Egyptology, if not all of archaeological history: the tomb of Tutankhamun. This is the Griffith Institute \u2013 arguably the best Egyptology library in the world. One of its most prized collections incorporates the notes, photographs and diaries of the English archaeologist Howard Carter, who discovered Tutankhamun&apos;s resting place in 1922. The only intact pharaoh&apos;s tomb ever discovered, it contained such an array of treasures that it took Carter 10 years to catalogue them all. Yet despite the immense significance of the discovery, the majority of Carter&apos;s findings have never been published, and many questions surrounding the tomb remain unanswered. Jaromir Malek is the soft-spoken keeper of the archive whose own Tutankhamun project is nearing completion. By making all of Carter&apos;s notes available online, Malek wanted to ensure that the public would have access to the full extent of the discovery \u2013 and to spur Egyptologists into finishing the job of studying the tomb&apos;s contents. He has ended up creating a model that other researchers hope will transform the field of archaeology. The effort has taken even longer than Carter&apos;s gruelling excavation. It began in 1993, when Malek says he realised that fewer than a third of the artefacts from Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb had been properly studied and published, a situation he describes as &quot;unacceptable&quot;. A total of 5,398 objects were found in the tomb, covering every aspect of ancient Egyptian life, from weapons and chariots to musical instruments, clothes, cosmetics and a treasured lock of the royal grandmother&apos;s hair. A few, like Tutankhamun&apos;s gold burial mask, are instantly recognisable, but many are not well known, even to experts. Part of the reason is that Carter died in 1939, just seven years after his excavation ended, and before he could fully publish his findings. &quot;He started working on the final publication, but he was physically and mentally exhausted after a very hard 10 years,&quot; says Malek. By all accounts a difficult man to work with, Carter had no collaborators left to continue his work when he died. And while the artefacts themselves are held in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, Carter&apos;s notes were donated to the Griffith Institute, where they have lain largely undisturbed ever since. The sheer size and importance of Carter&apos;s haul seems to have discouraged scholars from tackling it. &quot;I often say that the real curse of Tutankhamun is that Egyptologists have tended to shy away from working on the material,&quot; says Marianne Eaton-Krauss, an expert who has written three books about objects from the tomb. &quot;These pieces are beautifully made. To study them takes a lot of work, and requires expertise not only on the symbolism, but also the technology.&quot; So Malek decided that the best way to ensure that Carter&apos;s discoveries saw the light of day was to post the entire archive online. &quot;We can&apos;t make Egyptologists work on the material if they are not inclined to do so,&quot; he says. &quot;But we could make sure that all of the excavation records are available to anyone who is interested. Then there will be no excuse.&quot; A simple idea, but still a daunting task, particularly as a lack of funding meant that Malek and his handful of staff had to carry out the entire project in their spare time. Carter recorded his finds on more than 3,500 densely written cards, with additional notes by Carter&apos;s chemist and conservator Alfred Lucas, and more than 1,000 images taken by his photographer Harry Burton. There are also around 60 maps and plans of the excavation site, plus hundreds of fragile pages from Carter&apos;s journals and diaries. A succession of secretaries scanned and transcribed Carter&apos;s notes in between other work, then Malek proofread the results at evenings and weekends. Jonathan Moffett, head of IT at the affiliated Ashmolean Museum, built a database that could hold images of the original material as well as transcripts, so the text could be easily searched. In 1995 the team started posting the records in one of the first websites dedicated to Egyptology. They called it Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation . More than 15 years later, the internet has been transformed: a Google search for Egyptology now returns more than 3 million results. And Malek&apos;s project is almost complete. Around 98% of the material is available, with the last pages to follow within the next three months. Among the highlights is Carter&apos;s diary from the period in which he discovered Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb. When I ask to see it, Malek&apos;s assistant Elizabeth Fleming pulls the yellowed notebook from a stiff cardboard case, and with white-gloved hands settles it on a pillow on the table in front of me. Funded by the Egypt enthusiast Lord Carnarvon, Carter had been searching the Valley of the Kings \u2013 ancient Egypt&apos;s royal burial ground \u2013 for seven years. A few objects bearing Tutankhamun&apos;s name had been found in the area and the two were convinced that his tomb lay somewhere beneath thousands of years&apos; worth of limestone rubble. Yet season after season of arduous digging, during which their workmen cleared large areas of the valley down to bedrock, produced nothing. Then on Saturday 4 November 1922, the dig revealed a step cut into the rock of the valley floor, beneath the foundations of a group of huts. It was the beginning of a stairway that led to a walled-up doorway: Tutankhamun&apos;s resting place had been found. Fleming shows me two words from the next day&apos;s entry \u2013 &quot;seals intact&quot; \u2013 the crucial sign that the tomb had lain undisturbed since the second millennium BC. Carter&apos;s handwriting, in small, neat pencil, suggests a disciplined, down-to-earth man, not inclined to florid outbursts. A typical diary entry reads simply &quot;two donkeys&quot; \u2013 a reference to the transportation that Carter and his assistant took to the dig site each day. On Sunday 26 November, however, after his first glimpse inside the 3,300-year-old antechamber, Carter could no longer contain himself. As he peeped through a newly burrowed hole, he later wrote in his journal that &quot;the hot air escaping caused the candle to flicker&quot;. As his eyes became accustomed to the light, &quot;the interior of the chamber gradually loomed before one, with its strange and wonderful medley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one another&quot;. Strange ebony-black effigies of the king, gilded couches, exquisitely painted caskets, flowers, shrines, chests, chairs and chariots glinting with gold gave the appearance of &quot;the property room of an opera of a vanished civilisation&quot;. Elizabeth Fleming also shows me one of Carter&apos;s plans \u2013 the valley&apos;s contours, neatly conveyed in sparse yet graceful black-ink lines. The dig site was located in the deepest point of the valley, where floodwater dumps debris when it rains. This, along with the fact that the later tomb of Ramses VI was built almost on top of it, kept Tutankhamun hidden from robbers over the centuries, and from the wholesale dismantling of royal tombs by Ramses XI in the 11th century BC. The real meat of the archive, however, is in the notes and photographs that record every item found in the tomb in painstaking detail. Any other archaeologist working in the 1920s might have bundled the treasures out of the tomb in a matter of hours, but Carter worked methodically and meticulously. Burton&apos;s black-and-white photographs show the team&apos;s progress through the tomb, and these too are available online. Despite the difficult lighting conditions, these images \u2013 acknowledged as some of the best in archaeology \u2013 capture the eerie stillness of the tomb when it was first opened. Chairs and chariot wheels have been casually propped against the wall, while statues stand in their linen shawls as if placed there hours before. I&apos;m struck by how messy and jumbled the objects look. This is partly because Tutankhamun died unexpectedly, so his belongings had to be crammed into a much smaller tomb than would have been intended, and partly because the tomb was robbed shortly after the unfortunate king was buried, and the guards seem to have done a rather careless job of righting the ransacked contents before resealing the doors. &quot;We can see things missing,&quot; says John Taylor, who looks after the Egyptian mummies collection at the British Museum in London. &quot;We have the plinths for gold statuettes but not the statuettes themselves. They broke the gold fittings off furniture. And we can see fingermarks inside a jar where a robber stuffed his fingers in and scooped out a sticky mass of very valuable scented oil.&quot; Burton&apos;s photos document each artefact after removal from the tomb: a quick browse of the database reveals some charming treasures \u2013 from a leopardskin cloak with a golden head and silver claws to a collection of green and blue draughtsmen and even a folding bed. A search for &quot;mummy&quot; returns 68 photos taken at various stages of the unwrapping process, from plump outer bandages to fragile bone. For Malek, a principal aim of the project is to bring the forgotten details of the tomb to as many people as possible. &quot;We felt this was important because the discovery is so well-known,&quot; he says. &quot;This doesn&apos;t belong to Egyptologists only, or even to Egypt only. Everybody should have the right to see what&apos;s there.&quot; Taylor agrees that the failure of Egyptologists to publish the discovery in its entirety has left the public in the dark about much of what was in the tomb. &quot;A lot of the objects will be very unfamiliar to people,&quot; he says. &quot;What is needed is for schools and people with a more general interest to have access to the basic data and see what&apos;s there.&quot; In this, the website appears to be succeeding. It has informed countless school projects and even an interactive DVD being produced by the BBC to accompany an Egypt-themed episode of Doctor Who. Semmel, the German event promoter, has used Carter&apos;s technical diagrams to make exact replicas of many of the treasures from Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb for an exhibition that is currently touring Europe. But Malek also hopes to put &quot;moral pressure&quot; on Egyptologists, to encourage them to study this immensely important collection. Tutankhamun&apos;s is the only royal tomb that we have that wasn&apos;t gutted by tomb robbers. If we want to know what an Egyptian pharaoh took with him to the afterlife, he says, &quot;it&apos;s the only one we can look at&quot;. Everything in the tomb was there so that the king could continue living in luxury, from the food he would eat and clothes he would wear, to ceremonial items such as huge animal-headed couches on which he would have been carried into the afterlife. &quot;Nothing in the tomb was accidental,&quot; says Malek. &quot;We will not be able to understand the tomb as a unit until all of the objects are properly explained.&quot; Egyptologists are particularly excited about what the objects from the tomb can tell us about the technology of the ancient Egyptians. &quot;We can study how these objects were made, the materials and techniques that were used,&quot; says Malek. &quot;That is quite rare. There is a great difference between being able to look at a representation of a chair on the wall of a tomb or a temple and being able to study that particular object in reality.&quot; Although researchers will always want to study objects directly, gaining access to many of the most priceless items from Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb can be difficult. Carter&apos;s archive is a useful source of back-up information. But it also provides a lot of data that would be difficult or impossible to glean from studying the objects today. For a start, Carter recorded exactly where items were found in the tomb, and how they were positioned relative to each other. This has helped researchers to make sense of the jumble of objects in the antechamber. &quot;It seems like just a pile of things, but there is a system,&quot; says Malek. &quot;You can see what the thinking behind it was.&quot; For example, items of food should have gone into another room but the space was too small, so at the last minute they were placed into the antechamber. Marianne Eaton-Krauss recently used the Griffith Institute website in a study of how Tutankhamun was buried. &quot;It&apos;s a mine of information,&quot; she says. Eaton-Krauss was able to tell from Carter&apos;s excavation journal that the innermost shrine of Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb was too small to fit properly around his sarcophagus, suggesting that the sarcophagus had in fact been intended for someone else \u2013 something that it is impossible to tell from the objects as they are set up on display in Cairo. Eaton-Krauss points out that many objects from Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb seem to have originally belonged to other kings, and says she hopes the website will stimulate other Egyptologists to investigate further. &quot;If these were all studied, it would be of great historical significance.&quot; Also crucial for researchers is the fact that Carter and his colleagues recorded the artefacts almost immediately after the tomb was opened. &quot;They were the first to see the objects, and therefore saw them in the best condition possible,&quot; says Andr\u00e9 Veldmeijer of the PalArch Foundation in Amsterdam, who used the website in a recent analysis of the footwear found in Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb. This is particularly important for finds made of organic material. One pair of leather sandals, delicately embellished with gold leaf and coloured beads, is shown perfectly preserved in Burton&apos;s photographs, yet Veldmeijer says his visit to the Cairo museum revealed an oozing black mess. He describes the online archive as &quot;one of the best things in Egyptology&quot;. As Malek&apos;s project edges closer to completion, the Carter archive offers researchers an unprecedented view of the collection as a whole. &quot;What&apos;s really interesting is to see the totality of what is in the tomb,&quot; says John Taylor of the British Museum. &quot;There tends to be a lot of focus on the mummies and the jewellery, but these are just part of a complex of objects. Only if you study the whole lot together can you see why they are there.&quot; &quot;You can easily compare different types of object because you have that overview,&quot; agrees Veldmeijer. &quot;It&apos;s a good example of how you can get so much more from archaeological research.&quot; He is now pushing for archaeologists working in other areas to take a similar approach, instead of leaving their dig notes on huge collections of record cards that soon become too unwieldy for anyone to study. Veldmeijer notes a dig at Qasr Ibrim in southern Egypt that is recorded on 20,000 separate cards. &quot;So many excavations have not been properly published,&quot; he says. Sitting in front of those grey rolling stacks, Malek tells me that after going through every single page of Carter&apos;s excavation notes he has a new appreciation of the archaeologist&apos;s strength of character. &quot;He was not easy to work with,&quot; says Malek. &quot;He was quite often short tempered, perhaps not always tactful. But what I find really impressive is that there was this massive task, and in spite of all the difficulties, he finished it.&quot; Something that Malek himself hopes to live up to within the next few months.", "sentences": ["&quot;They were the first to see the objects, and therefore saw them in the best condition possible,&quot; says Andr\u00e9 Veldmeijer of the PalArch Foundation in Amsterdam, who used the website in a recent analysis of the footwear found in Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb."], "title": "Tutankhamun \u2013 the secrets of the tomb go online | feature", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jul/18/tutankhamun-website-howard-carter-tomb", "tags": ["Tutankhamun", "Archaeology", "Internet", "Crowdsourcing", "Science"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-17T23:05:56Z", "article": "Ocado will make a final attempt to bring investors on board its controversial stock market flotation in the next two days, in the hope of defying sceptics who have suggested the online grocer is pushing for too ambitious a valuation.

A Grammy award-winning clarinettist, saxophonist and composer, he blurred the lines between classical and popular music, recording more than 40 albums which journeyed between dancehall, samba, bossa nova, jazz and orchestral music. He was a hero and friend to a younger generation of virtuoso musicians inspired by his rare talent, huge lungs and legendary charm. &quot;He always had the courage to show his own work,&quot; said the Brazilian guitarist Marcello Gon\u00e7alves, who accompanied Moura on recent trips to London, Amsterdam and Berlin. &quot;He didn&apos;t limit himself to just playing what other people were playing. Each of his records is different and they were always different to what was happening at the time.&quot; Moura was born in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, in S\u00e3o Paulo state. Aged nine, he was given his first clarinet and by 1944 he was playing alongside his father, Pedro Moura, also a musician. In 1945, Moura&apos;s family moved to Rio de Janeiro, where the young clarinettist began studying at the Escola nacional de m\u00fasica, now the Escola de m\u00fasica da UFRJ. Moura&apos;s father reputedly urged his son to train as a tailor. Instead he quickly immersed himself in Rio&apos;s musical scene, simultaneously playing in orchestras, big bands and at the many samba dancehalls that proliferated during Rio&apos;s swinging 50s. By the age of 14 he was a professional musician. &quot;Sometimes on the same day I&apos;d play in the symphonic orchestra, then in a big band playing jazz and at a dancehall by night,&quot; remembered Moura, who also mastered the saxophone and the trumpet. He said the dancehalls had taught him &quot;that irresponsible way&quot; of playing. His first solo recording, Moto Perpetuo, was released in 1956. He went on to play alongside Brazilian stars such as Milton Nascimento and Elis Regina, as well as the US singers Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole. Moura was heavily influenced by North American jazz and tried to &quot;jazzify&quot; the sounds of his homeland. His 1998 album Rhapsody in Bossa, a tribute to George Gershwin, mixed tracks such as Summertime and Rhapsody in Blue with bossa nova standards. Moura&apos;s talent took him around the world, from London to Ecuador and from Switzerland&apos;s Montreux jazz festival to Carnegie Hall in New York, where he took to the stage in 1962 with Sergio Mendes for a show that propelled bossa nova into the global mainstream. His fame grew following his appearance in Brasileirinho (2005), an award-winning documentary about Brazilian choro music, directed by Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki. In 2000, Moura received a Latin Grammy for his tribute to the Brazilian composer Pixinguinha. His most recent album, AfroBossaNova, came out in 2009. &quot;No matter where he was playing, he always maintained the same posture and this just added to his elegance,&quot; said Gon\u00e7alves, who was at Moura&apos;s bedside as the clarinettist played the choro classic Doce de Coco shortly before his death. &quot;I have the feeling that he was trying to say goodbye, and to give his friends a blessing.

I&apos;ve only been in the saddle of this new bicycle \u2013 the centrepiece of London&apos;s cycle hire system, set to launch on 30 July \u2013 for two minutes and I&apos;m already being flagged down by a policeman. What have I done wrong, I wonder nervously. Did I cut across someone when changing lanes on the approach to Westminster Bridge? Should I be wearing a helmet? It&apos;s been three decades since I passed my cycling proficiency test, and there&apos;s been very little serious cycling in between. The policeman points to the spot on the curb when he wants me to park up. &quot;What have I done, officer?&quot; &quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;I just wanted to ask what the bike was like to ride. Do you think it will be popular?&quot; Squeezing the brakes and ringing the bell, he&apos;s like a wide-eyed boy in a bike shop. I offer him a go. &quot;I can&apos;t,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m on duty.&quot; It strikes me, during this rather surreal exchange, that at least the bike isn&apos;t suited to being a getaway vehicle. It weighs more than 20kg, and has three gears: Sloth, Tortoise and Ageing Elephant. It&apos;s designed for leisurely ambling rather than APD (aggressive pursuit of destination), which is clearly the default setting of every other cyclist on the road today. The looks of disdain and irritation are palpable as they continually whizz past me. After Paris, this will be the world&apos;s second-largest urban cycle hire system. The scheme, vigorously promoted by London&apos;s mayor Boris Johnson, will eventually see 6,000 bikes parked at 400 &quot;docking stations&quot; spread every 300 metres or so across central London (although the latest in a string of delays means only pre-registered &quot;members&quot; will be able to take out the bikes from a week on Friday, with the wider public only getting their hands on the bikes at the end of next month). After paying a daily access fee of \u00a31, and providing details of a credit card for the deposit, the first 30 minutes of bike use will be free, although the price escalates rapidly as the clock ticks on (\u00a31 for an hour, \u00a36 for two hours, \u00a335 for six hours). My first impressions of the bike, riding it from Victoria to Borough and back along the South Bank, are good. Yes, it is heavy \u2013 you&apos;re never going to overtake Lance Armstrong on this thing \u2013 but it needs to be built to last, and be thief- and vandal-proof, a problem that has blighted other systems around the world (particularly Paris). It is purposely not designed for long rides: the pricing structure encourages sub-30-minute journeys and, given the limited geographical spread of the distinctive blue docking stations, it is not yet a bike aimed at commuters. Rather, it is there to replace a short taxi ride, or a two- or three-stop tube journey. The bike has an adjustable padded seat, smooth handling, a guard to protect your clothing from the oily chain, a bell and dynamo lights. But there are problems. The lack of mirrors is a minor grumble, but understandable given how easily they might snap off (tip: carry your own clip-on mirrors). A far bigger inconvenience is the lack of a basket or a security chain, both of which come as standard on the V\u00e9lib&apos; in Paris. Instead, the London bike has what can only be described as a magazine rack. You could carry a Sunday newspaper in it, but not much else. And rather than chain it to a lamppost when you pop into the shop to buy said paper, you will have to find a docking station or risk losing the \u00a3300 deposit should it be stolen. My other criticism is that you&apos;ve got &quot;Barclays&quot; plastered all over the bike. Sure, London wouldn&apos;t have this new bike without the rumoured \u00a325m that Barclays has paid to sponsor the system for the next five years, but the prominence of the branding earns me a heckle or two as I pass the peace protestors camped out at Westminster Square. And then there is the name. Parisians have fallen in love with the V\u00e9lib&apos; \u2013 a portmanteau of velo (bicycle) and libert\u00e9 (freedom). Londoners are, one feels, less likely to fall for the Barclays Cycle Hire, as the bike is officially known. Freecycle is already taken, but this bike urgently needs an affectionate moniker (The London Wheel? The Big Ben? The Bumbling Boris?) if Londoners are to develop the same levels of affection. Another key to the scheme&apos;s success, says Tom Bogdanovich, campaigns manager at the London Cycling Campaign, will be avoiding the &quot;Montmartre effect&quot;, whereby users arrive at popular destinations only to find empty docking stations. (In Paris, the steep hill at Montmartre means users invariably only hire the V\u00e9lib&apos; to ride down the slope rather than up, leading to a noted shortage of bikes at the top of the hill.) &quot;London has the great benefit from learning from the experiences in Paris and Barcelona,&quot; Bogdanovich says. &quot;Getting the distribution right is key: it&apos;s crucial that people have easy, immediate access. As the system moves on, they must respond to patterns of use and identify where the highest demand is. It would make sense, for example, to think about expanding it to Canary Wharf and the Olympic zone.&quot; Bogdanovich says an estimated 250,000 people cycle in London every day, and that one in three people are &quot;interested&quot; in cycling. &quot;But that&apos;s still way behind cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen. The system should take advantage of the fact that London is a cluster of villages. Hackney, for example, has very high cycling rates \u2013 10% of all journeys. Also, the average bike journey in London now is 3.5km, yet this system is largely aimed at replacing short tube journeys in central London. Over time, the system will need to serve both demands.&quot;     Leo Hickman enjoys the V\u00e9lib' hire bike in Paris. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Four hours after handing my trial bike back to a Transport for London official, and one Eurostar trip later, I am standing outside a Paris apartment adjacent to the exquisite Jardin du Luxembourg on the Left Bank. The apartment belongs to Eric Britton, an American who has lived in the French capital since the late 1960s and who now acts as an international consultant and commentator on sustainable urban transport systems. He&apos;s a huge fan of the V\u00e9lib&apos;, which launched to much fanfare and enthusiasm three years ago this month. He immediately probes me for first impressions of the London bike. &quot;Yes, it is a big error not to include a lock-up and a basket,&quot; he agrees, as we walk to his nearest docking station. &quot;Around 90% of Parisians use the basket on their V\u00e9lib&apos;. Ladies&apos; purses, backpacks, shopping bags \u2013 they all go in there. I also think the London scheme is too small. Paris, which is a smaller city, launched with almost twice the number of bikes and stations.&quot; Still, Britton is broadly optimistic that London&apos;s bikeshare scheme will be a success: &quot;The real genius of the systems in both London and Paris is that the first 30 minutes are free. It needs to be 100% ready on day one, though. All the problems need to be ironed out, otherwise people will conclude it&apos;s not worth the effort. &quot;Over time, you will see the bikes starting to occupy the terrain. Slowly, they will increase and gain more of the roadspace. Then the demand for more bike lanes will increase. We&apos;ve seen this in Paris. Such a modal shift takes a little time, but it is happening here.&quot; Britton shows me how easy it is to undock a V\u00e9lib&apos;. As an annual subscriber, he has a swipe card which gives him instant access. I have to use my bank card to gain access via the electronic terminal, though, which delays things for a couple of minutes. Britton shows me how to quickly scan for the best available bikes: brakes, tyre pressure, seat, gears, a spin of the back wheel \u2013 a habit he says is now instinctive for most V\u00e9lib&apos; users. It has also become etiquette, should you have a faulty bike, to lower the seat and turn it to face backwards to indicate to other users not to use it. (Each docking point also has a &quot;spanner&quot; push button to mark the bike down as needing a repair.) The V\u00e9lib&apos; is virtually the same bike as the London one, except for the sizeable basket and chain lock. But whereas I had a gleaming new model to try out in London, most of the V\u00e9lib&apos;s I see in Paris are displaying signs of heavy use. I pick a bike with a handle grip missing. Graeme the photographer discovers, in the middle of a fast-flowing intersection as we head towards the Eiffel tower, that his chain has a tendency to slip at the most inopportune moments. Nevertheless, it is immediately apparent what differentiates Paris and London in terms of cycling experience. Paris&apos;s wide boulevards and avenues, with their separate side lanes now converted into cycle lanes, mean cyclists can regularly escape the near-constant close contact with heavy traffic that London&apos;s cyclists must tolerate. Despite the launch of London&apos;s first cycle &quot;superhighways&quot; for commuters yesterday, it is hard to see how other city&apos;s urban topography can ever be drastically altered to counter this. But Britton&apos;s most surprising observation is that the V\u00e9lib&apos; hasn&apos;t done much to reduce road traffic in Paris. Rather than get people out of cars \u2013 it is reckoned to have substituted only about 10% of car trips in central Paris \u2013 it has done a far better job of getting people off public transport. As many as half of all V\u00e9lib&apos; trips are estimated to have replaced Metro or bus journeys. Before I depart Paris, I meet up with Albert Ass\u00e9raf, a strategist at JCDecaux \u2013 the advertising corporation that runs the V\u00e9lib&apos; in return for a 10-year exclusive contract to use the city&apos;s 1,500-odd digital display hoardings. I ask what lessons London can learn from the Paris system, particularly after JCDecaux director general R\u00e9mi Pheulpin&apos;s comments last year that the Paris scheme was not commercially viable because of the extent of the theft and vandalism. &quot;Since we launched in 2007, we have expanded to 1,750 stations across the city and neighbouring suburbs and now have a maximum of 24,000 bikes in operation at any one time,&quot; he says. &quot;To date, we&apos;ve had 9,000 bikes stolen and 9,000 bikes vandalised. Most thefts are caused by day users because they are not used to how the docking systems works and they leave the bike accidentally unsecured. We have worked hard to communicate the message that these bikes are &apos;ours&apos; \u2013 they belong to all of Paris, and it is a system we should be proud of. London should do the same.&quot; Ass\u00e9raf says the average journey on a V\u00e9lib&apos; lasts 21 minutes and covers 2km, but that to counter the aforementioned Montmartre effect, users are now rewarded for returning their bikes to unpopular docking stations on hills (bikes are also redistributed around the city in trucks). &quot;We now give users 15 minutes&apos; free credit if they return a bike to a so-called &apos;altitude&apos; station. It&apos;s little lessons like this that London will need to learn. And London should make sure the stations are well stocked, even during the night. About 15% of all V\u00e9lib&apos; journeys occur after the Metro shuts down and people want to get home without paying for expensive taxis. The V\u00e9lib&apos; has become part of our lives \u2013 Parisians just can&apos;t imagine Paris without the V\u00e9lib&apos; now.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;But that&apos;s still way behind cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen."], "title": "London and Paris: a tale of two bike-hire schemes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/20/london-bike-hire-scheme-paris-velib", "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style", "Cycling holidays", "Travel", "London", "UK news", "France", "World news", "Ethical and green living"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-20T07:09:14Z", "article": "California could take another step towards confirming itself as a rival to Amsterdam today when Oakland city council votes on setting up and licensing four major marijuana factories. Marijuana would be mass-produced, packaged and distributed for sale from the four centres. As well as cannabis for medical purposes, the factories would make items such as body oil and baked goods. The cash-strapped council is keen to approve the plan in order to generate cash through permit fees and taxes. The plan was agreed in principle at a council meeting last week. One of the council members backing the plan, Rebecca Kaplan, told National Public Radio: &quot;Creating a regular, responsible, regulated permitting system to enable the creation and regulation of these industrial facilities is an important step in terms of public safety, providing jobs and revenue.&quot; If Oakland goes ahead, it will be the first place in the US to license such premises. California currently allows the use of marijuana for medical purposes but in November it is to hold a ballot on a proposal to make it legal for recreational use. Existing small growers are protesting against the Oakland plan, describing it as creating the equivalent of McDonalds or Wal-Mart and threatening to put them out of work. One of the 400 small growers supplying Oakland dispensaries , Dan Scully, told Associated Press: &quot;Nobody wants to see the McDonalds-isation of cannabis. I would compare it to how a small business feels about shutting down its business and going to work at Wal-Mart. Who would be attracted to that?&quot; The small growers supply four dispensaries in Oakland, of which the biggest is the Harborside health centre. They argue that the drug&apos;s industrialisation will reduce the number of varieties on offer to customers. But Kaplan said the premises of small growers could be a fire hazard, citing fire brigade reports about the danger of the many high-powered lamps used indoors to help cannabis grow. One of the companies planning to bid for a permit if the city council gives the plan the go-ahead is iGrow, a warehouse that supplies information and equipment for growing cannabis, but not the plant itself. Oakland, like other cities throughout California, is suffering severe debt problems in spite of budget cuts and redundancies. It voted last year to tax marijuana dispensaries, which is estimated to bring in about $1.5m (\u00a3980,0000) this year.

Alistair Mackintosh, Fulham&apos;s chief executive, was in Amsterdam today in an attempt to close the deal but he has been frustrated by the Dutch club&apos;s stance. Fulham remain hopeful they will be able to name Jol as the successor to Roy Hodgson, who has left to manage Liverpool, because the Dutchman has told them that he wants to join them. They have also been satisfied that Jol has told Ajax it is his intention to move to Craven Cottage. Mohamed Al Fayed, the Fulham chairman, is driving the deal and he remains determined to get his man. Ajax, however, do not want to lose Jol, who led them to second place in last season&apos;s Eredivisie and success in the Dutch Cup, and they have dug in their heels. It is believed that they have a contractual clause in their favour. Ajax have recorded losses of \u20ac20m (\u00a316.9m) and, to Jol&apos;s disgust, have released the striker Marko Pantelic and the midfielder Dennis Rommedahl this summer in the first phase of a cost-cutting scheme. They are set to sell the full-back Gregory van der Wiel to Bayern Munich, while Luis Su\u00e1rez could also be moved on. The Uruguay striker, who scored 49 goals for Ajax last season, has a close relationship with Jol. Jol has expressed his frustration at being asked to win the Dutch title with one hand metaphorically tied behind his back but Ajax hope they can persuade him to stay and pacify him with concessions over transfer targets and funds. The financial director, Jeroen Slop, and the chief executive, Rik van den Boog, have reportedly told him that he could have a greater percentage of the proceeds from the potential sales of Van der Wiel and Su\u00e1rez to rebuild the squad. Jol was quoted by today&apos;s edition of the Amsterdam newspaper De Telegraaf as saying Fulham &quot;were interested but, in principle, I&apos;m staying at Ajax&quot;, which prompted bewilderment in west London, where the assumption was the comment had to be some sort of political manoeuvring for the benefit of his countrymen. Tonight, Jol hinted on Dutch television that he might stay at Ajax if his conditions were met. &quot;I am worried about the future and Ajax is worried, too,&quot; he said. &quot;But if they think like me, then we can talk again tomorrow. The other clubs like PSV and Twente are getting better and they are not decreasing their squads like Ajax is. If we are really inventive, we can get to the same level as last season. That is what we are talking about \u2013 to make ourselves better.&quot; Perhaps the main attraction for Jol at Fulham would be a freer rein on transfers. Although Al Fayed never allots a specific budget for new signings, he is happy to allow his managers to suggest names to him and he has a history of backing them. His pockets have also been swelled by the \u00a31.5bn sale of Harrods. One of Jol&apos;s frustrations during his time at Tottenham Hotspur was the conflict over transfer policy with the then sporting director, Damien Comolli, while with his next job, at Hamburg, he was unhappy the club embarked on a spending spree after he had left. His job at Ajax has been made more difficult by the extravagant spending of his predecessor, Marco van Basten. Fulham&apos;s players are on their pre-season tour of Sweden and they are preparing for Thursday&apos;s game against Halmstad, under the guidance of the caretaker manager Ray Lewington, from a position of uncertainty. Hodgson&apos;s departure has, inevitability, prompted a number of them to consider their futures but the capture of Jol has been billed as the big-name to appease them. The new manager has a difficult act to follow as Hodgson oversaw the most successful period in Fulham&apos;s history.

If there&apos;s one thing that football grounds are good at it&apos;s banning things. Take Wembley, for example. Along with &quot;any article that might be used as a weapon&quot;, spectators are not allowed to take into the ground: unlicensed musical instruments, including trumpets, drums and &quot;other devices capable of causing a disturbance or nuisance&quot;; Flag poles greater than 1m in length; Flares; Bottles, glass vessels, cans and flasks; Frisbees and &quot;similar items&quot;; Dangerous or hazardous items; Illegal substances; Explosives or ammunition; fireworks; Knives, blades or other weapons; Firearms; Scooters, skateboards or other skates; Laser devices; Smoke canisters; Signs or items with corporate or inappropriate branding; Unauthorised fliers; Spray paint or large industrial style marker pens; Prams and push chairs; Transmitting devices; Professional cameras and recording devices; Large suitcases, lap tops, and back packs; Illegal merchandise items; Water bottles; Illegal charity collection utensils; Motor bike helmets; Umbrellas; Darts; Hampers and Cold Boxes; Air horns; Alcohol; and animals (except service dogs and guide dogs). But Wembley is far from alone. And the vuvuzela is not the first noise-maker to face a football ban \u2013 wooden rattles were banned in the 1970s due to their handy heft for hooligans. Other bans have been slightly odder. In the 1987-88 season Maine Road became populated with a bumper crop of blow-up bananas, named, in honour of striker Imre Varadi, &quot;Imre Banana&quot;. Arguably, the finest hour of the City inflatable craze came in September 1988 when the team visited Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Away supporters were banned due to trouble in a previous play-off fixture, but some City fans made their way into the ground regardless. &quot;As City scarves and banners would have been a bit of a giveaway,&quot; wrote Mike Rowbottom in the Guardian, &quot;a less obvious rallying device was devised. A 7ft inflatable Frankenstein. So simple.&quot; The craze continued. By February Bristol City arrived for a Littlewoods Cup semi-final with 200 sets of blow up fangs in honour of their manager Joe Jordan. At Wimbledon&apos;s Plough Lane, 1,500 Grimsby fans turned up waving haddocks. Blackpool started selling two and a half feet high plastic Blackpool Towers. Something had to give, and it did at Highbury, where local police deemed that the oversized novelty fruits could, by obstructing spectators&apos; views, incite violence. &quot;Football has become a leading victim of the British mania for banning things,&quot; wrote David Lacey. &quot;The latest absurdity came at Highbury on Tuesday night when police video cameras solemnly scanned the terraces for illicit giant bananas.&quot; The Gunners, though, soon relented and the inflatable craze was allowed to die a natural death. Not only inanimate objects have fallen foul of footballs rulemakers. In May 2006 Vladimir Kisilev was in Moscow to show one of his prize-winning pigs at a farm show and afterwards was keen to head over to the Luzhniki Stadium to watch Spartak Moscow v Zenit St Petersburg. Having nowhere to leave his porcine pal, Kisilev attempted to take it with him, but was stopped by police. &quot;I wanted to see the game, but had nowhere to leave the pig,&quot; said Kisilev. &quot;I almost managed to get it into the ground in a big bag, but it started grunting and the police noticed.&quot; Irene Kerrigan at least managed to get her pet into the ground. In January 2009 Hertford Heath faced Hatfield Town in a crunch Hertfordshire Senior Centenary Trophy quarter-final tie. Around 150 hardy souls watched a goal-less first half before proceedings took a bizarre twist early in the second half, with play being disrupted by the 63-year-old Mrs Kerrigan&apos;s pet Senegal parrot Me-Tu, who, having been a regular at Hertford Heath home fixtures, was demonstrating his new-found ability to mimic the referee&apos;s whistle. &quot;I&apos;ve never known anything like it in all my football career,&quot; said the referee Gary Bailey. &quot;I got a hell of a shock. It was a big game and there were quite a lot of people there. This woman was standing right by the touchline and suddenly unveiled a big cage with this big green parrot in it. I didn&apos;t mind at first. But then every time I blew my whistle the bird made exactly the same sound. It was bizarre. The crowd were all laughing. In the end, there was only one thing for it.&quot; Mrs Kerrigan and Me-Tu were asked to leave. FAST-TRACK SUCCESS &quot;Just two years after their creation Irish side Sporting Fingal F.C. won the FAI Cup,&quot; writes Michael Hallinan. &quot;They are now about to play against Maritimo in the second qualifying round of the Europa League. Has there ever been a team to achieve success so quickly?&quot; Rags to riches overnight? Only in America. Well, not only in America, but the United States is a good place to start &quot;Chicago Fire, coached by the current US national team coach Bob Bradley, won the Major League Soccer title in their very first year of existence,&quot; writes Corey Thompson. &quot;One mitigating factor was that this was in 1998, only the third year of the league&apos;s existence, so they weren&apos;t knocking off 80-year old clubs in order to hoist the championship trophy. This qualified them for the Concacaf Champions Cup the following year, where they were eliminated in the semi-final on penalties.&quot; The Seattle Sounders won the US Open Cup, the equivalent to the FA Cup, in their first season in 2009, while DC United, writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius, won the Concacaf Champions Cup in 1998, three years after their formation. Away from MLS, Uzbek side Bunyodkor Tashkent have been rather successful in their five years of existence. &quot;Bunyodkor were founded in 2005 and have since won the Uzbek league twice (2008, 2009) and been runner-up once (2007),&quot; writes Pieter Jordaan. &quot;They also won the Uzbek Cup in 2008 and reached the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League in 2008 and the quarter-finals in 2007. It does, of course, help that they are bankrolled by a rather large company in Zeromax.&quot; Mergers can also bring quick success to newly formed clubs. &quot;FC Amsterdam were established from a merger of two struggling Amsterdam teams in 1972 and played to almost empty crowds in the massive Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam,&quot; writes Meir Moses. &quot;They qualified for the 1974-75 Uefa Cup and made it to the quarter-final stage after having defeated the mighty Internazionale in the second round, then Fortuna Dusseldorf before succumbing to FC Koln.&quot; And a similar tale can also be found in Denmark. &quot;FC Copenhagen won the Danish top flight in their first season of existence, 1992-93,&quot; writes Mathias Stigsgaard. &quot;They were a merger of KB (mainland Europe&apos;s oldest football club) and B1903 and as such had an automatic spot in the highest division, which they won by one point.&quot; MOHAMED SHAWKY: MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WESLEY SNEIJDER (BUT NOT QIUTE AS SUCCESSFUL AS PELE) Last week we looked at the players who have won trebles with their clubs before going on to lift international titles with the countries. But, not for the first time, we missed out rather a big name. &quot;As legendary Paraguayan goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert kept on mentioning on the US channel Univision during the World Cup, Wesley Sneijder would have been the second person to win at least a treble with his club (including a continent&apos;s top trophy) and the World Cup in the same year,&quot; writes Tim Dockery. &quot;The first (and only) person to do that was Pel\u00e9 who in 1962 won the Campeonato Paulista (the Campeonato Barsileiro not yet being in existence), the Ta\u00e7a Brasil (a predecessor to the Copa do Brasil) and the Copa Libertadores with Santos and the World Cup with Brazil. &quot;However, even if Holland had won the World Cup, Pel\u00e9 would still have bested Sneijder as, in addition to a domestic double and a continent&apos;s top club competition, Pel\u00e9 and Santos also won the world&apos;s top club competition in 1962 by beating reigning European Champions Benefica for the Intercontinental Cup.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Has a goalkeeper ever been sent off during a penalty shootout?&quot; wondered Olumide Hassan back in 2007. Hats off to Tommy Tucker for discovering that Botswana goalkeeper and captain Modiri Marumo was sent off during a Castle Cup shootout against Malawi in May 2003. Having been booked for time-wasting before Malawi scored their third spot-kick, Marumo &quot;reacted to a pat on the shoulder from opposite number Philip Nyasulu by punching him in the face and got a red card&quot;. Malawi went on to win 4-1 and reach the semi-finals. &quot;I over-reacted in an exchange of words between myself and my counterpart,&quot; admitted Marumo. &quot;This unbecoming behaviour has not only embarrassed me, but also the organisation that I work for, the Botswana Defence Force (BDF). I hope my apology would be recognised and I pledge my commitment in serving the nation.&quot; For all the knowledge you can manage, and a lot more, head to the Knowledge archive. Can you help? &quot;Most of Spain&apos;s World Cup winning squad have won a few things or more at club level, except for \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa,&quot; notes Matt Prior (not that one). &quot;At 27, he now has a European Championship winner&apos;s medal and a World Cup winner&apos;s medal to his name, but no club trophies.

According to sources in the Netherlands, Jol has agreed in principle a three-year contract at Craven Cottage worth in the region of \u00a32m-a-year. The paperwork is prepared and is merely awaiting his signature. It is the result of lengthy talks between Jol and Fulham. Ajax have dug in their heels but Fulham&apos;s chief executive Alistair Mackintosh, who has been in Amsterdam, finally got the nod to meet with Ajax&apos;s directors, which has been interpreted in west London as a softening of the Dutch club&apos;s stance. Jol has two years to run on his contract and Ajax have demonstrated a keenness to hold him to that, despite his desire to take on the challenge of succeeding Roy Hodgson at Fulham. Jol is in dispute with Ajax over the direction in which the club is heading. Having recorded a loss of \u20ac20m (\u00a316.8m), they have released the striker Marko Pantelic and the midfielder Dennis Rommedahl, and Jol is worried that further cut-backs are imminent. Ajax have fought to convince him otherwise and they said that they had ended negotiations with Bayern Munich over the proposed sale of the full-back Gregory van der Wiel. One of the attractions for Jol at Fulham would be a freer rein on transfers. Mohamed Al Fayed, the chairman, has a history of backing his managers and would allow Jol to strengthen the squad that reached the final of last season&apos;s Europa League. The impasse has caused frustration and an element of bewilderment at Fulham, who cannot understand why Ajax have refused to accept that their manager wants to leave them. Jol does not want to walk out on Ajax and open himself up to being sued by them, potentially at great cost, and so he has waited for Fulham to agree a suitable severance package, which they have been keen to do. For Fulham, the situation carries some similarities with that of Hodgson from earlier in the summer. From the moment that Liverpool made him their top target to succeed Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Fulham knew that he wanted to go but Hodgson would not resign for the fear of losing out financially. Instead, he waited for a compensation package to be agreed before he wrote his letter of resignation. Jol, meanwhile, has played the game with the Dutch media. He told the Tuesday edition of De Telegraaf that Fulham &quot;was interested but, in principle, I&apos;m staying at Ajax&quot; while he has subsequently expressed a willingness to talk about the future with Ajax, and plot how the club ought best to move forward. At the same time, he has made plain his irritation at the financial constraints placed upon him, which are largely the legacy of the spending of his predecessor Marco van Basten. He has lamented the departures and stressed the need to strengthen, while pointing out that, at present, the funds are not available. In another twist, Jol has found himself under attack from the Ajax striker Miralem Sulejmani, who Van Basten signed for \u20ac16m only for him to struggle. West Ham wanted to take Sulejamani on loan only for the deal to be blocked. The player blames Jol. &quot;I really don&apos;t understand why Jol has vetoed the move,&quot; he said. &quot;It looks like he&apos;s trying to ruin my career. I was looking forward to relaunching my career at West Ham. Their manager sees me as a big talent and I&apos;m keen to make a fresh start elsewhere.&quot;", "sentences": ["Ajax have dug in their heels but Fulham&apos;s chief executive Alistair Mackintosh, who has been in Amsterdam, finally got the nod to meet with Ajax&apos;s directors, which has been interpreted in west London as a softening of the Dutch club&apos;s stance."], "title": "Ajax's stance softens as Martin Jol agrees personal terms with Fulham", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/21/martin-jol-fulham-personal-terms", "tags": ["Martin Jol", "Fulham", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-22T09:44:00Z", "article": "Martin Jol&apos;s proposed transfer to Fulham is off after Ajax succeeded in resisting the approach of the London club for their manager.

And I don&apos;t think I can bring myself to leave Ajax at this time. I came here last summer to be successful, to build a good team and to have fun. And those three things are what I am interested in achieving next season.&quot; Fulham had been optimistic of securing Jol&apos;s services as the replacement for Roy Hodgson, who has joined Liverpool, and they were so far down the line with the deal for the Dutchman that he had even agreed personal terms on a three-year contract at Craven Cottage. But the stumbling block all along was Ajax&apos;s refusal to entertain negotiations for Jol. Although a meeting was held between the Ajax hierarchy, Jol and the Fulham chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, in Amsterdam last night, which ran deep into the early hours and at which Jol is believed to have urged the club to release him, Ajax remained steadfast. &quot;We would not let Martin go for \u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m) to Fulham,&quot; said the Ajax chief executive, Rik van den Boog, this morning, as he expressed his happiness at winning the battle to keep Jol at the club. Jol, who led Ajax to second place in last season&apos;s Eredivisie and success in the Dutch Cup, has been forced to honour his contract, which has at least two years to run, with options on more. From the brink of a coup, Fulham now find themselves disappointed and they have been forced to endure Jol saying, in what appears designed as a public relations exercise, that he always wanted to stay at Ajax. &quot;It was always my intention to build on at Ajax,&quot; he said. &quot;For me, it was essential that I didn&apos;t stand alone. It was essential that everyone wanted to go full steam ahead. I was just looking for the right feeling.

Although Fulham had agreed personal terms with Jol, Ajax were not willing to allow him to leave under any circumstances, and have held him to the terms of the contract he signed last summer. &quot;Ray Lewington will remain in charge of all first-team matters as caretaker manager and the club would like to thank Ray, his backroom staff and all the players for their patience and professionalism ahead of the 2010/11 Premier League season.&quot; Jol has been in dispute with Ajax over the direction in which the club is headed.

Published quarterly, the survey measures confidence in the general arts and antiques market across categories including gold and silver, furniture, pictures, ceramics and clocks. There were price increases across 10 of the 11 categories, with silver and jewellery the best performers as values increased in line with precious metal prices. The worst performers were ceramics and clocks. The report said 24% of dealers reported a rise in prices rather than a fall during the second quarter of the year, with high-value deals driving prices higher. The proportion of surveyors reporting rises in the highest bracket of \u00a350,000-plus items doubled from the first to second quarter. Respondents were asked which sector was the strongest in their opinion. Gold, silver and jewellery were, unsurprisingly, the most cited areas, but a significant number of respondents also mentioned oriental art and ceramics. The watch sector bucks the trend slightly with the sheer volume of lower-priced items supporting the market. In the survey, 33% of dealers reported a rise rather than a fall in prices for lots of between \u00a31 and \u00a31,000. Auction house Fellows &amp; Sons has more than 100 watches for sale today, the majority of which are less than \u00a31,000. Christie&apos;s takes its watch auctions around the world, with upcoming sales taking place in Dubai in October, Amsterdam in November and New York in December. One of the most expensive watches bought in recent years was a 1974 Patek Philippe 18ct pink gold wristwatch, which went for $1.35m in 2008 in Hong Kong at Christie&apos;s. At a Bonhams auction in June 2010 a rare Patek Philippe 18ct gold chronograph wristwatch fetched \u00a350,400, beating an estimate of \u00a335,000-\u00a345,000. Despite such sales just 6% of surveyors told Rics they had seen a rise in watch prices in the \u00a350,000 and above category. Rics spokesman Andrew Davies said: &quot;Given the uncertain economic future it is of little surprise that buyers continue to invest in more traditional &apos;safe&apos; categories, such as precious metals and jewellery. However, we are noting a resurgent interest in oriental ceramics and works of art, particularly from middle and far eastern investors. &quot;Over the next 12 months survey respondents expect both demand and availability to increase. However, demand is expected to increase at a faster pace than supply.&quot; Chris Ewbank of Guildford-based auctioneers Ewbank Clarke Gammon Wellers said sale entries are up in terms of quantity, quality and value. &quot;We have our largest antique sale for over two years this month.

Eriksson, the former England manager, took charge of the Ivory Coast at the World Cup finals and the African nation would like him to sign another contract. But Eriksson has waited for Fulham to make their decision, having always been on their shortlist to succeed Roy Hodgson, and met them before their public pursuit of Jol, pictured right, which ended when he confirmed he would stay at Ajax. The Swede, who worked well with Fulham&apos;s chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, during their time together at Manchester City, does not feel slighted at being behind Jol on the wish-list. He believes Jol was the personal favourite of the Fulham chairman, Mohamed Al Fayed, and that he was and remains the No1 choice of the club&apos;s other prominent football figures. The much-decorated Hitzfeld, too, was on the original shortlist and, like Eriksson, he would bring experience and kudos to the position. The German is under contract with Switzerland, whom he led at the World Cup; they upset Spain in the opening group game before losing to Chile and drawing with Honduras to bow out. Hitzfeld has said that he intends to honour his contract with Switzerland, which takes in the 2012 European Championship. If Fulham want to make a relatively swift appointment by the end of the month, they are expected to turn to Eriksson or Hitzfeld. They could yet leave Ray Lewington in caretaker charge for a longer period, to take stock and cast the net for other candidates but it is more likely that they will follow the first option. Cardiff City&apos;s Dave Jones was installed today as the bookmakers&apos; favourite for the job and he would be keen but he is not thought to be under consideration. Fulham remain in limbo, as do some of their transfer targets. The Aston Villa midfielder Steve Sidwell, for example, has negotiated personal terms on a move to Craven Cottage and a \u00a32m fee has been agreed between the clubs but he needs to wait for the identity of the new manager to be revealed. He was originally a name put to the Fulham board by Hodgson, before he left to join Liverpool. Fulham also face losing players while the instability endures. The left-back Paul Konchesky has been linked with a reunion at Liverpool with Hodgson. Fulham had been optimistic about securing Jol&apos;s services as he had agreed his personal terms on a three-year contract at Craven Cottage but the stumbling block all along was Ajax&apos;s refusal to entertain negotiations for his release. Although a meeting was held among the Ajax hierarchy, Jol and Mackintosh in Amsterdam on Wednesday night, which ran deep into the early hours and at which Jol is believed to have urged the club to release him, Ajax remained steadfast. The 54-year-old did not want to walk out on his contract at the Dutch club as he might have opened himself up to being sued. &quot;I was probably a bit disappointed I had to say &apos;No&apos; to Fulham because the board don&apos;t want to let me go under any circumstances,&quot; Jol said. &quot;Alistair Mackintosh was offering a good job at a good club with good players \u2013 good, honest players \u2013 and I was willing to go there but I am under contract. I had to tell Fulham that I had to stay. All the problems, going to court, I didn&apos;t want that because Ajax is too big to be put through that misery.&quot; There was the feeling that although Ajax might now have a slightly disgruntled manager in charge, they could not bear to lose him to a smaller club, in the form of Fulham, who have virtually no standing in the Netherlands. Dutch pride was at stake. Jol has been in dispute with Ajax over finance for squad re-strengthening and the club, which has announced losses of \u20ac20m (\u00a316.8m), have made an attempt to offer him some small concessions. Fulham, though, do not feel that Jol has used their interest in him to serve his own ends at Ajax. &quot;When we commenced negotiations with Martin Jol,&quot; said Fulham, in a statement, &quot;we were informed that an exit clause existed in his contract with Ajax. Subsequent negotiations revealed that the clause was no longer valid and Ajax remained steadfast in their desire to keep their manager. &quot;Although we had agreed personal terms with Martin Jol, Ajax were not willing to allow him to leave under any circumstances, and have held him to the terms of the contract he signed last summer.&quot;", "sentences": ["Although a meeting was held among the Ajax hierarchy, Jol and Mackintosh in Amsterdam on Wednesday night, which ran deep into the early hours and at which Jol is believed to have urged the club to release him, Ajax remained steadfast."], "title": "Fulham turn to Sven-Goran Eriksson as Ajax refuse to release Martin Jol", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/22/sven-goran-eriksson-fulham-martin-jol-ottmar-hitzfeld", "tags": ["Fulham", "Sven-Goran Eriksson", "Martin Jol", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-23T11:56:35Z", "article": "Ok, I registered, and now have yet another geeky backpack, a pen, and a map of Paris. Plus a dog tag with my name and &quot;ICHEP 2010&quot; on so that security won&apos;t throw me out. Excellent. Off to a day of parallel talk sessions. In one room the audience were hearing how well the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) detectors at Cern are working, which is very well indeed. This is a major achievement not to be underestimated. They have come into operation much more smoothly than is usual for highly complex particle detectors. I basically knew that already, so I went to another very crowded session where the latest Hera (a particle accelerator at DESY in Hamburg) and Tevatron measurements of the W and Z bosons were being shown, along with the very first measurements of these particles from the Atlas and CMS detectors at the LHC. The W and Z are the particles that carry the weak force, and they have been well measured in previous experiments. But when I saw their mass peaks in 7 teraelectronvolt collisions for the first time, it brought home to me in a surprisingly powerful way the anchor that experiment provides for our understanding. The W and Z lead very fleeting lives, decaying almost immediately into other particles. They are bosons generated by the symmetries of the Standard Model of physics, and according to our model their masses come directly from the Higgs. In a sense they are partly made up of the Higgs. It&apos;s all a bit abstract, but quantum mechanical exchanges of these particles are responsible for making the sun shine. There&apos;s also a definite prediction, for example, that when you plot the distribution of electron-positron pairs in our collisions, you should see a big bump. And there it is. It works. Don&apos;t let anyone tell you quantum mechanics is only about uncertainty. Floating significantly more freely from the anchors of experiment in the hardcore theory session was Erik Verlinde of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Amsterdam, discussing the idea that gravity and general relativity may not be fundamental, but instead may emerge from the bulk behaviour of smaller things. If I understand it right, this would make gravitational waves essentially no more fundamental than sound waves. Fascinating, possibly a new direction, but as the speaker himself said, the theory needs to make some experimentally testable predictions. In the final session of the day we had presentations on the Higgs searches at the Tevatron particle collider at Fermilab in the US. Surprise, surprise \u2013 the room was packed (see photo above). I wonder why the organisers didn&apos;t use one of the bigger rooms. They can&apos;t have been taken unawares by the level of interest, surely? Anyhow, what we saw were the component parts of a number of different searches for that damned elusive particle, carried out independently at the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab) and DZero experiments. What is obvious is that no one is going to announce a clearcut observation of the standard model Higgs at this conference. What is not clear yet is how close we are, how much room the Higgs has left to hide in, and whether there are any hints of its presence. These questions will be answered at the plenary session on Monday, apparently, when the combined results of both colliders and all their different techniques will be shown. What comes now is a champagne reception while we look at lots of cool physics posters. It&apos;ll have to do ...

It is the first time the London-based firm has been convicted of criminal charges over the environmental scandal, in which 30,000 Africans were made ill when the toxic waste was dumped in Ivory Coast. A court in the Netherlands also ruled today that the firm had concealed the dangerous nature of the waste when it was initially unloaded from a ship in Amsterdam. Eliance Kouassi, president of the victims&apos; group in Ivory Coast, said: &quot;Finally Trafigura has been called out in a court of law. It&apos;s a real victory for us.&quot; The fine is, however, only half the amount sought by the Dutch prosecutors. Amsterdam district court judge Frans Bauduin also convicted a Trafigura employee and the Ukranian captain of the ship that carried the waste for their roles in the 2006 scandal. The seven-week trial centred on Trafigura&apos;s initial attempt to get rid of the waste cheaply in Holland. Look Bougert, prosecuting, told the court that Trafigura had put &quot;self-interest above people&apos;s health and the environment&quot;. The prosecutor said Trafigura initially tried to conceal how dangerous the waste was, adding that the firm wrongly described it as routine slops from ordinary tank-cleaning. Residents complained about the foul smell. The company hired to dispose of the waste in Holland wanted more money for the job. Trafigura then pumped the toxic waste back on to its tanker. The vessel, the Probo Koala, was sent to Ivory Coast, where the cost of getting rid of the waste was much lower. Instead of disposing of it properly, Trafigura &quot;dumped it over the fence&quot; in Abidjan, Bougert said. &quot;Cheap, but with consequences,&quot; he added. Last year, amid an international furore, Trafigura was forced to pay compensation totalling \u00a330m to the thousands of Africans who needed medical treatment. The payments settled out of court a civil legal action brought by London lawyers Leigh Day. Three years ago, in another settlement, Trafigura paid \u00a3100m to the Ivorian government to help clean up the waste. Trafigura has consistently denied wrongdoing, insisting that the waste could not have caused serious illness. After today&apos;s verdict, it said it would consider an appeal. &quot;While Trafigura is pleased to have been acquitted of the charge of forgery, it is disappointed by the judge&apos;s ruling on the other two, which it believes to be incorrect. Concerning the delivery of dangerous goods, it is important that the court has noted that there was limited risk to human health from these slops, and indeed no damage occurred in Amsterdam.&quot; The court convicted Trafigura employee Naeem Ahmed of leading the effort to dump the waste &quot;while its dangerous nature was concealed&quot;. Ahmed was fined \u00a425,000 and given a six-month suspended sentence. The Ukrainian captain of the Probo Koala, Sergey Chertov, also was sentenced to a five-month suspended prison term. Greenpeace campaigner Marietta Harjono said: &quot;This is a first step towards justice and a clear signal to other companies that the illegal export of waste to Africa will not go unpunished.&quot; Trafigura has become notorious for threatening reporters who delve into its conduct. It has been paying for the services of lobbyists Bell Pottinger and libel lawyers Carter-Ruck.

Within 15 minutes you&apos;re clear of the city, riding past people rowing on the river and fishing on the banks. Within 30 minutes you&apos;ve hit the first windmill (which is a private residence, so don&apos;t knock on the door) and the Amsterdam city limits at the Kleine Kalf (Little Cow) cafe.

My favourite route changes all the time, but there&apos;s a particular one through north London that is great for greenery and views. Setting off from my home in Dalston, I pedal straight up the high street, passing Stoke Newington (lots of cafes for breakfasts) and Stamford Hill, heading towards Lordship Lane. From here I cut off the busy main road and wend my way through rows of semis on quiet, gently undulating streets before tackling the climb to Alexandra Palace. The view from the palace is exceptional, and there&apos;s a pub, the Phoenix, at the top if you need refreshment. Instead I usually cruise down the long steep hill on the other side, pedal on through Highgate, then up to Hampstead (you could buy picnic supplies here), before heading into the heath. If I manage to find the secluded ladies&apos; ponds (which seem to disappear every time I go there), I lock my bike up and take a dip, along with the swans, dragonflies and old ladies in swimming hats.

Continue on past the Pompidou Centre (centrepompidou.fr), through the shopping area Les Halles. Stop for refreshments at Rue Montorgueil, a trendy street in the 2nd district where you can find lots of cafes, restaurants and Patisserie Stohrer (51 rue Montorgueil, stohrer.fr), Paris&apos;s oldest pastry shop. From here, cycle past the Louvre museum, before joining the Pont-Neuf bridge, where you can reach the two river islands in the middle of the Seine.

Jol, who is to remain in Holland after his club refused to release him to take over as Fulham manager, would have been delighted by the positive start his side made against the Premier League champions and they were rewarded with an early goal.

Yet the crest on their jersey features three gold stars. The third one, then, is an aspirational adornment, like the moustaches that scrawny 14-year-old boys grow to show they want to be men, or the souped-up Ford Capri that the Fiver drives to show that we fully intend to get our licence and insurance any day now, officer, otherwise why would we be driving? Duhhhh. City want their third title pronto. And they seem to be going about getting it in a canny way: by buying every player in the world. Manager Roberto Mancini has already spent \u00a378m this summer and is still jabbering about further acquisitions, which may involve sploshing \u00a325m on James Milner and \u00a370m on advanced research into fatal diseases, thereby disproving the notion that the club owners, who hold an enormous chunk of the world&apos;s wealth by fluke of birth, are not hollow bozos who care only about bling and \u2026 sorry, that was a misprint: the \u00a370m has been earmarked for Fernando Torres. &quot;Torres is one of the best strikers in Europe and has already been playing the Premier League for three years,&quot; gushed Mancini, whose challenge for a Big Cup spot was last season undermined by him having a mere seven senior strikers from which to cobble together an attack. No wonder even Torres won&apos;t be enough \u2013 City are also eyeing Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko and Inter&apos;s Mario Balotelli. &quot;There are two or three strikers that we could go for, but it is the same situation as with James Milner,&quot; revealed Mancini, perhaps hinting that the deal will only be done if the selling club agrees to accept an absurdly extravagant bid. &quot;First it is the price, then it depends on if the players want to change team,&quot; explained Mancini, who may well be able to field an entirely different 11 for every match of the season if he manages to add all his targets to City&apos;s extant multitude. Except, of course, he won&apos;t. Because new Premier League rules stipulate that clubs may only register 25 players for the first half of the season, including eight who were grown at home. City have 37 and counting. So either they&apos;re going to turn the likes of Joleon Lescott, Wayne Bridge, Jo, Felipe Caicedo, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Stephen Ireland into the planet&apos;s highest-paid stewards or they&apos;re going to find clubs that will take that lot off their hands. There will be no shortage of suitors because some of those players have plenty to offer \u2013 but they also have sumptuous contracts. City are likely to be paying at least part of their wages for many years to come, regardless of who they play for. All of which, of course, enhances the chances of a City employee lifting the Premier League trophy next season. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;The man was definitely not on the staff of our club. He was just an emotional fan. The referee failed to control the game well \u2013 perhaps he was too young&quot; - Yu Tao, general manager of Chinese Super League outfit Qingdao, denies that a fan who ran on to the pitch and karate-kicked the referee during the defeat to Shanghai Shenhua was a club official, despite sporting branded shorts and trainers, as well as offering up a neat line in blame repositioning. THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE UNSCHEDULED 42-HOUR STOPOVER BP might be suffering from bad PR at the moment, but if news of Portsmouth&apos;s pre-season tour of North America is anything to go by, woes prompted by photos of disconsolate and dead-looking sludge-soaked brown pelicans could soon be eclipsed by those of another well-known oil retailer. Pompey&apos;s website proudly informs visitors that their away travel is &quot;fuelled by Texaco&quot;, who everyone who is anyone in the petroleum industry is aware, are the official motor fuel partner of the npower Championship. Whether Texaco&apos;s remit stretches to fuelling Portsmouth&apos;s travels beyond the Championship&apos;s boundaries remains unknown. If it doesn&apos;t, their public relations wing could do worse than rattle off a short press release completely disassociating themselves from an expedition so beset by misfortune it makes Shackleton&apos;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition seem like a fun-filled weekend jolly for the lads. Relegated, potless and still very much in administration, the very fact that Portsmouth&apos;s budget stretched to a pre-season tour of anywhere more exotic than the Winchester bypass is surprising. But led by new manager Steve Cotterill, the club&apos;s two-week trip to USA! USA!! USA!!! and Canada concluded yesterday when a team comprised of trialists, youth-team players and a clatter of their few remaining registered first-team players were whipped 4-0 by DC United. It was the high point of the kind of bad trip that gives LSD a bad name, if only because it marked its end. Luckless Pompey&apos;s problems began a fortnight ago when a cancelled connecting flight meant a journey to San Diego ended up taking 42 hours. Travelling on to Canada, two players had to be sent home with knack, including suspected leg-snap for goalkeeper Jon Stewart, who as it turned out, was one of the lucky ones. The remaining players and backroom staff found themselves stranded in Chicago when a storm grounded their flight from Edmonton to Washington, which meant the players arrived for Saturday&apos;s match with DC United having had just four hours&apos; sleep and lost 14 items of luggage, including their kit. The final indignity? Having to wear the away strip of their hosts as they had their backsides handed to them by Major League Soccerball opponents in a bad-tempered &apos;friendly&apos; played in temperatures so sweltering the referee very considerately sent three players, including Hayden Mullins, off to cool down. &quot;The one thing about this result is that it&apos;s shown the position we&apos;re in. It&apos;s painful,&quot; said Cotterill who, to be fair, probably hadn&apos;t envisaged a future in which glitter and candyfloss featured prominently when he agreed to take the job. &quot;We&apos;ve got some good honest senior lads here and some youngsters who are trying their hardest. The kids have got to be at full tilt to be anywhere near the team and we&apos;re going to be playing in a man&apos;s league in a couple of weeks&apos; time.&quot; In poker, a player on &apos;full tilt&apos; plays with wreckless and ill-advised abandon after suffering bad setbacks. While this may well be the reaction Cotterill gets from his younger players, the Fiver suspects it&apos;s not quite the definition of the term he had in mind. \u00a366 HAT-TRICK OF FREE BETS WITH BLUE SQUARE Click here to find out more. FIVER LETTERS &quot;As a native of the &apos;notoriously rough Dublin village&apos; of Tallaght, I take offence at Friday&apos;s Quote of the Day and suggest you get your facts straight about what is now practically a city in south Dublin. As a Guardian reader of 10 years or so, I am not one who takes offence easily or writes in outrage to complain but when I see snide comments like this in Irish and UK media it is a bit galling when one considers just how far Tallaght has come from a deprived suburb to near city status. The village itself is virtually unrecognisable from its humble beginnings. Yes crime has been an issue in the past, and most recently seen in violence outside\u00a0Shamrock Rovers&apos; stadium, but show me a city anywhere in the UK where this does not happen.\u00a0I could easily make derogatory remarks about Manchester or London, but I don&apos;t.

The provision of housing in the Park will be absolutely vital to this: the amount, the type, the people who live in it. All are sure to stir strong feelings. They already have:   There will be some significant variation from the original London Development Agency framework for the site, which was produced and consulted on a year before OPLC came into existence. That masterplan, drawn up by architects EDAW, KCAP and Allies &amp; Morrison in 2008-2009, envisaged between 10,000 and 12,000 homes in six village developments at the park - just one of which would provide low-rise family homes. But Ford and Altman, the 47-year-old former deputy mayor of Philadelphia, see things differently. For much of the OPLC&apos;s first 12 months in operation, they have been evangelical about the need for more family housing. &quot;The overwhelming feedback from pretty much everyone was we want to see a greater accent on family housing, as that is plainly the part of the housing mix that is most needed in east London,&quot; says Ford.   As Norman writes, most recent estimates put the new number of future dwellings at between 8,000 and 10,000. He gets Altman and Ford to outline a vision:  What they have aimed for, [Altman] says, is &quot;family terraced housing, great neighbourhoods, crescents and squares, parks and housing around canals and the 1.9 miles of waterways at the site - the neighbourhoods that make London a great place to live&quot;.

That rather sombre combination of 1960s American free-jazz and European conservatoire music that has influenced many young players on this side of\u00a0the\u00a0Atlantic has generally bypassed the Dutch, who go to work with their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks.&quot; The review was of Amsterdam&apos;s Willem Breuker Kollektief, a riotously entertaining ensemble that appeared to owe as much to music-theatre as it did to the jazz tradition, and which mingled vaudeville, circus music, Brecht/Weill, cabaret, free-jazz and, on that occasion, a soprano-sax solo directed towards the possible occupant of a snake-basket. Looking back, the review said more about jazz journalists&apos; anxious attempts to pass off uncommercial music as bearably quirky to suspicious mainstream editors than it did about Breuker \u2013 an extraordinary, devoted, obsessively serious and immensely influential modern European artist who really needed no excuses. A saxophonist, clarinetist, composer and cheerleader for the unexpected, the Dutchman was one of the brightest stars of European free-jazz and contemporary classical music for almost four decades. His death at 65, after prolonged illnesses, halts the momentum of an astonishing musical dynamo. Breuker was a believer in what, as\u00a0a\u00a0diehard 60s radical, he would simply call &quot;people&apos;s music&quot;. He loved the theatre and often worked in it. The visual diversions he brought to what might otherwise have seemed taxing musical experiences did much to dispel the impenetrability often associated with avant-garde jazz over the course of the Kollektief&apos;s 36-year career. He composed more than 500 works for theatre, opera and film; ran his own recording and publishing company; and\u00a0was an active educator and proselytiser. A specialist in the work of\u00a0Kurt Weill, he assembled an archive of\u00a0the composer&apos;s materials and produced a 48-hour, 12-part radio documentary on Weill in 1997. Breuker was born in Amsterdam. His first music lessons were on clarinet, but he heard music in his own way. He could not see why the sound of the local fishmonger shouting, an approaching car engine or the neighbourhood barrel organist should not coexist in contemporary music. He began playing truant to listen to Schoenberg, Bart\u00f3k and Var\u00e8se in the library, &quot;in the era of Elvis and Little Richard&quot;. He taught himself saxophone and began writing music in his teens, but his indiscipline kept him from music college, and he was viewed with suspicion by Amsterdam&apos;s bebop-oriented jazz players. Breuker went to night school, studying to be a teacher, and entered jazz competitions at festivals. At one, he covered well-known songs written by a festival organiser, playing them discordantly on a plastic flute, with random words he had invented himself. These rickety beginnings got Breuker noticed, particularly by the bandleader Theo Loevendie and the composer Misha Mengelberg. By October 1966, Breuker\u00a0was recording his debut album, Contemporary Jazz for Holland, including the composition Litany for the 14th of June 1966, in response to the Dutch police fatally opening fire on demonstrations by the Provo anarchist group. The following year, Breuker became one of the founders (with Mengelberg and the drummer Han Bennink) of the nonprofit Instant Composers&apos; Pool, an\u00a0experimental self-help organisation for improvisers. He was also playing with the German pianist-composer Alex\u00a0von Schlippenbach&apos;s free-jazz big band, the Globe Unity Orchestra; with the multi-instrumentalist Gunter Hampel&apos;s group; and with Bennink, Mengelberg and the German saxophonist Peter Br\u00f6tzmann. In 1969 and 1970, Breuker was a significant presence at the Free Jazz Meeting in Baden-Baden, working with Don Cherry&apos;s New Eternal Rhythm Orchestra. During the 1970s, he founded both the Kollektief and his BVHaast record label, and worked as a sideman with a group led by the pianist Leo Cuypers, also a Kollektief member. BVHaast documented Breuker&apos;s own work and that of many of his jazz and contemporary-music compatriots, and some key figures from the world of electronica. In 1977 he began to organise the annual five-day Klap op de Vuurpijl (Top It All) festival in Amsterdam. In parallel with this jazz-improv world, and often entwined with it, the restless Breuker was also working in music-theatre, frequently collaborating with the playwright Lodewijk de Boer at Amsterdam&apos;s adventurous Theaterunie. After the formation of the Kollektief, the saxophonist and his cohorts frequently appeared in both musical and acting roles. Breuker also began working for the Baal theatre company, writing music for the Brecht play of the same name, and for Brecht&apos;s Drums in the Night. He also composed for films directed by Johan van der Keuken. He was invited by Yo-Yo Ma to write a work for cello and jazz band, which was performed by the cellist and the Kollektief on a live TV broadcast in 1992. In 1996 he wrote the oratorio Psalm 122 for the Kollektief, the Mondriaan Strings, the Nieuwe Muziek Chorus and a barrel organ. Breuker chaired the Dutch Jazz and Improvised Music Foundation, programmed and directed the ambitious Dutch Music Days 2003 festival in Utrecht, and was a crucial figure in public funding for new music. He had been immersed in musical education since the 60s, convinced by improvisation&apos;s potential as an enriching educational experience, and was always open and encouraging of his students&apos; ideas; the Kollektief ran educational workshops worldwide. Breuker won many prizes. He was named Ridder in de Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw (Holland&apos;s knighthood) in 1998. Despite ill-health, he remained constantly in search of new musical ideas, collaborating with the music historian Val Wilmer on a compilation paying tribute to the overlooked composer Reginald Foresythe; exploring crossovers with Turkish musicians; composing the two-hour oratorio Jonah for choir, Kollektief, string orchestra and solo vocalists in 2003; and making his 15th and 16th Kollektief tours to the US and Canada. The Kollektief&apos;s public subsidy was cut without warning in 2008. Breuker spent his last years witnessing what he considered the final evaporation of\u00a0attitudes that had nourished his work in the 1960s and 70s, and regretting &quot;a new generation of conservatoire students making music the same as 50 years ago&quot;. But Breuker&apos;s prolific output, boundless energy and optimism leaves an incandescent inspiration for future generations of contrarians like him, the recurrent cultural force he called &quot;musicians as warriors&quot;.

Howell also declined the world junior (under-20) championship which starts on Monday in Poland, a contest where he was close to the gold medal in 2008.

Tom McCarthy, its author, is a 41-year-old Londoner who went to Dulwich College and studied English at Oxford when the literary theory boom was at its height. After spending time in Prague and Amsterdam, he surfaced in 1999 as the general secretary of the International Necronautical Society, a semi-fictitious avant-garde group co-masterminded by the philosopher Simon Critchley, and began to stage events at such venues as the ICA. His first novel, Remainder (2005), later described by Zadie Smith as &quot;one of the great English novels of the past 10 years&quot;, was originally put out by a Paris-based art publisher, and though another novel, Men in Space (2007), and a book on Tintin soon followed, he was more of a figure on the gallery circuit than in the literary world until Remainder&apos;s reputation began to mushroom. In articles, lectures and interviews, McCarthy speaks the language of post-humanism. His allegiance is to James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, the French nouveau roman and post-structuralist modes of thought; with a few exceptions, such as William Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon, most English-language writing since modernism&apos;s heyday can be written off as naive, reactionary stuff. It&apos;s bracing and fun to see these views being aired in a stubbornly non-modernistic literary culture. But McCarthy&apos;s art world affiliations, and the rather arts-institutional intellectual currency he trades in, also raise the suspicion that his end product might turn out to be a bit pretentious, in the style of Deleuze-loving architecture theorists or Lacan-quoting gallery notes. This suspicion isn&apos;t totally off the mark, yet McCarthy is a talented and intelligent novelist; however pretension-prone the scene he&apos;s interested in might be, his writing is tight and lucid, and he has a functioning sense of humour. C is a 1960s-style anti-novel that&apos;s fundamentally hostile to the notion of character and dramatises, or encodes, a set of ideas concerning subjectivity. On the face of it, though, it&apos;s a historical fantasy, sometimes witty and sometimes eerie, built around the early years of radio transmission. The central figure, Serge Carrefax, is born in 1898 on an estate named Versoie in southern England. His father, an eccentric inventor, oversees a school for deaf children; his mother, who is deaf and was once the father&apos;s pupil, manufactures silk. Serge and his older sister, Sophie, grow up surrounded by transmitters and insects; Serge gets the wireless bug, while Sophie develops an interest in natural history. Time passes, punctuated by their father&apos;s elaborate school plays, pageants based on Elizabethan translations of Ovid. Then, after her initiation into adult sexuality, Sophie starts channelling cryptic messages. With the first world war looming, she drinks a glass of cyanide. Sophie&apos;s death and interment hang heavily over Serge&apos;s subsequent career in a way that&apos;s far from being conventionally novelistic. Though he&apos;s sent to a spa town in central Europe to be treated for &quot;black bile&quot;, Serge doesn&apos;t do much in the way of emoting, being more interested in precise spatial perceptions and the feelings he gets from dialling through radio frequencies. Under the influence of his godfather, a jovially sinister cryptographer named Widsun, he heads off to the war as a wireless operator in spotter planes over the front \u2013 an experience he enjoys in a Futurist kind of way. Having acquired a taste for cocaine and heroin, he turns up next in interwar London, studying architecture and tangling with flappers and fraudulent spiritualists. Finally, in 1922 (a key year in the history of literary modernism), he&apos;s sent to Egypt to help set up a world-spanning imperial communications network, a task that takes him to an archaeological dig where McCarthy dispenses a few of the keys to what is, by this stage, an immense symbolic superstructure. Needless to say, Serge isn&apos;t a rounded character. He himself has trouble getting to grips with perspective; at one point someone studies his features &quot;as though trying to draw their flat inscrutability out into some kind of relief&quot;. Like the narrator of Remainder, he&apos;s projected as a blank everyman, with a blokey, quizzical attitude to high-flown statements. But while he isn&apos;t an arty or intellectual figure, everything around him bursts with both qualities, from the novel&apos;s multivalently punning nomenclature to the micro-organised threads of imagery and argument involving Greek myth, Renaissance verse, geometry, earth and insects (these last, as in Finnegans Wake, playing on &quot;incest&quot;). Though Serge holds the foreground, it&apos;s plain from early on that the novel is chiefly structured by the idea of transmission and reception, which serves as a metaphor for, among many other things, and very roughly speaking, an implied relationship between language, technology and subjectivity. The near-Joycean scale and density of all this is truly impressive, as is McCarthy&apos;s ability to fold it into a cleanly constructed narrative, which has its boring stretches but also moments of humour and weird beauty. Yet its mind-blowingness as a reading experience depends on the reader&apos;s appetite for certain types of analysis. Armed with various concepts from Heidegger, Freud or Paul Virilio, say, it would be possible to unpick its implications more or less indefinitely, but there&apos;s a dispiriting feeling that the book has been reverse-engineered with an eye to achieving just that. On\u00a0the other hand, Sophie&apos;s death, which is partly an allegory for lost philosophical certainties, can also be read as taking on an emotional weight that goes against the grain of the novel&apos;s ostensible scorn for squishy psychologising. &quot;Will he turn out,&quot; McCarthy asked recently of the French writer Jean-Philippe Toussaint, &quot;to have been deconstructing literary sentimentalism or sentimentalising literary deconstruction?&quot; It&apos;s a sign of his writerly horse sense that this skilfully realised, ambitious, over-literary book finds the time to leave a similar question hanging.", "sentences": ["After spending time in Prague and Amsterdam, he surfaced in 1999 as the general secretary of the International Necronautical Society, a semi-fictitious avant-garde group co-masterminded by the philosopher Simon Critchley, and began to stage events at such venues as the ICA."], "title": "C by Tom McCarthy | Book review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/31/c-tom-mccarthy-novel-review", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Tom McCarthy", "C"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-31T20:05:51Z", "article": "Foreign, suave, expensive, a disciplinarian with excellent credentials \u2013 sound familiar? No, it&apos;s not Fabio Capello, but UK Athletics&apos; head coach Charles van Commenee. Athletics&apos; first foray into the world of foreign coaches is paying dividends as Van Commenee has so far managed to pull off what Capello has not. The Dutchman has been in charge for 18 months and is making a happy habit of exceeding his targets. At the European Championships in Barcelona, Britain went into the weekend well on course to surpass their target of 10-15 medals. At the World Championships in Berlin last year, there were six medals, one more than expected by Van Commenee&apos;s assessors and the best performance since 1993 by individual British athletes. While other Olympic sports are fretting about funding cuts and performance targets, athletics \u2013 a sport that suffered so badly after the decline of the so-called &apos;golden generation&apos; \u2013 is cruising along nicely, with the added bonus of assurances from UK Sport that their performance budget is to be ringfenced. So how does he do it? Van Commenee was dubbed the &quot;Volcano&quot; by Denise Lewis, whom he coached to heptathlon Olympic gold in 2000. The 52 year-old has a reputation for losing his temper: he labelled another of his athletes, Kelly Sotherton, a &quot;wimp&quot; after she won bronze at the Athens Olympics in 2004. The Van Commenee of today has retained some of that fire but, more importantly, he has fine-tuned his judgement, as results in Barcelona have demonstrated. A string of athletes will travel home with medals after years of inconsistent performances and unfulfilled potential. Mark Lewis-Francis, a serial underachiever, failed to make the selection criteria for the 100m but, having spotted something in training, van Commenee belatedly hauled him into the individual event and the 27-year-old claimed the silver medal. Martyn Bernard had not made the &apos;A&apos; standard for the championships, but, again, Van Commenee felt the high jumper was on an upward trajectory and invited him to compete. Bernard took the bronze medal with a season&apos;s best performance. Andy Turner, the 29-year-old who won his first gold in the 110m hurdles, lost his lottery funding last year. The hurdler had flopped badly at the World Championships last summer, failing to get past the heats, but Van Commenee took a gamble on his potential and this week he blossomed. Christian Malcolm, 31, and Chris Thompson, 29, won silver medals after many barren years of injury. Van Commenee&apos;s judgment works like this: he comes down like a ton of bricks on anyone who does not do as he says, but intuitively acquiesces to the needs of those for whom conforming brings scant reward. So while he forced Bernard to relocate from Liverpool to London \u2013 threatening to cut off all funding unless he did so \u2013 he allowed Phillips Idowu to amble along in his unconventional way, dodging his pre-championship media duties, but still coming up trumps with triple jump gold. His understanding of personalities, and how to deal with them, perhaps stems from his time as a social worker in Amsterdam working with young people struggling with poverty, drugs and crime. Certainly, he seems as interested in humanity as he is in performance targets: he lists one of his greatest achievements as teaching Chinese shot-putter Huang Zhihong how to cook rice. Unafraid of controversy, he invited Linford Christie \u2013 publicly rejected by the 2012 Olympic bid team because of his positive test for nandrolone in 1999 \u2013 to give a team talk to the troops. Similarly, and in contrast to his predecessors, Van Commenee has embraced Dwain Chambers in the team, despite his two-year suspension for performance enhancing drugs in 2003. Van Commenee, who was chef de mission for the Dutch Olympic team two years ago, has become renowned for his motivational team talks. In Barcelona he recalled being kicked out of the Olympic village as a young coach in a talk entitled &quot;How To Be Remembered For The Right Reasons&quot;. He has railed against overweight athletes, he banned the words &quot;injury problems&quot; and &quot;niggles&quot; from last year&apos;s World Championships \u2013 he did not want the British public to see his athletes as &quot;a bunch of pussies and wankers&quot; \u2013 and he has personally monitored individual athletes in training. Everyone in the British team is accountable to the Dutchman. All the above would usually make for an unpopular coach. Capello was nobody&apos;s favourite among the England players when he banned beer and mobile phones at dinner time. But every medal-winning athlete at these championships has praised Van Commenee&apos;s tough stance, and the sense of camaraderie within the team seems strong. At the training camp in Monte Gordo, high jump coach Fuzz Ahmed secretly smuggled in a crateload of mock Charles van Commenee spectacles for everyone to wear in the team photo. Even among the coaches, it seems, he has found equilibrium. Van Commenee initially upset the coaching staff as he made several dismissals and brought in new faces, as well as centralising operations which affected regional arrangements \u2013 such as Jessica Ennis&apos;s training base in Sheffield. The heptathlete&apos;s coach Toni Minichiello spoke out against the decision last year, but even he appears to have come round to Van Commenee&apos;s way of thinking, and was photographed laughing and joking with him in the Montjuic stadium, sporting replica Van Commenee glasses. While all eyes are on 2012, Van Commenee is thinking longer term and has not resorted to plundering the junior stocks to plug holes in the seniors. Two weeks ago he let 16-year-old Jodie Williams, Britain&apos;s most exciting young sprinting talent in years, compete at the World Junior Championships in Canada instead of travelling to Barcelona with the seniors. The juniors produced the best British performance since 1994. Few of them will be developed enough to win medals at the London Olympics, but they should ensure a positive future for the sport long after the comedy spectacles are packed away.", "sentences": ["His understanding of personalities, and how to deal with them, perhaps stems from his time as a social worker in Amsterdam working with young people struggling with poverty, drugs and crime."], "title": "Charles van Commenee shows Fabio Capello how to succeed with tough love | Anna Kessel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jul/31/charles-van-commenee-european-athletics-championships", "tags": ["European Athletics Championships", "Athletics", "Sport", "Charles van Commenee"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-31T23:03:52Z", "article": "When Tom McCarthy arrives in the cafe, the first thing he says is that he met me outside earlier. There&apos;s a moment of confusion. &quot;Whenever I have a blind meeting,&quot; he explains, &quot;it seems to start with me introducing myself to the wrong person.&quot; It&apos;s an appropriate curse for a writer whose books are filled with coincidence, with doubles and fakes, moments of deja vu, repetitions of repetitions. I picture pairs of journalist doppelgangers trailing him across London, recording in stereo. Fakes and simulacra appeal to McCarthy in his various guises as artist, critic and novelist. There is, for instance, the &quot;Joint Statement on Inauthenticity&quot; published by the International Necronautical Society (INS): the semi-fictional, quasi-totalitarian conceptual art collective that McCarthy founded in 1999 with a pastiche manifesto in the Times. &quot;All cults of authenticity,&quot; it declares, &quot;should be abandoned.&quot; Then there&apos;s the novel that launched his literary career, the bestselling, critically lauded Remainder, in which an accidentally traumatised narrator feeds his neuroses by spending his compensation money on re-creating scenes from his own imperfect memory, complete with actors and extras. With a publicity boost from Zadie Smith, who described Remainder as &quot;one of the great English novels of the last 10 years&quot;, McCarthy&apos;s reputation went global. His Tintin and the Secret of Literature wasn&apos;t just a quirky critical take on Herg\u00e9, but an ingenious demonstration of how good literature tunes in to the encrypted channels of culture, the &quot;illicit frequencies&quot; over which society whispers its secrets. A second novel, Men in Space, explored the disintegration of eastern Europe, the decaying orbit of a stranded ex-Soviet cosmonaut and the forgery of a medieval icon painting. And now there is McCarthy&apos;s new book, C (published by Jonathan Cape this week and longlisted for the Booker prize), a layered, deceptive tour through early 20th-century modernity, taking in radio, war, encryption, paranoia, sex and death. Serge Carrefax, its main character, is born to\u00a0the sound of his father&apos;s experimental wireless apparatus, tuned in to the electric hum of the new, invisible network. &quot;It&apos;s the great period of emergent technology,&quot; McCarthy explains. &quot;The book is set between 1898 \u2013 when Marconi was doing some of his earliest experiments \u2013 and 1922, which is the year the BBC was founded, and also the great year of modernism: The Waste Land and Ulysses. I wanted C to be a kind of archaeology of literature. But I think all &apos;proper&apos; literature always has been an archaeology of other literature. The task for contemporary literature is to deal with the legacy of modernism. I&apos;m not trying to be modernist, but to navigate the wreckage of that project.&quot; In C, archaeology is both method and material. The book, he says, grew out of research on Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon, the discoverers of Tutankhamun. Excavating the records led McCarthy to a series of strange coincidences that he traced through literary history, from Nabokov to the Egyptologists, and from Freud&apos;s case history of Sergei Pankejeff (the &quot;Wolf Man&quot;) to Marconi and Alexander Graham Bell. &quot;It&apos;s not a critical mapping out of territory,&quot; he insists, &quot;just that these things \u2013 radio technology, crypts, silk, dead siblings \u2013 kept coming back.&quot; I suggest that repetition seems to be part of his writing process, as well as a concern within the books themselves. &quot;Totally. If things keep coming back, you just think: &apos;There&apos;s an avenue here.&apos; If you look all the way back to Antigone, it&apos;s the same: dead siblings, crypts. And you realise this is a kind of fault line in western literature. I just wanted to explore it.&quot; Born in 1969, McCarthy grew up in London before studying English at Oxford, where he threw himself into theory and philosophy. Later, after spells in Prague and Amsterdam, he gravitated towards an art world that was doing more interesting things than the literary scene. The International Necronautical Society grew out of an interest in art manifestos and avant-garde movements. &quot;It&apos;s Kafka,&quot; he enthuses. &quot;It&apos;s Soviet. It&apos;s great. It&apos;s kind of corporate in a way, the way these groups would have second sub-committees into this or that.&quot; Is it true, I ask, that he once threw out two Necronauts for working with commercial publishers? &quot;I think I threw out four,&quot; he laughs \u2013 then looks uncomfortable. &quot;Well, the executive council did \u2013 which is not identical with me. I think, actually, the wording of the expulsion was that they had written what they had been told to write. It caused some grief. But at the same time, culture matters, and if you&apos;re not serious, you might as well be sitting in the Groucho club, going &apos;Loved your expulsion of me, darling.&apos;&quot; There&apos;s no question that McCarthy takes his work seriously: his knowledge\u00a0of cultural history is eclectic and thorough, zapping from\u00a0Marinetti&apos;s The\u00a0Futurist Manifesto\u00a0to Wilde, Proust,\u00a0Ovid and Jean Cocteau. I wonder what he thinks of the relationship between today&apos;s mainstream literary fiction and\u00a0more\u00a0avant-garde writing. &quot;The avant garde can&apos;t be ignored, so to ignore it \u2013 as most humanist British novelists do \u2013 is the equivalent of ignoring Darwin. Then you&apos;re just a creationist. It&apos;s ostrich-like. It needs to be worked through \u2013 which is not the same thing as imitation.&quot; But he flinches from applying the &quot;experimental&quot; tag to his work. &quot;People use that term when what they actually mean is &apos;not conforming to a certain type of realism&apos;, and that&apos;s just as much a literary convention as anything else. Burroughs said his &apos;cut-up&apos; writing was more realistic than Jane Austen. I think he was right. You&apos;re being assailed by associations and networks. Everything is a code, and that&apos;s why I have no qualms about deploying a type of realism as one of the frames in C.&quot; The multiplication of those frames gives the novel an intriguing complexity. Bildungsroman, war memoir, Freudian case study: C brilliantly re-encrypts the history of Edwardian and Georgian England in its own intricate cipher text, overlaying sets of symbolic codes drawn from the cultural artefacts and anxieties of the time. &quot;You have to look at all of this,&quot; as a character says in the novel, &quot;at all these histories of looking.&quot; &quot;If you think of the most canonical works of English literature,&quot; McCarthy points out, &quot;they&apos;re incredibly experimental. Someone called Remainder an &apos;anti-novel&apos;, but then what&apos;s Hamlet? It refuses at every level the genre that it buys into. Or take FR Leavis drawing up his Great Tradition: he has to exclude Tristram Shandy, the most prominent novel in English history at the time. It&apos;s like drawing up a history of football and excluding Pel\u00e9 and Maradona and Zidane! It&apos;s absurd.&quot; My time with the general secretary of the INS is almost up. Before I leave, I ask whether he&apos;s started work on anything new. Have any coincidences piqued his interest? Are the chains of associations leading anywhere? &quot;I&apos;m just beginning a new novel, called Satin Island. It&apos;ll take another two or three years to write.&quot; He raises an eyebrow. &quot;It opens with a huge oil slick. I started it about three months ago: nothing to do with Louisiana. It&apos;s just...&quot; \u2013 and here McCarthy looks as though he can&apos;t quite believe his luck \u2013 &quot;what I was thinking about at the time.&quot;", "sentences": ["Later, after spells in Prague and Amsterdam, he gravitated towards an art world that was doing more interesting things than the literary scene."], "title": "Tom McCarthy: 'To ignore the avant garde is akin to ignoring Darwin' | Interview", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/01/tom-mccarthy-c-james-purdon", "tags": ["Tom McCarthy", "Books", "Culture", "C"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-07-31T23:05:59Z", "article": "In a brilliant observation, Philip Roth once described Anne Frank as Kafka&apos;s &quot;lost little daughter&quot;. Frank&apos;s diary of her sequestration in the secret annexe of 263 Prinsengracht in Amsterdam is surely one of the most compelling documents of 20th-century European history, a heartbreaking, at times uplifting, record of a young life scorched and then exterminated by the Nazis. But the title is misleading. Yes, it was first a diary, a teenage girl&apos;s response to extraordinary and terrifying day-to-day events. On closer examination, however, the back story of the &quot;diary&quot; and its composition reveals neither a wordstruck ingenue nor an impetuous adolescent scribbler but a precocious young writer at pains to create a work of art. Such is the argument of an absorbing new study by the American critic Francine Prose \u2013 Anne Frank: The Book, the Life, the Afterlife (Atlantic \u00a316.99, pp336). Prose explores how the book that began as Het Achterhuis (&quot;the house behind&quot;) went through many drafts in composition, and then several postwar incarnations before it acquired its canonical title, The Diary of Anne Frank \u2013 as a Broadway play. Prose also describes how Frank discovered her vocation as a writer through the experience of confiding her thoughts to a cardboard-bound notebook, and how the text she created has become a touchstone of 21st-century responses to the atrocities of Nazism. It is a measure of Frank&apos;s achievement that her work has inspired the most partisan and obsessive devotion on Broadway and in Hollywood, as well as provoking some of the most ludicrous episodes in the vile catalogue of Holocaust denial. Among those people, it has become commonplace to claim that The Diary of Anne Frank is a forgery. The afterlife of books is one of the mysteries and fascinations of any library. Very many books, especially in this age of overproduction, are little better than Hello! magazine and leave virtually no trace in the sand. There are, however, three kinds of title that linger in the mind, and Anne Frank&apos;s diary has something of each. First, there are what you might call the sacred texts of western civilisation, constantly reread and reinterpreted: for instance, the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, Cervantes and Milton, the novels of Franz Kafka. These are all classics, though not all classics enjoy the same afterlife. Utopia is a classic, but for every 100 people who cheerfully use the word &quot;utopian&quot;, only a handful will be familiar with Thomas More&apos;s text. Second, there are what I will call &quot;zeitgeist books&quot;, volumes of fiction, poetry or ideas whose original appeal is inextricably linked to a moment in history. For instance, Penguin Modern Classics has just reissued John Le Carr\u00e9&apos;s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, a cold-war thriller that, 50 years on, speaks to a new generation of readers, describing a world now almost as remote as Edwardian England. Aldous Huxley&apos;s Brave New World is another zeitgeist book whose afterlife transcends its year of publication (1932). In our own time, Naomi Klein&apos;s No Logo is another zeitgeist book perhaps still too current to have acquired an afterlife. And then, finally, there is that shelf in the library of European masterpieces whose authors, as Francine Prose puts it, &quot;have been forced into a collaboration with misfortune&quot;, books that were made at an unendurably high cost to the writer. Nadezhda Mandelstam&apos;s memoir of Stalin&apos;s terror, Hope Against Hope, is one of these, and so are the works of Primo Levi. As Prose admits, the terrible circumstances of composition must colour our understanding of how good these books actually are, and to what extent they are works of art. But, as she says of Anne Frank, her &quot;unique and beautiful voice is still being heard by readers who may someday be called upon to decide between cruelty and compassion&quot;. If,\u00a0as a result, a government official in Kazakhstan or a secret policeman in Latin America &quot;opts for humanity and chooses life over death&quot;, that will be the vindication\u00a0of a diary, written in an attic, by a 13-year-old Dutch girl in the\u00a01940s. First came the book, now comes the saga...Afghanistan was in the courts last week, and not a mention of Wikileaks. The grinding wheels of Scandinavian justice handed down a verdict against the Norwegian journalist \u00c5sne Seierstad, who published The Bookseller of Kabul as long ago as 2003, provoking the righteous indignation of the eponymous Afghan bookseller Shah Muhammad Rais. The bookseller and his family launched an opportunistic international campaign to discredit her and, more profitably, to extract remuneration from the author in recompense for the alleged violation of the family&apos;s privacy, despite his wholehearted support of the book. Seierstad stoutly resisted these efforts, but last week an Oslo court ruled that she was &quot;negligent&quot; and should pay 250,000 kroner to Suraia Rais. I am delighted to see that Ms Seierstad and her publisher will be appealing this questionable verdict.

Cole has three years to run on his Stamford Bridge contract and he is happy with his football in west London but it is off the field where his problems lie. He feels hounded by the paparazzi in England and unable to live a normal life, having been installed as public enemy No1 in some quarters following his separation from his pop star wife, Cheryl. Cole&apos;s misery has not gone unnoticed at Real where Mourinho, who has maintained a friendship with him and still sends him text messages, is keen to find a new left-back to solve what has been the club&apos;s problem position. Although there has not yet been any approach, Mourinho could be prepared to offer Cole an escape route from his troubles and an exciting new challenge. Ancelotti, the Chelsea manager, had a fractious relationship with Mourinho when the pair where in charge of the rival Milan clubs and his message, in the wake of this friendly defeat in Frankfurt, left no room for grey areas. The Italian even appeared faintly amused as he said that he could keep repeating it for as long as anybody was prepared to listen. &quot;I&apos;m not interested in the relationship my player has with other coaches,&quot; Ancelotti said. &quot;It&apos;s normal that Mourinho has a good relationship with Ashley Cole but nothing has changed in our position. He is a Chelsea player and will remain a Chelsea player. There&apos;s no way he will leave. Everyone can forget that Ashley Cole will leave this club. There is no price. We believe that he&apos;s the best left-back in the world and because of this, he will stay at this club.&quot; Chelsea arrived in Germany yesterday and this was the first opportunity of the pre-season for Ancelotti to play many of his established stars, chief among them the club&apos;s England World Cup contingent of John Terry, Cole and Frank Lampard. There was a quiet debut for the new midfield signing Yossi Benayoun. Terry and Cole played the first 45 minutes, with the former culpable in part for the concession of the opening goal when, having started to shepherd the ball back to the goalkeeper Henrique Hil\u00e1rio, he decided at the last minute and under little pressure to pass it back to him. Hil\u00e1rio, who endured a nightmarish afternoon, was taken by surprise and when he tried to dribble away from Patrick Ochs he was tackled by the Eintracht midfielder. The Chelsea defender Jeffrey Bruma and Ioannis Amanatidis challenged for the loose ball but it broke to Ochs and he lifted it into the empty net. Cole could be pleased with his performance while Lampard, one of eight half-time substitutes, scored the equaliser, after a characteristic burst into the area. Eintracht&apos;s winning goal came after Nemanja Matic grabbed a handful of Marco Russ&apos;s shirt inside the penalty area. Halil Altintop smashed the resulting kick home. Hil\u00e1rio was a worry from the moment he miscued his first clearance and with every subsequent slice or shank, so his confidence appeared to ebb. From his fourth poor clearance in the 33rd minute Eintracht almost scored again through Theofanis Gekas, only for Hil\u00e1rio to save with his feet. He was also bailed out by Ricardo Carvalho in the 85th minute after having a clearance charged down. In the wake of the third\u2011choice goalkeeper Ross Turnbull&apos;s errors in the defeat to Ajax in Amsterdam last Friday, Ancelotti has to hope that Petr Cech, his No1, can continue his swift recovery from a torn calf muscle. Ancelotti believes that he will be fit for the opening Premier League fixture at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday week and possibly the Community Shield against Manchester United next Sunday. &quot;We had some problems with goalkeepers but it can happen at this moment of the season,&quot; Ancelotti said. &quot;We have to maintain trust in these goalkeepers. For other players, it was the first game [of pre-season] and they problems. They are not fit.&quot; Deco has not travelled with the Chelsea squad \u2013 the midfielder has been heavily linked with a return to Fluminese in his native Brazil \u2013 but Ancelotti said that he had stayed in London to recuperate from an unspecified injury, together with Cech, Alex and Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa. Didier Drogba, who has undergone minor groin surgery, is here in Germany and Ancelotti said that he could play against Hamburg on Wednesday. &quot;Drogba has improved very quickly. When we get back to London, Alex can train with us. We have to wait for Bosingwa.&quot; The game was played on a dreadful surface \u2013 the Eintracht manager, Michael Skibbe,was moved to apologise for its condition; an American football tournament played on it in recent days has taken a heavy toll \u2013 and Ancelotti was also unhappy that the controversial World Cup ball, the Adidas Jabulani, was used. &quot;It was difficult to play because the pitch was not good,&quot; he said. &quot;And we&apos;re not used to this ball.

This follows the disclosure in the Guardian that a series of unusual civilian shootings involving two British army units, are documented in last week&apos;s WikiLeaks publication of thousands of leaked US military files. A formal letter was sent to the defence secretary, Liam Fox, at the weekend by a lawyer, Phil Shiner, on behalf of the peace campaigner Maya Evans. Shiner said: &quot;I am sure we will be able to get this into court.&quot; The campaigners say the killings &quot;require to be investigated as suspected war crimes&quot; under the legislation that set up the international criminal court. They call on the MoD to conduct a proper investigation of the allegations. Since the details of civilian shootings recorded in the war logs were revealed, MoD officials have not disputed their general accuracy, but ministers have failed to give any explanation, or order any public investigation. Shiner told Fox the documents reproduced in the Guardian &quot;Identify ... the killing of at least 26 civilians and the wounding of a further 20 by British forces&quot;. This is a relatively small fraction of the hundreds of civilian killings admitted to by US forces in the course of filing war logs which were later leaked. Most British units barely figure in the civilian casualty reports collected in the field by US intelligence. But two detachments of UK soldiers figure repeatedly, and it is unclear whether this exceptional pattern was ever fully investigated. One US soldier reported in Kabul that they could not obtain the full story of a shooting because &quot;the investigation is controlled by the British&quot;. The US field reports detail a series of four shootings of individual innocent civilians in the streets of Kabul, during the space of little more than a month in 2007, at a time when the Coldstream Guards were newly patrolling the capital. The incidents culminated in the death of an Afghan general&apos;s son. In the US documents it is alleged that the following year saw a six-month period in which Royal Marine commando units took a regular toll on innocent motorists, shooting innocent drivers and motorcyclists on eight occasions for approaching too close to convoys. Earlier this year, in separate proceedings, the high court gave permission for a judicial review of the government&apos;s failure to hold a public inquiry into the British army&apos;s detention policies in Iraq, amid allegations that large numbers of civilians were tortured. The court said it could be argued that &quot;the alleged ill-treatment was systemic, and not just at the whim of individual soldiers&quot;. It criticised the effectiveness of MoD proposals to investigate the claims. Meanwhile, US army investigators seeking to trace the source of the massive trove of leaked logs have been questioning people with links to WikiLeaks, as well as the US army intelligence analyst arrested in May on charges relating to an earlier military leak. Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, further upped the war of words against the WikiLeaks website when he told ABC News: &quot;There&apos;s a moral culpability. And that&apos;s where I think the verdict is &apos;guilty&apos; on WikiLeaks. They have put this out withou t any regard whatsoever for the consequences.&quot; Investigators are fanning out across Boston, interviewing students and associates of Bradley Manning, the intelligence analyst accused of leaking a video of a US helicopter attack in Baghdad which was posted by WikiLeaks. Manning has not been charged with any offences connected with the Afghan war logs, but he continues to be held at the Quantico marine base in Virginia. A computer expert in the Boston area told The Boston Globe today that he had been approached by US military officials. Several other computer experts and hackers have also been interviewed anonymously, according to the New York Times and Washington Post. A further extension of the inquiry into the leak came when Jacob Appelbaum, a specialist in internet privacy protection based in Seattle, was detained at Newark airport in New Jersey having returned to the US from Amsterdam. Appelbaum, who has connections with WikiLeaks and has stood in for its founder, Julian Assange, at hacker conferences, had his laptop and three mobile phones seized. According to Cnet, he was questioned for three hours about WikiLeaks and the whereabouts of Assange, as well as about his views on the Iraq and Afghan wars. Appelbaum declined to answer any of the questions without a lawyer present.

You get some of that with Teengirl Fantasy. It&apos;s dream-disco featuring washed-out synths and samples doused in static and fuzz, with a heady aura about it of glo-fi and the hypnagogic pop of early Ariel Pink. TGF have done a version of the classic R&amp;B ballad from 1978, Love Don&apos;t Live Here Anymore, which is less a cover and more an opportunity to explore memories of the song, examining the nature of nostalgia, via a snippet, smothered in interference, of the chorus from the Rose Royce original. There is the sense that Teengirl Fantasy are about evoking half-remembered thoughts of pop songs past from the title of another of their tracks, NowThat&apos;sWhatICallVol2: much of their music feels like a hazy assembly of chart hits that come to us in snatches last thing at night or first thing in the morning. Dancing in Slow Motion, from their forthcoming debut album 7am (another redolent title, confirming the idea of music drifting into your semi-conscious mind), is like a half-remembered dream of a 90s R&amp;B tune, while Make the Move is based on a loop, distorted through overuse, of an 80s dance act such as Kleeer. Cheaters is like trying to get to sleep and hearing stereos from houses on either side of your bedroom, one playing gospel, the other playing trance. Forever the Feeling has a similar effect, only this time it sounds as though it&apos;s Fleetwood Mac and Fennesz ever so pleasantly doing your head in. Wake us up before you hypnago-go.

My group of 10 is planning to do about 180 miles over four days, which I thought sounded totally doable, based on the fact that I easily cycled about 20 miles a day for a week around Sweden a couple of years ago. To test my fitness, last weekend we went for a training ride from London to Brighton. I&apos;d heard it was a bit hilly, but lots of people who don&apos;t seem especially fit seem to have done it easily enough in about seven hours. However, we took a different route to the usual one and discovered some evil hills. I&apos;d seriously underestimated the fitness required for all these, and had to hold back the tears a couple of times. Now, I&apos;ve gone from being slightly cocky about our European jaunt to a state of mild panic. The plan is to cycle about 70 miles from London to Harwich on the first day, get the ferry to the Hook of Holland and then go via the Hague to stay the night in Rotterdam, before heading to Utrecht the next night. On the final day, we aim to do about 40 or so miles to finish in Amsterdam. We want to know the nicest and flattest route, particularly from London to Harwich. But is there one? I&apos;ve heard that it can be a bit undulating, but am praying that won&apos;t be the case. Is 73 miles possible in one day at about 10mph? Obviously we are spreading our distance, unlike the overnight Dunwich Dynamo riders who offered some good tips on this blog last week. But I&apos;ve heard that getting back in the saddle after doing a couple of long days can be painful in many senses of the word. How do people keep going? I&apos;m assuming it will be largely flat once we get out of the UK, but is that actually the case? Are there any bits to avoid? Should we be worried about this prevailing wind I&apos;ve been warned about? I also really need to know if there&apos;s any way to become hill-fit quickly, without actually crawling up hill after hill. I might try spinning classes. In truth, I am too fat to pedal my own weight, plus a bike, up a hill. I will shortly be consulting my new blogging friend, the fat cyclist, for tips. What do I need kit-wise? I haven&apos;t got anything fancy to wear, but I&apos;d like some affordable cycling tops, provided they&apos;re not in hideous pastel shades Perhaps the folks at the RidingPretty blog can help me look the part? What about insurance? Any ideas on the best and cheapest for taking bikes abroad? Policies sometime offer cover for sports equipment, but does that include bikes?

Speaking with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, and surrounded by religious leaders from the city, Bloomberg upheld the proposed mosque as an example of the religious tolerance that made New York famous, reminding his audience that Jews, Quakers and Catholics had all suffered religious discrimination within the city in the past. &quot;The World Trade Centre site will forever hold a special place in our city, in our hearts,&quot; said Bloomberg, who at times appeared close to tears. &quot;But we would be untrue to the best part of ourselves \u2013 and who we are as New Yorkers and Americans \u2013 if we said no to a mosque in lower Manhattan.&quot; Saying that he hoped the new mosque would bring the city closer together, he finished by declaring: &quot;Political controversies come and go, but our values and our traditions endure \u2013 and there is no neighborhood in this city that is off limits to God&apos;s love and mercy.&quot; The full text of Bloomberg&apos;s speech follows \u2013 and it is well worth reading.Mayor Michael Bloomberg&apos;s remarks as delivered on Governors Island: &quot;We have come here to Governors Island to stand where the earliest settlers first set foot in New Amsterdam, and where the seeds of religious tolerance were first planted. We&apos;ve come here to see the inspiring symbol of liberty that, more than 250 years later, would greet millions of immigrants in the harbor, and we come here to state as strongly as ever \u2013 this is the freest city in the world. That&apos;s what makes New York special and different and strong. &quot;Our doors are open to everyone \u2013 everyone with a dream and a willingness to work hard and play by the rules. New York City was built by immigrants, and it is sustained by immigrants \u2013 by people from more than a hundred different countries speaking more than two hundred different languages and professing every faith. And whether your parents were born here, or you came yesterday, you are a New Yorker. &quot;We may not always agree with every one of our neighbors. That&apos;s life and it&apos;s part of living in such a diverse and dense city. But we also recognise that part of being a New Yorker is living with your neighbors in mutual respect and tolerance. It was exactly that spirit of openness and acceptance that was attacked on 9/11.  &quot;On that day, 3,000 people were killed because some murderous fanatics didn&apos;t want us to enjoy the freedom to profess our own faiths, to speak our own minds, to follow our own dreams and to live our own lives. &quot;Of all our precious freedoms, the most important may be the freedom to worship as we wish. And it is a freedom that, even here in a city that is rooted in Dutch tolerance, was hard-won over many years. In the mid-1650s, the small Jewish community living in lower Manhattan petitioned Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant for the right to build a synagogue \u2013 and they were turned down. &quot;In 1657, when Stuyvesant also prohibited Quakers from holding meetings, a group of non-Quakers in Queens signed the Flushing Remonstrance, a petition in defense of the right of Quakers and others to freely practice their religion. It was perhaps the first formal, political petition for religious freedom in the American colonies \u2013 and the organiser was thrown in jail and then banished from New Amsterdam. &quot;In the 1700s, even as religious freedom took hold in America, Catholics in New York were effectively prohibited from practicing their religion \u2013 and priests could be arrested. Largely as a result, the first Catholic parish in New York City was not established until the 1780&apos;s \u2013 St Peter&apos;s on Barclay Street, which still stands just one block north of the World Trade Centre site and one block south of the proposed mosque and community centre. &quot;This morning, the city&apos;s Landmark Preservation Commission unanimously voted not to extend landmark status to the building on Park Place where the mosque and community centre are planned. The decision was based solely on the fact that there was little architectural significance to the building. But with or without landmark designation, there is nothing in the law that would prevent the owners from opening a mosque within the existing building. The simple fact is this building is private property, and the owners have a right to use the building as a house of worship. &quot;The government has no right whatsoever to deny that right \u2013 and if it were tried, the courts would almost certainly strike it down as a violation of the US Constitution. Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question \u2013 should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion? That may happen in other countries, but we should never allow it to happen here. This nation was founded on the principle that the government must never choose between religions, or favor one over another. &quot;The World Trade Centre Site will forever hold a special place in our City, in our hearts. But we would be untrue to the best part of ourselves \u2013 and who we are as New Yorkers and Americans \u2013 if we said &apos;no&apos; to a mosque in lower Manhattan. &quot;Let us not forget that Muslims were among those murdered on 9/11 and that our Muslim neighbors grieved with us as New Yorkers and as Americans. We would betray our values \u2013 and play into our enemies&apos; hands \u2013 if we were to treat Muslims differently than anyone else. In fact, to cave to popular sentiment would be to hand a victory to the terrorists \u2013 and we should not stand for that. &quot;For that reason, I believe that this is an important test of the separation of church and state as we may see in our lifetime \u2013 as important a test \u2013 and it is critically important that we get it right. &quot;On September 11, 2001, thousands of first responders heroically rushed to the scene and saved tens of thousands of lives. More than 400 of those first responders did not make it out alive. In rushing into those burning buildings, not one of them asked &apos;What God do you pray to?&apos; &apos;What beliefs do you hold?&apos; &quot;The attack was an act of war \u2013 and our first responders defended not only our city but also our country and our Constitution. We do not honour their lives by denying the very Constitutional rights they died protecting. We honour their lives by defending those rights \u2013 and the freedoms that the terrorists attacked. &quot;Of course, it is fair to ask the organisers of the mosque to show some special sensitivity to the situation \u2013 and in fact, their plan envisions reaching beyond their walls and building an interfaith community. By doing so, it is my hope that the mosque will help to bring our city even closer together and help repudiate the false and repugnant idea that the attacks of 9/11 were in any way consistent with Islam. Muslims are as much a part of our city and our country as the people of any faith and they are as welcome to worship in lower Manhattan as any other group. In fact, they have been worshipping at the site for the better part of a year, as is their right. &quot;The local community board in lower Manhattan voted overwhelming to support the proposal and if it moves forward, I expect the community centre and mosque will add to the life and vitality of the neighbourhood and the entire city. &quot;Political controversies come and go, but our values and our traditions endure \u2013 and there is no neighborhood in this city that is off limits to God&apos;s love and mercy, as the religious leaders here with us today can attest.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;But we would be untrue to the best part of ourselves \u2013 and who we are as New Yorkers and Americans \u2013 if we said no to a mosque in lower Manhattan.&quot; Saying that he hoped the new mosque would bring the city closer together, he finished by declaring: &quot;Political controversies come and go, but our values and our traditions endure \u2013 and there is no neighborhood in this city that is off limits to God&apos;s love and mercy.&quot; The full text of Bloomberg&apos;s speech follows \u2013 and it is well worth reading.Mayor Michael Bloomberg&apos;s remarks as delivered on Governors Island: &quot;We have come here to Governors Island to stand where the earliest settlers first set foot in New Amsterdam, and where the seeds of religious tolerance were first planted.", "It was perhaps the first formal, political petition for religious freedom in the American colonies \u2013 and the organiser was thrown in jail and then banished from New Amsterdam."], "title": "Bloomberg defends mosque as a symbol of New York's tolerance | Richard Adams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/aug/03/michael-bloomberg-ground-zero-mosque", "tags": ["Michael Bloomberg", "New York", "Islam", "Religion", "September 11 2001", "US news", "World news", "Ground Zero"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-04T11:42:09Z", "article": "Census of Marine Life \u2022 Scientists plumb the depths to ask how many fish in the sea\u2022 How did they count all the fish in the sea?\u2022 In pictures: The world&apos;s underwater creatures\u2022 Map: First global census of marine lifeFirst global census of marine life logs 230,000 species \u2013 but the 10-year study by 360 scientists warns of mass extinctions.

For others, it evokes that of his older brother, Herman J, most celebrated as the writer of the screenplay of Citizen Kane. However, Joseph L&apos;s son, Tom Mankiewicz, who has died of cancer aged 68, is cherished by James Bond fans as the screenwriter of Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man With the Golden Gun (1974), as well as having worked on rewrites of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979).     Tom Mankiewicz    At the beginning of his career, Mankiewicz admitted that he probably got work because of his father. &quot;You suddenly started to realise that people were asking you because it was you,&quot; he explained. Unlike his father&apos;s best films \u2013 literate, dialogue-based vehicles \u2013 when a director called &quot;action&quot; on a\u00a0Tom Mankiewicz-scripted movie, he\u00a0really meant it. He was born in Los Angeles, where his father was an MGM producer before becoming the Oscar-winning director of Letter to Three Wives (1949) and All About Eve. (His mother, the Austrian-born actor Rose Stradner, killed herself when Tom was 16.) It\u00a0seemed natural that the boy should follow the family tradition, so he majored in drama at Yale University. Before graduation, aged 18, he worked as production assistant on The Comancheros (1961), a\u00a0western starring John Wayne. In 1964 he was credited as production associate on The Best Man, Gore Vidal&apos;s sharp look at morality in politics. His first screen credit as a writer was on The Sweet Ride (1968), a pseudo-philosophical movie about three beach bums. It was not a success, nor was the Broadway musical Georgy (1970), for which Mankiewicz&apos;s book was based on the 1966 British film Georgy Girl. Nevertheless, the producers Albert R Broccoli and Harry Saltzman hired him for two weeks to doctor the Richard Maibaum script of Diamonds Are Forever. He stayed for six months, receiving a co-screenplay credit. Differing greatly from the Ian Fleming book of the same name, the script had 007 (Sean Connery) bounding from London to Amsterdam, LA to Las Vegas, on the trail of a huge diamond-smuggling operation, behind which lurks his arch-enemy, Blofeld (not in the novel). Bond has a good fight in an elevator, is pestered by two vicious gay men, and attracted by two beauties named Tiffany Case and Plenty O&apos;Toole. Connery, who had been enticed back to the role after four years away by a $1m fee, plus a weekly salary of $10,000, had not altered his droll style and sexual allure, although there was some change in his girth. When Roger Moore followed him in the part, Mankiewicz was entrusted to write the screenplay for Moore&apos;s first 007, Live and Let Die. The film, which did well at the box office, proved that Connery was not irreplaceable as Bond. While Mankiewicz stuck to the winning formula \u2013 the film had spectacular set pieces, particularly an incredible speedboat chase through the Louisiana bayous \u2013 it leaned rather more on the humorous side, honed to Moore&apos;s more lightweight personality. According to Mankiewicz, &quot;the difference between Sean and Roger was that Sean looked dangerous. Sean could sit at a table with a girl at a nightclub and either lean across and kiss her or stick a knife in her under the table and then say, &apos;Excuse me waiter, I have nothing to\u00a0cut my meat with.&apos; Whereas Roger could kiss the girl, if he stuck a\u00a0knife in\u00a0her it would look nasty because Roger looks like a nice guy.&quot; Although The Man With the Golden Gun, which Mankiewicz and Maibaum adapted from Fleming&apos;s last novel, had the usual stunts, exotic locales, a master criminal and sexy women popping up from time to time, it sometimes verged on self-parody. In fact, there is a tongue-in-cheek seam running through most of\u00a0Mankiewicz&apos;s work. In 1976 three films with Mankiewicz as writer were released: Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed, starring Bill Cosby as a stoned ambulance driver; The Cassandra Crossing, a disaster movie with an all-star cast; and The Eagle Has Landed (based on the Jack Higgins novel), an\u00a0entertaining but far-fetched thriller with Michael Caine as a German colonel infiltrating an English village in 1943 with the aim of kidnapping Winston Churchill. In 1977 the director Richard Donner recruited Mankiewicz to work on the script of Superman, for which he received the credit of creative consultant, a fancy name for script doctor. He got the same credit for Superman II (1980), directed by Richard\u00a0Lester, who added rather too much camp humour to footage that Donner had shot. Mankiewicz claimed to have written most of both pictures. He later helped Donner reconstruct Superman II, restoring all of the original footage that\u00a0had been altered by the\u00a0producers. In between fixing other people&apos;s films, he co-wrote the screenplay for Donner&apos;s Ladyhawke (1985), a\u00a0handsome-looking medieval fable of cursed lovers turning into animals. After directing 13 episodes of the TV adventure series Hart to Hart (1979-82), starring Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers, he directed two movies, Dragnet (1987) and Delirious (1991) \u2013 the former being a mildly amusing spoof of Jack Webb&apos;s 50s TV series; the latter about a writer (John Candy) trapped in his own soap opera. Mankiewicz is survived by his brother, Christopher, a producer and actor, and his sister, Alexandra. \u2022 Thomas Francis Mankiewicz, screen-writer and director, born 1 June 1942; died 31 July 2010", "sentences": ["Differing greatly from the Ian Fleming book of the same name, the script had 007 (Sean Connery) bounding from London to Amsterdam, LA to Las Vegas, on the trail of a huge diamond-smuggling operation, behind which lurks his arch-enemy, Blofeld (not in the novel)."], "title": "Tom Mankiewicz obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/04/tom-mankiewicz-obituary", "tags": ["James Bond", "Film", "Culture", "US news", "Sean Connery"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-04T23:06:19Z", "article": "Cesc F\u00e1bregas returns to Arsenal today at the end of his extended post-World Cup break and everyone associated with the club will hope that the planned squad photocall ends with the captain sitting alongside Ars\u00e8ne Wenger in the official team picture, all smiles. Wenger called at the weekend for F\u00e1bregas to end speculation that he will be returning to Barcelona, where he began his career. But if manager and supporters are desperate for such an outcome, then so are the players, who know that their chances of hoisting a trophy this season depend on a fit and committed F\u00e1bregas. &quot;He&apos;s just a fantastic player, that&apos;s why he&apos;s so important for us,&quot; Thomas Vermaelen said yesterday. &quot;Last season he played very good games for us, scored a lot of goals, gave passes. We hope he stays. He&apos;s our skipper because he&apos;s a leader. He&apos;s not only good with his feet, but from what I saw last season he also works hard for the team as well, hard tackling, and he&apos;s a complete player. &quot;It&apos;s between him and the boss \u2013 they will make a decision whether he will stay or not. But we as a club and as players all want him to stay, and he knows that. He knows that he&apos;s a good player for us but it&apos;s difficult in football and we will see.&quot; The situation has been made even more difficult by a succession of Barcelona players, including Lionel Messi, publicly expressing their desires for F\u00e1bregas to return to the Nou Camp, even though it is not immediately clear where he would fit into Barcelona&apos;s well-established midfield. Surprisingly, Vermaelen had no criticism of his fellow professionals. &quot;I think that&apos;s the way in football now, and I think Barcelona will want to make it easier to get him by talking to the press.&quot; The central defender also understands the pull of his home nation on F\u00e1bregas. Vermaelen left Belgium at an early age to join Ajax, but maintains that the desire to return to Catalonia may not be the influence on the captain&apos;s feelings. &quot;He has emotion here as well, because he came here when he was 15 or 16. I had that when I was in Amsterdam. If you go to another country when you are that young, I think you feel a bond with the country and the club as well.&quot; F\u00e1bregas will be vital because, Vermaelen believes, Arsenal are not far from delivering a first trophy in five seasons. &quot;We were close last season,&quot; he said. &quot;We were only one point behind [in the Premier League] until we lost too many points too easily in the last couple of games. &quot;We have to continue what we were doing, we don&apos;t have to change the way we play. We had some good games, but the most difficult thing in football is to perform every week, every game, and we have to do that this year. I think it&apos;s possible. I think we can do it and I am confident. The manager always believes in us, he believed in us in every game last season and he will do that again this year.&quot; Vermaelen was speaking at the launch of Arsenal&apos;s campaign to raise \u00a3500,000 this season for Centrepoint, London&apos;s biggest youth homeless charity, which was also due to be attended by Wenger. But the manager missed the event when a &quot;planned meeting&quot; overran. The inevitable speculation was that it concerned F\u00e1bregas \u2013 or at least the signings of a new goalkeeper and a central defender. Cynics might conclude that Wenger found it convenient to avoid reporters&apos; questions about F\u00e1bregas. Vermaelen and the rest of the players want the same questions answered. Through the &apos;Be A Gooner. Be A Giver&apos; campaign, the Gunners aim to raise \u00a3500,000 to create a state-of-the-art service in a refurbished building in Soho, to be known as the &apos;Arsenal Training Centre&apos;. The Centre will help homeless young people across London to develop essential life skills to get back on their feet and stay off the streets permanently. Every day Centrepoint provides accommodation and support for 800 vulnerable homeless young people between 16-25 years-old across London who have experienced domestic abuse, family breakdown, poverty, and increasingly, the harsh reality of knife and gun crime.", "sentences": ["I had that when I was in Amsterdam."], "title": "Cesc F\u00e1bregas returns to Arsenal and the club pray it is permanent", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/05/cesc-fabregas-arsenal-thomas-vermaelen", "tags": ["Cesc F\u00e0bregas", "Arsenal", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-05T14:32:01Z", "article": "Chelsea have lost three pre-season friendlies in a row, to Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hamburg. A Chelsea XI also lost 5-1 at Wycombe, with the Blues&apos; only victory so far coming at Selhurst Park in their 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. But should anything be read into these results? Well possibly, yes. Evidence suggests that teams who go on to win the Premier League title generally have favourable results in pre-season \u2026 Chelsea 2009-10 Won 4 Drew 1 Lost 1 Chelsea were unbeaten in all their friendly matches, including a 2-0 victory over the Seattle Sounders, a hat-trick of wins against Internazionale, Milan and Am\u00e9rica in the World Football Challenge in the US, and a 2-2 draw at Reading. They went on to beat Manchester United in the Community Shield 4-1 on penalties after drawing 2-2 in normal time. Nine months later, Chelsea sealed their title \u2013 and the Double \u2013 on the last day of the season with an 8-0 triumph over Wigan. Manchester United 2008-09 W7 D2 L0 In the buildup to their third consecutive title, Manchester United played in the Vodacom Challenge in South Africa, beating the Orlando Pirates and playing the Kaizer Chiefs twice, drawing the first match and winning the second 4-0. On their way back, the team stopped in Abuja, Nigeria to play Portsmouth, beating them 2-1 in a match that served as a rehearsal for the Community Shield, which Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s side also won, this time on penalties. The pre-season also resulted in away wins over Aberdeen and Darren Ferguson&apos;s Peterborough, and home games against Espanyol and Juventus, which were won and drawn respectively. Manchester United 2007-08 W8 D1 L2 United prepared to defend their title with a tour of east Asia, yielding a draw with the Urawa Red Diamonds, and victories over FC Seoul, Shenzhen FC and Guangzhou Pharmaceutical. Their only home game of the pre-season was a 3-2 defeat to Inter, although they managed away wins over Doncaster, Peterborough, Glentoran and Dunfermline. They lost 3-2 in Saudi Arabia to Al-Hilal before returning home to win the Community Shield on penalties after a 1-1 draw with Chelsea \u2013 whom they would beat by two points to win the Premier League. Manchester United 2006-07 W9 D0 L2 A pre-season tournament in South Africa saw Manchester United claim victories over the Orlando Pirates and the Kaizer Chiefs, although they lost the final to the latter on penalties. United returned to the UK and recorded away wins over Celtic and Macclesfield, although they lost to Preston North End at Deepdale. In August United took part in the Amsterdam Tournament, where they beat Porto and Ajax \u2013 although the Porto match is perhaps better remembered for Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney being sent off. The pair were suspended for the first three matches of the season as a result. United wrapped up their preparations with wins over Oxford, Sevilla and a Europe XI, and went on to win the league by six points. Chelsea 2005-06 W5 D1 L0 Chelsea put together an unbeaten run in the buildup to their second successive title, despite playing none of their matches at Stamford Bridge. Away wins over Wycombe Wanderers and Benfica were followed by a tour of the US, when they beat DC United in Washington, and play Milan \u2013 who had been beaten by Liverpool in the final of the Champions League the previous season \u2013 twice, winning in Boston and drawing in New York. The Blues&apos; final match before the Premier League restart was the Community Shield, where a Didier Drogba brace helped them defeat Arsenal 2-1. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s side went on to win the league almost as convincingly as the season before, finishing with eight more points than second-placed Manchester United. Chelsea 2004-05 W2 D1 L1 Mourinho&apos;s reign got off to an inauspicious start with his first game, a friendly away at Oxford, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Better results were to be found on a pre-season tour of the US, including a 4-2 win over Celtic and a 3-0 win over Roma, although the latter match was marred by the sending off of Mateja Kezman. The tour ended in Philadelphia with a 3-2 defeat to Milan. Although their pre-season was something of a mixed bag, their Premier League season was decidedly not: Chelsea finished 12 points ahead of nearest rivals Arsenal. Arsenal 2003-04 W3 D3 L2 Arsenal&apos;s pre-season results gave little clue as to the unbeaten season that lay ahead. Although victories over Rangers, Vienna and Besiktas \u2013 the latter two played on a tour of Austria \u2013 were solid enough, there were draws with Celtic, Barnet and Austrian part-timers SC Ritzing, as well as a defeat away to Division Two&apos;s Peterborough. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s side were level at 1-1 after 90 minutes against Manchester United in the Community Shield but lost 4-3 on penalties, substitute Francis Jeffers having been sent off in the 72nd minute for kicking out at Phil Neville. Manchester United 2002-03 W7 D0 L1 United won all but one of their pre-season matches in 2002, scoring 5-0 away victories over the Irish team Shelbourne, Division Two&apos;s Chesterfield and an XI put out by Aarhus of Denmark. They also beat Parma, Bournemouth, Valerenga and \u2013 in their only home fixture \u2013 Boca Juniors. United finished third in the Amsterdam Tournament having beaten Parma but succumbing 2-1 to hosts Ajax. They went on to win the league by five points from Arsenal. Arsenal 2001-02 W5 D0 L2 Arsenal&apos;s warm-up before their Double-winning season resulted in five victories, although few came against strong sides \u2013 Boreham Wood, Rushden &amp; Diamonds and Barnet were on the list of beaten teams. Sterner tests might have been expected from Norwich and Real Mallorca but both were dispatched with a two-goal winning margin. However, Wenger&apos;s side were beaten by AS Roma and Turkey&apos;s Kocaelispor. In the Premier League five teams were in contention for the title at the halfway point, but Arsenal took the title with a seven-point margin. Manchester United 2000-01 W6 D0 L2 United claimed a number of victories over big-name teams, including Real Madrid, Celtic and arch-rivals Manchester City \u2013 as well as wins over York City, Maltese side Birkirkara and an 8-1 drubbing of Shrewsbury Town. However, they were less impressive against Bayern Munich in the Olympiastadion for the final of the German side&apos;s centenary tournament, going down 3-1 with David Beckham missing a penalty.

Although the midfielder insisted he bore no psychological scars from the wreckage in South Africa, he can feel a certain liberation in being back at a winning team and in a positive atmosphere. &quot;I have got to be honest, the disappointing summer is not affecting the Chelsea side,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, we are disappointed with England but it is almost a breath of fresh air to come back to Chelsea. We won the Double last year and that is a nice feeling. There is no niggling mental effect from the World Cup at all. When the England games come then we will approach that but in terms of Chelsea, I think it is exciting to be back.&quot; There is irony and perhaps a sneaking feeling of dread among the England World Cup players that they must turn out in a Wembley friendly against Hungary next Wednesday before the start of the Premier League season on Saturday week. Chelsea open their title defence at home to West Bromwich Albion. Some club managers have criticised the timing of the international fixture, and Lampard can see their point. &quot;Everyone has spoken about it not being ideal,&quot; he said. &quot;There are two arguments. It is not ideal for the teams, that is an obvious statement, because everyone wants to prepare for that first game. But you have to understand that England need to prepare for the [Euro 2012] qualifying games as well. That game has always been there, and as a professional playing for your country, you go and play.&quot; Lampard trod carefully as he reflected on the World Cup and particularly when he was asked whether he had now forgotten about it. &quot;That would be a good headline for you,&quot; he said, with a smile. &quot;No one wants to go to the World Cup and get knocked out. I am sure that Brazil, Argentina, Italy and all the big teams that didn&apos;t get to the final feel the same. &quot;But you have to look forward. You do not want to dwell on things. You have to look forward to the season with a positive attitude for Chelsea and for England, as all England players do.&quot; Chelsea have just returned from an unsuccessful mini-tour of Germany in terms of results. They lost 2-1 to both Hamburg and Eintracht Frankfurt, defeats that followed the 3-1 reverse to Ajax in Amsterdam. The curtain goes up on their season on Sunday with the Community Shield against Manchester United. Carlo Ancelotti, the manager, has admitted that his World Cup players need another two weeks of training before they are match fit, but Lampard feels that he will enjoy the dividend of his four-week post-South Africa break later in the season. &quot;The rest was about a month, which is plenty for me; I was kind of ready to come back,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no issue for me there [in terms of time off] and now it is just about getting fit. It always takes a little time. Hopefully the rest we did have will be of benefit later on. &quot;We have not had the best results but that is normal because a lot of big players have come back later and have also had a little bit of injury, like Didier Drogba. The important thing is what happens when the business starts on Sunday and next week.&quot; Lampard&apos;s priority for the season is the retention of the Premier League title, and he stressed that results were the bottom line. &quot;We scored 100 goals last season and we probably won&apos;t score as many, if the truth be known,&quot; he said. &quot;People will set out to try and stop us doing things like that this year but I really don&apos;t care how we win the league, if we were to do it again. &quot;First and foremost, I would like to defend the league. Hopefully, we can try and win the Champions League but it is a horrible one to try and call at the start of the season.&quot; Lampard predicted that Manchester City could join the band of more established title challengers but, as many figures in the game have already done, he applied some pressure on the free-spending north-west club. According to him, it was imperative that they enjoyed a winning start to the season. &quot;They have got the money and they are stronger than ever but they will have to try and find the mix and they will have to try and make it work very quickly,&quot; he said. &quot;You feel that they are going to be a force eventually because of the money behind them, but how quickly they can do it and how successfully they can do it remains to be seen.&quot;", "sentences": ["They lost 2-1 to both Hamburg and Eintracht Frankfurt, defeats that followed the 3-1 reverse to Ajax in Amsterdam."], "title": "England's World Cup trauma won't hurt Chelsea, says Frank Lampard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/05/frank-lampard-chelsea-england", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Frank Lampard", "England", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-06T21:15:08Z", "article": "Here are two new comedies, going head-to-head on a Friday night.

It&apos;s certainly ambitious, and original. The characters are great: hapless Pete; the nightmare fiancee of Pete&apos;s best mate who&apos;s coming on the stag weekend in Amsterdam because they&apos;re not just lovers, they&apos;re best friends, too; the inappropriate commentators. And at times, in an awkward kind of way, it&apos;s very funny. Which is not something that can be said of Roger and Val, with Alfred Molina and Dawn French. I began by appreciating the lack of canned laughter. But maybe there isn&apos;t any because there wasn&apos;t anywhere for it to go. Perhaps it was filmed in front of a studio audience, and they sat there, in silence, baffled, or possibly asleep. Roger and Val are a tiresome middle-aged couple. They&apos;ve lost the\u00a0guarantee for the vacuum cleaner that&apos;s broken down, they bicker a bit but not in a nasty way, and it all happens in real time. And that&apos;s it, really. Possibly we&apos;re meant to recognise it from our own lives, or our parents&apos;, or people we know. Maybe it is true to life, well observed even, but that doesn&apos;t make it any less uninteresting. Which it is, staggeringly so.

In doing so, he joined his already outspoken predecessors Vicente Fox and Ernesto Zedillo, as well as other former Latin American presidents like C\u00e9sar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil. Latin American policymakers have learned that drug prohibition, more than the drugs themselves, is a problem. Prohibition of desire simply cannot work. Since taking office in late 2006, Calder\u00f3n has sent more than 45,000 soldiers into battle with the cartels, but, almost four years later, the Mexican drug business continues to thrive. This policy failure is not unique to Mexico. After 40 years of the international &quot;war on drugs&quot;, the only consistent outcome has been that drugs keep getting cheaper, more potent and far easier for people \u2013 especially our children \u2013 to access everywhere. This failure, however, is not even the main concern. More relevant are the immense risks, harm and pains caused by prohibition. Especially the violence. A recent multi-decade review by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy found that, when police crack down on drug users and dealers, the result is almost always an increase in violence. Mexicans can confirm it. Calder\u00f3n&apos;s offensive against the cartels has unleashed a wave of violence that has killed more than 28,000 people, including innocent civilians caught in shootouts. The folks in the Mexican bar who saw the decapitated heads roll over their dance floor as prohibition-funded gangs sent their message of dominance can surely confirm it. Brazilians can also confirm it. In the city of Rio de Janeiro, in 2008 alone, there were 2,757 murders. One in five was a summary execution during police operations against drug dealers in the ghettos called favelas. In the Brazilian drug war, these are the &quot;enemies&quot;. They are mostly very young. They proudly hold their machine-guns that replace the toys they never had. They battle for marginalised territories and for their occasional profits. Like most poor Brazilian boys, they dream of becoming famous soccer players, but they do not have the opportunity. They have no hope. They do not live long. They kill and die. Soon, other children take their places. The tragic deaths of these lost children are inevitable outcomes of a policy that is defined as a &quot;war&quot;, in which the &quot;criminal&quot; now becomes the &quot;enemy&quot;, who must kill or be killed. They arm themselves against the police and their competitors. The police arm themselves against them. It is a self-fulfilling, bloody prophecy. It is the predictable hallmark of drug prohibition. Violence is not necessarily related to drugs. As the alcohol or tobacco businesses demonstrate, the production and supply of drugs are not inherently violent activities. Weapons and violence only accompany those activities when undertaken in an illegal market. The prohibition yields the violence, as disputes must be settled out of court and on the streets. Paradoxically, when we prohibit these widely used substances, we are actually relinquishing meaningful control over them. Prohibition consigns the drug market to criminalised actors not subject to oversight of any kind. Legalisation would mean regulation and regulation is the best way to control the dangers of drug use, while cutting the cartels off at the knees. Every country that has provided a glimpse of what a regulated future might look like has experienced lowered rates of death, disease, crime and addiction. The Swiss policy of treating heroin addiction as a health issue rather than a moral or criminal one has been a resounding success with, among other indicators, a 60% reduction in criminal activity among participating addicts. When Portugal legalised the possession of all drugs, it experienced a decade of sharp declines in overall drug use, especially among the young. In Amsterdam, where over-the-counter marijuana sales have been tolerated for decades, rates of use among teenagers are much lower than they are in the US, where harsh penalties abound. Latin America is advancing the debate, but even in the US there are efforts to undo the damage of prohibition, the most prominent being California&apos;s effort to legalise marijuana. Hopefully, the thousands of Mexicans, Brazilians and people from other parts of the world who have been killed in the insane &quot;war on drugs&quot; will not have died in vain. Their deaths are already showing that it is time to put an end to all the pain and harms caused by drug prohibition; it is time to legalise and regulate the production, the supply and the consumption of all drugs.

More than half of UK consumers believe tax-free airport stores offer average savings of 20% or more compared with recommended retail prices on the high street. But the Kelkoo report reveals that departure lounge retailers are charging prices that are, on average, only 6.2% cheaper, with Heathrow offering the worst overall discounts of any major European airport, at just 3.1% less than high street prices. Consumers spent more than \u00a32.5bn on tax-free shopping in European airports last year, saving \u00a3168m against high street prices. But Kelkoo calculated that had the same consumers shopped online they could have saved on average a further 6.1% or \u00a3156m \u2013 a total discount of 12.3% or \u00a3324m. In a mystery-shopping exercise, the prices of a sample basket of 22 products, spanning the key categories of health and beauty, luxury, fashion, electricals, wine and spirits, tobacco, fine foods and confectionery were collected in 10 tax-free retail airport outlets, and compared to prices online and benchmarked against the average RRP in local high-street stores. The 10 airports selected account for 80% of European passenger traffic. Kelkoo found that prices varied by hundreds of pounds between airports. The cost of a Panasonic FZ38 digital camera ranges from \u00a3267.85 in Heathrow to \u00a3137.58 in Lyon, while a Dolce and Gabbana &apos;Hobo&apos; shoulder bag cost \u00a31,020 in Heathrow and \u00a3696.07 in Rome. The variation was proportionately just as big for cheaper items: a box of Guylian Belgian chocolate sea shells cost \u00a34.83 in Frankfurt airport, but almost twice as much in Amsterdam Schiphol where the same box would set you back \u00a38.42. Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld offered the second worst discounts at 4.6%, while Gatwick ranked fifth with below-average savings of 5%. British airport retailers are the most expensive for luxury, fashion and electrical goods while Spanish airports charge the highest prices for health and beauty products \u2013 wine and spirits are the most expensive in French airports. However, the best savings overall were offered by tax-free retailers in two french airports \u2013 Lyon-Saint Exup\u00e9ry (11.9% savings) followed by Charles de Gaulle in Paris (11.5%). However the UK topped the table when it came to online shopping, offering average savings of 15.4% compared with high street prices. France came second with savings of 13.7% while Italy came last out of six countries with savings of 9.1%. Bruce Fair, managing director of Kelkoo UK, said: &quot;Eleven years on from the end of duty-free there is still the perception that tax-free shopping offers the best deals. In reality, higher overheads, decreased competition and less choice means that tax-free shops are not always the hunting ground for bargains that people think they are. In fact, airside retailers simply cannot compete with online retail for the best prices.&quot; Tax-free shopping, which is free of VAT for travellers whose journeys start and finish within the EU, should not be confused with duty-free shopping which is free of VAT and excise duty. Duty-free was abolished by EU member states in 1999 and is now only available to travellers starting or ending their journey outside the EU. \u2022 This footnote was added on 2 September 2010.

For the many active Iranian YouTube members, this was a sensational opportunity to finally contribute, participate and share in a non-political world community project through a medium they knew well. After all, it was the 2009 elections that inspired citizen filming in Iran, with YouTube serving as the main channel to the outside world. Clips of the brutality on the streets of Iran catapulted YouTube into newsrooms and signalled it as a potent news source. It came as a slap in the face, then, to read the FAQ on the Life in a Day website: &quot;Anyone over 13 years old can submit footage, except for residents and nationals of Iran, Syria, Cuba, Sudan, North Korea and Myanmar (Burma), and/or any other persons and entities restricted by US export controls and sanctions programmes.&quot; The &quot;story of a single day on earth \u2026 One world, 24 hours, 6 billion perspectives&quot; is actively boycotting 1.5 billion of the 6 billion perspectives it pursues. Wouldn&apos;t it be great to have included these countries \u2013 to have seen something of daily life rather than the usual imagery? Surely that would have been more in step with the spirit of the project, especially given that most of the submissions will naturally end up on the cutting-room floor. Instead, this decision is meanspirited, hasty and compromises the integrity of a project intended to be truly universal, when it is in fact not open to all. YouTube has been described as &quot;a speakers&apos; corner that both embodies and promotes democracy&quot;. A valid appraisal. So why the concern and involvement with political sanctions? Even if the film were funded by the US government, the boycott wouldn&apos;t have made sense: the US senate has allocated $50m to the Victims of Iranian Censorship Act (Voice) to help Iranians evade government censorship of the internet and to put pressure on foreign companies not to help Iran in its repressive measures. Life in a Day is due to be screened at the 2011 Sundance film festival \u2013 and the Sundance institute apparently prides itself on providing a forum for filmmakers &quot;to explore their stories free from commercial and political pressures&quot;. Even Korean electronics giant LG partnering the project says: &quot;Using video footage to bring people together to share their diverse perspectives and experiences helps enrich all our lives. Life in a Day is a perfect fit with our core values: humanity, pleasure, curiosity, and an optimistic energy&quot;. The film&apos;s multinational footage will be directed by Kevin MacDonald, who made One Day in September and Touching the Void, both provocative films that don&apos;t succumb to public expectation. Life in a Day&apos;s executive producer Ridley Scott, acclaimed director of Blade Runner and Gladiator, has come under attack on Iranian internet forums. An accomplished group of Iranian filmmakers in Amsterdam are now creating their own Iranian version of the Life in a Day concept in retaliation. It was Scott who directed the campaign that launched Apple Mac computers in 1984. In this Orwellian depiction of the Big Brother state of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Macs are coming to save man from conformity, with the strapline &quot;with Macintosh \u2026 1984 will not be 1984&quot;.

The New York Observer yesterday profiled developer Sharif El-Gamal, and reporter Dana Rubinstein produced these paragraphs:  He began visiting mosques downtown near where he lived and worked, and came away with the realization that there were more mosque-goers than there were mosques to accommodate them. Some mosques had to hold four services a night, and still there were people praying on the streets. He began toying with the idea of developing a mosque himself. When asked if making a profit was his initial motivation, Mr. El-Gamal, smiling slyly, would only say, &quot;I am a businessman. I am a businessman.&quot; Soon, he met Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, and his plans grew more complex. &quot;I&apos;d never met an American imam who spoke the way I speak, who, it was almost like I was listening to a professor,&quot; Mr. El-Gamal said. &quot;I went up to him and I said, &apos;It&apos;s not fair that only 70 people get to hear this.&apos; And I started a relationship with him.&quot; &quot;Then as I got married and as I became a father and a husband and a member of the Jewish Community Center on 76th and Amsterdam, I was like, &apos;Wow, let&apos;s build a community center.&apos;&quot; Mr. El-Gamal, who now lives on the Upper West Side, continued to focus his energies on the Muslim community in Lower Manhattan, a neighborhood that had long expressed a desire for a new community center. The District Needs Statement put out by Community Board 1 reads, &quot;With the tremendous increase in the population of the Financial District and Seaport and Civic Centers, a community center is urgently needed to support a strong and stable community there.&quot;.. ...&quot;And it had nothing to do with the World Trade Center site,&quot; Mr. El-Gamal said. He repeated himself, this time more slowly: &quot;It had nothing to do with the World Trade Center site. It had to do with me being an American, a New Yorker who has particular religious beliefs and wants to help his community.&quot; Anyway, &quot;Literally within two weeks, or within a month of him being here, he made a call and we found the Burlington site. And, when we found that site, he called a guy, who said, &apos;Oh, good timing, my son is showing the building tomorrow afternoon, and we want to sell.&apos;&quot;  Now let&apos;s hear from Ben Smith and Maggie Haberman of the Politico, who write that the mosque is a long-shot ever to be built because El-Gamal has failed utterly to get his financing together and to grease the squeaky wheels of the New York political process:  The Cordoba Initiative hasn&apos;t begun fundraising yet for its $100 million goal. The group&apos;s latest fundraising report with the State Attorney General&apos;s office, from 2008, shows exactly $18,255 \u2013 not enough even for a down payment on the half of the site the group has yet to purchase.  The group also lacks even the most basic real estate essentials: no blueprint, architect, lobbyist or engineer \u2014 and now operates amid crushing negative publicity. The developers didn&apos;t line up advance support for the project from other religious leaders in the city, who could have risen to their defense with the press... ...&quot;They needed to talk to all the right people and they never did. That&apos;s a normal part of building any building in Manhattan,&quot; said George Arzt, a longtime public relations man in New York who was Mayor Ed Koch&apos;s press secretary.  It always astonishes me when people are caught off-guard in these situations, but I think most average people don&apos;t understand what the right-wing media culture is like in this country. They just don&apos;t give it thought. And they have no ability to think about how what they&apos;re doing can be portrayed by others whose political agenda is served by destroying them. Meanwhile, bravo to Ted Olson, the arch-conservative Washington power-lawyer who lost his wife in the plane that crashed in central Pennsylvania and who said yesterday that &quot;probably the president was right about this&quot; when he spoke last Friday. Meanwhile again, from Gallup, fresh off the presses:  Republicans (44%) are more likely than Democrats (31%) or independents (29%) to be paying a great deal of attention to the story about the mosque. Republicans overwhelmingly disapprove of Obama&apos;s remarks on the issue, including 63% who do so strongly. Democrats generally approve of Obama&apos;s remarks, while independents tilt toward disapproval, but close to half of each group does not have an opinion (compared with 26% of Republicans).  In other words, most Democrats and independents (combining those with no opinion and those who approve) don&apos;t care about what Obama said one way or the other. Once again, what constitutes &quot;news&quot; is driven almost entirely by the third or so of American who despise Barack Obama. And if all the people who&apos;ve invested so much time and energy in denouncing this development (which is slated to include, by the way, a 9-11 memorial) actually spent that energy trying to explain to Americans the distinction between an entire religion and some of its fanatic adherents rather than blur that distinction for political purposes...well. that would be some other country, I guess.", "sentences": ["&quot;I went up to him and I said, &apos;It&apos;s not fair that only 70 people get to hear this.&apos; And I started a relationship with him.&quot; &quot;Then as I got married and as I became a father and a husband and a member of the Jewish Community Center on 76th and Amsterdam, I was like, &apos;Wow, let&apos;s build a community center.&apos;&quot; Mr. El-Gamal, who now lives on the Upper West Side, continued to focus his energies on the Muslim community in Lower Manhattan, a neighborhood that had long expressed a desire for a new community center."], "title": "Some mosque backstory | Michael Tomasky", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/aug/19/us-politics-new-york-will-mosque-even-be-built", "tags": ["US politics", "New York", "Islam"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-20T13:03:00Z", "article": "1.

Wilders, whose success in June&apos;s general election catapulted him into the role of kingmaker in attempts to form a new coalition government, is to travel to New York to take part in protests on 11 September against the proposed Muslim community centre near Ground Zero. Maxime Verhagen, the acting foreign minister and Christian Democrats&apos; leader, has voiced fears that Wilders&apos;s speech in New York will tarnish Dutch reputations. He has also taken the unusual step of circulating confidential orders to Dutch diplomats around the world on how to answer questions about Wilders&apos;s influence in a new government and on the fallout for Muslims in the Netherlands. With characteristic robustness, Wilders has told Verhagen to mind his own business. He clearly intends to grab attention with a tub-thumping exercise in Islamophobia in New York. &quot;Good feeling. Important speech. No one will stop me. No mosque at Ground Zero,&quot; he tweeted after booking a flight to New York. &quot;Stop Islam, defend freedom&quot; is his rallying cry. The tensions over 9/11 and New York come as Wilders savours his growing clout at home. His Freedom party is running at 31% in the most recent opinion poll, ahead of all other contenders, and he has spent most of this week at a secret location with Verhagen and Mark Rutte, the liberals&apos; leader, haggling over the terms for a new coalition government. Wilders, whose party almost tripled its seats, from nine to 24, in the June election, is not joining the new cabinet. Instead, he will prop up a rightwing coalition of liberals and Christian Democrats in return for pledges of a tough new crackdown on immigration and other policy concessions. If the talks succeed, Wilders will be in the enviable position of wielding power while abjuring responsibility. The negotiations have been going on for a fortnight and are supposed to be concluded next week. But they are said to be going badly. A coalition backed by Wilders would command the slimmest of majorities \u2013 76 seats in the 150-seat second chamber or lower house. The Trouw newspaper yesterday reported at least one dissident Christian Democrat MP would not support it, making it unviable. Verhagen is in a difficult position. While negotiating with Wilders, he is also telling his diplomats how to undermine the rightwing maverick. Verhagen faces mounting resistance within his own party to collaborating, even if only tacitly, with Wilders. Last week German Christian Democrats joined Dutch party dissidents in calling for a boycott of Wilders. The latest opinion polls show Wilders soaring ahead of Rutte&apos;s liberal VVD party. Rutte, who is expected to be the new prime minister, supports an immigration crackdown and other anti-EU and hardline policies demanded by Wilders. But the two rightwingers are split over the main issue \u2013 austerity and budget cuts. Rutte is committed to slashing public spending by \u20ac18bn to halve the budget deficit from almost 7%. He is demanding health service, education, welfare and social security cuts. Wilders, who is being prosecuted in Amsterdam on charges of inciting hatred and discrimination, is portraying himself as the protector of Dutch welfare, while calling for a tax on Islamic headscarves, a ban on the Qur&apos;an, closure of Islamic schools, deportation of immigrants and proscribing mosque-building.

Almost every moment in the German diarist&apos;s 15-year life, which ended in 1944 in Bergen-Belsen, has already been copiously chronicled; each person with even a passing connection to her story has told their own. And the uses to which her diary has been put have also been well critiqued, most notably by the American critic Cynthia Ozick, who, in an article for the New Yorker in 1997, argued: &quot;The diary has been bowdlerised, distorted, transmuted, reduced; it has been infantilised, Americanised, sentimentalised, falsified.&quot; Ian Buruma, writing in the New York Review of Books the following year, put it more bluntly: Anne Frank has become a Dutch Joan of Arc. In the absence of new material, those who write about her must either endlessly rehearse what&apos;s already known, reconstitute her for a modern audience or analyse those &quot;new&quot; Anne Franks. Francine Prose tries to do all three and fails much of the time. For, if Anne Frank has in some sense become a sign, then the task of analysing her book&apos;s afterlife requires the skills of a semiotician rather than a novelist. Prose&apos;s chief argument is that, by viewing the diary as a historical document, we have overlooked its qualities as a &quot;work of literary genius&quot;, although from the spring of 1944 onwards Anne rewrote her diary as she updated it, to turn it into a more eloquent piece of writing. After the war her father, Otto Frank, drew on versions A (the original) and B (Anne&apos;s revision) to produce C \u2013 the standard edition, until both the critical edition (1989) and the definitive edition (1995) supplemented C with hitherto omitted passages from A and B. Yet none of this is new: indeed most of Prose&apos;s material is based on already published work, written by people who knew how the Anne Frank story ended. The problem of hindsight isn&apos;t just incidental to the framing of that story but central to it: the question that needs asking is why the diary has become so famous. Despite some insights along the way, Prose is so wedded to the idea of the diary&apos;s unique literary properties that she ends up simplistically suggesting that its fame is ultimately the result of its brilliance. But you have only to read the remarkable wartime diary of Etty Hillesum (An Interrupted Life, Persephone Books), a young Dutch woman who died young (in Auschwitz) but who remains almost entirely unknown, to realise that Frank&apos;s afterlife is rather more complex. Her posthumous beatification \u2013 the remaining few frames of film of her have almost the status of a relic \u2013 rests mostly on those lines in her diary about still believing that people are good at heart. (The ones about people&apos;s innate &quot;urge to destroy .\u00a0.\u00a0. to kill .\u00a0.\u00a0. murder and rage&quot; have curiously never found equal fame.) Ruthlessly decontextualised, the good-at-heart sentence has turned Frank into an emblem of forgiveness, as though she were in some sense anticipating her own death and absurdly exonerating those responsible. Prose traces how this idea was taken up in the Broadway and Hollywood versions of the diary. Frank, according to Natalie Portman, who played her in the 1997 Broadway version, was &quot;a happy person&quot;. A Californian teenager who corresponded with Otto Frank said that Anne &quot;helped me through my teens&quot;. The American immigration authorities refused to grant the Frank family an entry visa during the war. But never mind: Anne Frank has been posthumously Americanised; you can almost reimagine her as a blonde, betassled cheerleader. The prevailing version also rewrites Dutch history, with Miep Gies \u2013 who sustained the Frank family in the secret annexe \u2013 as heroine, erasing the fact that, despite the presence of only 200 German police in Amsterdam, 107,000 Dutch Jews were deported, largely through the combined efforts of Dutch police and civilians. According to Adolf Eichmann, the Dutch transports ran so smoothly that they &quot;were a pleasure to behold&quot;. Prose doesn&apos;t shrink from this. She also quotes Bruno Bettelheim, who claimed that the play, &quot;while it confronts us with the fact that Auschwitz existed .\u00a0.\u00a0. encourages us at the same time to ignore its implications&quot;. She gets closest to fresh thinking when she tackles the difficulties of teaching children about Anne Frank, and specifically how painful it is for teachers to tell their pupils the facts of the Nazi genocide without depressing them or leaving them without hope. One young American even contended: &quot;Knowing Anne, she was happy in the concentration camps.&quot; Anne died in Bergen-Belsen, according to testimony, weeping, screaming, starving, squabbling, hallucinating and ultimately hopeless. An awful lot of Anne Frank&apos;s diary has nothing to do with the Holocaust: it&apos;s an unusually candid expression of hostility to a mother in a confined setting, for instance. But perhaps we get the Anne Frank that we need, so that, bizarrely, what&apos;s also a journal about the early stages of genocide has ended up with the accolade of being the world&apos;s most famous be-nice-to-each-other primer. Prose, in her fantasies about teaching the diary, ends up colluding with this. Anne Frank, she suggests, lives on in the vitality of her writing, just as she always wanted to. But Anne Frank isn&apos;t alive. She died a horrible death, and that&apos;s what makes her real story so unbearable. \u2022 The War After: Living with the Holocaust by Anne Karpf is published by Faber.", "sentences": ["The prevailing version also rewrites Dutch history, with Miep Gies \u2013 who sustained the Frank family in the secret annexe \u2013 as heroine, erasing the fact that, despite the presence of only 200 German police in Amsterdam, 107,000 Dutch Jews were deported, largely through the combined efforts of Dutch police and civilians."], "title": "Anne Frank: The Book, the Life, the Afterlife by Francine Prose | Book review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/21/anne-frank-francine-prose", "tags": ["History", "Second world war", "World news", "Books", "Culture", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-20T23:04:46Z", "article": "For many years I had fantasised about escaping the British winter to spend December on a white, tropical beach on a gorgeous remote island in some far-flung corner of the world. The Caribbean, Bermuda, South Pacific\u2026 any would have done, but I finally found my slice of paradise in the Seychelles when my dream came true last year, though not quite in the way I had envisaged. I certainly hadn&apos;t planned to wake up \u2013 on the cusp of 39 \u2013 in a mixed-sex dorm with three guys with flatulence, and the prospect of having to cook porridge for 26 people by 6.30am. Still, a topaz hoop of ocean cradled by the steep, forested slopes of the Matoopa peninsula as well as a beautiful coastal habitat full of endangered flora and fauna may have lay on my doorstep, but I wasn&apos;t just here to relax among them. Instead, I was in this island idyll on a volunteer project. I had been feeling burnt out from work and wanted to flee winter and learn new skills. Volunteer projects seemed a good option for a grown-up backpacker. Narrowing my search criteria to marine research helped cut down the thousands of options out there, but I was still left with a huge range of countries, from Australia to Zanzibar, in which I could help sustain a blue planet. In the end I plumped for a project organised by Global Vision International, an expedition company whose sustainable development credentials appeared to deliver. Five weeks&apos; volunteering in such a beautiful place didn&apos;t scream hardship, and I would be able to go diving every day for five weeks for the same price as a week in a four-star resort. The project was a response to a genuine need. Live coral was reduced by as much as 90% in some parts across the Seychelles&apos; Inner Islands following the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o and with large-scale bleaching now a global concern our job was to comb a tract of reef to collect data for international scientific analysis. I would join a &quot;coral recruitment&quot; phase, noting abundance, diversity and health of juvenile corals to help determine the long-term impact of rising sea temperatures on the ecosystem. The 40-minute transfer to GVI&apos;s base in north-west Mah\u00e9 along a sliver of asphalt wedged between sparkling sea and giant jungle-clad granite boulders offered a hint of what was to come. Scalloped by pockets of sand and fringing reef, the winding road petered out at some iron gates. Mangrove swamps patrolled by giant crabs, the fizz of crickets and an &quot;access denied&quot; sign: that now meant home. The former Seychelles Youth Village, a communist-style youth camp abandoned in the mid-90s, is now inhabited by a handful of rangers from the Seychelles Centre for Marine Research &amp; Technology, who share their ramshackle base with blister bugs, fruit bats, giant crabs, nesting wasps \u2013 and, over the course of a year, about 100 GVI volunteers. Bar the occasional boat moored offshore, living on the doorstep of a strictly protected marine ecosystem means exclusivity for volunteers \u2013 in effect our own piece of paradise. Living quarters occupied two main blocks of the former camp \u2013 &quot;classrooms&quot; on the ground floor; mixed dorms (cement floor, corrugated iron roof) up top. In a mixed bag of Singaporeans, Australians, Canadians, Americans, British and various Europeans, I found myself a mosquito net away from a 45-year-old Essex policeman on extended leave and a stroppy 18-year-old from Kent. Our disparate bunch also included students on marine biology placements, redundant bankers, a Pinewood Studios pyrotechnics expert, a notary, some dive masters in training and a smattering of gap-year travellers. Within 24 hours of arrival, a military-base routine kicked in, governed by daylight hours, duty groups (Boat, Grounds, Kitchen, Tanks), Monday Camp Clean, Wednesday Weeklies (stores, data input, boat logs) and up to three research dives a day. Then there was the theory. With 52 coral types to master and a 95% pass rate to achieve, we set out on the path to coral geekdom. We lived and breathed coral, not just under water but also on camp, where we bonded over flash cards of &quot;cat sick&quot; (montipora), &quot;Nik Naks&quot; (psammocora) and, a personal favourite, &quot;Dougal&quot; (herpolitha), which truly resembles something from The Magic Roundabout. Turtle walks and community work with a local school offered a mid-week &quot;escape&quot; from base. With the nearest bus stop a 35-minute schlep away, trips out were limited to the weekend. Occasionally we walked to a nearby waterfall or hired cars and explored the island&apos;s beaches, but mostly we bounced along for an hour on the packed local bus to Mah\u00e9&apos;s tiny capital, Victoria, or on to Beau Vallon beach, in search of cappuccinos, internet cafes, decent food and a bit of local colour. Most nights I was fast asleep by 9pm. Projects included making a rainwater collector, mapping the grounds and extending the veggie garden. We filled and carried our own tanks to the dive boat \u2013 at low tide that could mean a kilometre&apos;s wade through a rug of seagrass in 32C (90F) heat. Enrolment required a Padi Open Water certificate, which I had, but my 30-plus dives straddled two decades and there had been a five-year hiatus prior to my first Seychelles dive. I had to get up to speed, fast. If there were downsides, it was the seemingly endless chores: &quot;If I&apos;d wanted to learn how to use a broom and mop I&apos;d have gone to scout camp,&quot; mumbled Bathonian Kev. And the food. A tight budget in a very expensive country meant a slim menu of basic and tinned ingredients (porridge, lentils, bread and tinned tomatoes were staples) not helped by a kitchen featuring two hot plates and a semi-functioning oven. Spirits nose-dived after personal food stashes were plundered by some of the volunteers (we never found out who was responsible). But the experience was overall, incredible. I stretched myself beyond my wildest imagination. I learnt to operate a dive compressor and smash a coconut husk on a metal spike to open it. I&apos;ve got new friends in Zurich, Amsterdam, Berlin and Brighton. I know a mushroom coral from a fungiidae and a stichopus from a sea cucumber and my enjoyment of diving has increased 10-fold. Our data will be published in the Status of Coral Reefs of the World. Over 10 weeks we surveyed hundreds of square metres of reef. We logged 116 turtles, 47 dolphins, 10 octopus, one whale shark and 211 incidental sightings including guitar sharks, sailfish, devil rays, puffer fish and Humphead wrasse \u2026 According to dive project manager Mario there were also two known cases of underwater sex (a pair of turtles being one), one missing eyebrow and 14 incidences of skipping base without telling anyone you were &quot;giving yourself the day off&quot;. Some days were tough but if there&apos;s one thing my backpacker days taught me, it&apos;s that there&apos;s a carefree parallel universe out there whose only entry requirements are a sabbatical and a sense of adventure. \u2022 Global Vision International (01727 250250; gvi.co.uk) offers five- and 10-week placements on its Marine Conservation in the Seychelles programme for \u00a31,745 and \u00a32,745 respectively, with monthly departures.

Gyliano van Velzen, a Dutch under-16 international, has turned his back on Ajax&apos;s famed youth academy and agreed terms at Old Trafford in a deal that has incensed the Amsterdam club. Van Velzen, a tall, left-sided midfielder, initially informed Ajax in March that he had received an offer to move to Manchester, but the teenager was dissuaded from going through with the move and decided to stay with the &apos;B1&apos; under-17s&apos; team. The issue seemed to be resolved until Van Velzen returned to Ajax a few weeks ago and informed them that his parents had decided they wanted to move to England to start a new life. The family, it emerged, had been offered a house in the Manchester area and Van Velzen, affiliated to Ajax since the age of 13, arrived towards the end of last week. Ajax, renowned for producing so many outstanding Dutch footballers, are said to be &quot;surprised and disappointed.&quot; They have written to United&apos;s chief executive, David Gill, asking for compensation and, if they are not satisfied with the response, they will look at other options. One report in Holland has claimed they will file a lawsuit via Fifa, although it is understood they would rather settle the matter without having to take legal action. The dispute bears similarities to the Paul Pogba case last year when Le Havre complained to Fifa that the 17-year-old had been illegally poached from their academy only for the organisation to rule in United&apos;s favour. After eight months of wrangling over compensation, the two clubs finally reached an undisclosed settlement in June. A spokesman for United said that Van Velzen had been signed in full accordance with Fifa regulations. Their argument is that the player had never signed professional terms and, as such, was on the market.

The American actor will be directed by Sam Mendes in what will be the final production for the Bridge Project, a three-year transatlantic collaboration that has seen US and British actors tour the world in productions including The Tempest, As You Like It and The Cherry Orchard. Spacey, the Old Vic&apos;s artistic director, will open at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) Harvey theatre in New York in February 2012 before opening in London in May and running throughout the London 2012 Olympics. The Bridge Project has been a collaboration between the Old Vic, BAM and Mendes&apos;s production company, Neal Street. Mendes and Spacey worked together on the film American Beauty in 1999, for which they both won Oscars. Mendes said: &quot;I am absolutely delighted to be working with Kevin again for the first time since American Beauty and I am doubly thrilled that he will be leading year three of the Bridge Project. Richard III is a play I love, and a role I think Kevin is born to play. &quot;I&apos;m also thrilled that the partnership between our three entities has strengthened and blossomed over the course of this venture, along with a host of invaluable international partnerships that have enabled us to extend the reach of global touring year after year.&quot; Spacey, who took over artistic control of the Old Vic in 2003, was similarly excited. &quot;Sam is one of the finest directors I have had the pleasure to work with and to gain this opportunity is beyond my wildest hopes. &quot;I love Sam&apos;s perspective on a role, carving and shaping the actor. With such a remarkable character before me, I have a feeling this one is going to be a memorable experience.&quot; Richard III, the villainous king made more vengeful and ambitious because of his hunched back, has some of Shakespeare&apos;s best known lines \u2013 &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent&quot; and &quot;A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse&quot; \u2013 and has been played by most of the great stage actors.

The 10 debut titles in the running for the \u00a310,000 award range from dystopian fiction to popular psychology, and span the globe from Somalia to Finland, Kashmir to Winston Churchill&apos;s family home in Kent. War stalks the pages of the best-known novel on the list, Nadifa Mohamed&apos;s Black Mamba Boy, which was longlisted for the Orange prize and has already won the 2010 Betty Trask award. Mohamed takes the story of her father, who left Somalia as a boy and settled in the UK after crossing Africa, and transforms it into fiction inflected by the African tradition of praise poetry. Starting as a 10-year-old boy in 1930s Somalia and journeying through Djibouti, Eritrea, Sudan and Egypt to freedom in Britain, Mohamed&apos;s main character witnesses key moments in the African experience of the second world war and embodies the itinerant experience of the Somali community. According to the chair of the judges, the Guardian&apos;s literary editor Claire Armitstead, Mohamed is just one of a group of young British authors on the longlist who are expanding the territory of the novel. &quot;This year&apos;s longlist brings together a younger generation of writers who have moved beyond the social realism of Martin Amis and Ian McEwan, and are pushing at the boundaries of realist fiction,&quot; she said. Armitstead also cited Rebecca Hunt, whose novel Mr Chartwell imagines the depression that haunts both Winston Churchill and a young woman in Battersea as a huge black dog, and Ned Beauman, who explores Nazism, eugenics and entomology in Boxer, Beetle, as responding to the changes in publishing and wider society with fiction that enlarges the possibilities of the novel. Speaking to the Guardian, Beauman, who expressed his &quot;delight&quot; at finding himself on the longlist, agreed that there was an impulse towards experimentation, but not necessarily in imposing what he called &quot;the literary equivalent of recessional austerity measures&quot;. &quot;Paring away plot, character, humour, lyricism, humanity is more often boring than it is bold,&quot; he said. &quot;The Americans know this, and indeed all I did in Boxer, Beetle was smuggle a few postmodern devices across the Atlantic, but at the moment a lot of British readers seem to be falling for this idea that the most interesting fiction has to involve rather dated Modernist self-flagellation.&quot; After the success of projects as various as Inglourious Basterds and The Kindly Ones, he confessed himself unworried by the difficulty of attracting readers to a story which combines the Third Reich and cockroaches. &quot;What has emerged as a bigger obstacle is that everyone finds all the characters so horrible,&quot; he said, &quot;which had honestly never occurred to me when I was writing it.&quot; Steven Amsterdam, whose episodic novel Things We Didn&apos;t See Coming considers how we might retain our humanity in a future ruled by environmental and technological catastrophe, and Maile Chapman, whose Your Presence is Requested at Suvanto evokes life in a 1920s Finnish asylum, are the two remaining novelists on the list. Alexandra Harris looks back at the early 20th century through a different lens in Romantic Moderns, a study of how English writers, painters, gardeners, architects, critics and composers imbued the artistic revolutions coming across the channel with a nostalgic sense of place. Daniel Swift considers the lack of imagination that powers modern warfare in Bomber County, an investigation into the death of his grandfather which was sparked by Robert Graves&apos;s observation that the second world war produced no great poets. Basharat Peer, meanwhile, reports from the frontline of the conflict between India and Pakistan in a return to his troubled homeland of Kashmir in Curfewed Night. Kathryn Schulz&apos;s Being Wrong, an exploration of how our convictions shape our lives despite being riddled with error, and Katharine Towers&apos;s The Floating Man, a collection of poetry haunted by music and water, complete the list. Armitstead will be joined on the judging panel by the artistic director of the ICA, Ekow Eshun, the author Adam Foulds, the biographer Richard Holmes, the actor Diana Quick, the Guardian&apos;s deputy editor, Kath Viner, and Stuart Broom from Waterstone&apos;s, who will represent the views of five reading groups hosted in Waterstone&apos;s bookshops around the country. Last year&apos;s winner was the Zimbabwean writer Petina Gappah, for her collection of short stories, An Elegy for Easterly. She joined a roster of winners from the 12-year history of the award that includes Zadie Smith, Alex Ross and Jonathan Safran Foer.

This week, it emerged that 150,000 young people won&apos;t even get into university. Some bright person came up with the idea of sending lots of these unfortunates off to foreign countries on a gap year, purportedly so they can learn new skills and improve their employability \u2013 oh, and learn about other cultures and stuff. Many of these gappers will end up in bars on Brunswick Street, Melbourne. Some will populate the hostels of Barcelona and Amsterdam and Tallinn, trading drinking games for syphilis. Still others will bathe Argentinean lepers or irrigate fields in Malawi. And then there are those poor, misguided souls who will arrive in India, bringing with them enthusiasm and naivete. I remember the first gapper I met in Mumbai. He was a skinny 17-year-old who sat motionless at the edge of an iron bench in my friend&apos;s garden, too terrified to say anything other than a grateful &quot;yes, please&quot; when somebody offered him a beer. I can see why. Too many of the visitors I&apos;ve met came to India expecting a spiritual, magical land filled with wonder and wisdom and yoga \u2013 always yoga. All of this exists. But to the general dismay of all concerned, you can only fly into the major cities, which means negotiating an overpopulated third-world metropolis before venturing into the elephant- and cliche-filled rural heartlands. I never saw that terrified tourist again. But if he was anything like the other young gappers who grace our shores, his trajectory probably went something like this: terror, regret, drunkenness, acceptance, optimism, drunkenness, self-discovery, drunkenness, drunkenness, smug satisfaction at having had the courage to discover the real India, which nobody else ever has or ever will, drunkenness, Heathrow. I should probably mention how cheap alcohol is in India. Very. It&apos;s not just the increased quantities of vomit on our streets that is of concern (considering that half the population of Mumbai doesn&apos;t have access to sanitation, a little extra human waste is the least of our worries). What is most annoying is the attitude of those who claim to have been there, seen that and really, really understood all of it. When we see you bargaining with a hawker over a 50-rupee (70p) trinket that you think is worth only half as much, we know you&apos;ve spent between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 for a few months off \u2013 more than even most middle-aged, middle-class Indians make in a year. When you act like you understand what&apos;s going on just because you&apos;ve travelled around the country for three months, we know you&apos;ve failed to notice the special treatment you&apos;ve been getting at, for example, hostels that won&apos;t let Indians in because we might disturb your lot. When you get into a bar in sandals while we&apos;ve been informed of a &quot;strict dress code&quot;, we notice that, too. When you talk about spirituality and helping the poor, we know you have to do some suitably noble tasks between weeks spent smoking pot on Anjuna beach so the admissions committee at your university of choice doesn&apos;t think you&apos;re a complete wastrel. So come on over. Ride some elephants, feed the poor, feel enriched and go home with great stories. Tell your friends, tell the dons, tell the HR managers who interview you one day.

Instead Howell decided to test himself at higher levels, at three strong European events in two of which he was seeded near the bottom. The policy looked dubious in the early rounds of the young grandmasters invitation at Biel, Switzerland where Howell began with 1.5/6. But the Sussex teenager, who sometimes used to fade under pressure, fought back to a solid 3\u00bd/9. Then he made a strong 8\u00bd/11 total in the highly rated world rapids (30-minute games) in Mainz, Germany, losing only to Russia&apos;s elite GM Sergey\u00a0Karjakin. This week Howell was the second-lowest-ranked player in the Youth v Experience match in Amsterdam, where five mainly teenage talents met a quintet of mostly elite GMs. Again he began with a defeat, against Israel&apos;s No1 and World Cup winner Boris Gelfand, but again he recovered with excellent wins against No1s from Holland and Denmark to finish with 4\u00bd/10. The upshot is that Howell will have kept his precious 2600+ international rating and will start next month&apos;s world team Olympiad in Russia, where he plays No4 for England, in good form and with a big gain in confidence. The lurking question, though, is whether these achievements are enough to sustain him as a long-term professional player at a time when major chess events are under growing pressure from the recession. Despite setting age records for British chess and being close with his 2600+ rating to the world top 100, he ranks only world No15 among under-20s. The year of his birth, 1990, has turned out the supreme vintage year in chess history, producing the world No1 Magnus Carlsen, Karjakin, and others who have already reached or are close to the elite 2700 level. Howell stated at Amsterdam that he was still unsure whether to continue as a chess pro or to join his friends at university. There is also a third way, taken by England&apos;s 1990s star Matthew Sadler, who reached the world top 30 by his mid-twenties then gave up chess for a career in technology. Howell&apos;s win from Denmark&apos;s No1 came in a sharp Ruy Lopez where 5...Ne7 (f6) is dubious. If 11...Qxa1 12 Nc3 Black&apos;s queen is in trouble, while 14...f4?! (Be6 and 0-0-0) was met by 16 c4! provoking Bf5?! (Ne7). At the end White&apos;s rare four-pawn centre is decisive, as Black soon loses his c7 pawn and is then crushed by the phalanx.

US investigators are pursuing leads in three American cities, according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. The arrests come at a time of heightened alert just days before the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the US. On Sunday, authorities found the suspicious items: a mobile phone taped to a medicine bottle, multiple mobile phones and watches taped together, and a knife and boxcutter in one of the men&apos;s checked luggage. The man and his luggage were headed to separate international destinations, which also raised concerns. None of the items found on the men or in their luggage violated US security rules. But the items and the men&apos;s changing travel itinerary may have been a deliberate test of the US aviation security system to determine what would raise red flags. Neither man was on any US terror watch lists, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN today. A US law enforcement official identified the men as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al-Soofi and Hezam al-Murisi. Soofi is of Yemeni descent, an official said. The pair were arrested yesterday at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport after getting off a United Airlines flight from Chicago. RTL television news broadcast video footage filmed on a passenger&apos;s mobile phone of armed law enforcement officers escorting two men off the plane, their hands bound behind their backs. The officers&apos; weapons were holstered and there appeared to be no resistance. They were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit acts of terror, but neither has been charged with any offence in the Netherlands, the national prosecutor&apos;s office said. Under Dutch law, the men can be held without charges for up to six days. No charges have been filed against the men in the US, a law enforcement official said. Soofi was questioned as he went through security in Birmingham, Alabama, on his way to Chicago, one of the officials said. He told the Transportation Security Administration authorities he was carrying a lot of cash. Screeners found $7,000 (\u00a34,500) on him, but he was not breaking any law by carrying that much money. Soofi was supposed to fly from Chicago to Washington Dulles airport in Virginia and then on to Dubai, one of the officials said. But when he got to Chicago, he changed his travel plans to take a direct flight to Amsterdam, while his luggage went on to Virginia. On international flights, passengers and their luggage must be headed toward the same destination, according to US policy. Murisi also changed his travel plans in Chicago to take a direct flight to Amsterdam, raising suspicion among US officials. Federal air marshals were on the flight from Chicago to Amsterdam, a law enforcement official said. Homeland security spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said once officials found suspicious items in luggage associated with two passengers on Sunday night&apos;s flight, they notified the Dutch authorities.", "sentences": ["Two men arrested in Amsterdam may have been conducting a dry run for a potential terrorist attack, US officials said today after a mobile phone taped to a bottle of medicine and a knife and boxcutters were found in one of the men&apos;s luggage.", "The pair were arrested yesterday at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport after getting off a United Airlines flight from Chicago.", "But when he got to Chicago, he changed his travel plans to take a direct flight to Amsterdam, while his luggage went on to Virginia.", "Murisi also changed his travel plans in Chicago to take a direct flight to Amsterdam, raising suspicion among US officials.", "Federal air marshals were on the flight from Chicago to Amsterdam, a law enforcement official said."], "title": "Schiphol arrests: US officials suspect terror 'dry run'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/31/dutch-police-suspicious-items-transatlantic", "tags": ["Netherlands", "US news", "US national security", "Air transport", "World news", "Europe", "Amsterdam Airport Schiphol"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-08-31T17:38:36Z", "article": "Two men of Yemeni origin who flew from Chicago to Amsterdam yesterday were being held by Dutch police today on suspicion of plotting terrorism. Dutch investigators said: &quot;The men are held in custody on suspicion of a conspiracy to a terrorist criminal act. In a few days it will be made public if they will be charged.&quot; They can be held for six days without charge. The two men, named by US authorities as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al-Soofi and Hezam al-Murisi, took a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Amsterdam on Monday despite being booked on a different itinerary from Chicago, to Dubai via Washington. Their luggage, however, went not on the Amsterdam flight but to Washington, raising questions about US airport and flight security in the anxious run-up to the 9/11 anniversary. Worried US officials scrambled to retrieve the suspect luggage, said to belong to Soofi, which had already been transported on a domestic US flight from Chicago to Dulles airport in Washington. It was found to contain a mobile phone taped to a bottle of medicine, several other mobiles taped together and several watches similarly parcelled together. There was also a knife and a Stanley knife. There were no explosives. The Americans contacted the Dutch authorities and requested the arrests, speculating that the two men may have been conducting a &quot;dummy run&quot;, testing US and European airport security. There was nothing illegal in the luggage and Soofi had already told US security that he was carrying $7,000(\u00a34,500) in cash. Both men were destined for Dubai, apparently en route to their home country of Yemen, which US intelligence regards as an al-Qaida stronghold. &quot;The arrest[s] took place on the basis of information provided by the US authorities. The two men have Yemen nationality. They were supposed to be travelling on to Sana&apos;a in Yemen,&quot; said a Dutch police statement. Despite being held by the Dutch, it appeared that there were scant grounds for prosecution. In the US, government officials said the two men did not know one another, were not travelling together, and were unlikely to be charged. A film of the arrests on the UA plane at Schiphol airport outside Amsterdam, shot by a passenger by mobile phone, showed the two men being led away quietly in handcuffs without fuss or commotion. It appeared that the men had missed their Chicago-Washington flight and that the airline had rebooked them on to the flight to Amsterdam, from where they were to fly home. As the suspicions of terrorism-linked activity were dissolving , questions were being asked about how the luggage was allowed to travel unaccompanied. It was only when US security realised that the men had not boarded the Washington flight and were not on the plane from Washington to Dubai that the aircraft was grounded and the luggage retrieved. &quot;It is astonishing that the US security system did not prevent abandoned luggage to be carried from Chicago to Washington,&quot; said Claude Moraes, a Labour MEP in the European parliament monitoring negations between Brussels and Washington over transatlantic air security arrangements. &quot;Databanks and body scanners can do really little when basic security measures and procedures are not implemented.&quot; Security at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport was reinforced this year, after the abortive Christmas Day terrorism attack when a Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, flew from the Netherlands to Detroit with explosives in his underwear, failing to blow himself up over US territory before being wrestled by passengers and crew.

Amsterdam&apos;s finest was conducted by its music director, Mariss Jansons, whose pair of programmes ventured significantly outside the repertory he normally conducts in Britain. The first concert was an all 20th-century affair, while the second was devoted to Mahler&apos;s Third\u00a0Symphony. Stravinsky&apos;s Symphonies of Wind Instruments was pungent, bright-toned and crisply authoritative rather than elegiac. The first movement of Bart\u00f3k&apos;s Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta worked to a gut-wrenching climax; its finale saw an outpouring of irresistible energy. The first half over, wind and strings then combined forces for what was surely the British premiere (though not claimed as such) of Luciano Berio&apos;s Quatre Dedicaces. Four sharply contrasted miniatures, posthumously collected together, they form a sequence in which Berio&apos;s magical way with instrumental colour and texture is crystallised into a glittering display; a perfect showcase for such a\u00a0great\u00a0ensemble.

In one of the web&apos;s fastest-growing environmental campaigns, Greenpeace international says at least 500,000 people have now protested at the organisation&apos;s intention to run its giant new data centre mainly on electricity produced by burning coal power. Facebook will not say how much electricity it uses to stream video, store information and connect its 500m users but industry estimates suggest that at their present rate of growth all the data centres and telecommunication networks in the world will consume about 1,963bn kilowatt hours of electricity by 2020. That is more than triple their current consumption and more electricity than is used by France, Germany, Canada and Brazil combined. Facebook announced in February that it planned to build what is expected to be the world&apos;s largest centralised data storage centres in Portland, Oregon. Although it will include some of the world&apos;s most energy-efficient computers, the sheer scale of the Facebook operation will almost certainly use more electricity than many developing countries. The company has said it will source its electricity from Pacific Power. It uses coal power \u2013 the dirtiest form of power generation \u2013 for 67% of its electricity, and produces less than 12% of its electricity from renewable sources. The company has said it plans to generate more electricity from renewables in future but has given no detailed information. In a statement Facebook said: &quot;It is true that the local utility for the region we chose, Pacific Power, has an energy mix that is weighted slightly more toward coal than the national average. However, the efficiency we are able to achieve because of the climate of the region and the reduced energy usage that results minimises our overall carbon footprint. &quot;Said differently, if we located the data centre most other places, we would need mechanical chillers, use more energy, and be responsible for more overall carbon in the air \u2013 even if that location was fuelled by more renewable energy.&quot; Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International, urged Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to commit his company to a plan to phase out the use of dirty coal-fired electricity. In a letter to Facebook, Naidoo said: &quot;Facebook is uniquely positioned to be a truly visible and influential leader to drive the deployment of clean energy.&quot; Earlier this year Greenpeace admitted that many of its own web hosting operations are also housed in data centres powered primarily by coal and nuclear power.

John Traynor is in Dutch police custody after being detained in Amstelveen, outside Amsterdam, as part of an operation between detectives in Holland and the UK&apos;s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). In a statement today, Soca said Traynor was believed to have been living in the Netherlands for a number of years. Guerin was shot dead by the pillion passenger on a motorbike as she stopped at traffic lights in Naas Road, Dublin, in June 1996. Traynor, 62, has been wanted in the UK for 18 years after absconding from prison one year into a seven-year sentence for handling stolen bearer bonds in London. A prisoner at Highpoint prison, in Suffolk, he was given temporary release, went back to Ireland and did not return. He is now awaiting extradition to the UK to serve the remainder of his sentence. Traynor was one of Guerin&apos;s criminal contacts and, prior to her murder, was seeking a high court order to prevent her from writing about his involvement in organised crime. He hired a gunman to shoot her in the leg a year before another gangland criminal in Dublin had her assassinated. Traynor fled Ireland after she was killed and moved between Spain and the Netherlands. He was arrested with Brian Meehan in Amsterdam in 1997. Meehan was extradited and is now serving life for Guerin&apos;s murder. Traynor was released without charge. A Soca spokesperson said: &quot;He is now awaiting extradition to the UK to serve the remainder of his sentence. &quot;This arrest is as a result of ongoing collaboration with the Dutch authorities that Soca has to apprehend criminals operating in the Netherlands that impact on the UK.&quot; It is expected that Traynor will appear in court in the coming days. There are no outstanding warrants for Traynor in the Irish Republic. Traynor was an associate of Dublin criminal boss Martin Cahill, also known as The General, and was also close to John Gilligan. Gilligan was cleared of the murder of Guerin in 2001. He was jailed by the special criminal court for 28 years for importing cannabis resin, the longest sentence handed down in Ireland for drugs offences. Traynor was involved in a wide variety of criminal enterprises, from organising armed robberies to drug smuggling, embezzlement and prostitution. He was the second in command and main adviser of the drug-smuggling gang broken up by the Garda investigation into the Guerin murder. He also had contacts with the Irish National Liberation Army. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2010. The original referred to Naas, just outside Dublin.

Landed in a qualifying group which also includes Spain and the Czech Republic, the Scots needed to glean six points from their meetings with Lithuania to keep hopes of an appearance at Euro 2012 alive. Scotland&apos;s unrewarded domination here in Kaunas last night, particularly during the second half, will pray on the manager&apos;s mind. For the remainder of Levein&apos;s tenure, he is unlikely to see his team enjoy as much possession away from home as they did here. &quot;We had the opportunities to win,&quot; he said. &quot;All our performance lacked was a goal. &quot;They had a tactic which was to foul, but they were going five and six without getting a booking,&quot; he added. &quot;It is important that the referee looks after things like that, but he didn&apos;t.&quot; Levein described a late lunge by Kestutis Ivaskevicius on Alan Hutton as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Stockholm, Cardiff, Oslo, Skopje and Amsterdam are among the cities Scotland have visited in the recent past. Victory has not been forthcoming in any of them. The continued faith of the Tartan Army, 3,000 of whom made the journey, is baffling. Yellow cards for two members of Lithuania&apos;s back four, issued within 20 minutes, illustrated the home side&apos;s combative approach and it was they who created the first meaningful chance, when Allan McGregor was forced to make a fine stop from a Saulius Mikoliunas shot. His opposite number, Zydrunas Karcemarskas, was similarly smart in clawing away two long-range efforts from Barry Robson. Stephen McManus also volleyed narrowly wide, having collected a Darren Fletcher free-kick. Levein had banked on experience to improve fortunes. David Weir \u2013 at 40, three years older than Lithuania&apos;s manager \u2013 and Lee McCulloch had returned. Youthfulness and pace was to be supplied by Steven Naismith, who was lively enough during the first-half. Hutton, having made a surprising recovery from groin surgery, offered further attacking presence with marauding runs from full-back. There was an anxious moment for Scotland as half-time approached, Mikoliunas falling \u2013 all too readily \u2013 inside the area under a challenge from Scott Brown. The Turkish referee waved away claims for a penalty, however, but only after a pause. Robson&apos;s cross to the unmarked Kenny Miller moments after the restart afforded Scotland their first clear-cut opportunity. But the Rangers striker, who has opened the domestic season in terrific form, should have done better than supply a tame header, which sailed into the home goalkeeper&apos;s hands. The appearance of Kris Boyd and McFadden warming up on the track suggested Levein was perplexed by Scotland&apos;s bluntness. The manager could at least take solace from the presence of Weir at the other end, with the veteran coping with what little Lithuania threw towards him. Naismith was the next Scot to be foiled, shooting again straight at Karcemarskas while under no pressure, in another example of wastefulness. If it was clear long before full time that Lithuania would be the grateful recipients of a point, Scotland&apos;s desperation grew. That emotion, though, rarely triggers the composure needed to prise open teams, as proved the case.", "sentences": ["Stockholm, Cardiff, Oslo, Skopje and Amsterdam are among the cities Scotland have visited in the recent past."], "title": "Lithuania 0-0 Scotland | Euro 2012 Group I qualifier", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/03/lithuania-scotland-euro-2012", "tags": ["Lithuania", "Scotland", "Football", "Sport", "Euro 2012 qualifiers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-09-03T23:04:49Z", "article": "Apocalyptic fiction tends to follow an irresistible drive towards vanishing point, the moment the last lights go out. The genius of Steven Amsterdam&apos;s sprightly debut, which has been longlisted for the Guardian first book award, lies in its stop-start structure: through nine disconnected episodes in the life of its unnamed narrator we are offered an alternate version of the first half of the 21st century, as humanity struggles with environmental degradation, resource wars and epidemics, moving through periods of terror, stability, reckless hedonism and the constant need to rebuild and readjust to a violently changing climate. We have a particular susceptibility to apocalypse at the moment, with climate change such a pressing threat. But as the narrator&apos;s grandfather says in the first section, &quot;What We Know Now&quot; \u2013 a witty reminder of the millennial panic over that putative Y2K computer meltdown - &quot;It&apos;s always been the end of the world. What did we have this century? World War I, the influenza, the Depression, World War II, concentration camps, the atomic bomb . . .&quot; The narrator is only a child when his father, convinced that &quot;the future is a hospital&quot;, hustles his exasperated wife and son out of the city to rural safety on New Year&apos;s Eve 1999. His desperate apologies to the boy, as they hide out in the woods while the world fails to end, are as much for his inability to control his own fears as for the dangerous times to come. When we next meet the narrator a few years later, as a sarcastic wise-ass teenager, a barricade has already been erected between countryside and city, and food and water are rationed. He takes a chaotic road trip into the country with his ailing grandparents: a blackly comic caper punctuated with tender memories of their long marriage. As in all the episodes, Amsterdam sketches in the immediate details with a brilliantly vivid economy, gesturing with the lightest of touches at tectonic shifts in society beyond. By the third section things have taken a shocking turn for the worse: lashed by famine and relentless rains, our narrator is working for the government, evacuating the floodlands, surviving on rats and treebark while rescuing what spoils he can from abandoned mansions. We meet him at camps and disaster sites, fleeing contagion and heartbreak, taking refuge in a self-sufficient gated community and guiding the terminally ill on last-gasp adventure holidays (&quot;Each one a little star, burning out brightly&quot;). In a period of relative calm he hitches his own to a charismatic leader in a political interlude that is all the more powerful for being framed almost entirely in personal terms. He&apos;s a survivor, a fixer, a slacker-Everyman and a deadpan comic, as in this riff on the uses of vinegar: &quot;We&apos;re washing our hair with it (lice), and washing our fruit in it (contaminants). Plus someone&apos;s figured out that if you drink a quarter cup of it a day, the Brazilian stingers seem to leave you alone. And believe me, none of that comes out nicely at the portable toilets.&quot; Where recent eco-dystopias such as The Road or Year of the Flood conjured an environmental degradation that degrades humanity&apos;s moral sense beyond repair, Amsterdam&apos;s tone is refreshingly unapocalyptic, and his novel is more interesting for it. The love and yearning that suffuse it, as the narrator struggles to balance his emotions with his survival, give it a tender power, while much of the business of disaster is recognisably administrative: doling out relocation grants, &quot;clos[ing] out mortgages on exploded houses&quot;. Though there are chilling hints of nightmarish violence elsewhere, Amsterdam focuses on the more familiar spectres of privilege and inequality. &quot;Someone always has the money, right? You worked that out a long time ago, didn&apos;t you?&quot; says the narrator&apos;s father on finding him &quot;safely on the inside again&quot;, cushioned by government jobs and private enterprise. In one of the novel&apos;s rare false notes, the narrator worries repeatedly about his moral agency in the free-for-all of social chaos. Though scavenging is the new way of life, he is horrified by the bitter prophecy of a dying plague victim that &quot;If you survive this, you&apos;re going to have it all&quot; \u2013 first pick of real estate and consumer goods in a city full of corpses. The dreamlike section in which he is tempted with stolen jewels while being tested for employment suitability by the new government is unusual for feeling clumsily abstract and forced. For the book as a whole is a small marvel, overflowing with ideas. Scary, funny, shocking and touching by turns, it combines the readerly pleasures of constant reorientation with the sober charge of an urgent warning.

Built during the second world war, the wards of wing 21B are these days committed to the treatment of drug addiction. Susannah is a long-term drug user and is intelligent but troubled. She first smoked cannabis at 13. At 17, she began taking heroin with the father of her children. Now 37, she has been dependent on drugs \u2013 mostly heroin \u2013 for almost two decades. &quot;I lived in Spain for a while,&quot; she tells me. &quot;And London for a year, working in the restaurants with a friend. I went there to try to get off drugs but ended up on crack.&quot; These days, however, Susannah, who also suffers from a bipolar disorder, is one of the beneficiaries of Europe&apos;s most tolerant drug regime. For in Portugal, where Susannah lives, drugs have not only been decriminalised for almost a decade, but users are treated as though they have a health and social problem. Addicts such as Susannah are helped by the law, not penalised and stigmatised by it. In the midst of the recently resurgent debate in Britain about whether our drug laws are working \u2013 or require a major overhaul \u2013 the experience of Portugal has become a crucial piece of evidence in favour of a radical approach that has confounded the expectations of even its conservative critics, so much so that in the last month British officials have asked their Portuguese counterparts for advice, with the only caveat being that they avoid mentioning the word &quot;decriminalise&quot;. It is, perhaps, an unnecessary sensitivity. For the reality is that, despite liberalising how it regards drug possession \u2013 now largely an administrative problem rather than a criminal offence \u2013 Portugal has not become a magnet for drug tourists like Amsterdam, as some had predicted. British officials are not the only ones who have made the pilgrimage to Portugal in recent years \u2013 health specialists, officials and journalists from around the world have all made the journey to see what Portugal is doing right, even as their own countries are still struggling. Nor has it seen its addict population markedly increase. Rather it has stabilised in a nation that, along with the UK and Luxembourg, once had the worst heroin problem in Europe. For Susannah \u2013 as for the many long-term addicts now on methadone replacement and other programmes, and for the country&apos;s health professionals \u2013 the country&apos;s recent social history is divided into what the world of addiction and drug use was like before Law 30 was approved in November 2000, and what it is like now. Before the law, which decriminalised (or depenalised) possession of drugs but still prohibited their use, the story of drug addiction in Portugal was a familiar one. More than 50% of those infected with HIV in Portugal were drug addicts, with new diagnoses of HIV among addicts running at about 3,000 a year. These days, addicts account for only 20% of those who are HIV infected, while the number of new HIV diagnoses of addicts has fallen to fewer than 2,000 a year. Other measures have been equally encouraging. Deaths of street users from accidental overdoses also appear to have declined, as \u2013 anecdotal evidence strongly suggests \u2013 has petty crime associated with addicts who were stealing to maintain their habits. Recent surveys in schools also suggest an overall decrease in drug experimentation. At the same time, the number of those in treatment for their addiction problems has risen by about a third from 23,500 in 1998 to 35,000 today \u2013 helped by a substantial increase in available beds, facilities and medical support \u2013 with many going on to methadone replacement programmes. The consequence is that perhaps as much as \u20ac400m (\u00a3334m) has been taken out of the illegal drugs market. But decriminalisation, as Portuguese officials and others who have observed the country&apos;s experience are at pains to point out, was only the most obvious part of what happened 10 years ago in the midst of a similar debate on drugs to the one now going on in the UK. Then, in a moment of grand vision powered by an inquiry which recommended a wholesale overhaul of Portugal&apos;s anti-drugs policy in 1998, the government opted to make wholesale changes to the way Portugal dealt with the issue, giving a huge boost in resources to everything from prevention to harm reduction, treatment and reintegration \u2013 creating an entirely joined-up approach to drug abuse under the auspices of a single unit in the ministry of health. It marked an acceptance that for many, living drug-free was neither realistic nor possible and that what society needed to do was mitigate the risk individuals posed to themselves and a wider population at large by helping them manage their problems. Susannah&apos;s doctor, the head of treatment at the Centro das Taipas, is Dr Miguel Vasconcelos. He frames Portuguese drug laws in a way that I hear repeated several times. Within certain clearly defined limits \u2013 an amount equivalent to 10 days&apos; normal use of any particular drug, ranging from amphetamines and cannabis to heroin \u2013 possession, he explains, is now considered similar to a traffic offence. It is a notion I find later described in the Portuguese drug strategy document as a &quot;humanistic&quot; approach. Vasconcelos, 51, is old enough to remember what it was like before, in a country which, two decades ago, barely had a methadone replacement programme at all. In his office, decorated with artworks by his clients, Vasconcelos says: &quot;Critics from the conservative parties were concerned that the new law would make Portugal a place like Amsterdam, but that did not happen. &quot;You have to remember,&quot; he says, &quot;that the substances are still illegal; it is the consequences that are different.&quot; And for those arrested in possession of drugs for personal use, that means not a court appearance but an invitation to attend a &quot;dissuasion board&quot; that can request \u2013 but not insist upon \u2013 attendance at facilities such as the Centro das Taipas for assessment and treatment. &quot;They evaluate if someone is ill or a recreational user, if a person uses sporadically,&quot; says Vasconselos. &quot;Even then people have a choice. People can refuse to attend the dissuasion board.&quot; For many, he believes, the experience can be cathartic and he admits being surprised by how open many of the clients who have come to his facility via that system have been . If there has been a problem with the Portuguese experiment, he believes that it has been one largely of perception \u2013 outside Portugal \u2013 where decriminalisation has been misunderstood by some as legalisation or a step on the road to it. Rather, Vasconcelos believes that decriminalisation is a natural consequence of a gradual shift from regarding addicts as social delinquents to regarding them as people in need of help, a view reiterated by Dr Manuel Cardoso, a board member at the Instituto da Droga e da Toxicodepend\u00eancia at Portugal&apos;s health ministry, which now co-ordinates the country&apos;s approach to drug abuse. At the centre of Portugal&apos;s deeply pragmatic approach are the dissuasion boards. Lisbon&apos;s board \u2013 which deals with 2,000 cases a year \u2013 sits in a modest office on the second floor of a block above a pretty park. There are no lawyers (although they can attend) and no clerks in robes. No uniforms at all. Last Friday, on one side of the table were Nadia Simoes and Nuno Portugal Capaz, both members of the commission. On the other was a 19-year-old barman in a white T-shirt who allowed the Observer to observe the confidential process but asked not to be named. Stopped by police with 5.2 grams of cannabis, he is marginally over the limit of what can be dealt with by the dissuasion board alone and has had to appear in court as well. It is the young man&apos;s first offence. He looks nervous. But it quickly becomes clear that this is a non-confrontational process, as Simoes explains that while possession of drugs for personal use is not a criminal offence, it is still forbidden. The man nods his understanding. Simoes explains the risks of smoking cannabis, including schizophrenia, and the sanctions the board can impose for second offences, including a fine or community service. Licences crucial to employment can also be revoked. As the process concludes, the barman looks relieved and promises to stop smoking. As he leaves, Capaz stands up and shakes his hand. The whole thing has lasted less than 10 minutes. A sociologist by training, Capaz is a vice-president on the board. He believes that far from Portugal becoming more lenient, the reality is that the state intervenes far more than it did before Law 30 and the other associated legislation was introduced. Before, he explains, police would often not pursue drug users they had arrested, interested only in the dealers. &quot;People outside Portugal believe we had a tougher approach under the old law, but in reality it is far tougher now.&quot; Now everyone who is caught with drugs must go before one of the 20\u00a0boards in the country to be categorised as either a recreational user, someone with a developing problem, or an addict. And while some 30% choose to refuse to appear at the first summons, most \u2013 when threatened with a fine for disobedience \u2013 eventually attend. Capaz has been involved since the very beginning and is struck by two things. The first is how Portuguese society has come to accept that addicts and drug users should be treated as a social rather than a criminal problem. The second, he explains, is that under the old criminal system all of those caught were supposed to be equal before the law. &quot;With this system,&quot; he explains, &quot;We do it the other way. We can apply the law in a way that fits the individual.&quot; Indeed, the law recognises that for addicts certain sanctions are not appropriate. While recreational users can be fined, the law prevents addicts from having a financial penalty imposed for fear that in trying to raise the fine they might be driven to commit a crime. But not everyone is totally convinced. Not even among the people who have dedicated their lives to assisting addicts. Francisco Chaves runs a modern shelter for street addicts close to Casal Vendoso, a place once notorious for its drug problems. &quot;I want to explain first that this is not my profession but a vocation,&quot; he explains by way of introduction. He wants, however, to pose a &quot;rhetorical question&quot; which turns out to be more passionate intervention than a debating point. He is concerned that under the &quot;humanistic approach&quot; enshrined in Portugal&apos;s decade-old laws \u2013 in its concern for the human rights of the addict \u2013 perhaps too much pressure to change may have been taken off addicts. &quot;I worry that it has become too easy being an addict now,&quot; he says. &quot;They can say: &apos;I&apos;ve got clean clothes. I&apos;ve got food. Support. So why should I change?&apos;&quot; He says this sadly, because he agrees that addicts should be treated properly but cannot avoid &quot;the paradox of the situation&quot;. &quot;I say it is a rhetorical question because places like this are required. It is a personal, philosophical question.&quot; But it is one without any obvious answer. Outside his office in the large, bright space where addicts are lolling on the sofa, eating or watching television, I encounter Fernando Almeida, 31, who has been a heroin addict since he was 19. A thief \u2013 who stole to support his habit \u2013 he was recently released from prison and found a place at this centre. When he arrived six months ago, he weighed 55 kilos. These days he weighs 73kg and appears both lucid and motivated. &quot;In the old days I used to get hassled by the police. Now the police don&apos;t interfere with me,&quot; he says. &quot;I used to steal. Now I&apos;m not going to steal anymore. For me the solution is to stop. I&apos;ve discovered food and small things like taking a walk and having a coffee. I&apos;m learning how to work.&quot;", "sentences": ["For the reality is that, despite liberalising how it regards drug possession \u2013 now largely an administrative problem rather than a criminal offence \u2013 Portugal has not become a magnet for drug tourists like Amsterdam, as some had predicted.", "In his office, decorated with artworks by his clients, Vasconcelos says: &quot;Critics from the conservative parties were concerned that the new law would make Portugal a place like Amsterdam, but that did not happen."], "title": "What Britain could learn from Portugal's drugs policy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/05/portugal-drugs-debate", "tags": ["Drugs policy", "Portugal", "Drugs", "Health", "Society", "Politics", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-09-06T09:19:32Z", "article": "Given that so many people sent so many excellent nominations in for the first round of this year&apos;s Not the Booker prize, you might think I&apos;d start this blog by beaming with pleasure at the success of proceedings so far.

And if I don&apos;t emphasise this point strongly enough, then that wonderful first round of the competition will all count for nothing. So, here goes. Pay careful attention:You only have until midnight 6 September 2010 \u2013 TONIGHT \u2013 to get your votes for the shortlist in. That&apos;s to say, not very much time at all. So get voting!

Yes, there&apos;s also a good strong showing for the kind of books you&apos;d expect to appear in the literary pages and contending for prizes, and I&apos;m pleased to note that quite a few books in the running for the real Booker are on our longer list. I&apos;m even hoping this year that some of them will get through, just so we can see how they stack up against the titles that the judges have missed. But the best thing is the fact that there are so many books that won&apos;t have crossed the radar of most people on the literary circuit. So well done you. Just two quick notes before I sign off and you can get on to the serious business of voting. There are a dozen or so books that were nominated and haven&apos;t been included here. That&apos;s because the authors don&apos;t fit in the Booker criteria, or, as was more often the case, the books were published in the wrong year. If you can&apos;t find a book you nominated here and think we&apos;ve got it wrong, do say so in the comments and we&apos;ll look into it. I&apos;ve also made an executive decision to include the couple of nominations for graphic novels. I couldn&apos;t find anything against them in the Booker rules, and thought it might be quite interesting if they got through ... Although, again, let us know if you have objections.

But according to an 18-month study of remote human settlements deep in the Congolese jungle, chimpanzees are being subjected to a &quot;wave of killing&quot; by bushmeat hunters. The scientists who carried out the study believe that the region, in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), is home to at least 35,000 of the unusually large sub-species of chimpanzees. This is probably the largest population of chimps in Africa, but such is the hunger for chimp meat that the researchers believe the animals are facing a &quot;major and urgent threat&quot; and that northern DRC is now &quot;witnessing the beginning of a massive ape decline.&quot; &quot;I was actually astonished to see the sheer quantities of bushmeat being taken out of the forest,&quot; said team member Dr Cleve Hicks, at the University of Amsterdam. &quot;It was really shocking.&quot; He estimates that roughly 440 animals in the region are being slaughtered each year. Because of the remote nature of the terrain and the ferocity of the DRC civil war, it was only in the last decade that the apes were studied in detail by primate researchers. Hicks documented a group of super-sized chimps with a unique culture, including a sighting of the apes feasting on a leopard carcass - although it was unclear whether they had actually killed the animal. He said that the local belief that the animals howl at the moon has never been confirmed. To document the threat posed by bushmeat traders, Hicks and his colleagues conducted regular surveys of bushmeat markets in local towns and on roads on either side of the Uele river in northern DRC. In total they spent 1,365 days in 10 cities and towns and surveyed 13,140km of road. They recorded chimp carcasses and orphans for sale. The primatologist Dr Jane Goodall has estimated that for every chimp orphan that is sold as a pet, 10 others from its family group will have been killed. In total, the team saw 44 orphan chimps and 35 carcasses, plus nine leopard skins, 10 okapi (a type of antelope) skins, parts of 14 elephants, bushmeat from two hippos, 169 monkey carcasses and 69 monkey orphans. Two of the orphan chimps had their top incisors knocked out or burned down with hot knives to prevent them from biting their handlers. The study is published in the peer-reviewed journal African Primates. Almost all of this trade, which the researchers describe as &quot;larger and more widespread than anticipated, and expanding&quot;, is happening in the region south of the Uele river. Here the human population is more dense than to the north because of illegal artisanal goldmining operations. Also local taboos about eating bushmeat have begun to break down in recent years. Hicks, who is also affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said that one tribe, the Barisi, used not to harm the animals because they believed their tribe was descended from a union between a man and a female chimp. The women of two other tribes, the Azande and Babenza, previously refused to eat or cook ape meat for fear that it would result in them giving birth to babies with &quot;big ears&quot;. The spread of a Christian group called the &quot;message believers&quot; whose doctrine is based on the teaching of an American faith healer and preacher called William Branham who died in 1965 has swept away some of the old beliefs. Hicks said that followers interpret his teachings as condoning bushmeat hunting. A spokesperson for William Branham ministries said that this was a misinterpretation of Branham&apos;s teachings. &quot;I have no idea where they would be getting that,&quot; he said. &quot;He didn&apos;t have any type of doctrine where you can eat whatever you want. William Branham was an avid outdoorsman. It was very important to him to follow all the laws of the land.&quot; Hicks said that many people do not know that it is against DRC law to hunt chimpanzees and that the law is not enforced locally. Some of the people who had orphan chimps even showed the researchers documents signed by local officials that purportedly gave them permission to keep the animals. &quot;Once the population is fragmented [its decline] is probably going to speed up rapidly,&quot; said &quot;Hicks. &quot;What we are seeing probably is the beginning of that process. Its not too far gone yet too stop it ... There are very few roads so theoretically it wouldn&apos;t be that difficult to control.&quot; Alice Macharia of the Jane Goodall Institute in Arlington, Virginia said: &quot;The increasing level of the bushmeat trade in this region is truly alarming. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has the largest population of chimpanzees in the wild, the bushmeat trade, the illegal commercial hunting of chimpanzees, remains one of the greatest threats to their survival along with loss of habitat due to deforestation. When roads are cleared to make way for mining, logging and other concessions, hunters have greater access to these endangered animals.&quot;", "sentences": ["This is probably the largest population of chimps in Africa, but such is the hunger for chimp meat that the researchers believe the animals are facing a &quot;major and urgent threat&quot; and that northern DRC is now &quot;witnessing the beginning of a massive ape decline.&quot; &quot;I was actually astonished to see the sheer quantities of bushmeat being taken out of the forest,&quot; said team member Dr Cleve Hicks, at the University of Amsterdam."], "title": "Congolese chimpanzees face new 'wave of killing' for bushmeat", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/07/congo-chimpanzees-bushmeat", "tags": ["Wildlife", "Environment", "Animals", "World news", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-09-07T07:00:49Z", "article": "There are only two things wrong with The Hard Times of RJ Berger (MTV, Sunday): its central premise and everything else. The central premise is that geeky high-school student RJ finds a new lease of social life after it is revealed to the entire school, when his pants fall down during a basketball game, that he has a gigantic schlong. The show&apos;s creators, David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith, call it a cross between The Wonder Years and Hung. Aside from the general ick factor of focusing on a near-child&apos;s genitalia, the set-up does not ring true. The desirability of a giant penis is an adult preoccupation. To deviate from any norm is the greatest sin in the teenage bible. A donkey dong, especially if attached to a nerd, is more likely to draw further ridicule than new respect. But if its content is wrongheaded, its tone is appalling. If the boys&apos; references to their (male) enemies as &quot;bitches&quot; doesn&apos;t tip you off, from the moment the first female character appears (Lily, the mandatory overweight-girlfriend-with-a-crush-on-our-hero), it&apos;s clear what the prevailing sensibility is. &quot;Guess what?&quot; she says, cheerfully. &quot;You&apos;re taking a weedwhacker to that moustache?&quot; RJ&apos;s best friend Miles responds, with a venomous sneer.

When Lily announces that RJ can have her &quot;any time, any place, any orifice&quot;, she sounds less like a teenage girl than an exercise in wish-fulfilment for two adult male writers who have almost literally tossed off a script that does only them any good.

Datastore editor Simon Rogers spoke at a meeting in Amsterdam (which was recorded visually by Anna Lena Schiller), and last week I spoke at a meeting in Berlin, giving a presentation entitled &apos;Datajournalism on Guardian.co.uk&apos;. My talk discussed projects like the Afghan War Logs and the Datablog, crowd-sourcing exercises like our investigation into Tony Blair&apos;s finances or our visualisations of Twitter conversations around World Cup matches, and our Open Platform API. There was a full programme on the day, and organiser Georgi Kobilarov illustrated the difference that aggregated linked data should make in the lives of people. He said that on his smartphone, he can download apps from Qype and Yelp and Foursquare and any number of data providers about listings or venues, using geolocation to tailor the content to where he is. But he doesn&apos;t want to have to check a multitude of data sources to find out what to do. He doesn&apos;t care about the apps themselves, or the app provider, he cares about the information that will help him plan his evening. He wants an app that bridges them all, and uses information from Facebook and Twitter to say &apos;There is a pretty lousy bar around the corner, but two of your old high school friends are there, so it is probably your best bet right now&apos;. That frivolous example masks a serious point that all of the theories about semantic web technology and linked data will only be realised if they help provide and support services that people find truly useful, or if they help businesses to make services more effectively and more cheaply. The BBC have been doing the latter, and there were two talks from them looking at how they had used semantic web technology to build the BBC Earth site, and the Corporation&apos;s 2010 World Cup site. The essential premise was that if you build the right data model, which they based in RDF in a triplestore rather than a plain old fashioned relational database, you can save time and effort in maintaining a big dynamic website. For example, with a comprehensive abstract model of a tournament, simply tagging a story as being about Siphiwe Tshabalala would be enough to infer that the story was also about South Africa and Group A. With a simple tagging tool, journalists were able to automatically update over 700 team, group and player pages. Tom Scott has blogged about case studies of the BBC use of semantic web technology and Jem Rayfield has written about the dynamic publishing mechanism for their World Cup site. During the course of their talks, it was revealed that using this technology, the BBC plan to have a dynamic updating page for every single athlete competing at the 2012 Olympic Games, and may also release the data source to be available to the public. Ole Wintermann of the Bertelsmann Foundation spoke from the perspective of being a data consumer. The issue he saw is that politicians need to make decisions about &apos;megatrends&apos; like migration, demographic change, terrorism &amp; security issues, climate change and biodiversity. However, most of the datasets and models used to extrapolate trends are independent of each other, so that a graph of predicted German GDP in the 2040s looks radically different if you factor in an expected loss of population. Their Future Challenges blog network features around 60 bloggers from around the globe, trying to work out ways to combine and visualise datasets to show the possible correlations and inter-dependencies of the &apos;megatrends&apos;.

For the three years from 1948, before Cobra disintegrated under the force of\u00a0its own contradictions, Corneille took part in a display of artistic pyrotechnics which he and his comrades in art hoped would set the world ablaze.     Corneille    In a sense it did, since for the first 18 months Cobra comprised the most attention-grabbing collection of expressionist painters in the world. At that point, Jackson Pollock was finding his feet and looking for the audience that arrived in a rush with the publication in August 1949 of the issue of Life magazine with the famous spreads of Hans Namuth&apos;s photographs showing Pollock at work. As a Dutchman, Corneille belonged to the letter &quot;a&quot; of Cobra, an acronym for Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam: Asger Jorn was Danish; Constant, Corneille and Karel Appel were the most prominent of the Dutch contingent; Christian Dotremont and Pierre Alechinsky were Belgian. Constant (Constant Anton Nieuwenhuys, as he preferred not to be known) was a\u00a0communist who hated Soviet socialist realism. The group followed his lead in\u00a0proposing to be a red internationale, creating art for the people, though it was not until the brightly hedonistic, uncomplicated primary colours of\u00a0Corneille&apos;s old age that he himself became a truly popular artist. But to start with, there was the revolution. &quot;We\u00a0looked on art as an invincible weapon in the fight for freedom,&quot; Constant said. &quot;We were poor but enthusiastic, and we didn&apos;t care if the public laughed at us. That sort of attitude arises only at certain rare moments.&quot; Paris was the city conspicuous by its absence from Cobra, but it was to Paris that Corneille travelled with Appel in 1948 and where, in the Notre Dame cafe, the group signed a manifesto denouncing the surrealists, though annexing some of their methods. They looked to children&apos;s art, to the art created in psychiatric hospitals, to folk art and folklore, and, the century&apos;s common denominator, &quot;primitive&quot; art. From this melange they created art of\u00a0brilliant colour and expressiveness, only semi-abstract. Corneille was born Cornelis Guillaume van Beverloo in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, to Dutch parents who moved back to the Netherlands when their son was 12. From 1940 to 1943, he took drawing lessons at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie, where he formed a\u00a0friendship with Appel which lasted until Appel died in 2006. Corneille taught himself painting and experimental verse, and in 1950, when he settled in Paris for life, chose Corneille as his nom de guerre and learned printmaking in the Paris atelier of Stanley William Hayter. Lithography was a useful discipline for reining him in. In black and white, he created dark images that at their best could look like a surreal interpretation of Goya. Incongruously enough, it was during a four-month stay in Budapest that he discovered Paul Klee and Joan Mir\u00f3 in\u00a0reproduction while he was browsing in a\u00a0bookshop. In the Cobra years, he was to mine them extensively. Possibly out of relief that Corneille and his Dutch allies were at last producing art to be proud of, Willem Sandberg, the director of the Stedelijk Museum, brought Cobra to Amsterdam for a huge exhibition in 1949. The press was outraged. The daily paper Het Vrije Volk headlined its report &quot;Botch, blotch, and splotch&quot; and fistfights broke out in the audience during a modernist poetry reading (Corneille was one of the Cobra poets), almost like the glory days of Dada after the end of the first world war. In 1951 Li\u00e8ge followed suit with a\u00a0Cobra retrospective, though minus the fisticuffs. Likewise the break-up of\u00a0Cobra later that year; no punch-up, just natural attrition. Artists and groups do not sit easily together, except in the pages of art history. Corneille, meanwhile, had visited Tunis in 1948 and experienced the kind of north African epiphany that had affected other artists so deeply, from Delacroix to Renoir and Matisse. For a time, these impressions embedded themselves deep in his memory, but in\u00a0the late 1960s they emerged with a\u00a0cast of exotic animals and prettified Gauguin nudes as part of his repertory, playing against a backdrop of wide desert spaces. Corneille carried on painting until the end of his life, but the later work is a problem. If the test is, &quot;would it look good hanging on a wall at home?&quot;, the answer is yes. Yet there is a weightlessness that suggests a\u00a0talent running on autopilot. Still, the\u00a0paintings and graphics sold well, and if his international reputation dimmed, at home he\u00a0was a hero. In 2007 he travelled to\u00a0the Netherlands for the opening of\u00a0a\u00a0Cobra museum, devoted to keeping the torch burning. Corneille is survived by his second wife, Natacha, a Russian ballet dancer, and their son, Dimitri. \u2022 Corneille (Cornelis Guillaume van Beverloo), artist, born 3 July 1922; died\u00a05\u00a0September 2010", "sentences": ["As a Dutchman, Corneille belonged to the letter &quot;a&quot; of Cobra, an acronym for Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam: Asger Jorn was Danish; Constant, Corneille and Karel Appel were the most prominent of the Dutch contingent; Christian Dotremont and Pierre Alechinsky were Belgian.", "From 1940 to 1943, he took drawing lessons at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie, where he formed a\u00a0friendship with Appel which lasted until Appel died in 2006.", "Possibly out of relief that Corneille and his Dutch allies were at last producing art to be proud of, Willem Sandberg, the director of the Stedelijk Museum, brought Cobra to Amsterdam for a huge exhibition in 1949."], "title": "Corneille obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/08/corneille-obituary", "tags": ["Art"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-09-09T21:30:08Z", "article": "Over the years, the music of Arvo P\u00e4rt has claimed a special place in the Vale of\u00a0Glamorgan festival. The relationship was cemented when he made his first visit in 1996, and P\u00e4rt has reaffirmed it this year by coming back for the festival&apos;s celebration of his 75th birthday, which falls on Saturday. He was present for the UK premieres\u00a0of four of his works by the\u00a0Cello Octet Amsterdam in the Bradenstoke Hall of St Donat&apos;s Castle. Its\u00a0monastic austerity offered an appropriate setting for the bell-like tones of P\u00e4rt&apos;s tintinnabulist style \u2013 not\u00a0to mention his own rather monk-like appearance (though he was, on this occasion, happily beaming). The composer&apos;s arrangement of his Sieben Magnificat Antiphonen, renamed simply\u00a0O-Antiphonen, was particularly evocative in this context, achieving both\u00a0a gentle intimacy and the sense that all eight instruments were aspiring\u00a0to the vibrant quality of the voices for which the antiphons were originally conceived.

Van der Vaart smiles an easy-going smile.\u00a0He does that a lot during his unveiling as a Tottenham player, following his skin-of-the-teeth transfer-deadline-day move from Real. He also offers a nice line in humour. But, under the relaxed exterior, the competitive fires rage. They have done so since the days when he would use empty beer bottles as goalposts or would-be tacklers on the caravan park that was his home in Beverwijk, near Amsterdam. And they will drive him as he prepares to shape the latest chapter of his career in a fourth country \u2013 he spent three seasons at Hamburg in between Ajax and Real. It is easy to forget that Van der Vaart is only 27 as he seems to have been around for an age. But the attacking midfielder believes he is poised to enter his prime years and he is eager to establish himself in Harry Redknapp&apos;s team as Tottenham chase glory at home and in the Champions\u00a0League. &quot;I think it&apos;s a good match, Dutch players playing in England,&quot; Van der Vaart said, when it was put to him that he was following in the footsteps of Dennis Bergkamp and Ruud van Nistelrooy. &quot;Also with [Robin] Van Persie; he is a great player, who is feeling well here. Twenty-seven is a great age to play. There is so much ahead\u00a0of you.&quot; Van der Vaart has heard all about the rivalry in north London from his international team-mate Van Persie, who has been at Arsenal for six years, and one of his first games for Tottenham stands to be the Carling Cup derby at White Hart Lane on Tuesday week. &quot;Robin told me it is the greatest derby in the world,&quot; Van der Vaart said. &quot;But we have a good chance to win against them and aspire to beat them over the season. Why can&apos;t we finish above them?&quot; Van der Vaart made his debut for Ajax at the age of 17, when he was still living in the family caravan. According to him, it had &quot;three rooms, it wasn&apos;t so big but my family liked it&quot;. The travelling life was &quot;maybe not a normal lifestyle but it was really nice because it was different&quot;. &quot;Everyone was looking,&quot; he continued, &quot;and saying &apos;Isn&apos;t it strange to live there.&apos; For me, it helped because I was like a street\u00a0fighter.&quot; Van der Vaart has needed his mental toughness to deal with the problems he has faced. Injuries blighted his time at Ajax, while at Real it was club politics that tested him. He had four managers in his two years there. &quot;It was political [at Real] and it was difficult for somebody from Holland to play every game,&quot; he said. &quot;The president mostly liked Spanish players and some big players.&quot; Van der Vaart has endured frustration at international level, not least at this summer&apos;s World Cup, when he lost his\u00a0starting place from the last 16 onwards. He did come on as a 99th-minute substitute in the final, which Holland lost 1-0 to Spain. He had starred at Euro 2008 but been peripheral at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2004. Then there are the pitfalls of his high-profile relationship with Sylvie, a model and television presenter, whom he married in 2005. &quot;She is perhaps more famous than I am,&quot; he said, with a smile, but both of them have found the spotlight overbearing at times. An Ajax game at Den Haag in 2004 was temporarily halted because of anti-Semitic abuse aimed at her from the home crowd. Van der Vaart had &quot;only 10 minutes&quot; to decide on whether to sign for Tottenham and the phone call to his wife sounded interesting. &quot;I said, &apos;We are going to London&apos; and she was a little bit shocked,&quot; Van der Vaart said. &quot;But at the end, she was also happy.

I spent the majority of time at school trying to break the rules. I would climb to the top of buildings; I even burned a building down once \u2013 not intentionally, just because I was interested in fire. I remember going through the rule book, ticking off the ones I had broken and looking for the ones I hadn&apos;t.&quot; He might be stretching the truth \u2013 &quot;Most of what we say about ourselves is a wonderful piece of storytelling,&quot; he believes \u2013 but his youthful rebellion is suggestive of the way this director, actor and writer has set about breaking theatre&apos;s rules. Ever since he started making work with Complicite, the company he co-founded in 1983, McBurney&apos;s guiding principle has been to create whatever he feels he is not seeing on Britain&apos;s stages. His productions draw on international theatre, dance, music, literature and developing technologies, not to mention his training in movement at the Jacques Lecoq school in Paris, to fulfil one simple rule: that &quot;the text of the different parts of theatre must be as articulate as the spoken word&quot;. Though he has been hailed as an innovator, McBurney is suspicious of such evaluations. &quot;There&apos;s nothing really original,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s only the question of whether something is alive, and speaking to you.&quot; This is precisely what he is good at: making things \u2013 inanimate objects, abstruse concepts, even a 5,000-year-old corpse \u2013 come thrillingly alive. In Complicite&apos;s 1992 show A Street of Crocodiles, books fluttered across the stage as a flock of birds; in 1999&apos;s Mnemonic, which won an Olivier award for best new play, the story of a man stumbling towards death was represented by a wooden chair. In A Disappearing Number, another Olivier award-winner, which is being revived in London&apos;s West End this month, complex mathematical equations become vivid metaphors for personal relationships. McBurney is sometimes criticised for putting style over substance, most recently in reviews of his Japanese production Shun-kin, which is also being revived this autumn, at London&apos;s Barbican. But even the play&apos;s vehement detractors concede their astonishment at the magical transformation of a puppet into a flesh-and-blood actor, and have been seduced by the show&apos;s crepuscular lighting. The one thing McBurney doesn&apos;t do is present straightforward linear stories. Whether creating a show from scratch or adapting a work of literature \u2013 by John Berger, say, or Haruki Murakami \u2013 he will overlap narratives, past and present, fact and fiction, so that they communicate with each other. &quot;Very rarely do I find a linear story to be a reflection of life as I see it,&quot; he says. &quot;The story of Oedipus, say, is useful to us because we have all had the experience of wanting to kill our father, and we can act out the horror of those thoughts in another context. So the linear story can give you a reduction of life. But if I&apos;m representing life, I want to make connections between things.&quot; Even talking about himself, McBurney delivers almost nothing straight. He doesn&apos;t so much answer questions as meander around them. His description of a recent &quot;extraordinary experience&quot;, taking A Disappearing Number to India (the show revolves around an Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan), takes approximately 40 minutes and incorporates, among other digressions: a potted history of Indian theatre; a eulogy of director Habib Tanvir and his Naya theatre company, whose Charan the Thief, seen in London in 1982, in which &quot;the way someone expressed joy was to do a double backwards somersault&quot;, was a strong influence; the need for baroque excess in Bollywood films; the rootlessness of many modern actors; and, for good measure, the immorality of the free-market economy. Listening to him, you feel as though you are being tugged through the twisting back streets of a foreign city by a skittish guide, with no idea of what you might see or where you might end up. His circumlocutions make him difficult to pin down. But then, he is deliberately resistant to any such attempt, drawing on Rita Carter&apos;s book Multiplicity: The New Science of Personality to explain his evasiveness. &quot;What she articulates is that we are all multiple people, but we have an illusion that we are one single self, and an illusion of continuity in the present . . . it corresponds to my sense of who I am.&quot; His approach to theatre-making was forged in the 1980s, and so was his political activism \u2013 his resistance to &quot;the blind, almost fundamentalist adherence to a consumer capitalist society&quot;. He travelled widely in his late teens and early 20s, to Canada and the US, to Greece, the USSR, in part to escape Thatcher&apos;s Britain, where he felt &quot;constantly in political opposition. Living in France while the Falklands war was going on, I felt a profound sense of shame and betrayal, just as I did by the war in Iraq. People have asked why I don&apos;t talk about that directly in my plays. Well, politics needs to be articulated in many different ways.&quot; He tends to choose the subtler options. For instance, he rarely visits countries as a tourist \u2013 &quot;tourism is very destructive&quot; \u2013 but travels in a focused attempt to learn about other cultures, with a view to making pieces of theatre that speak directly to those cultures. It means a great deal to him that in the ambiguous, shadowy, ironic Shun-kin Japanese audiences recognised themselves and their distinctive worldview. The capitalist expansion of India, which he has been witnessing first-hand over the past decade while working on A Disappearing Number, raises for him an &quot;urgent question, of who we are as people. We now have access to an extraordinary amount of knowledge, but that knowledge isn&apos;t necessarily part of us. I feel that knowledge brings responsibility \u2013 but how capable are human beings of a sense of responsibility?&quot; It is a question he endeavours to answer in his theatre, in the same way that his favourite composers \u2013 Shostakovich, Schnittke, Edison Denisov \u2013 were &quot;incredibly articulate about the nature of moral responsibility in the 20th century. You can hear the darkness and the fear in the music.&quot; McBurney himself is driven by the desire for knowledge. At 53, he says: &quot;I&apos;ve hardly begun \u2013 I&apos;m so curious about this and I need to know about that. I&apos;m naturally attracted to something I don&apos;t understand, because when you try to deal with something you don&apos;t understand, it opens a door into another world.&quot; A Disappearing Number grew from his increasing interest in mathematics, one of many subjects that had repelled him at school. &quot;Mathematics is an art form that builds on itself. As a mathematician, you are adding to the sum of everything that is already known. You&apos;re not saying, &apos;I&apos;m coming in here with my own individual voice&apos;, you&apos;re coming in with a collective voice. So you have a tremendous sense of human continuity as well as of mathematical continuity.&quot; Collectivity and an awareness of continuity play a key role in McBurney&apos;s theatre. His sensitivity to the latter was instilled in him at birth: his father was an archaeologist who taught at Cambridge. It was his mother who imbued him with a passion for theatre: she had wanted to be an actor and encouraged McBurney and his two siblings to perform plays in their rambling Victorian house. But his parents also, unwittingly, gave him a sense of separation from other people that is partly to do with identity. &quot;I don&apos;t know where I belong, to be honest. My father was American, my mother&apos;s Irish, I suppose I&apos;m English but I&apos;ve never felt particularly at home in England.&quot; He wonders whether it was the resultant longing for a sense of community that led him to acting, which he began at school. Although he was a shy child, what McBurney loved about his schooldays was &quot;making connections between people&quot;. He still enjoys this, working hard on the introductions to his plays to make explicit the audience&apos;s relationship to the actors. Mnemonic opened with each person in the audience holding an ivy leaf, imagining that its veins represented the lines of their ancestry and that everyone in the room was distantly related. At the beginning of A Disappearing Number, one of the actors instructs the audience to think of a number, double it, add 14, halve the result, then subtract their original number. &quot;What I like about the theatre,&quot; he says, &quot;is that we are all able to imagine the same thing at the same time, just as now, we are all imagining the number seven.&quot; It is a cheeky trick, but an effective one \u2013 it reminds the audience that their imaginative contribution to the show is crucial. Collaboration, with audience, actors, designers, technicians, is central to McBurney&apos;s work, and has been since Complicite sprang into being in 1983. He makes the founding quartet \u2013 himself, director Annabel Arden, and actors Marcello Magni and Fiona Gordon \u2013 sound like outlaws: &quot;Everybody was on the run.&quot; He knew Arden from Cambridge (to his parents&apos; relief, the teenage McBurney buckled down long enough to pass the entrance exam), where they performed in Footlights alongside Emma Thompson and Stephen Fry. He met Magni (Italian) and Gordon (Canadian, born in Australia) at the beginning of the 1980s, at the Jacques Lecoq school. The group was quickly successful, winning the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh festival in 1985 for their satire of Thatcherite capitalism, More Bigger Snacks Now. But they also quarrelled constantly. In 1989, just at the point, McBurney says, when they were &quot;totally pissed off with each other and the whole thing was about to explode&quot;, they were offered a residency at the Almeida theatre in London for 15 weeks. It proved to be &quot;a moment of metamorphosis&quot;: during that time they created 13 shows, one of which was the company&apos;s first stab at a classic text, a darkly comic interpretation of Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt&apos;s The Visit, which transferred two years later to the National Theatre. Afterwards, the quartet disbanded, but not until McBurney had been persuaded to take responsibility for Complicite as its artistic director. In the two decades since, the company has grown into &quot;a constantly shifting community, like a tribe of people who go away and come back and go away and come back again&quot;. One of the things that binds them together is food: McBurney is passionate about cooking, and &quot;we have large communal meals together&quot;. Magni still works frequently with McBurney: he was an associate director on Endgame in London last year, and is performing in A Dog&apos;s Heart, McBurney&apos;s first opera, which opens at the English National Opera in November. Every Complicite show is born out of chaos. The Elephant Vanishes \u2013 adapted from Murakami&apos;s exploration of ultra-modern technology and human disconnection \u2013 grew from an attempt at another Japanese show that failed (&quot;I make a lot of things\u00a0that nobody ever sees&quot;). With opening night looming, rehearsals ground to a halt, and McBurney had to instruct his entire team to take 24 hours off to clear their heads. A Disappearing Number was incomplete when it first went on stage at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth in March 2007; it is only now, as he prepares to remount the show at the Novello theatre, that McBurney feels its problems are starting to be resolved. He describes working on A Dog&apos;s Heart, which had its premiere at the Holland festival in Amsterdam in June, as &quot;another wonderful collaborative process&quot;, but confesses that it, too, came perilously close to disaster when he and his designer, Michael Levine, decided to scrap their original set design after seeing it mocked up on stage, sending their producers into a panic. Equally unusual for the opera world, but more positive, was his approach to the score: treating it as he would a written text, he invited the composer, Alexander Raskatov, and a group of performers into a workshop so that they could play around with the music and understand it more fully. With three productions opening in London over the next 10 weeks, McBurney is frantically busy. But then, he always has been. He is a writer, for the stage, obviously, but also of non-fiction for journals such as the Drawbridge and Brick. He is unexpectedly diffident discussing his writing, a hangover from school, where &quot;I was such a ducker and diver that I never really believed in my own writing, so I always shied away from calling it that&quot;. Working on an opera was &quot;a total liberation: you feel so confident that almost every move, every piece of emotion is there in the musical text. It&apos;s a sort of blessed relief after writing your own things, where you&apos;re constantly doubting what you&apos;ve written.&quot; Plus he is an actor for film and TV: he was a slippery British diplomat in The Last King of Scotland, and recently appeared as the parchment-dry Archdeacon Robert in the BBC comedy Rev. &quot;Acting on film can be a wonderful release,&quot; he says, &quot;because you&apos;ve got to be very exact within a few words, and bring them to life in a very specific way.&quot; He is still smarting from the fact that he had to turn down an acting job, &quot;a particularly unpleasant character&quot; in a new film by Joe Wright, because it clashed with A Dog&apos;s Heart. In A Disappearing Number, one of the characters interprets the mathematician GH Hardy&apos;s assertion that &quot;the noblest ambition is that of leaving behind something of permanent value&quot; as proof of the necessity of having children. It was while the show was playing at the Barbican in the autumn of 2007 that McBurney met his partner, Cassie Yukawa, on the street: &quot;Just by chance, completely extraordinary chance. We literally just saw each other. I didn&apos;t believe that such things were true.&quot; The couple now live together in McBurney&apos;s flat in a former piano factory \u2013 another coincidence, as Yukawa is a pianist who has performed at Carnegie Hall in New York \u2013 and have two children, a girl and a boy. For McBurney, this is his life&apos;s &quot;most surprising story&quot; of all. \u2022 A Disappearing Number is at the Novello theatre until 25 September.Box office: www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk / 0844 482 5170 \u2022\u00a0Shun-kin is at the Barbican from 4-13 November.

The contingent was pictured holding banners incorporating St George&apos;s cross, Israel&apos;s flag and the US stars and stripes, as well as the slogans &quot;No Mosque at Ground Zero&quot;, &quot;The more Islam, the less freedom&quot;, &quot;No Sharia&quot;, and &quot;No Surrender&quot;. They wore EDL T-shirts sporting the group&apos;s crusader shield logo. Over the past 18 months in town centres across England the group has protested against the spread of Islamic institutions and in support of the armed forces. EDL demonstrators have been heard chanting racist slogans and have clashed with anti-fascist activists, and marches have been banned for fear of violence. The decision to send protesters to America reflects the organisation&apos;s self-proclaimed &quot;new phase of international outreach and networking&quot;, which began in April when supporters attended a Berlin demonstration in support of Wilders. The Dutchman said yesterday that New Yorkers must defend themselves against &quot;the powers of darkness, the forces of hatred&quot;. In June, the EDL sent delegates to speak at a &quot;counter jihad&quot; conference organised by the International Civil Liberties Alliance in Zurich, where they gave a presentation entitled The Anatomy of an EDL Demo. Nick Lowles, of Searchlight, the anti-fascist monitoring organisation, said: &quot;The EDL operates on two levels. There are the street activists such as the 120 that demonstrated in Oldham and 100 in London this weekend. But then there is the political agenda driven by a group of leaders whose ideas come from Christian fundamentalism. They are running a dual strategy and they see an international aspect to their goals where the uniting issue is anti-Islam.&quot; The EDL is planning to join a far-right demonstration in Amsterdam on 30 October under the banner of the European Freedom Initiative.

The Techmark index, which tracks the stock prices of 88 hi-tech British companies, is up 40% in two years, and at its highest point since 2001. Investors are hopeful of a flurry of takeover deals as cash-rich foreign competitors seek to expand overseas. British companies such as Arm, Sage and Psion have strong balance sheets, operate in growing niche markets and have attractive research and development pipelines, making them an appealing target for overseas rivals. Nor are valuations exorbitant. The Techmark, at 1941.51, is a long way from its high of 5743 at the start of 2000. Businesses have flourished in recent years as management has cut waste, sold unprofitable subsidiaries and improved sales and marketing. &quot;The big shake-out after the internet bubble burst means only the strongest have survived,&quot; says Roger Phillips at Evolution Securities. He adds: &quot;British technology companies make up quite a small part of GDP when you compare the contribution made to the US economy by their American counterparts. But they are throwing off cash and offer a safe haven to investors worried that the financial crisis has further to run.&quot; Shares in UK tech companies such as Misys and Aveva are trading at their highest levels in three years, while takeover speculation has increased since IT infrastructure provider Dimension Data received an approach from Japan&apos;s Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone. But the sector is in a very different place from 10 years ago, when the market built up unrealistic growth expectations for many British hi-tech companies. For a while the optimism appeared to be well founded: the dotcom boom had its origins in the US, where a messianic belief in the ability of new technology to make firms more productive spawned a generation of analysts prepared to argue that the old rules of investment no longer applied. But the cracks started to appear when companies began to rein in spending on large capital projects such as IT and telecoms. That was when the bubble popped and firms such as Marconi went to the wall. With memories of turn-of-the-millennium excess fresh in their minds, technology companies were among the first to make cuts at the onset of the credit crunch in 2007; they were determined not to go into another recession with excess capacity. And, fortunately for them, businesses did not have huge IT budgets to cut, unlike in 2000/1. So when the downturn arrived, technology companies found themselves in reasonable shape. Now, muscular British firms such as Sage, Arm and Autonomy are viewed as merger targets for foreign predators. Arm is the British microchip company behind the phenomenal success of Apple&apos;s mobile devices. Recently, it launched a microprocessor design which it claims will lead to a new generation of &quot;super smartphones&quot;. Arm says the new chip will allow Apple and other handset makers to create phones with five times the &quot;brainpower&quot; of today&apos;s models. Autonomy, one of the UK&apos;s largest software groups, has repeatedly been named as a likely takeover candidate, with IBM and Oracle seen as possible bidders. Mike Lynch, Autonomy&apos;s chief executive, has brushed off the rumours, hinting instead that the company is more hunter than prey. Autonomy paid $775m (\u00a3500m) last year to buy Interwoven, which specialises in management software for legal documents, and raised \u00a3550m in a bond issue earlier this year. It has more than \u00a3600m available to spend on acquisitions; analysts suggest possible targets include Kofax, a document-capture software group listed on the London Stock Exchange. The new bullishness in the sector has also prompted the private equity owners of Edwards to look at a possible flotation of the company whose vacuum technology is used by the world&apos;s biggest chipmakers. Crawley-based Edwards says its systems are in use at 10 of the world&apos;s biggest semiconductor manufacturers, including AMD, Intel&apos;s rival in the PC processor market. The owners value Edwards at more than \u00a31.5bn. In New York, Baker Capital has hired Morgan Stanley to explore a sale of Interxion, the Amsterdam-based data-centre operator. The potential sale comes alongside preparations for a flotation for Interxion in the US, which filed a draft registration with the securities and exchange commission in May. Observers say the UK&apos;s technology sector will always be dwarfed by the US&apos;s, where Microsoft, Cisco, Apple and Google are among the industry giants. Mike Townend of IP Group, which invests in British technology start-ups, says: &quot;American investors have always been more supportive of technology companies than their British counterparts, although attitudes are slowly changing on this side of the Atlantic.&quot; But it is too late: the Americans have had a headstart, and their companies are now so much larger than ours, it is unlikely we shall ever catch up. One broker says: &quot;British technology companies that become big and successful are eventually taken over by even bigger and richer overseas competitors.

Dentsu, which is desperate to build its position in Western markets such as the US and UK, is understood to have put in a pre-emptive bid for AKQA which its owners are putting up for sale. General Atlantic, the Connecticut private equity firm, took a majority stake in AKQA in 2007, reportedly for between $200m and $250m. Morgan Stanley, which advised General Atlantic when it bought into AKQA, is in the process of holding meetings with potential buyers. One source with knowledge of the sale process described Dentsu&apos;s bid price as &quot;crazy&quot;, with one report valuing the agency netowrk at about half the sum. It is understood that General Atlantic are in favour of the deal but chairman Ahmed and chief executive Tom Bedecarre, who own about 10%, are not so sure about the tie-up. However a source close to the company played down the move by Dentsu, pointing out that the agency is regularly approached with offers. &quot;There is plenty of inbound [approaches] on an almost weekly basis. That doesn&apos;t in any way indicate a sale,&quot; said the source. The source claimed that the board was steadfastly focused on taking AKQA public in the future through an IPO. Ahmed founded AKQA, which has clients including Nike and McDonald&apos;s, in 1995 in his very early 20s. The agency now has offices in London, New York, Washington DC, Shanghai, Berlin and Amsterdam and employs more than 800 people. Last year Dentsu put in a premium bid of $700m to try to buy Microsoft&apos;s digital agency network Razorfish, the largest in the US by revenue, but still lost out to Publicis Groupe which paid $530m in a deal that also included a media commitment.

Alexandria, New Delhi, Montreal, Amsterdam and Bogot\u00e0 have all held the year-long role of World Book Capital since UNESCO inaugurated the concept in 2001 with Madrid, looking to foster reading and promote books around the world. Ljubljana is the current incumbent, with Buenos Aires to take up the position next year and the Armenian city of Yerevan in 2012. Pullman, whose bestselling Dark Materials trilogy is set in parallel versions of Oxford, said it would be &quot;a wonderful city&quot; to take on the mantle of World Book Capital in 2014. &quot;Oxford gave me a university education but, best of all, a Bodleian readers&apos; card which I have made regular use of for many years,&quot; said the author. &quot;It&apos;s always difficult to tell what chance of success we have, because we don&apos;t yet know what our competition will be and these decisions can sometimes be political. In the past we have had a strong bid for the European Capital of Culture which was overlooked \u2013 perhaps because the judges thought we already had plenty of culture.&quot; His fellow children&apos;s author Natasha Narayan agreed. &quot;Oxford has a very strong bid to be World Book Capital \u2013 it is no surprise that the city produced great children&apos;s authors like Lewis and Tolkien, and as an author I find the city a wonderful and inspiring place to write in,&quot; she said, while Bodleian librarian Sarah Thomas described Oxford as a &quot;sparkling jewel in the world of books and reading&quot;. The city plans a programme running from April 2014 until April 2015, which would include the completion of the Story Museum \u2013 a location dedicated to storytelling in the city \u2013 and the opening of new parts of the Bodleian libraries.

They do not like each other. She is precocious and attention-seeking. He is sullen and grieves for his lost girlfriend, to whose memory he miserably masturbates. But as time \u2013 marked only by the changes in the patch of sky and single treetop visible from an attic window \u2013 passes them by, they fall in love. Sexual desire uncoils in this dim hiding place. Unfortunately, the couple have no privacy to explore, let alone consummate, their relationship because they are living in very close quarters with her parents and her sister, his parents, and a querulous dentist. In these circumstances, every murmur, fart, endearment, is overheard; every glance, move, touch is witnessed. They cannot escape this purgatory because actual hell awaits them in the outside world. As a premise for a novel about the constraints upon young love, this could hardly be objected to. However, Annexed is, daringly, a reimagining of the diary of Anne Frank through the eyes of Peter van Pels, the boy who shared her awful incarceration and unspeakable fate. And, predictably, the fundamentalists of the Church of Frank have heaped contumely on Sharon Dogar&apos;s head. The attacks have been so asinine and protectionist that I found myself hoping Annexed would be scurrilously iconoclastic. It is, of course, nothing of the sort. It is, for the most part, a delicate, poised and scrupulous re-enactment. Peter&apos;s voice lacks, as it probably should, the poignant chirpiness of Anne&apos;s. There are moments of tedium and claustrophobia, but that&apos;s appropriate. It&apos;s an engrossing read for the paradoxical reason that you already know what happens in the end. So why the fuss? If you visit the Anne Frank House at 263 Prinsengracht, Amsterdam, and enter the secret annexe via the door concealed behind the bookcase (as if into a satanic version of Narnia), you are encouraged, you are compelled, to imagine the bickering black comedy of bourgeois manners enacted there by people who, like characters in a Beckett play, were tormented by the hope they clung to and by each other. This compulsion is precisely what Dogar has given in to and she has thus done the memory of Anne Frank a great service. After millions of copies of her diary have been sold in numberless languages, after generations of schoolchildren have &quot;done&quot; it as a set text, after the docudramas and the plays and the movies, a sepia-coloured hagiographic glaze has settled over Anne. Like many an icon, she has been heavily varnished. Every now and again, she needs a Sharon Dogar to come along to defamiliarise and thus revitalise her. It is regrettable, therefore, that Dogar and her publishers appear not to have the courage of their convictions. Annexed has a preface, an apologia that is the nearest thing to an attack of nerves you are likely to see in print. The novel has anxious footnotes that indicate where it departs from the &quot;truth&quot; of the diary. (The truth is that Anne, like all diarists, is an unreliable narrator. She &quot;improved&quot; \u2013 sexed up, one might say \u2013 her diary with a view to its eventual publication. She imagined a future as a novelist.) By her own account, as well as Dogar&apos;s, she yearned for sexual love. We should grieve for her more, rather than less, if she was murdered before she experienced it. The zealous, self-appointed guardians of her memory should be grateful to Dogar rather than outraged. Hindered by caution, this is not quite a great book,\u00a0but it is firmly on the side of the\u00a0angels.

Van der Vaart \u2013 at \u00a38m, more of a steal than an acquisition \u2013 equalised from the penalty spot as Spurs scored three in the last 15 minutes to defeat Wolves 3-1, only their second league win in five outings. It was a spiritual day at the Lane. Aaron Lennon kissed his rosary beads as he prepared to come off the bench. &quot;Be strong,&quot; Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, told Roman Pavlyuchenko before sending him on to score their second. Spurs needed to be &quot;strong&quot; to disguise an unconvincing display. On these days you see how far they have to travel to match Chelsea and Manchester United. To get there they will need to stop using the high ball to Peter Crouch as a kind of comfort blanket. An interchangeable gang of strikers need to be more deadly. But you always have a shot at self-improvement when the club&apos;s big skill is talent spotting. With Van der Vaart, Spurs may have robbed the bank. The Dutch are no better than the English at high-pressure penalties but Van der Vaart, 27, was imperturbable as he helped preserve Tottenham&apos;s credibility as Champions League contenders. A home defeat to Wigan and a draw at West Bromwich Albion had taken a nibble out of those credentials. Real Madrid discards can go two ways: into bitterness and self-doubt or towards redemption at lesser clubs. Wesley Sneijder survived rejection at the Bernab\u00e9u to become a Serie A and Champions League winner with Inter. He and Van der Vaart were part of the Holland squad who reached the World Cup final and tried to clog Spain into a ditch. To produce Sneijder and Van der Vaart in a single crop suggests the Dutch are still masters at raising playmakers. Inter jumped first to exploit Real&apos;s big-name overload and now Spurs can claim a comparable transfer-window triumph. To think: James Milner, a fine player but without Van der Vaart&apos;s dimensions, cost Manchester City \u00a326m. For \u00a38m, Tottenham snatched a match-changer with 85 Holland caps and 120 goals in 330 appearances for Ajax, Hamburg and Real Madrid. On the evidence of his form so far he was no falling star. Redknapp&apos;s calling card is to recognise under-utilised talent and pull it in from the margins. He backs himself to revive a player&apos;s confidence. William Gallas, adrift in the freelance market, was another of his summer signings. Neither he nor Van der Vaart, though, needed an ego massage. In his home debut the new rival to Luka Modric as the team&apos;s chief improviser looked as if he is here to run the club. Spurs, who face Arsenal in the Carling Cup third round here on Tuesday, are now blessed with a pair of artistes to work the gaps between midfield and attack. Like Steven Gerrard with England, Van der Vaart treated a wide-right berth as a notional appointment and soon floated inside to demand the ball. &quot;I gave him a starting position on the right and just said \u2013 pop off where you want to,&quot; Redknapp said: the kind of order bound to endear him to his new No11. Players in these higher echelons are often a couple of geometrical steps ahead of their team-mates and it will take more games before some of these Spurs regulars understand the possibilities that Van der Vaart&apos;s movements open up. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to seeing them [Van der Vaart and Modric] play together. I like those players who know how to play and can see a pass,&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;I can see us getting a lot of joy when they play together.&quot; Van der Vaart says: &quot;My favourite position is behind the striker but I can play across the whole midfield.&quot; Redknapp said: &quot;His best position is probably behind two strikers, but we have a left-sided player in Gareth Bale and it&apos;s a question of how we set up. The main thing is he can play between the lines.&quot; Old hands will know this syndrome well. It&apos;s called Dutch fluidity, which defies easy categorisation in the positional sense. Redknapp is drawn to free-spiritedness but still has to organise a team to beat Wolves, who are starting to seriously resent their reputation as boot boys. The first Van der Vaart attribute you notice is his energy, his tenacity. Then he starts rolling his studs over ball, back-heeling passes in tight spots and dipping balls into the box with his deft left foot. Redknapp went to see him play for Holland in Amsterdam and placed him on a list of desired targets, but it was Levy, he says, who pursued the deal as the window closed.

The 200mph train operated by Germany&apos;s state railway company, Deutsche Bahn (DB), will pull into the capital&apos;s flagship St Pancras International terminal on 19 October after a maiden cross-channel voyage that challenges one of Europe&apos;s busiest aviation markets. The state-of-the-art, German-made Inter City Express (ICE) 3 train must pass stringent tunnel safety tests before it can start full services from Frankfurt, with December 2013 the likely start date. But rail experts expect it to open up Britain to a new market for rail travel and put downward pressure on Eurostar fares. A spokesman for Deutsche Bahn said: &quot;DB is committed to introducing high speed passenger rail services between London and Germany, enhancing connectivity between these two countries. Services are expected to start at the end of 2013. &quot;Work has already commenced with safety, infrastructure and regulatory bodies across Europe in order to meet all the requirements necessary to operate these trains. As part of this work we will hold a safety exercise with an ICE train in the Channel tunnel on 19 October, showing the train subsequently the same day in London St Pancras.&quot; Eurostar, the Paris and Brussels service that operates from St Pancras, has been a success since its 1994 debut, now carrying more than 9 million passengers and taking three-quarters of the air and rail market between London and the French and Belgian capitals. DB is considering a route that would start in Frankfurt \u2013 the heart of Germany&apos;s finance industry \u2013 with possible stops at Cologne and Brussels en route to London. The service is expected to grow the high-speed rail market between London and the continent by around 10%, carrying more than 1 million passengers per year. Chris Cheek, a rail industry analyst, said the move would further reinforce the case for long-distance train travel at the expense of the aeroplane. &quot;It will increase the size of the high-speed rail market between London and Europe and the main source of the traffic will be diversion from the air,&quot; he said. A spokeswoman for Eurostar was sanguine about the potential competitive threat to her company. &quot;It will be very good news because ultimately it will grow the market.&quot; Asked if a new entrant would benefit passengers on the Brussels route, who currently pay as little as \u00a369 for a standard return but could hope for even lower prices, she said: &quot;Of course we would compete very energetically with any rail competition.&quot; Despite the threat of a new rail entrant, Eurostar believes that the competitive threat from low-cost airlines such as Ryanair already holds down cross-channel rail fares. However, a London-to-Frankfurt train service will also stretch the industry maxim that rail journeys must last no longer than four hours in order to compete with airlines. A trip between Europe&apos;s two largest financial centres would take four to five hours, with DB hoping that the appeal of broadband access and lack of airport security hassle will tempt the all-important business traveller market. A spokesman for High Speed One, the owner and operator of the Channel tunnel rail link, said the service could use the high-speed terminal at Stratford in east London to tap the business market at Canary Wharf and in the City. &quot;Stopping patterns for any Frankfurt-to-London route are not confirmed but post-Olympics there will be an even more compelling case for international services to start using Stratford International \u2013 not just leisure passengers but also business travellers, given the close onward connections.&quot; Channel tunnel safety authorities have already relaxed regulations that will make it easier for DB to operate a London-to-Frankfurt service. The ICE3 train will have to be 375m long in order to allow its rear and front doors to connect with emergency exits in the train tunnels that connect with the central service tunnel which is used in the event of emergency evacuations. The exits are spaced 375m apart, hence the requirement for trains of that length. Because the DB train will be formed by two locomotives bolted together, and passengers cannot therefore travel through length of the train, the company must prove that it can evacuate people from either end without serious problems. Richard Clifton, head of the UK delegation to the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority (CTSA), said DB had to prove that the different configuration of its train would not hinder an evacuation. There have been three fires in the tunnel since it opened in 1994. &quot;It is up to Deutsche Bahn to produce some proposals as to how to evacuate the train. They [DB] need to demonstrate an evacuation system from a shorter train, or one that does not have a through-corridor, which does not diminish the level of safety,&quot; he said. Faster than flying For decades, three hours has been seen as the magic number, the journey time at which train travel becomes faster than flying on a centre-to-centre basis. But with stricter and more time-consuming airport security, plus frequent air traffic delays, that magic three hours is stretching. So much so, that Guillaume Pepy, CEO of SNCF (French national railways) has stated that this three hours has become four or perhaps five. He cites Paris-Perpignan, where SNCF&apos;s high-speed TGV takes five hours, yet where rail has captured 50% of the market. It&apos;s not only journey time that&apos;s important. European high-speed trains typically achieve punctuality of 90-95% on time or within 15 minutes, whereas European airlines struggle to reach 63-68%. And with WiFi and power sockets for laptops, a train journey is often more productive. As air travel gets slower, rail gets faster. New high-speed lines have made rail a serious player on routes such as Paris-Amsterdam (3 hrs 20 minutes), Paris-Frankfurt (3 hrs 55 minutes), Barcelona-Madrid (2 hrs 40 minutes) and Milan-Rome (3 hrs). Deutsche Bahn&apos;s planned test run of an ICE through the Channel tunnel to London is an exciting development, potentially the forerunner of a direct Frankfurt-Cologne-London service. This would take advantage of new EU rules that came in this year, under which anyone with the relevant licences can operate an international train service within the EU. DB already offers bookings from London to Cologne in conjunction with Eurostar, but the change of trains in Brussels means a journey time of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours. A direct train could cut London-Cologne to 3 hrs 55 mins. This would compete with air not only on speed and convenience, but on comfort \u2013 DB&apos;s ICE trains are among the most comfortable trains in the world, being designed to tempt German businessmen out of their BMWs and Mercedes, with power sockets for laptops at every seat and WiFi on many routes. And using DB&apos;s current ICE fares to neighbouring countries as a guide, I&apos;d expect a London-Cologne or London-Frankfurt journey on any new service to start at a very affordable \u20ac49 (\u00a341) or even \u20ac39 each way, with no need to pay to get add the cost of getting to and from airports. In short, this is a move that I personally would welcome with open arms. Now, how about a direct London-Amsterdam train service in 3 hrs 50 mins?

The apparent plot led to plans for many airports, including in the UK, to install full body image scanners to detect concealed explosives. Last month, two Yemeni men were arrested at Schiphol after flying in from Chicago, on suspicion they may have been conducting a dry run for an airline terror attack.

Staff feared something was up when they trooped down to their regular monthly meeting with management only to discover that the usual array of beer and wine had been scrapped and replaced by water and fizzy soft drinks. Not only that, the monthly raffle (top prize: \u00a350 of Top Shop vouchers) was nowhere to be seen. Some staff were in tears at the announcement that the channels would close, with moods not entirely lifted by the Sky high-up who said how refreshing it was that &quot;decisions are actually made&quot; at Sky. Yeah, thanks for that. Predictably, a planned company bowling day also bit the dust. No chance of a strike then. \u2712The BBC has spent most of the past two years tightening up its rules for competitions, and is naturally sensitive to any accusation of fakery or misleading the listeners.

They mainly travel via Kenya, Dubai or Yemen, though there is growing evidence they are now going through Uganda, counterterrorism officials suggest. It is not believed that the arrested man was involved in a plot in Britain, but Evert Boersma, from the Dutch prosecutors&apos; office, said the arrest followed a tip-off from British authorities. He said the man was suspected of possible involvement with a foreign terrorist organisation, but did not specify which. The man flew in on Sunday morning on a KLM flight, Boersma said. &quot;He had already boarded his connecting flight for Uganda when he was arrested.&quot; Another spokesman for the Dutch prosecutors&apos; office said: &quot;The man was en route from Liverpool to Entebbe in Uganda when he was arrested.

Surely the summer of 2012 would be a much better time to introduce this for visitors to the Olympics? Your article seems to assume that the users of such a service would all be business people, heads down to their laptops. For me the advantage of the train is that the journey itself is worth experiencing. On a recent journey to Nice by train the view was worth watching from the moment we entered France \u2013 and the point where we emerged into the Rhone valley and could see the snow-capped Alps caused everyone in the carriage to gasp audibly. It&apos;s much more interesting that a flight. Your article also assumes that it&apos;s all about time: &quot;How quickly can I get there?&quot; If the question is: &quot;How\u00a0will this impact on the planet?&quot; then the train is by far the more attractive option. Please tell Deutsche Bahn it can&apos;t come soon enough for me. Peter Lewis Nottingham \u2022\u2008The prospect that Stratford International railway station might finally be used for cross-channel train travel could see the end of its status as a \u00a3200m white elephant. Built on the high-speed line, but never having had a single international train service stop there, it has hitherto been an embarrassment. But with direct train travel between London and Germany, particularly Frankfurt, I am certain its value could finally be realised. It is ideally placed to handle business passengers from nearby Canary Wharf travelling to Europe&apos;s financial hub, which is bound to reduce the demand for flights from London City airport. But, as importantly for that part of east London, it will mean Stratford International station becomes a destination itself, with all the added benefits to the local economy of businesses locating nearby. Andrew Boff Conservative, London assembly member \u2022\u2008Mark Smith rightly lauds the prospect of direct high-speed train services between London, Cologne and Frankfurt, and asks: &quot;What about a direct train service between London and Amsterdam?&quot; Surely the question should be: &quot;What about direct train services between Edinburgh and Paris, or Leeds and Brussels?&quot; \u2013 or does the rest of Britain not merit integration into the European rail network?

The secretary of state for transport, Philip Hammond, awaits the McNulty report on how to reduce the costs of the railway, but early indications from the report team indicate that it will duck the real issue of Network Rail&apos;s costs and instead propose restructuring the railway and closing lines for longer periods to allow more time for maintenance, without any evidence that this will actually save costs. The Office of Rail Regulation published a report this month that Network Rail was 34% to 40% less efficient than the best of European infrastructure managers, mainly in the maintenance and renewals area. So why did the ORR only require Network Rail to reduce its costs by 21% over five years? Surely the answer is to require NR to reduce its costs by a further 20% over the next four years while keeping lines open for longer for its customers to run trains. It would need a new management at Network Rail committed to real and effective cost-cutting and customer service, coupled with a less arrogant approach to its main funder, the government, and its stakeholders, but this ORR evidence is surely more powerful than spurious consultants&apos; views on costs savings from &quot;restructuring&quot;.

The problem, though, was persuading someone to take the lengthy sea journey down under \u2013 various reports suggest the idea being turned down by half of Europe&apos;s clubs, including those from England. Eventually the invite appears to have extended to Czechoslovakia, and after being turned down by the national side and Sparta Prague, Australia was in 1927 delighted to welcome Prague&apos;s AFK Vrsovice, who were renamed Bohemians (Bohemia being part of western Czechoslovakia) for the tour. The tour seems to have been hugely successful, with the Czech visitors winning 15, drawing two and losing three matches over four months. On their departure they were presented with two live kangaroos, which must have made the journey home interesting. A squad member named Havl\u00edn, though, is believed to have taken responsibility for the marsupial duo, and they were safely delivered to Prague Zoo. Such was the success of the entire episode, Vrsovice were permitted to keep the name Bohemians and the side became known as the Klokani, Czech for Kangaroos. The nickname stuck and the animals soon hopped onto the club crest. For more on Bohemians&apos; kangaroos you can read two slightly conflicting accounts: one from the Czech perspective  and one from an Australian. ONCE THEY GET THEIR CLAUSE IN \u2026 &quot;After Stefan Schwarz&apos;s space ban, which other contracts have had bizarre clauses inserted in them?&quot; wondered someone whose name has been lost in the mists of time. Let&apos;s hand this one over to Berlin-based football journalist and Knowledge reader, Eberhard Spohd:  German keeper Georg Koch went to PSV Eindhoven in 1997, but he left very soon for Arminia Bielefeld. He could do this, because he had the clause in his contract, that he could leave any time he suffered from racist hostility. You know, a German in Holland ...  Manager Frank Pageldorf also had a chance to immediately leave Hamburg if Uwe Seeler was no longer president of the club. Seeler departed soon after Pagelsdorf started as coach but the manager decided to stay and had some very good years with the club.  Let&apos;s see, what else do we have: Rolf-Christel Guie-Mien negotiated that his wife should get a cooking course when he played for Eintracht Frankfurt. Arminia Bielefeld guaranteed to build forward Giuseppe Reina one house for every year of his contract but didn&apos;t negotiate the size of it. That led to problems when it came to the golden handshake, believe me. In 1992 Udo Lattek was offered a 500,000 mark bonus if his team Schalke 04 finished higher than their rivals from Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season (but he was sacked before the end of the campaign).  And there is our dear manager Eugen Hach who was fired at Alemannia Aachen because of this strange clause. The club was allowed to sack him, if his team was less than three points clear of the relegation zone (but only after the eighth matchday of the season). And the inevitable happened. Hach explained why he accepted this clause: &quot;I had a strong belief in this team.&quot;  And Germany isn&apos;t the only place for odd contracts. &quot;Stig Inge Bj\u00f8rnebye, of Liverpool fame, was a keen ski jumper in his younger days (his father was a former Olympic ski jumper),&quot; writes Stig Marstein, &quot;and in Stig&apos;s Liverpool contract it was stated that he was not allowed to ski jump or any other form of skiing, obviously to avoid ski related injuries.&quot; GROUNDS CLOSE TO WATER, ROADS AND PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE YOU CARE TO MENTION Last week we looked at some of the stadiums closest to water, from Zenit St Petersburg&apos;s surrounded stadium to the old AFC Portchester that backed on to a moat. As ever, the Knowledge inbox has been full of those we missed: Of course, there&apos;s the old Gay Meadow, the former home of Shrewsbury Town, where Fred Davies and his coracle used to chase balls in the Severn and the aptly-named Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough. In mainland Europe there&apos;s Werder Bremen&apos;s Weserstadion on the banks of the Weser (which might also be the ground closest to a swimming pool), Slovan Liberec&apos;s Stadion U Nisy which almost overhangs the river Nesa from which it takes its name and Kalmar&apos;s soon-to-be-defunct Fredrikskans ground. &quot;The views from the stands over the pitch and the water behind must be unique in top flight football,&quot; writes David Tornquist. &quot;Less pleasant are the views of the spectators standing on the banks and relieving themselves into the water at half-time.&quot; Even further afield there&apos;s the WIN Stadium in Wollongong, the Nelson Mandela Stadium in Port Elizabeth. In non-league football there&apos;s St George&apos;s Lane, home of Worcester City, where the Canal End isn&apos;t just a nice name, and this offering from Bob Figg: &quot;At a very amateur level Godmanchester Rovers FC in Cambridgeshire are (or at least were) located on an island. My dear departed dad used to regale me with tales of the 30s and 40s when the idea was to get a goal up and then boot the old-style football into the river. Once it was retrieved it was waterlogged and apparently like kicking a cannon ball.&quot; We reckon a likely sight was here, though it seems the club have now moved away to a site across town. At least two grounds have been built on top of (former) bodies of water \u2013 Southampton&apos;s old Dell, and Chelsea&apos;s Stamford Bridge, which according to Ben Prow and this map, was built over Counter&apos;s Creek. And to go back a fortnight to our piece on grounds near major roads (more interesting that it sounds, believe us), we were remiss not to include Ajax&apos;s Amsterdam Arena, which, while not built near a major road, is actually on top of a small one. \u2022 Thanks to Paul Sylvester for this link to the rather wonderful European Fields photographic website, which not only features grounds near roads and rivers, but some near vineyards, petrochemical sites and reindeer. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;A couple of years ago I stumbled across what looked like Garth Crooks presenting Newsnight. I&apos;m still, to this day, unsure of whether it was a bad dream or it actually happened. What&apos;s the deal?&quot; asked Andy Blackshire back in 2005. Close, but no cigar, Andy; what you were watching was indeed on BBC2, but it was everyone&apos;s (OK, the odd person&apos;s) favourite questioner hosting Despatch Box, a late-night politics show. It transpires that Garth used his spare time as a player at Tottenham to study politics at college. Along with this and his BBC Sport work, another string to his broadcasting bow has been the &quot;discussion-cum-record&quot; radio show he hosted on Greater London Radio, Garth Crooks in Conversation, which even won him a Sony Award in 1999-2000.

Catherine Zeta-Jones?&quot; A glimmer of recognition, if you&apos;re lucky... Looking at media coverage of some of the world&apos;s more obscure towns, you may be forgiven for thinking a city&apos;s fame only comes with its traumas. Bridgend is still trying to patch up its sombre media coverage with rebranding initiatives such as ourbridgend.com.  In an age where it seems like our geographical knowledge is only improving because there are more war zones to read about, a young company based in the heart of the Hayes is seeking to buck this trend. Operating out of The Old Library, the office of Cardiff &amp; Co is almost like J.K. Rowling&apos;s Platform 9-3/4 in its subtlety, going unseen amidst the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The man working the magic is Richard Thomas, managing director of the company. Founded in 2007, its aim is to market the city to the world, be it as a leisure, tourism or business destination.  One of the company&apos;s challenges is to promote a positive new image of Cardiff in the modern world. What, then, does Thomas make of the hackneyed clich\u00e9 of using somebody such as Shirley Bassey as a poster child of the city?   &quot;Sometimes there&apos;s nothing wrong with a hackneyed clich\u00e9. Other nations often exploit clich\u00e9s and stereotypes rather well,&quot; &quot;As long as they&apos;re constructive, positive and have a modern and up-to-date feel to them, I think that&apos;s fine.&quot;   He cites the male voice choir Only Men Aloud as an example of this new, hybrid representation of Cardiff: a totemic, choral image but with a &quot;modern twist&quot;. On the subject of the arts, Thomas is adamant Cardiff now has more than enough happening to sate the appetite of visiting culture vultures. He said:  &quot;Our cultural offer is developing year on year. Now we&apos;re fortunate in having the Wales Millennium Centre, which is not only an iconic building, but the things that go on there are fantastic as well. With it being home to the Welsh National Opera, but also more populist things like Mamma Mia!, for example, I think we&apos;re now seriously on the cultural map.&quot;  Perhaps through stereotypes in the media, many of my non-Welsh friends now living happily in Cardiff initially had certain apprehensions about moving to the capital city. They are now loath to leave; one of the main reasons unanimously being that people here are friendlier than in most cities, British or otherwise.  Thomas concurs: the city likes to prove its naysayers wrong. He highlights the case of the Ashes in 2009, held in the brand new Swalec stadium, as an example. He said:   &quot;Beforehand, the media were largely negative about the prospect of the Ashes coming to Cardiff, with doubts about the pitch, doubts about the capacity of the city to cope and to organise such a big sporting occasion. &quot;They were proved wrong on all counts, and in fact were very positive about it afterwards and were pleased to admit that they were wrong. When (people) come to the city, they&apos;re pleasantly surprised and tell other people about their experiences and want to come back.&quot;  Thomas added: &quot;The proof is in the pudding. People come here and they love it.&quot;      Display rafts at White Water, Cardiff Photograph: Hannah Waldram/guardian.co.uk    On the subject of sports, Cardiff is also increasing its portfolio in this field, with the recent opening of its International White Water centre (&quot;an excitement- and thrill-packed session,&quot; he assures me) and the council recently secured a contract to build a new ice rink - both in the prosperous Bay area.  Concordantly, Cardiff &amp; Co are putting notable emphasis on the business front. He cites the relocation of the BBC Wales studios from Llandaff to the Roath Basin as a major boost for the city.     Matt Smith as Doctor Who. Photograph: BBC Photograph: BBC    The move would bring the likes of Holby City, Doctor Who and Sherlock to the once-derelict docklands. Thomas said:   &quot;It will really put Cardiff at the forefront of drama development for the BBC across the UK and further builds on the city region&apos;s position as a major employer with the media and creative sectors.&quot;   One need only wander down to the waterside of Mermaid Quay to see how influential these homegrown TV shows have been in attracting tourists to the city. A shrine to a fictional character killed off in BBC Wales&apos;s sci-fi series Torchwood has been gathering size there for some time now, with letters and items adorning the wall left by people from Arizona to Tokyo.

It&apos;s true that my booklet \u2013 distributed on the banks of the Thames recently as part of the event A River Enquiry, for the mayor&apos;s Thames festival \u2013 had explicitly stated that Caine would be there, &quot;re-sinking a scale replica of Atlantis&quot;. But most people had figured out from the tone that the events in my brochure, which I&apos;d named &quot;Cold Water Fun&quot;, would not really be taking place as advertised. There were certainly no crowds milling at the appointed hour to see Boris Johnson dropped naked into the river from a helicopter in the &quot;SPLASH CONTEST&quot;, and no one formed lines later that afternoon to watch &quot;beggars from the eurozone&quot; perform poems to the river in cockney rhyming slang. Over the last year or so I&apos;ve done a series of related works, creating pamphlets to announce \u2013 often in overzealous capitals and small print \u2013 the dates, times and locations for imaginary, scurrilous and often impossible events. The first booklet, produced for the Frascati Theatre in Amsterdam, promised among other unlikely things a nine-hour apology from Tony Blair concerning his conduct over Iraq. More recently, potential punters in Paris were misled to expect the appearance of &quot;biologically female&quot; strippers and a &quot;reflationary discoth\u00e8que&quot;; and up in Edinburgh last year, at Forest Fringe, a few sorry souls searched in vain for a genetically enhanced arm-wrestling contest in which Bob &quot;the octopus&quot; Brown was slated to take on Karl &quot;the monkey man&quot; Malone. Back in London, the delight people seemed to find in my Cold Water Fun booklet came from its ludicrous disruption of the proper and the everyday. Standing on the banks of the Thames in the sunshine, people could look out at the serene river and imagine it filled with a replica Spanish armada in combat with Sudanese pirates. Mimicking the contemporary appetite for reality as cruel spectacle, parroting phrases from tabloid headlines, internet spam and talent-contest announcements, the booklets contained more than a whiff of the unsavoury. The promised mix of theatrical performance and real-life spectacle mirrored our contemporary media landscape, where footage of distant disasters appears alongside fake paparazzi shots of minor celebrities having drinks with TV-coached politicians. Reality, we can say quite surely, is not what it used to be. As a writer and producer, what excites me about creating virtual events is that you can pick your cast and locations without the concern for practicalities or budgets. If you want Demis Roussos singing Agadoo from the top of a blazing Houses of Parliament, you just write it and it&apos;s happening. If you want a debate between Pete Doherty, Charles Dickens and Robinson Crusoe, that&apos;s also fine. No matter if Doherty&apos;s in rehab, Dickens deceased and Crusoe fictional \u2013 they&apos;ll all be there without question. Researching for Cold Water Fun, I was also thrilled to find a slew of material on London&apos;s historical carnivalesque past, specifically related to the river. I especially enjoyed accounts I found in history books of the more or less spontaneous frost fairs which took place on the frozen Thames from the 1600s onwards. Elephants were led across the ice, dancing bears and dog-fights abounded, and you found stalls of different kinds as well as puppet shows and carousels, all presented on what a contemporary commentator referred to as &quot;the great river become a stage&quot;. I loved imagining this transformation that the ice must have brought to the capital \u2013 stopping the river traffic and turning the working Thames into a party venue, a place for marvels and an arena in which to earn a hasty shilling. Climate change is certainly heading us in the opposite direction, but a frozen Thames would be a great excuse to stage that sliding contest, imagined in my booklet, for real.", "sentences": ["The first booklet, produced for the Frascati Theatre in Amsterdam, promised among other unlikely things a nine-hour apology from Tony Blair concerning his conduct over Iraq."], "title": "Tim Etchells on performance: Virtual events occur in spirit on a mystic river", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/sep/22/tim-etchells-performance-virtual-events", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-09-24T09:36:17Z", "article": "1) Ralph Milne (Scotland) Picture the scene. It&apos;s the last day of the season, and you need to win if you are to claim your first league title. Pressure enough without the gigantic hassle of playing a local derby away from home. What you really need is your outstanding flair player, a maverick with just a snifter of genius, to score a goal of such stupefying majesty within the first four minutes to calm your nerves and make think - actually, to make you know - fate is on your side. In 1983, Dundee United had that genius. He was called Ralph Milne, and his goal at Dens Park that day is one of the greatest scored on these shores in the 1980s. It was the day after his 22nd birthday, and a moment so perfect as to bring a lump to the throat. Yes this is the same Ralph Milne who is seen a complete joke by most in England. Milne was indeed a big fat mess at Charlton, Bristol City and, most infamously, Manchester United - Sir Alex Ferguson recently described him as his worst-ever signing - but that&apos;s only because he had failed or decided not to suppress his love of the booze. But at Dundee United Milne was a revelation: a Tangerine dream of a winger who frequently Tango&apos;d opposing left-backs with his combination of mischief, tricks and frightening pace. He was totally two-footed and the big occasion stimulated Milne like his first dram. His record of 15 European goals for Dundee United is unlikely to be beaten in a hurry. Yet he played his last game for the club at 25 and his last professional game (bar a spell in Hong Kong) at 28. &quot;If I had an outstanding failure then it was Ralph Milne,&quot; said Jim McLean, who managed United to that title. &quot;He should have been playing in World Cups. He should have won a bundle of Scotland international honours. It was a tragedy that that boy was not playing for his country all the time. He had tremendous talent - and I failed with him. He did not have the right attitude to the game and I could not instil that into him.&quot; McLean might be philosophical about it, but Milne isn&apos;t. That was his career - his life - and, rightly or wrongly, he blames McLean. Indeed, he detests him: for being too despotic (he once fined Milne a week&apos;s wage for leaving the gym light on, even though Milne says he had never been near the gym and particularly for denying him a chance to play for his country. While Mexico 86 was going on, Milne was supplementing his relatively paltry wage in a plastics factory. &quot;Without stating the obvious,&quot; he says, &quot;that was a hard one to stomach.&quot; The sadness will stay with him until his last breath - but so will the good times, particularly one stab of his left foot on 14 May 1983. The Ralph Milne story is told in full in this moving documentary. RS 2) Bert Trautmann (West Germany) Over the years, Bert Trautmann routed the big school bully, punched his own sergeant as he fought on the Eastern Front, smacked his captor as a POW, and walloped the referee after a game between Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. Other times he was calmness personified. Before one Manchester derby in the mid-1950s, Matt Busby \u2013 never a bad judge of player \u2013 told his Babes they were to, under no circumstances, look up when they shot at goal. &quot;If he sees your eyes,&quot; warned Busby, &quot;he&apos;ll know where you&apos;re going to put it.&quot; Trautmann was a great shot stopper, commanded his box, was dominant on crosses \u2013 and was as brave as they come, playing out the last 16 minutes of City&apos;s victory over Birmingham in the 1956 FA Cup final with a broken neck. He was roundly considered his country&apos;s best of the era \u2013 and to this day their best of all time \u2013 but never won a cap because he was unofficially blacklisted by the DFB for the &quot;mercenary&quot; act of turning professional, the German game still in thrall to amateurism. West Germany would have to make do with the erratic Toni Turek (who, this being Germany, turned in a man-of-the-match performance as his side beat Hungary in the 1954 World Cup final, but that&apos;s another story). SM  3) Jimmy Case (England) You can make a strong case for Liverpool&apos;s title-winning side of 1978-79 as being the greatest in the history of the English game. The midfield quartet had everything. Ray Kennedy, Terry McDermott and Graeme Souness could all put it about to various degrees, but had ample class. The fourth, Jimmy Case, was more of a bits-and-pieces grafter, but only when juxtaposed with the ridiculous talents of his team-mates. In that 1978-79 season, he scored the fewest goals in the Liverpool midfield, yet still managed a healthy haul of seven. To put that into context, Xabi Alonso, Liverpool&apos;s best midfielder of the 2000s by some distance, scored 18 goals over five seasons, never getting more than five in a single campaign. Bob Paisley could not understand why England manager Ron Greenwood never picked Case. &quot;From the moment Greenwood took charge of England,&quot; argued Paisley, &quot;he quite rightly plumped for the club system by taking more than half our team, six players in all, for his first game against Switzerland. At that time he picked three of our midfield men, McDermott, Ian Callaghan and Kennedy, yet ignored Case. The strength of our midfield was based on the collective efforts of four men, not three. Case&apos;s absence threw extra work on the other three. Greenwood should have gone the whole hog and picked Case as well, he&apos;s a key man.&quot; Case would have to make do with winning all of Liverpool&apos;s first three European Cup finals. SM  4) Horst Blankenburg (West Germany) It&apos;s no good being next in line to the throne if the Queen lives until she&apos;s 274. Ask Prince Charles. Or Horst Blankenburg. In football years, that&apos;s how long Der Kaiser, Franz Beckenbauer, lived when he was blocking the route of Blankenburg to the West Germany team. Beckenbauer started 60 consecutive games over nearly seven years before retiring from international football in 1977, so the closest Blankenburg - the ultra-smooth libero in Ajax&apos;s three consecutive European Cup wins in the early 1970s, who played good cop to big Barry Hulshoff&apos;s bad - got to international football was when he picked for a star-studded select XI in The Six versus The Three match at Wembley in 1973 to celebrate the UK&apos;s entry into the EEC. Irony or ironies, he played alongside Beckenbauer - and was managed by Helmut Sch\u00f6n, the man who consistently ignored him with West Germany. Blankenburg&apos;s is an odd case. He was at Ajax between the ages of 23 and 28 but did scarcely anything either side of that, and had been headhunted from a relegated Bundesliga side, 1860 Munich, to replace the brilliant Velibor Vasovic. He was the only regular outfield player in Ajax&apos;s Total Football side not to play international football (the goalkeeper, Heinz Stuy, was also uncapped). Hennes Weisweiler, the legendary German coach, said Blankenburg came closest to his ideal of a libero, yet there was an alternative school of thought. Some felt that Ajax were so good that any Tom, Dick or Horst have played sweeper; others retorted that Blankenburg was so sophisticated that only Ajax were intelligent enough to get the best out of him. Blankenburg&apos;s bigger achievement might have been to fit in with Ajax off the field. At the time they were embroiled in perhaps football&apos;s most interesting rivalry, and in the Venn diagram that had Ajax and Holland on one side and Bayern Munich and West Germany on the other, Blankenburg was the very small bit in the middle. He owed that to making such a majestic first impression. The late, great Bobby Haarms, Ajax&apos;s assistant manager throughout the 1970s, takes up the story: &quot;He asked me when he came to Ajax how to present himself to the other players. I basically said: &apos;They&apos;re all typical Amsterdam arseholes. Full of themselves.&apos; Blankenburg walked into the dressing room, said: &apos;I&apos;m Horst, I&apos;m a Kraut and I&apos;ve come to play football with you.&apos; And that was it. He was immediately accepted.&quot; A German taken to the Ajax bosom; we really can&apos;t stress how unlikely this was. Blankenburg starred when Ajax humiliated Bayern in the European Cup in 1973, their signature performance. Johan Cruyff even asked him to play as a naturalised Dutchman in the 1974 World Cup, which would have added another twist to the already heavily loaded final against West Germany in Munich. Reports vary as to whether Blankenburg declined, still hoping to play for his country, or was not allowed. Either way, he had no chance of playing for West Germany, and not just because of Beckenbauer. &quot;Maybe I was too inconvenient for the national coach; I always said what I thought,&quot; says Blankenburg. &quot;It is partially my fault. After I won the European Cup with Ajax for the third time in a row (in 1973), a journalist told me that Sch\u00f6n had said &apos;I&apos;ve never noticed Blankenburg. I don&apos;t know why I should select him.&apos; Of course I was angry and said to the journalist &apos;Sch\u00f6n can lick my arse!&apos; That didn&apos;t go unpublished - and that was the end of my dreams of the national team.&quot; Three European Cups and eternal love in his spiritual home of Amsterdam, where a bridge is named after him, is not a bad compensation. RS 5) John McGovern (Scotland) John McGovern was often disparaged as a journeyman, but man did he go on a journey with Brian Clough. He is sometimes described as a water-carrier, but somebody had to carry the water so that Clough could walk on it. Clough bought McGovern at three of his five clubs, inherited him at a fourth (Hartlepool) and tried to buy him for the other (Brighton). McGovern was Clough&apos;s idea of what a young man should be like: polite, neat-looking (although only after Clough ordered a terrified 15-year-old McGovern to get his flowing locks cut at their first meeting and, crucially, vice-free. Clough became a father figure, albeit with a twist. &quot;My dad died when I was 11,&quot; said McGovern, &quot;and in some ways he was the only male person I could get advice from - although I didn&apos;t ask advice, it was kind of thrown at me.&quot; Clough made McGovern the youngest man to play in all four divisions by the time he was 19, and he would captain Nottingham Forest to the title and two European Cups. Yet on the pitch, as he shambled around the centre of midfield, McGovern could look terribly awkward and cherubic; when he arrived for his first day at Derby on a bike, the great Dave Mackay said he thought McGovern was a &quot;bold adolescent autograph-hunter&quot;. But Clough (or rather Peter Taylor, who persuaded an originally sceptical Clough) spotted that McGovern had something so few people in the English game now, never mind then, are aware of: the importance of moral courage, and in industrial quantities. &quot;He couldn&apos;t run and often looked ungainly,&quot; said Clough. &quot;But he would always stand up straight, he always strived to get and to pass the ball, and he would do that whether the team was losing 3-0 on a filthy night at Walsall or winning 4-0 on a sunny afternoon at Wembley.&quot; McGovern became Clough&apos;s consigliere, the on-field manager who calmly dealt with trouble and kept his nerve when others were flagging. He was a playbreaker and a playmaker, the sort of unobtrusive type whose value has only become truly apparent in modern times. Scotland had some very good midfielders around that time, yet it is still a travesty that McGovern did not play one game. And when he says &quot;I would have walked to Scotland for a single cap&quot;, it is not just an inane platitude. He wasn&apos;t helped by a farcical incident involving the Scotland manager, Ally MacLeod. When Forest stuffed Manchester United 4-0 at Old Trafford in their Championship season of 1977-78, MacLeod announced excitably that all Forest&apos;s Scottish players would be in his squad for the following summer&apos;s World Cup. A photographer, sensing an opportunity for some coin, got the four - McGovern, John Robertson, Archie Gemmill and Kenny Burns - to dress up in kilts. When the squad was announced there was no McGovern; it transpired MacLeod had no idea he was Scottish. &quot;Takes some believing, eh?&quot; says McGovern. Then again, so does the story of the quiet lad who formed such a bond with Brian Clough. In the good times and bad, McGovern&apos;s was unbelievable tale. RS 6) Micky Hazard (England) Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. British managers have never been entirely comfortable with diminutive ball-playing midfielders, but in the 1980s - the heyday of long-ball football - they treated them with a suspicion usually reserved for articulate aliens. So it was that Micky Hazard&apos;s career passed without him getting anything like the credit or opportunities he deserved. After all, apart from passing the ball with wit, imagination and rare technical skill to a teammate, what did he actually do? Hazard, an Englishman in name but not nature, had a few very good years under Keith Burkinshaw, but generally struggled to get a game for club, never mind country. That was understandable at Spurs, where he had to compete with Glenn Hoddle and Ossie Ardiles; less so at Chelsea, where he would usually miss out to John Bumstead, Peter Nicholas, Nigel Spackman and even John McNaught. He wasn&apos;t helped by a penchant for fast food that meant he struggled to play two games a week, but it was still a desperately sorry state of affairs. After inspiring Spurs to the Uefa Cup in 1984, with the winner in the semi-final and assists for both their goals in the amazing final against Anderlecht, he made the England squad for the summer matches against Scotland and the USSR. There is a probably apocryphal story that Bobby Robson told him to warm up at half-time, as he&apos;d be going on, and then forgot about him. Either way, Hazard did not feature again. Fans of Spurs and Chelsea adored him, but to others his value only really became apparent when he enjoyed an Swindonian summer in the early 1990s under Ardiles and Hoddle. The fact that these two built their teams around him - Ardiles signed him twice, bringing him back to Spurs in 1993 - was, in many ways, the casting judgement on his career. In a sense Hazard was an ersatz Xavi, and praise including the word &apos;ersatz&apos; comes no higher. He was certainly a Proper Footballer, and England is no country for those. Hazard might not be the best player never to play for England, but he has a good case for being the classiest.

I have also encountered the &apos;Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&apos; which is green and white, the &apos;AT Bilbao&apos;, the &apos;Kaiser Chiefs&apos;, and the &apos;Juventus&apos;. No doubt there are many others. Vessels are named by their owners or holding companies. Sometimes the name seems random but some vessels are named after famous figures (real, literary or mythical), places, song titles or for family members. Of course, the odd wealthy football fan can also pay homage to his team in this way.&quot; Well let&apos;s take a look at the good ship Borussia Dortmund. Built in 1998, she&apos;s currently stationed in St Petersburg, though seems set to head to Hamburg this week (you can follow her progress on this brilliant tool here). More than 20 photos of her in all her glory can be found here, as she flits from port to port. There&apos;s also the aforementioned Juventus and a couple of Arsenals too. Incidentally, while on the subject of Dortmund, it would be remiss of us not to recall the instance when an investigation by the German consumer TV show Plusminus in 2000 claimed to have found tributyltin - a toxic anti-bacterial chemical that can cause health problems in humans - in the club&apos;s replica Nike shirts. Tributyltin is more commonly used as a paint on ships to protect them from barnacle damage. &quot;We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn&apos;t be in textiles that people wear,&quot; said scientist J\u00fcrgen Kundke. Dortmund pulled the shirts from their club shop, as did the Kaufhof, Karstadt and Hertie department stores, though Nike were quick to insist: &quot;Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans.&quot; Moving on, Michel van der Velde notes that &quot;a towage company from IJmuiden (close to Amsterdam) re-named one of their ships after the local second division football club two months ago. Telstar, whose famous players include Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Arjan de Zeeuw, Heinz Stuy and Louis van Gaal, can be seen here.&quot; And Nick Tolerton adds that &quot;there was a whole fleet of ships named after teams, the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd fleet of deepwater Grimsby steam and motor trawlers&quot;. He goes on to add:  In the 1960s this ran to more than 20 ships named after football teams, and over the decades from the first in the early 1930s nearly 30 clubs were represented. Inevitably there was a Grimsby Town. However, as well as ships named after the more glamorous clubs of the 50s and 60s - an Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton, Spurs, and Wolverhampton Wanderers (the last of those must have been a tight squeeze to paint up on the stern) - the smaller clubs were well-represented, including an Aldershot, Gillingham, Port Vale, and, generously considering their rivalry with Grimsby, a Lincoln City. The one foreign team, inevitably at that time, was the Real Madrid of 1961.  More information about the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd &apos;football fleet&apos; (plus pictures of all the vessels) can be found here. Switching to tourist boats, Justin Horton offers word of the Spanish ferry company Iscomar, which &quot;repainted its vessel Isabel Del Mar with the badge of RCD Mallorca as part of a sponsorship deal. It is to be hoped that neither party to the agreement goes down.&quot; And Genoa resident Michael Nimmo adds that &quot;one of the companies (Rimorchiatori Riuniti) where I work, organises boats in the harbour here. A lot of their workers are Genoa fans, and in honour of one of our star players two years ago, Thiago Motta (formerly of Bar\u00e7a and now of Inter) the company called one of their boats The Brazilian, and gave it No88 (his squad number). He came down and signed autographs and had his photo taken, but needless to say he left shortly after.&quot; While we&apos;re on the subject of football&apos;s sea-faring links, it is worth digging into the history of Boca Juniors. After losing a play-off against local rivals Boedo for the right to their black-and-white-striped kit in March 1907, Boca agreed to visit Buenos Aires harbour and take the colours of the first foreign ship to come in. The 4,146-tonne freighter Drottning Sophia arrived from Copenhagen, flying the Swedish flag and the rest is history. When the club released a limited-edition 105th anniversary shirt in 2010, it even bore the yellow and blue national flag on the front. Any more for any more? You know where to email. TRAVEL SICKNESS &quot;Starting from their home ground for every away trip, which fans would have the shortest distance to travel to visit every other English league ground?&quot; wonders Ian Cade. &quot;Our thinking was that it would be somewhere in the Midlands or north west, with perhaps Stoke being the compromise \u2026&quot; Step forward Daniel Lewis, from University College London&apos;s Department of Geography, who manfully offered to do our job for us, at least in terms of top-flight teams. He writes: &quot;Being a geographer I thought I&apos;d have a crack at it ... Method: I gathered the stadium postcode for each Premier League club, and then wrote a web scrapper to ask Google Maps for the best route between each home stadium and each away stadium. This creates a time/travel matrix which you can use as a lookup to find the travel time between two clubs. The query returns the fastest possible driving time, and the distance associated with that time. While there may be shorter routes, my thinking is that time taken to travel to an away game is more important than the distance exactly. Results: The best club to support for least distance to all away games is Stoke, with a total travel time to all matches of 1,989 minutes (33 hours and nine minutes) and an average journey time of 99 minutes (1 hour and 39 minutes) for an approximate total distance of 1,860 miles (average 93 miles). The worst club to support for distance to all away games is Sunderland, with a total season travel time of 4,005 minutes (66 hours and 45 minutes) a total over twice that of Stoke, and an average journey of 200 minutes (3 hours and 20 minutes) for a total distance of 36,48 miles (average 182.4 miles). Fans from Newcastle actually have to go slightly further, but Google reckons that they will get there faster. The most remote game in the season is between Sunderland and Fulham, which is at least a 305-minute drive (5 hours and five minutes). The most accessible game of the season is the Merseyside derby where the grounds are four minutes apart, edging out the Chelsea v Fulham game by one minute. Full results can be found in these two matrices.&quot; Luckily, reader Marcos Garcia has been casting his eye over the rest of the Football League&apos;s teams, albeit not in such scientific detail. &quot;By my calculations, the fans with the shortest distance to travel would be those from Burton Albion,&quot; he begins. &quot;Going to every other English football ground and returning to the Pirelli Stadium each time would involve a total journey of approximately 14,835 miles. At the other end of the scale, Plymouth Argyle&apos;s supporters would have the furthest to travel, clocking up a whopping 36,672 miles which is roughly one and a half times around the earth. If we look at the individual leagues, the Championship&apos;s least travelled supporters are those from Leicester City (3,862 miles), with the most travelled being Swansea City (7,245 miles); League One has MK Dons (4,583 miles) and Carlisle United (9,688 miles); while in League Two there&apos;s Burton Albion (3,457 miles) and Torquay United (8,517 miles).&quot; FOOTBALL SCORES &quot;Last weekend I saw the fantastic game between Schalke 04 and Dortmund with a friend,&quot; writes Hauke Bracht. &quot;It was an intense game and a joy to watch and gave us the following idea: wouldn&apos;t it be fun, watching football in a pub, to have live musical improvisation as a soundtrack? Has any piece of music ever been improvised or composed as a soundtrack to a particular football game? If so - what match? If not - why not?&quot; We are delighted to report, Hauke, that this has indeed been done before. During the second May bank holiday this year, English violinist Nigel Kennedy put on a series of events as part of his Polish Weekend at London&apos;s Southbank Centre by the Thames. The weekend&apos;s signature event was a show called the World Cup Project, in which he and 20 or so other musicians played in front of a silent screening of Poland&apos;s 1-1 qualifying draw with England from 1973 (a result that meant Poland would qualify for Germany 74, while England would not). The piece received a broadly positive critical reception, but the most common complaint was that the semi-improvised performances had not reflected the action on the pitch. As John L Walters noted in the Guardian: &quot;[It] was a curate&apos;s egg: 20-odd musicians playing alongside a screening of the notorious match between England and Poland. Kennedy&apos;s riffs were redolent of Hot Rats-era Zappa, electric Miles and white funk. There&apos;s nothing like Wembley and endless feedback solos to bring out one&apos;s inner bloke. The match was better structured than the music, though, as heroic goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski made save after save against the vivid green pitch and K-tel ads of 1970s TV football. When Poland scored, the audience erupted, but the &apos;soundtrack&apos; just riffed on until coming to an arbitrary halt. Combining football and music is a great idea, but it may need a more responsive lineup.&quot; While we&apos;re on the subject, we must remember Mogwai&apos;s mesmerising soundtrack to the film Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, and here is an older Knowledge column on the classicial composers inspired by football. ENGLAND MIDWEEK &quot;I&apos;m currently working in Germany, and the Bundesliga seems to have something known as the &apos;Englische Woche&apos;,&quot; writes Tom Ayres. &quot;As far as I can tell, this is where everyone plays two or three games within seven days (presumably to make up for time lost over a winter break). I&apos;m just curious to know why it&apos;s known as the English week \u2013 a sly dig at certain non-terrestrial TV companies in the UK, maybe?&quot; We&apos;ll let Raphael Honigstein field this one: &quot;It&apos;s much more banal than that. Weeks with midweek games are known as Englische Woche(n), because that&apos;s how football is being played in England. In Germany, midweek games are rarer.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Apart from goalkeepers, who&apos;s won the most caps without scoring a goal for their country?&quot; wondered Marcus Massey in 2008. As Gabriel Byrne says in Miller&apos;s Crossing, &quot;Who ya gonna believe?&quot; There&apos;s a bit of confusion on this one, due to conflicting evidence from Wikipedia and rsssf.com. According to Wikipedia, the Saudi Arabian defender Mohammed Saleh Al Khilaiwi scored once in 142 appearances, which makes the Egyptian defender Hany Ramzy \u2013 who failed to engage the back of anyone&apos;s net in 124 appearances \u2013 the market leader in this particular field. Yet rsssf.com, which is probably less unreliable than Wikipedia, suggests Saleh Al Khilaiwi only scored in penalty shoot-outs during 143 games for his country. After doing a Columbo, we reckon the offending goal came during an Olympic Games match against Australia in 1996. Which, in official terms, doesn&apos;t count.

Bowman said about a fifth of Smiths&apos; \u00a32.7bn of sales last year came from government-related contracts around the world, casting a cloud over a key part of its business for the foreseeable future. The UK accounts for about 4% of revenues across the group, which counts the UK Ministry of Defence, airports operator BAA, and the US department of defence as clients. Bowman said: &quot;Clearly governments around the world, especially in the developing world, are going to be cutting costs, which is going to present challenges over the medium term.&quot; Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: &quot;The results themselves are pretty solid but the price for the credit crisis has still yet to be paid. Smiths is certainly not alone in having question marks over government spending, this is something the whole market is contending with.&quot; Smiths&apos; warning comes ahead of a meeting tomorrow convened by Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, with more than 30 of the state&apos;s biggest suppliers. The talks will include representatives from accounting firms Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG, and construction firm Balfour Beatty, and will to address the terms of their contracts. Smiths joins Connaught, the collapsed council house maintenance firm, schools IT company RM Group, construction firm Balfour Beatty and telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide in warning about the impact of the forthcoming government spending cuts, which are widely expected to be the most severe since the second world war. But Philip Bowman said the economic uncertainty went far beyond government spending cuts: &quot;Banks are rebuilding their balance sheets, Ireland is going back into recession and various forms of tax increases are going to affect consumer demand and so economic conditions are likely to remain challenging.&quot; Smiths&apos; so-called detection unit was the best performing of its five divisions, reporting a 43% jump in operating profit to \u00a390m on the back of a 15% rise in sales to \u00a3574m. The unit, which is piloting a new body imaging system that detects items concealed under clothing, is benefiting from a rise in airport security spending following the attempted terrorist attack on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day last year. Bowman said the unit, which also makes X-ray and trace detection systems, is likely to benefit from the withdrawal of British and American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there were opportunities for selling detection equipment as they beef up security screening of cargo and people,&quot; he said. Smiths maintained its full-year dividend payout at 34p a share. Its \u00a3435m profit is comfortably ahead of analysts&apos; forecast of \u00a3383m. However, in a research note Credit Suisse analyst Andre Kukhnin anticipated only a &quot;small upgrade&quot; to his forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year because &quot;the company continues to highlight the uncertain macroeconomic conditions and government spending restrictions&quot;.

He was lamenting that, since the Stedelijk Museum closed for renovation, there are very few places where contemporary art can be displayed. So he and his team decided to make just such an expo, and Beeld Hal Werk is the result. Beeld Hal Werk can have different meanings but, when pronounced, it sounds like the Dutch word for sculpture, some 60 examples of which are on display. Climb the tower in the middle for a nice overview - it&apos;s also is a good location for watching my favourite exhibit: Zoro&apos;s spinning cloth disc, which makes a very industrial sound and is a hypnotising image. The location is a former industrial factory where the light changes frequently during the day, giving different views to the works. For a nice contrast with all the metal and concrete, get a beer or two from the bar and enjoy views of the lake. Closure is planned for the end of October so go while it lasts. \u2022 Beeld Hal Werk, Gedempt Hamerkanaal 85. Entrance Fee \u20ac5. Open 11am\u20137pm daily.

When you enter, you are welcomed by Klaus, who seems to have been born behind the bar, and chain smokes despite having hardly any voice. If you meet him, he will surely tell you about his parrot and pour you some of his green booze-mix. This mix - and Klaus - are what make this bar famous. Just ask for the green special-mixed booze (I can&apos;t remember the name, as it is very hard). He will know what you mean. And only take one! I can tell you, that is enough. Than go to the jukebox and listen to some hits from past decades. When you want to move on there is the Toast bar across the street. At weekends you might meet young people on their way to bars and clubs here, but during the week it has more character when it fills with regulars. \u2022 Na und?!, Wohlwillstra\u00dfe 47, Sankt Pauli.

It is a lyrical transition from an upcycling museum (TrashArt lends new eyes and colours to disposable things collected together in a garage complex) to a classical, imposing, centrally located museum.

The solution was to bring in a versatile, high-profile producer, and take even more risks in breaking down the barriers between traditional music and jazz, vaudeville and any other big-band styles that took their fancy. Producer John Leckie has worked with everyone from the Stone Roses and Radiohead to Baaba Maal and Rodrigo Y Gabriela, and is now responsible for pushing the 11 members of Bellowhead to their limits, with mostly triumphant results. This is an album that constantly surprises and changes direction, with brave, intricate arrangements that transform even the best-know songs, but still guarantee that Jon Boden&apos;s vocals and storytelling are never swamped. There&apos;s an epic, widescreen approach to many of the songs, with the shanty New York Girls mixing the romping fiddle, accordion and brass with suitably personal vocals, while A-Begging I Will Go is treated to urgent, edgy brass work worthy of some Shaft-era thriller, and the slinky Yarmouth Town develops into a wild, jazzy workout.

Researchers from across the UK were honoured for achievements that included proof that swearing relieves pain, a means of collecting whale snot with a remote-controlled helicopter and the first documented case of fellatio in fruit bats. Not to be confused with the real (and more lucrative) Nobel prizes, which are due to be announced next week, the &quot;Igs&quot; are awarded to scientists whose work makes people laugh first and think later. The ceremony, hosted by the Harvard-based journal Annals of Improbable Research, took place last night with the much-coveted prizes handed out by real Nobel laureates. Recipients were allowed a maximum of 60 seconds to deliver their acceptance speech, a time limit enforced by an eight-year-old girl. Commenting on the strong showing of UK scientists this year, Marc Abrahams, the master of ceremonies, told the Guardian: &quot;The nation may agonise over its place in the world, but in this one thing at least, Britannia rules.&quot; The Ig Nobel 2010 winners were: Medicine prize Psychologists Simon Rietveld and Ilja van Beest at the University of Amsterdam share the award for discovering that breathing difficulties brought on by asthma can be alleviated by repeated rollercoaster rides. Physics prize Awarded to Lianne Parkin and her team at the University of Otago in New Zealand for demonstrating that people are less likely to slip over on icy footpaths if they wear their socks outside their shoes instead of inside. Biology prize A description of the sexual antics of the short-nosed fruit bat earned the award for Gareth Jones at Bristol University and collaborators in China. The team showed that females who performed oral sex on their mates copulated for longer. &quot;It is the first documented case of fellatio by adult animals other than humans to my knowledge, and opens questions about whether female animals can manipulate males via sexual activity, perhaps in this case to improve their chances of successful fertilisation,&quot; Jones told the Guardian. He planned to demonstrate the behaviour at the ceremony using puppets. Writing about the research for the Huffington Post last year, the primatologist Frans de Waal said: &quot;The fellatio story on bats is a bright spot in an otherwise miserable record that denies animals the pleasure principle, homosexuality, and other forms of non-reproductive sex.&quot; Peace prize Awarded to psychologist Richard Stephens and others at Keele University for confirming that swearing relieves pain. Stephens, who began the study after striking his thumb with a hammer, found volunteers could tolerate more pain if they repeated swearwords rather than neutral words. He suspects that &quot;swearing induces a fight-or-flight response and nullifies the link between fear of pain and pain perception&quot;. Engineering prize The task of monitoring dangerous bugs in whales at sea is a formidable one. Karina Acevedo-Whitehouse and others at the Institute of Zoology in London developed a way to collect fluids ejected from whales&apos; blowholes by attaching petri dishes to the underside of small, remote-controlled helicopters and hovering them overhead. Transportation prize Working with Japanese scientists, Mark Fricker and Dan Bebber at Oxford University used slime mould to model an effective railway network. In the experiment, cities were represented by porridge oats that were linked to one another as the slime mould grew. &quot;The Ig Nobel awards are great. They are a wonderful vehicle for putting some science into the public domain in a fun and interesting way,&quot; said Fricker. Management prize To Alessandro Pluchino and team at the University of Catania for demonstrating mathematically that companies work more efficiently if staff are promoted at random. Public health prize Awarded to Manuel Barbeito at the Industrial Health and Safety Office in Maryland for scientific studies that found microbes cling to beards, making more hirsute men a potential laboratory hazard. Chemistry prize For research in 2005 that overturned the long-held belief that oil and water do not mix, the prize was awarded to Eric Adams at MIT and others, including researchers at BP. Economics prize Awarded jointly to the executives and directors of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, AIG and Magnetar for &quot;creating and promoting new ways to invest money \u2013 ways that maximise financial gain and minimise financial risk for the world economy, or for a portion thereof.&quot;", "sentences": ["Commenting on the strong showing of UK scientists this year, Marc Abrahams, the master of ceremonies, told the Guardian: &quot;The nation may agonise over its place in the world, but in this one thing at least, Britannia rules.&quot; The Ig Nobel 2010 winners were: Medicine prize Psychologists Simon Rietveld and Ilja van Beest at the University of Amsterdam share the award for discovering that breathing difficulties brought on by asthma can be alleviated by repeated rollercoaster rides."], "title": "Ig Nobel awards go to slime mould and fruity bats", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/01/ig-nobel-awards-mould-bats", "tags": ["Ig Nobel prizes", "Science prizes", "Research", "Science", "Higher education", "US news", "UK news", "World news", "Education"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-01T12:20:00Z", "article": "My first reaction, on hearing that Michael Grandage was to leave the Donmar Warehouse, was one of sadness. He&apos;s done so much brilliant work there over the past nine years that I felt like asking, as Harold Pinter once asked Antonia Fraser in a rather different context, &quot;Must you go?&quot;. But although Grandage&apos;s departure, which won&apos;t take place for another year, is perfectly understandable in career terms, it also raises important questions about how directors can best make an impact. The irony is that it&apos;s Grandage&apos;s success in running a small Covent Garden venue that has made him an internationally sought-after figure. Both at the Donmar and at the Sheffield Crucible before that he has demolished the myth that European drama generally makes for dodgy box office. He has given us not just old favourites like Ibsen and Chekhov but also Schiller, Kleist, Strindberg and Pirandello. He has refreshed the British repertory by reviving The Chalk Garden, The Family Reunion and Osborne&apos;s The Hotel in Amsterdam. He has rightly honoured Stephen Sondheim and lesser-known works of American musical theatre. And he has taken the Donmar&apos;s work on tour, into the West End and around the globe. It&apos;s a staggering achievement. After 15 years running the Donmar and the Crucible \u2013 at one point even commuting between the two \u2013 Grandage is entitled to a change of direction: already he&apos;s booked to do Don Giovanni and Evita in New York and a follow-up to his Glyndebourne Billy Budd. But, while I understand Grandage&apos;s need to spread his wings, I hope he doesn&apos;t succumb for too long to the freelance life. The blunt truth is that directors only really make their mark by running buildings: think of Stanislavski in Moscow, Brecht in Berlin, Joan Littlewood at Stratford East, George Devine at the Royal Court. In running a building, directors make a definite artistic statement \u2013 they choose the plays, shape the policy, determine casting and get to promote the next generation. Without a permanent base, they often become flying dutchmen, traversing the globe without leaving an indelible mark. I can think of one (literally) towering exception to this rule: the late, great and immensely tall Tyrone Guthrie, who was endlessly peripatetic but who left behind a strong legacy in his passionate advocacy of the open stage. But, although the fashion today is to go freelance rather than opt for the stress of running a building, I think it is to the detriment of our theatre. I wish some of our immensely talented directors, people like Deborah Warner, Katie Mitchell, Phyllida Lloyd and Rufus Norris, had put down permanent roots. As Sam Mendes, Grandage&apos;s predecessor at the Donmar, once said, &quot;It&apos;s a world now of freelance directors, all working in the same few theatres, all discussing the same few plays.&quot; So while I wish Michael Grandage well in his new career, I hope he doesn&apos;t turn into a perennial globetrotter doing an opera here, a musical there and a play somewhere else. You can create good work that way. But, in the end, it&apos;s only by running a building that you can effect a pronounced change and realise theatre&apos;s potential \u2013 as well as your own.", "sentences": ["He has refreshed the British repertory by reviving The Chalk Garden, The Family Reunion and Osborne&apos;s The Hotel in Amsterdam."], "title": "Why I'm sorry to see Michael Grandage exit the Donmar Warehouse", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/oct/01/michael-grandage-exit-donmar-warehouse", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Donmar Warehouse", "Michael Grandage"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-01T14:31:03Z", "article": "Geert Wilders, the maverick Dutch anti-Islam campaigner, has emerged triumphant as the linchpin of a new rightwing minority government pledged to banning the burqa in the Netherlands, cracking down on immigration, strengthening the police and slashing public spending. Almost 16 weeks after a general election in which Wilders&apos; Freedom party almost tripled its vote but from which there was no clear winner, Liberals and Christian Democrats in the the Netherlands agreed a minority coalition pact supported in parliament in The Hague by Wilders&apos;s 24 seats. The deal could still come unstuck this weekend, with many Christian Democrats uneasy about forming a coalition a man who goes on trial on Monday in Amsterdam on charges of hate speech and inciting racism. The Christian Democrats are to hold a party congress tomorrow to bless or reject the coalition pact. Analysts expect a green light from the congress for what will be a fragile government, the most rightwing in the Netherlands in decades. An opinion poll yesterday showed majority Dutch support for the new government. The 46-page pact drawn up by the Liberal and Christian Democrat leaders puts Wilders in the strong position of exercising power without responsibility. His party will not be in the government but will support the coalition in parliament in return for crucial policy concessions. &quot;A new wind will blow in the Netherlands,&quot; he said. &quot;We have enormous influence \u2026 It&apos;s a beautiful day for the Netherlands.&quot; The leaders of the new government \u2013 Mark Rutte, head of the Liberal VVD party and the new prime minister, and Maxime Verhagen, leader of the Christian Democrats and current foreign minister \u2013 were more muted in marking the breakthrough. Between them the two parties muster a mere 52 seats in the 150-seat second chamber or lower house in The Hague. With Wilders&apos;s caucus voting with the government it has a wafer-thin majority at 76 seats. Wilders has won pledges to introduce legislation banning Islamic headgear, joining France, Belgium and Switzerland in a growing campaign across Europe to ban a veil that relatively few Muslim women wear. The coalition will aim to halve immigration, emulate Denmark in making it difficult for the spouses and children of immigrants to join them, and deport immigrants found guilty of crimes meriting sentences of 12 years. It is committed to slashing public spending by \u20ac18bn and will take a more Eurosceptic position towards Brussels, fighting for lower contributions to the EU budget. The inauguration of the new government next week looks likely to coincide with Wilders&apos;s trial, which opens in Amsterdam on Monday.

Prosecutors say Wilders, a key figure in a new coalition poised to take power in the Netherlands, provoked hatred against Muslims with remarks comparing Islam to nazism and by calling for a ban on the Qur&apos;an. Wilders argues he has a right to freedom of speech. If convicted, he faces up to a year in prison. The populist leader emerged last week as the linchpin in a new rightwing minority government, which he signed up to in return for a pledge to introduce a ban on the burqa and restrictions on immigration. The Christian Democrats agreed to the new coalition at a party congress on Saturday despite nervousness from members about forming a government with Wilders. The new minority government, which also includes the liberal VVD party, is expected to take power over the next two weeks. Wilders waved to supporters as he walked into an Amsterdam court at the start of the trial. He had been expected to embarrass his new coalition partners by using the trial as a platform for his anti-immigration rhetoric. But today his lawyer said he would stay silent throughout the proceedings. Bram Moszkowicz said: &quot;My client will, at my advice, exercise his right to silence today, tomorrow and the other days.&quot; But Wilders&apos;s Twitter account has not been silenced. &quot;The freedom of expression of at least 1.5 million people is standing trial together with me,&quot; he wrote, referring to his supporters in the national elections in June. Among the remarks that his opponents see as offensive, an editorial in the newspaper De Volkskrant stands out. &quot;I&apos;ve had enough of Islam in the Netherlands; let not one more Muslim immigrate,&quot; he wrote in the paper. &quot;I&apos;ve had enough of the Qur&apos;an in the Netherlands: Forbid that fascist book.&quot; The blond politician has called for a tax on clothing commonly worn by Muslims, such as headscarves, or &quot;head rags&quot; as he called them, because they &quot;pollute&quot; the Dutch landscape. He is also known for the 2008 short film Fitna, which offended Muslims around the world by juxtaposing Qur&apos;anic verses with images of terrorism. Convictions for discriminatory remarks are frequent in the Netherlands, but penalties rarely extend beyond a small fine. Prosecutors were initially reluctant to bring Wilders&apos;s case to court, saying his remarks appeared directed toward Islam as an ideology rather than intended to insult Muslims as a group. But they were eventually ordered to do so by a judge. Mohamed Rabbae, chairman of the moderate National Moroccan Council, said outside the court that he hoped judges would force Wilders to issue an apology for his past remarks. &quot;We are not for getting Wilders in prison.

The opening of the trial, expected to last a month in Amsterdam, followed a successful weekend for the maverick Dutch politician, with his influence over a new rightwing government confirmed and a campaign speech in Germany aimed at establishing a trans-national European movement against Muslim immigration. Wilders entered the dock amid heavy security and promptly affirmed his commitment to free speech, dismissing the charges against him while not entering a plea. He faces a hefty fine or a year in jail if found guilty on five charges of inciting hatred and discrimination against Muslims and insulting their religion for likening, as he routinely does, the Qur&apos;an to Adolf Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf and describing Islam as fascist. &quot;I am on trial, but on trial with me is the freedom of expression of many Dutch citizens,&quot; he told the Amsterdam district court. &quot;I can assure you, I will continue proclaiming it.&quot; Wilders then asserted his right to remain silent for the rest of the trial, prompting a comment from the presiding judge, Jan Moors, which was challenged by Wilders&apos;s lawyer. Moors said Wilders was known for making bold statements but avoiding discussions, adding: &quot;It appears you&apos;re doing so again.&quot; Bram Moszkowicz, representing Wilders, said the comment gave the appearance that Moors was biased and moved to have him substituted. The hearing was suspended while other judges consider the complaint. They are to rule tomorrow on Wilders&apos;s challenge, meaning that a new panel of three judges could be appointed, delaying the trial by several months. &quot;I thought I had a right to a fair trial, including the right to remain silent,&quot; said Wilders. &quot;It is scandalous that the judge passes comment on that. A fair trial is not possible with judges like that.&quot; At the weekend, rather than comparing Islam to fascism, Wilders argued that Islam was the new communism, paraphrasing Karl Marx to declare that Islam is now the spectre haunting Europe. Relishing a role as a martyr for liberty and free speech, he stated: &quot;I am standing trial \u2026 because of my opinions on Islam \u2026 and because the Dutch establishment \u2013 most of them non-Muslims \u2013 wants to silence me. I have been dragged to court because in my country freedom can no longer be fully enjoyed. &quot;In Europe the national state, and increasingly the EU, prescribes how citizens \u2013 including democratically elected politicians such as myself \u2013 should think and what we are allowed to say.&quot; The attempt to bring Wilders to trial was initially dismissed, but an appeals court ruled he should face charges after he wrote an opinion piece in a Dutch newspaper stating: &quot;I&apos;ve had enough of Islam in the Netherlands; let not one more Muslim immigrate \u2026 I&apos;ve had enough of the Qur&apos;an in the Netherlands. Forbid that fascist book.&quot; He makes such statements on a weekly basis and was banned from entering Britain for reasons of hate speech under the Brown government. The ban was later lifted. Two years ago, in an interview with the Guardian, he said: &quot;Islam is something we can&apos;t afford any more in the Netherlands. I want the fascist Qur&apos;an banned. We need to stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands. That means no more mosques, no more Islamic schools, no more imams.&quot; He added that Islam was &quot;the ideology of a retarded culture&quot;. &quot;Not all Muslims are terrorists, but almost all terrorists are Muslims,&quot; said Wilders. In Berlin at the weekend he argued that Islam was bent on dominating the west, deliberately flooding Europe with migrants. &quot;We must realise that Islam expands in two ways. Historically, Islam expanded either by military conquest or by using the weapon of hijra, immigration. Muhammad conquered Medina through immigration. Hijra is also what we are experiencing today. The Islamisation of Europe continues all the time. But the west has no strategy for dealing with the Islamic ideology, because our elites say that we must adapt to them rather than the other way round.&quot; While Wilders was delivering his call in Berlin for a new &quot;international freedom alliance&quot; targeting Muslim immigration in Europe, Dutch Christian Democrats held their noses and committed to a new minority government with the rightwing liberal VVD party, which will depend on the backing of Wilders&apos;s 24 seats in the Dutch parliament. In return for his support, Wilders has gained a binding agreement to ban the burqa, crack down on immigration, and pursue more Eurosceptic policies. &quot;This is an historic event for the Netherlands,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be able to rebuild our country, preserve our national identity and offer our children a better future.&quot; The new government is expected to be sworn in next month, led by Mark Rutte, the VVD leader, as prime minister.", "sentences": ["The opening of the trial, expected to last a month in Amsterdam, followed a successful weekend for the maverick Dutch politician, with his influence over a new rightwing government confirmed and a campaign speech in Germany aimed at establishing a trans-national European movement against Muslim immigration.", "&quot;I am on trial, but on trial with me is the freedom of expression of many Dutch citizens,&quot; he told the Amsterdam district court."], "title": "Geert Wilders trial halted as lawyer accuses judge of bias", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/04/geert-wilders-trial-halted", "tags": ["Netherlands", "The far right", "Islam", "European Union", "World news", "Geert Wilders", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-04T17:08:05Z", "article": "Tony Fox, who has died aged 82, ruled British sculling during the 1950s. He won the Diamond Sculls at Hen- ley in 1951 and 1953, the Wingfields for three consecutive years from 1951, and the Scullers&apos; Head in 1955 and 1956. He competed for Britain in the single scull five times and the double sculls once (1954), winning a silver medal in the European championships in 1951 and reaching the Olympic final in\u00a0Helsinki in 1952. Fox was born into a Guernsey medical family and learned to row in the Channel Islands. He took up the sport in earnest while studying medicine at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and then joined a remarkable group of London Rowing Club scullers when British rowing was in the doldrums. Having won the Head of the River race with the London club in 1950, Fox entered a new event the following year \u2013 the Norfolk Long Distance Sculls in Norwich. This was the first time trial for scullers, and Fox won it, followed by John Pinches, Archie Nisbet and Farn Carpmael, all from the London club. This group also included John Marsden, a teacher at Eton; Edward Sturges, who ran a gym attended by London oarsmen and the children of the royal family; and Doug Melvin, a young electrician from the John O&apos;Gaunt club in Lancaster. The club revolved around the coaching of Eric Phelps, who had taken the double scullers Jack Beresford and Dick Southwood to Olympic gold in 1936. The company was competitive, inspirational and congenial. The older men in the group were instrumental in reviving tideway rowing after the second world war and were a driving force behind initiatives for sculling, the discipline that uses two oars instead of one. Fox and Pinches inaugurated a club regatta in 1951, to which Oxbridge colleges were invited. It\u00a0was won by a scullers&apos; eight, formed by Fox and Carpmael, in a gale. Fox swept the board in 1953, winning the Vesta Dashes, the Diamonds, the Wingfields, the Metropolitan Regatta and the Norfolk Sculls. He represented Britain at the European championships in Copenhagen, where Rob van Mesdag, of the Netherlands, beat him in a heat. In 1954 Fox lost the Wingfields to Sid Rand of the RAF. In the double sculls at Henley, he and Marsden beat the fancied Russians Georgi Zhilin and Igor Emchuk in the first round but were defeated by Erich Schriever and Peter Stebler of\u00a0Switzerland, the eventual winners, in the semi-final. That year, the London men finished fourth in the European championships in Amsterdam. Fox wore the GB vest at two Olympic Games. In Helsinki he finished fourth. It was the best Olympic result for a British sculler since Beresford&apos;s gold in 1924. He finished ninth in Melbourne in 1956, part of a British team that the maverick oarsman Colin Porter describ- ed as the &quot;worst ever&quot;. After that, Fox completed his studies at St George&apos;s hospital, Tooting, south-west London, and joined his father, uncle and brother in their general practice on Guernsey before retiring to Cornwall in 1989. He married Paula Sweby, a nurse, in 1958, and is survived by her and four daughters.  \u2022 Thomas Anthony Fox, rower, born 27 July 1928, died 31 July 2010", "sentences": ["That year, the London men finished fourth in the European championships in Amsterdam."], "title": "Tony Fox obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/04/tony-fox-obituary", "tags": ["Rowing", "Channel Islands", "Doctors", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-05T13:04:47Z", "article": "Academics in Europe are seeking new partnerships with their counterparts in African to halt a brain drain that is stripping the poorest nations of their most valuable assets. The European University Association (representing 850 universities in 46 countries) last week presented a paper in Brussels that sets out a strategy for well-managed, long-term cooperation between European and African institutions. Africa is hampered by an acute shortage of academics (it trains only 2.3% of the world&apos;s researchers, less than the UK total) and at the same time many of the most highly qualified graduates are leaving. Abdeslam Marfouk, a researcher at Louvain University, Belgium, estimates that in more than 10 African countries over 40% of highly qualified personnel are working abroad. That proportion rises to 53% for Sierra Leone, 63% for the Gambia and 67% for Cape Verde. Half of the continent&apos;s researchers are living in Europe. While the global economic crisis may have slowed down this trend it remains a challenge for African universities alongside rising student enrollments thanks to improved access to secondary education, a lack of public investment, and competition with other countries to recruit the most gifted candidates. &quot;The pressure on universities and higher education providers is tremendous,&quot; the EUA paper maintains. &quot;Without proper laboratories or centres of excellence, and with salaries 10 or even 20 times lower than those on offer in developed countries it is hardly surprising so many graduates are leaving,&quot; said Abdoulaye Salifou, the deputy-head of the Association of French-speaking Universities. The EUA is seeking to build on models of cooperation that support the institutions that employ researchers in their home countries. One such programme has been run by Sweden&apos;s Uppsala University for almost 40 years. Its International Science Programme, focusing on chemistry, physics and maths, targets &quot;university departments rather than individuals,&quot; said Kay Svensson, the university&apos;s head of international relations. Between 2003 and 2008 the ISP ran in 12 countries, including 10 in sub-Saharan Africa, awarding 138 doctorates and 300 master&apos;s degrees with a less than 5% brain drain. The EUA initiative comes at a time when institutional cooperation is at a low ebb. &quot;European aid focuses mainly on the Millennium Goals. There is very little cooperation in education and most funds for research are directed towards developing excellence,&quot; says Kees Kouwenaar, the head of the Centre for International Cooperation at Amsterdam University, which is developing long-term partnerships with universities in the developing world. &quot;What does exist is not very visible, restricted in scope and subject to many constraints,&quot; adds Pascal Hoba at the Association of African Universities. Some observers are not convinced that the model favoured by the EUA will have impact. Jamil Salmi, a World Bank coordinator, thinks that &quot;only a few bilateral cooperation programmes include the setting up of resources \u2013 wages, laboratories \u2013 that enable researchers and academics from developing countries to return home on favourable terms.&quot; This article originally appeared in Le Monde", "sentences": ["There is very little cooperation in education and most funds for research are directed towards developing excellence,&quot; says Kees Kouwenaar, the head of the Centre for International Cooperation at Amsterdam University, which is developing long-term partnerships with universities in the developing world."], "title": "European universities seek to halt Africa's brain drain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/05/administration-eu", "tags": ["Education", "University administration", "European Union"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-05T21:05:01Z", "article": "A rightwing coalition is elected, and arts cuts come (while, inevitably, defence is protected).

Their plan was to extrapolate the success of their single Aidy&apos;s Girl Is a Computer, a woozy cyborg love story set\u00a0to clicking garage beats which had received widespread acclaim from critics and the dancefloor alike. &quot;Aidy&apos;s Girl came from us trying to make Apple sing to us,&quot; James Young said back then. &quot;When we first started the album, it was a concept that ran throughout, with interludes of two robots talking.&quot; Aiden Whalley, the other half of Darkstar, chipped in, with a\u00a0sigh: &quot;We&apos;re not that far away now \u2013 we&apos;ve just got to wrap it up in the next six weeks.&quot; They never did release that album of robotic 2-step. It was finished by the end of 2009, but it &quot;felt like the easy way out&quot;, Young says now \u2013 so they scrapped the entire thing, drafted in the definitely human vocalist James Buttery and started from scratch. The album that Darkstar have emerged with will surprise many. North\u00a0is not a dubstep album, a &quot;post-dubstep&quot; album or an album that cares for the chronology of that music at all. The duo spent months soul-searching, engaging in obsessively close listening to any music they could get their hands on, and the result is a devastating kind of melancholy synth-pop, with 1980s keyboard wires frayed by 21st-century ennui, and 21st-century technology. The striking thing about North is its cohesiveness. It&apos;s only 40 minutes long and it&apos;s got one very distinct sound: a very human sadness, filtered through washes of computerised distortion. &quot;It&apos;s a really grey-sounding synth, really organic and grainy,&quot; Young says of the &quot;synth pad&quot; they used on seven of North&apos;s 11 tracks. &quot;We call them &apos;swells&apos; \u2013 where synthesisers start quite minimal and then develop into a huge chord, before progressing. I felt like it wouldn&apos;t be right if we just carried on with that dayglo Hyperdub sound of a couple of\u00a0years ago,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean I love those songs, but it already feels like a lifetime away.&quot; Bands are sometimes reluctant to discuss the music they listened to while\u00a0making an album. Influences can\u00a0be misinterpreted, a record&apos;s originality can be called into question. Young has no such hang-ups \u2013 Darkstar did nothing but listen to music, day and\u00a0night for months, with microscopic focus. &quot;I&apos;ve been listening to so many things,&quot; he says wearily. &quot;A shitload of Burial, a shitload of Radiohead \u2026&quot; he starts, before embarking on a musical journey through sci-fi film scores, cutting-edge techno, the likes of the Human League, and above all the first album by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the\u00a0Dark. Many songs started with Whalley working them out on piano or guitar, before they were &quot;mapped out&quot; on computer in their flat above a shop in Hackney. They are now planning a touring live show, the final stage of their\u00a0blossoming from bedroom DJ duo into fully fledged band \u2013 though they are keen to keep it relatively simple. &quot;People can get carried away \u2013 we&apos;re not going for the Royal Albert Hall just yet.&quot; So will it just be men standing behind laptops? &quot;No, we&apos;re eliminating all sight of laptops. It&apos;s important for it to look live as well as be live. It&apos;ll be three synths, a drum machine, and a vocal processor.&quot; Like a 21st-century Kraftwerk? &quot;Sort of,&quot; he laughs, nervously.

French and Dutch &quot;defence leagues&quot; will join the EDL and several other anti-Islamic organisations on 30 October to coincide with the end of Wilders&apos;s trial for hate speech and inciting racism. About 2,000 EDL supporters are expected to demonstrate in Leicester tomorrow. Home secretary Theresa May banned marches in the city this week but the EDL said its protest would go ahead, raising fears of unrest. The EDL, formed in Luton last year, has become the most significant far-right street movement in the UK since the National Front. It claims to be a peaceful, non-racist organisation protesting against &quot;militant Islam&quot;. Many of its demonstrations have descended into violence and Islamophobic and racist chanting, attracting known football hooligans and far right extremists. At its most recent demonstration in Bradford, in August, 1,600 police officers tried to contain EDL supporters as bricks, bottles and smoke bombs were thrown. There were 13 arrests. Critics say the demonstration in Amsterdam is a sign of the EDL&apos;s growing influence among far right and anti-Islamic groups in Europe and the US, and part of its self-proclaimed &quot;international outreach work and networking&quot;. The EDL refused to answer the Guardian&apos;s questions today but its leader, who uses the pseudonym Tommy Robinson, wrote on the group&apos;s website that the Amsterdam demonstration would &quot;take the English Defence League global&quot;. &quot;The EDL has been in contact with our European brothers and sisters and we have decided that on Saturday 30th October the European defence league will be demonstrating in Amsterdam in support of Geert,&quot; Robinson wrote. &quot;We hope that all of you will be able to join us for this, what promises to be a landmark demonstration for the future of the defence leagues.&quot; The Amsterdam protest will see EDL supporters join other activists from countries including Germany, Belgium and Switzerland for the launch of what is being called the &quot;European Defence League&quot;. One group planning to attend is the French Defence League, or Ligue de Defense Fran\u00e7aise. It was formed in July and one of its co-founders confirmed it was modelled on the EDL. &quot;We were indeed inspired by their [EDL&apos;s] statutes and by the spirit of openness which enlivens them,&quot; a spokesman wrote in an email to the Guardian. Like the EDL, the French group denies it is racist or violent and says it aims to fight the &quot;threat&quot; Islam poses to France&apos;s values and customs. &quot;We who wish to keep our values and our liberties must unite and fight those who are willing to sell the nation and our country for a politician&apos;s sash,&quot; the spokesman said. The growth of the EDL and similar groups is of growing concern, says the Labour MEP for London, Claude Moraes, who chairs the all-party European parliament group on anti-racism. &quot;The EDL&apos;s racist and Islamophobic message is resonating across Europe as we can see from the formation of these groups,&quot; he said. &quot;This is particularly dangerous because they are using this virulent Islamophobia as an excuse to promote what is a dangerous agenda of hate and division.&quot; The European connections are part of a number of international links forged by the EDL in the past year. In August it emerged that the EDL had received endorsements from Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, opponents of a Muslim community centre being built near the site of the 9/11 attacks in New York. In one of her blogs Geller wrote: &quot;I share the EDL&apos;s goals ... We need to encourage rational, reasonable groups that oppose the Islamisation of the west and not leave it solely to fringe groups like the BNP.&quot; Last month Robinson and at least seven other EDL supporters flew to New York to attend a protest against the community centre near &quot;ground zero&quot;. In April EDL supporters attended a demonstration in support of Wilders in Berlin, and in June EDL delegates spoke at a &quot;counter-jihad&quot; conference organised by the International Civil Liberties Alliance in Zurich, where they gave a presentation entitled The Anatomy of an EDL Demo. Nick Lowles of anti-fascist organisation Searchlight said: &quot;The EDL is operating on two levels. There are the violent street demonstrations that have brought fear and division to towns and cities across the country, then there is the political wing of the organisation that is partly inspired by Christian fundamentalism and is making links and inspiring other groups in Europe and elsewhere.&quot;", "sentences": ["Far right groups modelled on the English Defence League have been set up across Europe and are planning to demonstrate in Amsterdam in support of the Dutch politician Geert Wilders.", "Critics say the demonstration in Amsterdam is a sign of the EDL&apos;s growing influence among far right and anti-Islamic groups in Europe and the US, and part of its self-proclaimed &quot;international outreach work and networking&quot;.", "The EDL refused to answer the Guardian&apos;s questions today but its leader, who uses the pseudonym Tommy Robinson, wrote on the group&apos;s website that the Amsterdam demonstration would &quot;take the English Defence League global&quot;.", "&quot;The EDL has been in contact with our European brothers and sisters and we have decided that on Saturday 30th October the European defence league will be demonstrating in Amsterdam in support of Geert,&quot; Robinson wrote.", "&quot;We hope that all of you will be able to join us for this, what promises to be a landmark demonstration for the future of the defence leagues.&quot; The Amsterdam protest will see EDL supporters join other activists from countries including Germany, Belgium and Switzerland for the launch of what is being called the &quot;European Defence League&quot;."], "title": "'Defence leagues' plan Amsterdam show of support for Geert Wilders", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/08/far-right-geert-wilders-protest", "tags": ["The far right", "English Defence League", "Netherlands", "Theresa May", "Politics", "Islam", "UK news", "World news", "Geert Wilders", "Europe", "Leicester"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-09T23:11:11Z", "article": "A few months ago, I sat in a magnificent Victorian lecture hall at University College London. It was once one of finest centres of intellectual inquiry in Europe, thanks to the efforts of its founder, the sternly anti-clerical philosopher Jeremy Bentham. It did not take me long to realise that fear of clerical fascism had led Bentham&apos;s trembling successors to abandon intellectual inquiry and basic intellectual standards along with it. I had come along with hundreds of others because, on Christmas Day 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a former UCL student, tried to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear and kill the 278 passengers and crew on Northwest Airlines&apos; flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. After such a narrow escape from mass murder, I thought that no one could deny that the universities needed to confront campus sectarianism. I reckoned without the limitless capacity for self-delusion of British academe. By the time UCL organised a public debate on the Abdulmutallab affair, reporters had established that the Nigerian student had lost himself in London&apos;s political netherworld, where the white far left meets the religious far right. As president of UCL Islamic Society, Abdulmutallab had presided over an &quot;antiterror week&quot;, which featured a promotional video of clips of violence, accompanied by hypnotic music. The film-maker had inserted footage of George Galloway saying the west believed Palestinian blood was cheaper than Israeli blood, and Amnesty International&apos;s latest pin-up, Moazzam Begg, alleging the Americans tortured him at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. &quot;When we sat down, they played a video that opened with shots of the Twin Towers after they&apos;d been hit, then moved on to images of mujahideen fighting, firing rockets in Afghanistan,&quot; one member of the audience told the New York Times. &quot;It was quite tense in the theatre, because I think lots of people were shocked by how extreme it was. It seemed to me like it was brainwashing, like they were trying to indoctrinate people.&quot; The London Times found that one cleric who had lectured the UCL Islamic Society was on record as saying of the Jews (inevitably): &quot;They&apos;re all the same. They&apos;ve monopolised everything: the Holocaust, God, money, interest, usury, the world economy, the media, political institutions\u2026 they monopolised tyranny and oppression as well.&quot; Alongside the racism came the concomitant sexism, homophobia and hatred of the western world. Channel 4, for instance, had caught another visiting imam on camera saying that the testimony of women was worth half that of a man. As for gays, he added: &quot;Do you practise homosexuality with men? Take that homosexual man and throw him off the mountain.&quot; You might have thought that in light of the above, academics would have wanted to protect their students. In particular, they should have wanted to protect Muslim students from going the way of Abdulmutallab. Instead of facing the problem squarely, they pretended it did not exist. Philippe Sands, a law professor who is always alleging that Tony Blair is a &quot;criminal&quot; for overthrowing Saddam Hussein&apos;s genocidal tyranny, appeared undisturbed by the existence of actual criminals among his university&apos;s alumni. He didn&apos;t want to spy or snoop on his students, he said, and did not see why anyone should want him to. Other speakers followed the example set by the UCL&apos;s provost, Malcolm Grant, and avoided discussing extremism in the university by the shabby trick of denouncing those who wanted to talk about it as &quot;Islamophobes&quot;. Given the precedents, the report from the official inquiry was predestined to be a lame effort. As expected, it concluded last week that university life played no part in the radicalisation of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. I could attack it by emphasising that UCL had chosen to put on the inquiry team Muhammad Abdul Bari, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain. Dr Bari is high up in the Jamaat-e-Islami-dominated East London Mosque. I can best describe the political character of the sect by telling you that the authorities in Dacca have indicted Jamaat&apos;s Bangladeshi leaders on charges that they aided and abetted the Pakistani army&apos;s crimes against humanity during the Bangladesh war of independence. Among the communalist imams who regularly rolled up to his mosque&apos;s rooms was one Saudi preacher who denounced Jews as pigs and Hindus as idol worshippers. Given that Bari was reluctant take up an invitation from Panorama to disassociate himself from the cleric, the inquiry&apos;s failure to be shocked by the company Abdulmutallab was keeping is not such a surprise. We are always told to condemn less and understand more. So, instead of criticising, I will empathise with the academics and try to appreciate why supposed liberals such as Sands will not confront anti-liberal movements when they are raging around their workplace. Ignorance is a part of it. I doubt one lecturer in 10 at UCL knows anything about the ideologies of Jamaat and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the assault on civil liberties may play their part, too. When lecturers who oppose all three meet students and preachers who promote hate-filled ideologies, they may not argue against them with the vigour with which they would argue against the white far right because at some level they think the hate is the fault of the west. I do not need to overcomplicate the question, however. Vice-chancellors and their staff do not engage in robust debate with extremists and try to show vulnerable students the moral and intellectual virtues of liberalism because they are frightened. By far the most revealing comment on Abdulmutallab did not come from Philippe Sands or Malcolm Grant but from UCL&apos;s professor of English, John Sutherland. He described how a friend of his, &quot;an eminent scientist&quot;, strolled in to take a look at an art exhibition organised by the UCL Islamic Society. &quot;&apos;Was he a believer?&apos; asked an obviously Muslim student. &apos;No,&apos; replied my friend, &apos;he didn&apos;t believe in any god, as it happened.&apos; &apos;Then,&apos; the young man confidently informed him, &apos;we shall have to execute you.&apos; My friend laughed it off after lodging a mild complaint. It could, of course, have been Abdulmutallab who made the threat.&quot; I am willing to bet that the laughter of the eminent scientist was of the tinny and nervous variety. I will wager further that equally tinny and nervous laughs are being heard on campuses across Britain.", "sentences": ["I had come along with hundreds of others because, on Christmas Day 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a former UCL student, tried to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear and kill the 278 passengers and crew on Northwest Airlines&apos; flight from Amsterdam to Detroit."], "title": "How radical Islam seduced the academics | Nick Cohen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/10/terrorism-islam-abdulmutallab-nick-cohen", "tags": ["UK security and counter-terrorism", "Islam", "World news", "Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-10T09:21:54Z", "article": "The self-proclaimed king of rock and soul, Solomon Burke, whose hits included Everybody Needs Somebody to Love, has died at Schiphol airport in Holland, aged 70. The beautiful voice, apparently effortless style, and pristine diction and timing of the preacher turned singer-songwriter were legendary in the business. He was described by Jerry Wexler, his producer at Atlantic Records, as &quot;the best soul singer of all time&quot;, and sold more than 17m records. Burke had just arrived on a flight from LA and was due to perform in Amsterdam on Tuesday with the Dutch rock band De Dijk, to launch their joint album, Hold On Tight, his second album of the year. He said earlier this year that he was clocking up a steady 130,000 annual frequent flyer air miles, performing across the States and in Europe \u2013 and in an interview with the Telegraph last month, he said: &quot;As long as I have breath to do it, I&apos;ll sing.&quot; After years when he was better known through cover versions of his songs than his own recordings, his career was reborn after his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and first Grammy award for the album, Don&apos;t Give Up On Me, the following year. Burke won new generations of fans at every appearance, including at Glastonbury two years ago. He was born in Philadelphia in 1940, began singing in a church choir as a child and preaching too \u2013 he was dubbed The Wonder Boy Preacher \u2013 and was recording by the age of 14. He once said: &quot;The only thing I don&apos;t know is what key I was crying in when I came into this world.&quot; His website boasted that he was born &quot;to the sound of horns and bass drums&quot;. From his earliest songs he created a distinctive style, mixing soul, rock and roll and country influences. His first album for Atlantic Records in 1962, when he was 22 (or possibly 24 \u2013 he was deliberately vague about his birthdate) was entitled Solomon Burke&apos;s Greatest Hits. The country style fooled the Ku Klux Klan into believing he was a white singer and he was once booked to entertain at a rally: not only did he escape unscathed, the audience repeatedly requested their favourite numbers. Later hits included the 1964 classic Everybody Needs Somebody to Love, covered by everyone from the Rolling Stones to the Blues Brothers, and Cry to Me, used in the film Dirty Dancing. He in turn performed songs by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Van Morrison and Elvis Costello, and duetted with Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Joss Stone. He was a giant of the soul world, literally and figuratively, with 21 children, 90 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren, and in later life became immensely heavy. In many of his last appearances, including Top of the Pops seven years ago, he sang magisterially seated in a throne-like armchair.", "sentences": ["Burke had just arrived on a flight from LA and was due to perform in Amsterdam on Tuesday with the Dutch rock band De Dijk, to launch their joint album, Hold On Tight, his second album of the year."], "title": "Solomon Burke dies in Amsterdam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/10/solomon-burke-dies-amsterdam", "tags": ["US news", "Music", "World news", "Solomon Burke", "Amsterdam Airport Schiphol"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-10T13:45:08Z", "article": "     Solomon Burke, who died this morning on a plane at Amsterdam&apos;s Schipol airport, lived his life in front of a microphone \u2013 a life that is mapped in scores of YouTube clips, from a 1962 recording of Cry to Me \u2013 to which many fans have added comments that they are crying for him \u2013 to an awesome Top of the Pops 2003 version of Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.

Burke, who has died aged 70, was indeed vast, and was confined to a wheelchair in his later years after his weight rose to an alarming 30 stone. But he was massively endowed with talent, too, and recordings such as Cry to Me and Everybody Needs Somebody to Love caused some (Wexler included) to consider him soul&apos;s greatest singer. He was born in Philadelphia, began singing in church when he was seven, and was powerfully influenced by the religious faith of his grandmother Eleanor, who belonged to an evangelical organisation called the United House of Prayer for All People. Burke wrote one of his earliest compositions, Christmas Presents From Heaven, after Eleanor died in 1954. His own early forays into the pulpit earned him the nickname &quot;The Wonder Boy Preacher&quot;, and he hosted his own gospel radio show, Solomon&apos;s Temple, in Philadelphia. Burke trained as an embalmer at his uncle&apos;s funeral parlour, but began pursuing a singing career in earnest while still in his teens. His earliest discs were released on New York&apos;s Apollo label. He aroused the interest of producers at Atlantic Records when they heard him sing Be Bop Grandma, a more rock-orientated piece than Burke&apos;s usual churchy fare, and he scored his first hit for the label with 1961&apos;s Just Out of Reach, this time essaying a country-flavoured direction. He began to find his authentic soul voice the following year with the release of Cry to Me (which would feature prominently in the movie Dirty Dancing many years later). It was the first in a series of powerful soul singles which included If You Need Me, Goodbye Baby and the gloriously uninhibited Everybody Needs Somebody to Love. The last of these was promptly covered by the Rolling Stones, then by Wilson Pickett, and in 1980 it was reborn again when it featured in the film The Blues Brothers. Burke became a regular touring attraction in the US, undertaking punishing cross-country schedules by bus. Performing in the segregated southern states was often fraught with danger, and on one occasion Burke and his band were aghast to find themselves performing to a Ku Klux Klan rally in Mississippi. When white restaurants refused to serve black musicians, the entrepreneurial Burke stepped into the breach and sold pork-chop sandwiches to his tour mates. In December 1964, Burke was in Los Angeles to visit his friend Sam Cooke on the day Cooke was murdered, which prompted him to write his biggest hit, Got to Get You Off My Mind. Huge in the US, Burke was also revered in Britain, where his influence rippled out to numerous other acts. &quot;I used to come over to Britain all the time,&quot; he recalled. &quot;Tom Jones and I used to hang out, and I played everywhere, including the Cavern in Liverpool.&quot; Finding himself eclipsed at Atlantic by the likes of Otis Redding and Sam &amp; Dave, he moved to Bell in 1968 and recorded the album Proud Mary (1969), which was boosted by the chart success of its title track, written by John Fogerty (and later a hit for Ike and Tina Turner). However, the tide was now running against Burke, who went through a number of labels during the 70s, including MGM, Dunhill and Chess, but could not recapture his previous magic. He diversified by scoring the movie Cool Breeze (1972) and recording the theme song for a US version of the TV sitcom Love Thy Neighbour, about a black family living next door to bigoted white people. Burke even attempted to exploit the fashion for sibling pop created by the Jackson Five and the Osmonds, dragooning seven of his own children into the Sons and Daughters of Solomon. They recorded an album for MGM, but it sank. It wasn&apos;t until the mid-80s that the wheel began to turn back in his favour, notably with his much-admired live album Soul Alive! (1985), where Burke supercharged his best-known songs with renewed inspiration. As Burke told it, he signed a record deal for Soul Alive! in a Chinese restaurant in Boston, after he had played the tapes to the music critic Peter Guralnick. Guralnick immediately called his contacts at Rounder Records, who hotfooted it to the restaurant and wrote Burke a cheque on the spot. The Burke revival continued with the superb A Change is Gonna Come (1986, hailed by one critic as &quot;one of the decade&apos;s great soul statements&quot;), and he continued to tour and record into the 90s. In 1987 he made his movie debut as Daddy Mention in the crime drama The Big Easy. The new century looked bright for Burke when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and the following year cut the acclaimed Don&apos;t Give Up On Me for the Fat Possum label. Featuring songs from Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Brian Wilson, Dan Penn and Van Morrison, the album was a resounding testimonial to Burke&apos;s life and achievements. &quot;I&apos;m honoured such important artists would have songs for me,&quot; he said. &quot;Very few artists at 62 get a chance to blaze the path of new glories and pass the pits of hell.&quot; The disc won a Grammy for best contemporary blues album. In 2004, Burke featured in the blues documentary Lightning in a Bottle, while his country-soul album Nashville (2006) featured guest appearances by Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Buddy Miller. In New York, in March 2007, Burke co-hosted the all-star celebration in memory of the Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, and in December that year performed at the private party after the Led Zeppelin reunion concert at the O2 Arena in London (Ertegun had signed Zeppelin to Atlantic in 1968). Burke&apos;s 2008 album, Like a Fire, was another homage from celebrity fans, and included songs by Eric Clapton, Keb&apos; Mo&apos; and Ben Harper. Burke, who now made a selling point of his immense girth by being carried on stage on a crimson throne, found himself a festival favourite, and made his debut at Glastonbury in June 2008. During 2009, Burke worked on a new album, Nothing&apos;s Impossible, with the revered producer Willie Mitchell at his Royal Studio in Memphis. It was released in April this year, though Mitchell had died in January. Burke followed it up with his Year of the Dream of Love tour in Europe this summer, which included his final British appearances. Amid all this, Burke found time to fulfil the role of archbishop in his own pentecostal church in Los Angeles, the House of God for All People, claiming: &quot;I&apos;m a church minister first, then an entertainer.&quot; He was pronounced dead at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, having flown in from Los Angeles. He had been due to perform with the Dutch band De Dijk, with whom he had recorded a new album, Hold On Tight, set for release this month. Burke was said to have fathered 21 children, the majority by his second wife, Dolores.

As an Israeli diplomat, he helped shape the institutions of government from pre-state days. As arguably the foremost international lawyer of the second half of the 20th century, he made contributions that were vast, influential and unmatched, mixing encyclopedic knowledge of the law with a profound understanding of practice. His inspiration, springing from his Jewish heritage, was the biblical instruction &quot;justice, justice shalt thou pursue&quot;. When accepting the first Hague prize for international law in 2004, he devoted his speech to the place of international law in the daily life of the average human being. He pointed out the extent to which ordinary lives are governed by international agreements, whether covering commerce, transport or the environment. He also focused on the rights of individuals in foreign countries and the rise of war crimes tribunals. The author of The Law and Practice of the International Court 1920-1996 (four volumes, 1997), Rosenne was the leading authority on the main judicial arm of the United Nations, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands. The role of the international court of justice (ICJ) is to settle legal disputes between states and to give advisory opinions to international bodies, so the political circumstances of the time militated against an Israeli citizen being elected one of its 15 judges. Nonetheless, those who were judges consulted him on difficult questions: he was the accepted authority on the court&apos;s working and jurisprudence. Rosenne was born in London with the surname of Rowson, his family having come from Tsarist Russia, and was educated at Cranleigh school, Surrey. When the second world war came, he served from 1940 to 1946 in the Royal Air Force, something of which he was very proud. He obtained an LLB from London University, qualifying in 1944, began working for the Jewish Agency, the pre-state authority, and moved to mandatory Palestine in 1947. He served on the committee helping to establish the institutions of the Jewish state, and when it came into being in 1948 he became the legal adviser to the foreign ministry, a post he held until 1967. His contributions were immense, from formulating the armistice agreements of 1949 to dealing with the fallout from the abduction of Adolf Eichmann from Argentina in 1960 to face trial in Israel. There were also state succession issues in the light of sometimes problematic relations with the former mandatory power, and inexorable and sensitive questions of war and peace, use of force and the freedom of the seas. All of this reflected the constant challenges faced by the new country. Thereafter, he served as an ambassador to the UN \u2013 deputy permanent representative in New York (1967-71) and permanent representative in Geneva (1971-74) \u2013 and in various international organisations. He was a delegate to innumerable international conferences, notably the sixth (legal) committee of the UN general assembly and in the UN international law commission. On 14 June 2010, he was appointed to the Turkel commission, the independent public commission established to examine the Gaza flotilla incident. Although not as physically robust as he once was, his intellect was as strong and as sharp as ever. His contribution is likely, once the report is completed, to have been significant. Rosenne was a truly formidable international lawyer and became an expert in, and great contributor to, for example, the law of treaties (which he termed the central element of all modern international law) and the law of the sea (in which he participated in all the major UN conferences). His list of publications on these subjects and the ICJ was immense. But for Rosenne, law and practice went together. He was always conscious of the importance of practical problems \u2013 the reasons why the law was evolving in a particular direction and the need to tackle questions that needed effective resolution. Supremely realistic in providing advice, he acted for and advised a number of states as counsel before the ICJ and other courts and tribunals. These included the US in the Elettronica Sicula case, about the expropriation by Italy of a US-owned Italian subsidiary, and the LaGrand case, about the execution in the US of a criminal who was a German citizen without his being given the required access to a consul; Serbia in the genocide case brought by Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1993; and Japan in the Southern Bluefin Tuna case. He also advised in a number of international arbitrations. A successful and thoughtful teacher, Rosenne was a visiting professor at numerous institutions around the world, including the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and the universities of Cambridge, Utrecht, Amsterdam and Virginia. He also gave the general course on international law at the Hague Academy of International Law. Rosenne drove to the heart of any matter, and was not diffident about putting forward his invariably illuminating insights. Generations of international lawyers, fortunately including myself over a number of years, benefited immensely from conversing with him. He became, in effect, the institutional memory of both the ICJ and of the UN, reminding diplomats of inconsistencies in the opinions they expressed over long periods. His happy marriage to Esther Schultz began in 1940. She survives him, as do their sons Jonathan and Daniel. \u2022 Shabtai Rosenne (Rowson), international lawyer and diplomat, born 24 November 1917; died 21 September 2010", "sentences": ["A successful and thoughtful teacher, Rosenne was a visiting professor at numerous institutions around the world, including the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and the universities of Cambridge, Utrecht, Amsterdam and Virginia."], "title": "Shabtai Rosenne obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/12/shabtai-rosenne-obituary", "tags": ["Israel", "Law", "United Nations", "Gaza flotilla", "Judaism"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-12T20:37:00Z", "article": "This is the second year of the Cleantech 100, first published in 2009 as a joint venture between the Guardian and the Cleantech Group as a true representation of global innovation and private company creation. This year, we asked: which 100 of today&apos;s private cleantech companies are the most likely to make the most significant market impact over the next 5-10 years? Hundreds of worldwide cleantech experts \u2013 including companies themselves \u2013 nominated the list, which also included so-called &quot;passive&quot; nominations and validations derived from analysing market data, taking votes of confidence in a company&apos;s ability to achieve high growth and high-market impact from market transactions such as investment rounds, and major customer and partnership announcements. To be on the list, companies must be independent, for-profit, cleantech companies that are not listed on any major stock exchange. In 2010, 4,616 nominations were received from 3,260 unique sources, resulting in a longlist of 3,138 companies. A weighting and filter system was then applied to collate the results, score each company, and reduce the candidates to a shortlist of 218 companies to present to an expert advisory panel in a second stage of the process. Here members of the expert panel combine their votes with scores carried through from the first stage. Ultimately firms are scored on three key criteria: their innovation, their market&apos;s size and growth, and the company&apos;s ability and resources to execute its technology. The result is this authoritative guide to the best 100 companies in cleantech. Clearly, there are many, fine companies who are not on the 2010 list. They may be waiting to be discovered, they may be out of favour this year for whatever reason or they may simply have just missed the cut. Only so many companies can be on the list.

In reality, it&apos;s often anything but. Most iconic gigs are such because they capture a moment and a mood, whether personal or societal: that first yes-it-really-really-really-could-happen bit of eye contact with the future Mr or Mrs You, or, as Mani said of Spike Island, the chance to &quot;get as many like minds in a field, get &apos;em off their tits, give &apos;em a bit of music and see what happens&quot;. Take perhaps the last defining concert in this country, Blur at Hyde Park in 2009. Technical niceties weren&apos;t really a consideration; most people would have been more interested in the colour of Damon Albarn&apos;s Fred Perry than the range of his falsetto. And do you really think Ian Brown&apos;s voice hit the heights at Spike Island? At Hyde Park, Albarn could have Mockneyed his way through Daisy Bell on loop for two hours in his 1995 Kappa mac and it would not have changed the fact that this was a Culturally Important Moment. When Blur reunited at Glastonbury earlier that summer, even this paper said that it was &quot;not just about the music&quot;. Sometimes, similarly, it&apos;s not just about the football. The comparison with gigs is far from exact, because with football you are talking about improv rather than established material, but it remains true that all live creative pursuits have the capacity to transcend the actual performance. In football, that is never truer than during a World Cup. There is no greater shared experience in sport and maybe even life: 31 days and 31 nights of cool beers and watercoolers; big screens and bigger ideas; sweepstakes, wallcharts and wall-to-wall football. In that context, it is possible to view the most notorious World Cup of all, Italia 90, a little differently. As a pure football tournament it left a fair bit to be desired - although, as we shall see, it might not be as bad as the received wisdom suggests - but as a dramatic spectacle it was immense: a freestyle opera so full of rich and lasting experiences as to make the clich\u00e9 of &quot;balmy, barmy nights&quot; almost irresistible. Not a great tournament, but certainly an epic one. Of all the World Cups in the last 40 years, only Italia 90 could have produced a book as soulful and momentous as Pete Davies&apos;s All Played Out. More than any other, Italia 90 felt like a World Cup. It captured a mood and, being the last World Cup before the Premier League and the Champions League, came at a time when anything was possible for football. We know now that the showers-that-be ballsed that up completely, but we didn&apos;t then. If Matthew Engel, one of the most original and brilliant sportswriters this country has produced, calls Italia 90 an &quot;unmitigated triumph&quot; for its wider impact - as he did in this paper the day before the final - that will do for us. So will the comment of MaidMarian in an article about great tournaments two years ago: &quot;Italia 90 was a great event just spoiled by the football.&quot; Much of that was to do with the venue. Italy. All football tournaments should be held in Italy, where calcio is consumed with a passion that makes religion seem almost frivolous by comparison. At the time Serie A was the best league in the world by a distance, and the game has rarely felt as important as it did around then. Italy ached with such fervour that the tournament could not fail to haemorrhage grandeur and gravitas. Two days after the final, Ian Ridley wrote in this paper that &quot;probably only in Italy could such an unsatisfying tournament overall - in footballing terms, that is - have been such a success&quot;. A model tournament     Diego Maradona. Photograph: Getty Images    On the field, Italia 90 had two major things going for it: an almost ceaseless supply of drama, and a number of individual and collective stories that went straight into World Cup folklore. We usually associate drama in football with the cheap theatre of goalfests, but Italia 90 infamously has the lowest goals-per-game average (2.21). There were another 28 goals scored that did not go in the book: it&apos;s fitting that such a dramatic tournament should have set a new record of four penalty shoot-outs - including, uniquely, two in the semi-finals - that has not been bettered (though there were also four in 2006). Some felt those semi-finals were cheapened by the manner in which they were decided, but both were immense matches regardless - probably the best pair of semi-finals in any World Cup, which counterbalances the appalling final. It&apos;s certainly the case that they were the first pair of semi-finals since 1966, and perhaps 1954, in which we did not, deep down, know the result of at least one of the matches in advance. The mighty nature of the semi-finals was a reflection of a tournament whose balance of shocks and heavyweight clashes was perfect. This is an absolutely vital element of a World Cup yet one that is rarely commented upon. If you have too many thrilling shocks early on you end up with predictable semi-finals (1994, 2002), and if you have none you end up without that Pak Doo-Ik moment (2006). Somewhere in between is Italia 90, which had an immaculate model: one largely unknown side to gallivant as far as the quarter-finals but no further (Cameroon), with another also providing a significant shock or two (Costa Rica); one or two dark horses to reach the quarter-finals (Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia), and everyone out the way so that four proper teams can face off in the semi-finals. Italia 90 was able to achieve this despite the elimination of Brazil and Holland in the second round, another development that lends considerable weight to suggestions that this was one of the most dramatic World Cups. As a loose rule of thumb, the quarter-finals is par for the top tier of international sides: if you go out at that stage it might still be failure, and the coach can be quietly confident there will be a P45 waiting for him when he gets home, but it is not humiliation. Yet if you go out before that, you will be remembered forever.     Rudi Voller and Frank Rijkaard. Photograph: PA    That meant the two games on Sunday 24 June were imbued with an impossible tension. Bad enough that one of Brazil and Argentina were going out, and one of Holland and West Germany, but to go out to their most hated rivals was utterly unthinkable. Brazil lost to Argentina in perhaps the greatest smash-and-grab of all - worse still, they were vaccinated by Diego Maradona, who produced one of the great assists to win the match - while Holland were thrashed 2-1 by West Germany and humiliated further when Frank Rijkaard mistook Rudi Voller&apos;s perm for an old tissue. Brazil&apos;s exit is still their earliest since 1966 - a harsh legacy for a brutally underrated team who were disparaged for their sacrilegious sweeper system but who were completely dominant in all four of their matches - while Holland, who played with the vigour of men emerging from an Amsterdam caf\u00e9 in the small hours, are rightly judged by the peerless historian Cris Freddi as &quot;the most disappointing team in any finals tournament&quot;. They did, at least, contribute to one of the greatest days in any World Cup. Le notti magiche di Toto Schillaci To continue the dramatic theme, we had the most shocking start to any World Cup when Cameroon beat the holders Argentina, and a few seismic late goals: Freddy Rincon to put Colombia through from Group D, Daniel Fonseca to put Uruguay through from Group E - and shatter the hopes of Scotland and Austria in two other groups - and, of course, David Platt&apos;s life-changing volley against Belgium. There was even, for the only time in the World Cup, the drawing of lots to decide which of Holland and Ireland would be beaten by West Germany in the second game. The redemption of West Germany, who had lost the previous two finals, was one of many fantastic tales, both collective and individual, that will keep us warm as the years close in. Most nations would have gone a big rubbery one at the prospect of deliverance from the pain of Espana 82 and Mexico 86, but Germany just went about their business with the minimum of fuss. This side is occasionally, unfathomably criticised, yet they were as good a power team as there has ever been, with scarcely a weakness and at least six world-class players in Andreas Brehme, Jurgen Kohler, the utterly underrated Guido Buchwald, Lothar Matth\u00e4us, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann and Rudi V\u00f6ller. The quality of the champion is a vital part of a World Cup&apos;s legacy, and in that regard Italia 90 is in credit: the Germans were the best between 1970 and 2010.     Paul Gascoigne. Photograph: Empics    England&apos;s journey was equally compelling, from &apos;No Football Please, We&apos;re English&apos; (the headline in Gazzetta dello Sport after the appalling first match against Ireland) to a performance of genuine continental sophistication in that semi-final against West Germany, Their progress may have been a little hamfooted - a three-goal win would not have flattered Cameroon in the quarter-final, and Belgium had slightly the better of an excellent second-round game - but they were also ingenuous, likeable and, by using a sweeper system that seemed astonishingly sophisticated in a country that taught 4-4-2 on the curriculum, thrillingly European. They were also very worthy winners of the Fifa Fair Play Award, and the goodwill of that match against West Germany was truly remarkable for a game of such importance. Goodwill flowed towards Ireland as they gave it a lash and sneaked into the quarter-finals in their first-ever World Cup. There was Argentina&apos;s warped and guiltily hilarious defence of their title, which they surrendered as compliantly as Tony Montana did his life; say what you like about them, but the World Cup will never have better pantomime villains. There was the eye-watering thuggery and eye-moistening brilliance of Cameroon, the first African side to reach the quarter-finals. And then there were the hosts. Other nations have wanted to win a World Cup just as much as Italy did in 1990, but none have needed to win it quite as much. When they went out to Argentina in the semis, you could almost feel the wailing. Italy&apos;s star was Toto Schillaci, compelling evidence that beauty can be in the eyes of the beholdee. Italy will always talk about the &quot;Notto Magiche di Toto Schillaci&quot;. He won the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot but he was not the only man whose life was defined by four weeks in the summer of 1990: Paul Gascoigne came from leftfield to inspire England (it&apos;s easy to forget that he wasn&apos;t even certain of a place in the squad until an astonishing performance against the Czechs in late April), Roger Milla came out of of retirement to drive Cameroon to the last eight with four goals and proof that some old men can dance; and Sergio Goycoechea came from the shadows to save the penalties that took Argentina to the final. Proustian rush Stories and drama are, you might say, all well and good, but the football was negative and unwatchable and blah blah blah . Well. The main evidence used to damn Italia 90 is that average of 2.21 goals per game, yet there is an uncomfortable contradiction here. At the time, Serie A was rightly seen as superior - yet that had an extremely similar ratio (2.24 in 1989-90; 2.29 in 1990-91). It is dangerous to confuse negativity with defensive excellence, and there was plenty of the latter on offer. Ireland and Egypt were negative, Cameroon were filthy and Argentina were both, but the rest were fairly blameless. The technical quality was very high, too. And, though Italia 90 is seen as an affront to the purists, surely the 1-1 draw between West Germany and England in the semi-final of that tournament is preferable to the basketball farce between Italy and West Germany at the same stage of the 1970 World Cup, when six goals were scored in the final 31 minutes because everyone had shot their bolt in the heat? If you did a Family Fortunes-style survey and asked 100 people to name the worst World Cup, Italia 90 would surely come top. Yet the reality is simply not that clear cut: purely in terms of entertaining football, there are strong arguments that 1938, 1962, 2002, 2006 and maybe 2010 were inferior. Italia 90&apos;s problem was not that it was the worst, but that it was the first: the first low-scoring World Cup of the colour television era (and the first in which one team failed to score in the final, which seems incredible now), and thus forever to be despised. It is seen as the dark age of football, before the abolition of the backpass and the assault from behind, but in reality it was simply the case that the balance between attack and defence was slightly out of whack. The dark age is now, ever since the Millennium Bug of 4-2-3-1 kicked in. The fact that Italias 90&apos;s appeal extended beyond the action is reflected by the staggeringly high quality of its peripherals. The Proustian rush of the BBC&apos;s titles will, of course, never be bettered in sport, but that is not all. The 21st-century stadia, all built or heavily redeveloped for the tournament, were remarkable; and the kits were the best of any World Cup. Italia 90 came after the Toffs era of classy but plain kits, and just before design tools and their design tools got to work (and also just before adidas unfathomably marginalised the trefoil). Nor was there a corporate overload: Brazil&apos;s kit, an elegantly faded colour rather than the brilliant yellow we know now, was made by Topper. Topper. How cool is that? And how cool were the TV graphics, part of RAI&apos;s superb coverage, which included umpteen fresh and new camera angles. We even had Orbis&apos;s World Cup 90, a one-off that was as good as sticker albums got. This stuff may seem piffling, but it all added to the feel of a Proper World Cup. &apos;Don&apos;t do it son!&apos;     Italia 90: Rene Higuita and Roger Milla. Photograph: Eric Renard/Corbis    There was plenty more to take from the tournament. As we did a similar thing during an On Second Thoughts on USA 94, here&apos;s a list of other things to remember fondly from Italia 90. Klinsmann producing an individual performance for the ages against Holland; the hideous cruelty, on an individual level, of the already besieged Jim Leighton&apos;s crucial mistake against Brazil; the hideous cruelty, on a collective level, of Taffarel&apos;s miraculous injury-time save from Mo Johnston in the same game; the two-footed perfection of West Germany&apos;s left wing-back Brehme, who scored two penalties with his right foot having scored one with his left at Mexico 86, and who was such an attacking threat that the Holland right-winger Johnny Van&apos;t Schip&apos;s principal job was to mark him (Brehme scored the decisive goal with a delicious curler); the mysterious and apparently impenetrable Italian defence, which went a World Cup record 517 minutes before conceding; Maradona&apos;s crafty politicking before the semi-final and then his staggeringly cocky penalty at the end of the same game, which left most of Italy foaming with impotent rage; Barry Davies giving Carlos Valderrama a rollocking a split-second before Valderrama&apos;s regal reverse pass allowed Rincon to score and put Colombia into the last 16; the peerless Davies holding the name &quot;CANIGGIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot; for an age; Gazza making a prat of Mark Goodier; Milla making a prat of Rene Higuita; Massing. Gary Lineker&apos;s nervelessness from the spot against Cameroon, particularly as, in the first instance, he was taking England&apos;s first penalty for four years; the outside of Enzo Scifo&apos;s right foot; John Motson shrieking &quot;You can&apos;t have this in the final&quot; after Gustavo Dezotti&apos;s assault on J\u00fcrgen Kohler, as if it would have been a hoot in the semis; the regal smoothness of Careca&apos;s two goals against Sweden; the majestic simplicity of Ruud Gullit&apos;s goal against Ireland; Murdo MacLeod being sparked out by a Branco free-kick to such an extent that he tried to head a cross into his own net a few moments later and prepared to wheel away before it drifted wide of the top corner; Belgium&apos;s supreme performance with 10 men against Uruguay; Tony Cascarino&apos;s penalty against Romania when, having walked from the halfway line while getting all sorts of agita from the voice inside his head (&quot;You look like a man about to meet a firing squad\u2026 The whole world is watching. Frightening, isn&apos;t it? \u2026 You&apos;d better assure your mother. &apos;Don&apos;t do it son!&apos; she&apos;s screaming. &apos;What happens if you miss?&apos;&quot;), he kicked the ground so hard that he could have broken his foot, but still scored; Dragan Stojkovic&apos;s performance against Spain, and particularly his dummy for the first goal; Michel&apos;s hat-trick against South Korea; two silk-smooth English Deses, Lynam and Walker; one of them having a brief but total shocker against Cameroon; a phalanx of Czech midfielders whose left feet were not much educated as doctoral; hearing the Stone Roses on the BBC; Bobby Robson admitting that &quot;4-4-2 saved us&quot; after the Cameroon game, which in the climate of the time was akin to saying you preferred Primark underwear to Ann Summers&apos;; the otherwise unfairly maligned Howard Wilkinson telling the England team that &quot;they had a bye, basically&quot; against Cameroon, who then gave them a proper chasing; and Matth\u00e4us&apos;s chilling second goal against Yugoslavia, neck and neck with Roberto Baggio&apos;s meandering run as the best of the tournament; There were, we&apos;re sure you&apos;ll disagree, some pretty memorable on-field moments.

The mayors of Amsterdam, Zagreb, Paris and Mexico City announced this week that they intend to cut their cities&apos; carbon emissions by 10% in the next year. The 10:10 campaign, supported by the Guardian, is championed in 40 countries with 3,000 businesses and 100,000 individuals signing up, including celebrities Sienna Miller and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall This is the first time that capital cities have signed up, said campaigners. Speaking from the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris mayor, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, said: &quot;10:10 is an invitation to act concretely and determinedly. I am very happy about this partnership.&quot; Social housing complexes will be renovated, head offices of the 20 arrondissements given energy-saving refurbishments and the city&apos;s fleet of public vehicles will be &quot;rationalised&quot; in an attempt to cut carbon emissions. Plans have also been unveiled for geothermal wells in the north-east of the city which will power 12,000 homes. The formal agreement from Paris came just before a separate day of international mass participation climate action on 10/10/10, when 7,000 events took place around the world. Twenty four hours later, Paris was joined by the largest city in the Americas, as Mexico City signed the pledge. Its carbon-cutting programme includes the opening of a new line of its Metrobus system (saving 35,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide), replacing all the city&apos;s taxis (saving 100,000 tonnes of CO2), building more sustainable homes and large-scale water-saving methane-capture programmes. &quot;It&apos;s about the survival of our civilisation,&quot; said mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, as he appealed to the city&apos;s 21.2 million residents to use less electricity and water and make more journeys by bicycle and public transport. The city&apos;s average temperature had risen by 3C in the previous century, he said. Meanwhile, 1 million people tuned in to watch Dutch celebrities quizzed on their environmental knowledge on a 10:10-themed television show. It followed Amsterdam&apos;s decision to join the campaign, where viewers were given the number of a hotline to sign up to 10:10 over the telephone. Staff in public buildings in the city are already using energy monitors, lights are being turned off when not in use, and thermostats have been turned down. Zagreb would also soon be joining the movement, confirmed the mayor, Milan Bandi\u0107, speaking in the Croatian capital on Sunday. 10:10 now has hubs in 45 countries worldwide, and in May, the prime minister, David Cameron committed the UK government estate to cutting its emissions by 10%.

Sin Decir is one of our favorite tracks from their latest release, Al Final, El Parque, an amazing album dominated by hypnotic chamber music sounds and fine string arrangements, along with more conventional synthesizers and electric guitars. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Bleeding Knees Club - Bad Guys       Bleeding Knees Club only formed in March, but have already toured Australia&apos;s east coast a bunch of times, recorded an EP and secured a label and distribution. Admittedly, BKC trade in a certain brand of music that doesn&apos;t require/intentionally avoids precision, planning and cleanliness. Even though you can imagine these guys bashing out an EP within the amount of time it takes some bands to soundcheck, it still suggests potential radness in the near future. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoBaiana System - Jah Jah Revolta       Baiana System is a new group from Bahia, a Brazilian state famous for its ax\u00e9 music - a style marked by lyrics full of ambiguous sexual overtones and simple dance rhythms. Their trump card is to raise the Bahian guitar to a new level, combining a typically Brazilian musical manifestation to elements of dub, contemporary electronic, rock and other genres, as observed in Jah Jah Revolta. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicThe Wilderness Of Manitoba - Sea Song       To fully appreciate The Wilderness Of Manitoba, you need to be in a calm, relaxed mood. So sit back. Clear your mind. Forget your worries for a moment. Ignore the phone, the internet, your pets, everything. Now start Sea Song and just let the gorgeous vocal harmonies and beautiful folky melodies wash over you. Wasn&apos;t that pleasant? Now go and get a copy of their first full-length, When You Left The Fire, because it has 12 more tracks just like that one. CHILE      Super 45Dadal\u00fa - Gracias       Dadal\u00fa&apos;s (Daniela Sald\u00edas) first steps in music were linked to the punk and hardcore scene. Later, she refined her ideas, got closer to hip-hop and took part in Colectivo Et\u00e9reo, Iris and Julia Rose. However, her solo work is strongly influenced by Phil Spector and Mark Ronson&apos;s orchestrated pop. Gracias, the first single from her forthcoming debut album Per\u00edodo, to be released by netlabels Ponk and Michita Rex, is the best proof that differences between punk, rap and pop are dwindling. CHINA       WooozySun Ye - Strange Planet       With projects in rock, punk and post-rock bands under his belt, Shanghai-based Sun Ye is nowhere near finished with whatever he has planned for his music - fluid, dreamlike melodies that tinkle and slide smoothly in and out of your ears. His unpredictable yet continually enthralling tunes have landed him support slots for both \u00d3lafur Arnalds and \u00c9milie Simon this year. His latest album, Trash Can, was released on the Miniless label. DENMARK       All ScandinavianThe Malpractice - Boss Stallion       October 25 will see the release of The Malpractice aka Johannes Gammelby&apos;s (I Am Bones, Beta Satan) solo debut Tectonics on Crunchy Frog, an 11-song strong album of alternative rock aiming at minds, (pop) hearts and feet. Here&apos;s the great Boss Stallion and if you dig it, make sure to check out the other album single Oh, The Irony streaming on MySpace. ENGLAND       The Guardian Music BlogThe Visitors - Hello Moon       Visitors frontman Karl Walsh used to head Factory Records folkies To Hell With Burgundy. The official bio says he has spent the time since the label&apos;s demise &quot;writing novels in the French countryside&quot;. Hello Moon says different. It speaks of years spent orbiting Bowie&apos;s legacy, drifting on the dark side of the Duke before taking a quantum leap into Wayne Coyne&apos;s shoes. More years spent Waitin&apos; For A Superman to spin earth backwards, to rewind to a time when we were still wide-eyed about space, glam rock and the power of a good, solid tune. ESTONIA       PopopTallinn Daggers - Island Phi Ley       Tallinn Daggers is an electronic pop duo from Tallinn that consists of Ardo Kivi and Joosep Volk. Since they united in 2009 they have released one digital EP, The Last Escape, and a handful of singles. They are known for their very energetic live shows and listener-friendly habit of giving away their music. FINLAND       GlueBig Wave Riders - Big Sound       Formed just before the summer, Big Wave Riders aim to be the next big thing in Finnish indie music. While they ready their debut EP, we can enjoy a taste of their first recordings with Big Sound&apos;s fast tropical beat and early 80s garage vibe. FRANCE       ZikNationHutchinson - Oh My Lover       Hutchinson is an electro-rock duo featuring Olivier Deniaud and Eric Tanguy, who make their music in the very creative city of Nantes. It&apos;s a hobby that doesn&apos;t stop them being rather good. You might have had a hard time guessing they were French. GERMANY       BlogparteiMIT - Pudong       German band of the moment is definitely MIT. With the advanced electronica of their second album Nanonotes, which was produced by Simian Mobile Disco member Jas Shaw, and especially with the video to Pudong, they have hit the spot in Germany&apos;s blogosphere. MIT may rightly be seen as a concept for taking Kraftwerk&apos;s legacy into the future. GREECE       Mouxlalouloudago.quiet - Everyone I Ever Met       go.quiet is the project of Christina Kassesian and housework. Everyone I Ever Met, the primary result of their collaboration, is soothing, compelling, heartbreaking, mysterious and gloomy. An enticing dip into melancholy that urges you to lean closer to the speakers to fully feel everything that is being played and sung. There&apos;s a beauty in the melody that conjures up a cinematic romanticism with the soft-spoken, whispered, gentle vocals to amplify this emotion. ICELAND       I Love Icelandic MusicCaptain Fufanu - Lava       Captain Fufanu are two youngsters and probably the brightest hope of the Icelandic electronic music scene. Hrafnkell Fl\u00f3ki Einarsson and Gu\u00f0laugur Halld\u00f3r Einarsson (sons of a different Einar, so not brothers) aka Kaktus and Gulli played their first gig at the age of 16 in 2008. The duo mix dub, techno, house and experimental electronica. The song Lava is unreleased. INDIA       IndiecisionKaav - Daya       Kaav is an alt-prog trio from Kochi. The band&apos;s expansive, instrumental soundscapes are based in an understanding of local Carnatic music, with the trappings of a more alternative Oceansize - think a dosa-eating Explosions In The Sky. Daya is taken from a recently-released eponymous three-track EP, which we highly recommend you download  here for free. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarGhaust - Sleep And Release       With only two members, Ghaust, who hail from Jakarta, build an instrumental trip crossing through different genres, where post-rock/shoegaze influences and crushing sludge/doom tempo collide with hardcore punk and heavy rock. Sleep And Release explores a cumulative void, expressing emotions that can only be conveyed with music. IRELAND       Nialler9Sacred Animals - Chosen Seed       Sacred Animals is a solo project of Darragh Nolan. His debut release is the lush four-track EP Welcome Home and serves as a perfect introduction to his fanciful and feral, wild like nature ballads. The music recalls Radiohead, Bon Iver and Guillemots without ever really sounding too much like any of them. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelACE And The Deck - Mr. Grieves (Pixies cover)       ACE And The Deck take the Pixies&apos; Mr. Grieves, stir it up with reggae, shake it up with psychobilly, throw in some surf punk and cut it with a generous helping of arak. Their debut album is a veritable musical arsenal taking the best from all genres, and hits the market on December 13. ITALY       PolaroidHavah - The Competition Dies       Michele Camorani was a member of La Quiete, one of the most important screamo hardcore bands of the past decade. This is his new solo project, and the sound is very different. Imagine a Blank Dogs song locked up in a dark basement all alone for 20 years - that&apos;s how obscure and cursed Havah&apos;s music can be. Sometimes, suddenly, pop melodies come to the surface, but soon they&apos;re buried into the noise once again. It&apos;s definitely worth downloading Havah&apos;s first album for free via his MySpace. JAPAN       JPOP LoverHotel Mexico - Its Twinkle       Hotel Mexico are not from Mexico, but are a glo-fi and chill electro band hailing from Kyoto. Its Twinkle is taken from the recently released His Jewelled Letter Box EP and is full of radiant guitar melodies, ambient bells, airy synths and more reverb than any respectable song has the right to use. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaHello Seahorse! - Un A\u00f1o Quebrado       Once a twee-pop band, Mexico City&apos;s Hello Seahorse! morphed into a gloomy sounding beast on their third album, Bestia. Now they&apos;ve delved deeper into their tormented souls and came out with their fourth album in four years, Lejos. No Tan Lejos. Produced by the legendary Money Mark in Los Angeles and by local wizard Yamil Rezc, the 11 songs lay a rich forest of synths where Lo Blondo&apos;s banshee-like voice soars with operatic tropes. Say &quot;Hola!&quot; to this seamonster. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamSpace Siren - This Radar       Amsterdam quartet Space Siren have strong indie-rock pedigree behind them. Featuring members who previously made up the noisy, melancholic band Seesaw, who released a number of great albums on the reliable Transformed Dreams label early in the 2000s, Space Siren carry the torch on wonderfully. Thick layers of guitar distortion hark back to an era when Sonic Youth ruled the independent underground. The percussion drives every song. And, somehow, amidst the haze of overdrive, there&apos;s room for the strong, moody vocals of Gwendolien. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatSecret Knives - The Northwest States       Secret Knives is the solo bedroom recording project of Ash Smith, who also plays in Over The Atlantic. The Northwest States begins with a pop melody and lyrics about lost love over programmed beats and a nice rumbling bass line. Then the layers of guitar start to build until the song soars into a shimmering shoegaze crescendo. The song is from Secret Knives&apos; new album Affection, available for free download from here. NORWAY       EardrumsDunderhonning - St\u00f8v       Dunderhonning is a young quartet from Harstad in the north of Norway. They have just released their debut full-length album on Guano Recordings, Sakte Ut Av Fokus, where they play warm, poetic, dreamy and powerful pop/rock. They sing in their native language and dialect, which suits the songs and their expression well. People who have heard and loved the music of Kr\u00e5kes\u00f8lv may find these two close to each other in style. Their album is high on my list of the best Norwegian albums this year. Highly recommended. PERU       SoTBLongPlayer - Chica A Go-Go       It&apos;s time to welcome the debut of LongPlayer, a powerful quartet that formed in Lima in 2009 and is led by experienced Pipe Villar\u00e1n. Their first single, Chica A Go-Go, carries a pleasant melancholy and is full of crunchy guitars and surprise trumpet appearances. Their self-titled debut album, which comes out on October 21, promises to deliver a classic rock lesson and will undoubtedly be one of the best of the year. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Noiserv - 06:00am - Mr. Carousel       Since his first presence in MAP a year ago, Noiserv (aka David Santos) has played internationally, recently in Scotland and Slovenia, and has shared the stage with Bill Callahan, Camera Obscura, Damon &amp; Naomi, Perry Blake and The Swell among others. In July, he released a new EP, A Day In The Day Of The Days - a musical diary of one fictional day. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseMinus - Hasdeu       Minus is Daniel Stanciu, a young man from Bucharest who combines massive mountains of bass with glitchy, twinkling Game Boy melodies and a healthy dose of synth funk. The EP from which Hasdeu was taken can be listen to and downloaded on Minus&apos; page at Local Records. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopBear Bones - Oil &amp; Lacquer       Islay-born singer Ben Harrison&apos;s thick brogue and some inspired bursts of accordion make eight-strong Bear Bones an unmistakably Scottish proposition and Oil &amp; Lacquer a heavenly way to spend four minutes. Fans of Belle &amp; Sebastian won&apos;t be disappointed. Since it&apos;s exactly two years since the Music Alliance Pact was launched, as a bonus you can also download a free anniversary compilation here which contains mostly exclusive and rare tracks contributed by 23 previous MAP artists from Scotland. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Typewriter - Cry So Well (The Suntan Mix)       Ten years and three line-up changes later, Typewriter have finally released their labor of love, Indian Head Massage. Their debut album is chock full of well-crafted power-pop tunes and guitar riffs, whimsical lyrics and one of the most dynamic rhythm sections in the country. As a live four-piece, Typewriter shed all inhibitions to deliver a spine-tingling dose of forgotten melodies to awaken the senses, but on record they take the time to flesh out the minute details that make each song stand out. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Goldfish - Fort Knox       Hailing from Cape Town, Goldfish is made up of Dominic Peters and David Poole, who are one of the hottest jazz/electro duos this side of the equator. A mix of &quot;funky riffs, acid jazz melodies and instantly catchy dance floor songs&quot; is what they are about and Fort Knox is the epitome of their unique sound. This duo have made their mark in the dance scene and world domination is in sight. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKGo-yo - The Blue Devil       Singer-songwriter Go-yo writes songs about cynical self-consolation. After debuting with a self-titled single offering lo-fi piano pieces last year, he has begun a venture into the realm of trip-hop and electronica with the recent release of first full-length album I Came Alone. While songs such as Let The Little Bird Fly maintains Go-yo&apos;s original, melancholic piano sound, The Blue Devil creates an atmosphere similar to that built by Air&apos;s score for The Virgin Suicides. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseMother Of The Forest - Br\u00e4nna Broar       This suddenly prolific artist has just released another EP, this time with guests such as Mattias Alkberg and Magnus Ekelund. Vocals are processed and distant in the mix, adding to both the spookiness of the tracks and the prominence of the staccato electronic bursts that punctuate and enliven each song. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Legendary Lightness - Airplane       The Legendary Lightness is the side-project of the two drummers from Swiss indie outfits Schnitzer and Gabardine. The singer-songwriter duo hail from Zurich and has just released a splendid single called Airplane. It&apos;s an airy piece of music, providing you with the musical layer for daydreaming. Airplane will be featured on an EP which will be sold at concerts and is limited to 100 copies. Their debut album is scheduled for release this winter. UNITED STATES       I Guess I&apos;m FloatingTwin Shadow - Yellow Balloon       The description for this artist should be short and sweet: spin the track, buy the album and become very happy. Twin Shadow, the one-man project of Brooklynite George Lewis Jr, is full of smooth synths, dark vocals and compositions operating under the influence of 1980s music but not cheaply ripping it off like loads of chillwave acts. Simplicity and melody merge seamlessly in Yellow Balloon, like many of the tracks on debut LP Forget. VENEZUELA       BarquisimentoLos Mentas - El Kiosko       Los Mentas is a rockabilly band with a new and nostalgic proposal and a strong dose of punk-rock flavor. Other influences like tango and swing can also be found in their work. Richard &quot;Chicha&quot; Blanco, Carlos Aray, Hector &quot;Lukas&quot; Paredes and Juan Olmedillo are Los Mentas, and El Kiosko is included on their debut album.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamSpace Siren - This Radar       Amsterdam quartet Space Siren have strong indie-rock pedigree behind them."], "title": "Putting the world's music blogs on the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/15/music-blogs-map", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Blogging"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-15T23:05:09Z", "article": "Another year, another challenge for the travel industry. Last year it was the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of a recession and a slump in the value of sterling, making holidays more expensive at a time when people could least afford them. This year, the storm was tangible, in the form of the Iceland volcanic ash cloud \u2013 a phenomenon of sci-fi-like proportions that grounded flights across much of Europe in April and threatened to cast a pall over the entire summer. Then there was the more antediluvian threat of the niggling BA &quot;will they, won&apos;t they?&quot; strikes. All of which goes to show that, by now, we should have probably come to expect the unexpected. Travellers are certainly learning to be more adaptable \u2013 witness the ingenuity of many who had to make long journeys by road, rail and boat during the ash cloud shutdown. And travel companies are also making valiant efforts to respond to rapidly changing and often unforeseen circumstances. Despite all of this, survey after survey shows that people continue to regard holidays as a priority. Certainly, our own readership are a well-travelled bunch \u2013 Guardian readers take a total of 4.8 million holidays a year, Observer readers 3.6 million and users of guardian.co.uk 12.4 million.

I was nine, and the two pieces that puzzled me were Waterfall and Ascending and Descending. In the first, water at the bottom of a waterfall flows along a channel back to the top without defying gravity in a never-ending cycle. The second is even more striking, with one set of monks climbing an endless staircase while another group walk down it without either ever getting any higher or lower. Years later I learnt that both works were inspired by Roger Penrose. As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher&apos;s work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tri-bar \u2013 a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn&apos;t. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces. Doing what most find impossible has long been Penrose&apos;s stock in trade in mathematics and physics, even when it comes to publishing. His previous book, The Road to Reality, was a 1,049-page bestseller, although it was mostly a textbook. Penrose doesn&apos;t do &quot;popular&quot;, as he peppers his books with equation after equation in defiance of the publishing maxim that each one cuts sales in half. By that reckoning Cycles of Time will have about four readers, though it&apos;s probably destined to be another bestseller. As Penrose puts forward his truly Extraordinary New View of the Universe, that the big bang is both the end of one aeon and the beginning of another in an Escheresque endless cycling of time, he outlines the prevailing orthodoxy about the origins of the cosmos. In the late 20s it was discovered that the light from distant galaxies was stretched towards the red end of the visible spectrum. This redshift was found to be greater the further away the galaxy was, and was accepted as evidence of an expanding universe. This inevitably led theorists to extrapolate backwards to the big bang \u2013 the moment of its birth some 13.7bn years ago, when space and time exploded into being out of a single point, infinitely hot and dense, called a singularity. That at least was the theory, with little more to back it up until 1964, when two American scientists discovered &quot;cosmic background radiation&quot; \u2013 the faint echo of the big bang. In the decades since, further evidence has accumulated and theoretical refinements made to accommodate it. Yet in recent years a few physicists have challenged the big bang model by daring to ask and answer questions such as: was the big bang the beginning of the universe? Traditionally such questions have been dismissed as meaningless \u2013 space and time were created at the big bang; there simply was no &quot;before&quot;. Although it&apos;s possible to work out in incredible detail what happened all the way back to within a fraction of a second of the big bang, at the moment itself the theory of general relativity breaks down, or as Penrose puts it: &quot;Einstein&apos;s equations (and physics as a whole, as we know it) simply &apos;give up&apos; at the singularity.&quot; However, he believes we should not conclude from this that the big bang was the beginning of the universe. Acknowledging that he&apos;s not the first to think such heretical thoughts, Penrose looks at earlier &quot;pre-big bang proposals&quot;. Finding them &quot;fanciful&quot;, Penrose looked anew at the big bang, because of an unsolved mystery at its heart involving the Second Law of Thermodynamics. One of the most fundamental in all of physics, it simply says that the amount of disorder, something that physicists label &quot;entropy&quot;, increases with the passage of time. Herein lies the mystery for Penrose. The instant after the big bang, &quot;a wildly hot violent event&quot;, must have been one of maximum entropy. How can entropy therefore increase? Penrose thinks he has the answer; there must be a pre-big bang era that ensures that entropy is low at the birth of the universe. And here&apos;s how. In what Penrose calls &quot;conformal cyclic cosmology&quot;, the beginning and the end of the universe are in effect the same, since these two phases of its evolution contain only massless particles. Between now and a far off distant future, everything from the tiniest particles to biggest galaxies will have been eaten by black holes. They in turn lose energy in the form of massless particles and slowly disappear. As one black hole after another vanishes the universe loses &quot;information&quot;. Since information is linked to entropy, the entropy of the universe decreases with the demise of each black hole. The strangest thing about massless particles is that for them there is no such thing as time. There is no past or present, only &quot;now&quot;, and it stretches for all eternity \u2013 but since there is no tick of the clock, what eternity? With some mind-numbing maths, Penrose argues that as time ends in the era of massless particles, the fate of our universe can actually be reinterpreted as the big bang of a new one: &quot;Our universe is what I call an aeon in an endless sequence of aeons.&quot; Escher would have approved.

Nails Inc offers a Champagne Manicure (\u00a345, Harvey Nichols stores nationwide), and So Spa does both a Pint &amp; Pedicure and a Manicure &amp; Martini (\u00a345, Sofitel Hotel, London,sofitel.com/uk), so there&apos;s something for everyone. B: BOOB LASERS The new treatment to trickle over from LA is TLC Breast Enhancement, which uses intense pulsed lights (IPL) to lift the boobs and possibly increase their size. &quot;The microbeam from the laser encourages oestrogen production and\u00a0mimics natural growth,&quot; says Dr\u00a0Daniel Sister, who offers the treatment at his London salon (\u00a31,500 for six sessions, 020 7221 2248). C: COMPUTER FACE The frown lines that come from staring at a screen all day are rectifiable, says cosmetic surgeon Dr Michael Prager, if you look up at least every half hour. And if that fails? &quot;&apos;Baby Botox&apos; injections in the lower face and neck.&quot; D: DETOX CELLS The new luxe serums are the skin equivalent of a fruit diet, promising to rid the skin of toxins altogether (Chanel Sublimage Serum, \u00a3240, boots.com/chanel; Dior Capture Totale One, \u00a375, boots.com and La Prairie White Caviar serum, \u00a3260, houseoffraser.co.uk). E: EYEBROW COLOURING Balenciaga&apos;s autumn/winter show featured models with mint-green, bubblegum-pink and Smurf-blue eyebrows. They looked A-Mazing, bleached first, then coloured gently with hair dye. You could do this at home if you were properly hardcore, but the alternative is eye shadow or pigment (Golden Olive pigment, \u00a315, maccosmetics.co.uk) dabbed on confidently and neatened with a\u00a0cotton bud. F: FISH THERAPY At Aqua Sheko in London (020 3489 8336, \u00a335), a tank of tiny carp are waiting to suck away the dead skin from your heels and toes, pretending they&apos;re cleaning the scales of a larger fish. Don&apos;t worry, they love it, it&apos;s lunch. And apparently it doesn&apos;t hurt, just &quot;tickles&quot;. G: GADGETS You know how in the past couple of years, breadmakers and assorted gadgets have infested kitchens UK-wide? The same is about to happen to your bathroom. Beauty gadgets are becoming affordable enough for normal people (that&apos;s us) to buy. There are home airbrushes for flawless make-up (Luminess Air, \u00a3179, luminessair.co.uk); pore cleansers (Clarisonic Plus, \u00a3175, harrods.com and Bliss Pore-fector, \u00a3125, 020 7590 6146) and hair-removal systems (Philips Lumea, \u00a3399.99, amazon.co.uk) so that you can laser your legs in front of the television. Plus, old-fashioned gadgets such as exercise machines are getting much wackier. The Ciclotte (ciclotte.com) launches this month \u2013 a\u00a0\u00a36,800 designer exercise bike that&apos;s perfectly round and looks more like sculpture than something to sweat on. H: HAIR HAIR FILLERS The idea is to plump up each hair as if it was a rich lady&apos;s lip and you were a cosmetic surgeon. Redken&apos;s Time Reset range, which is aimed specifically at the over-45s, uses &quot;peptides and ceramide&quot; to target cavities in hairs, and make them lovely and shiny again. (Redken Time Reset Porosity Filler, \u00a313.05, feelunique.com) HAIR ON HAIR Carolina Herrera&apos;s catwalk models wore clips covered in silky hair securing their ponytails. The barrettes (there were more than 300) took hours to make \u2013 lead stylist Orlando Pita and his team of six spent about 10 hours attaching real hair to each one. ROOTS Grunge roots are at the wearable end of the 90s trend \u2013 dark at the scalp then blonde at the tips, as if you&apos;ve been on tour gigging for three months, but it&apos;s no big deal. MEDUSA HAIR Dior, Giles Deacon and Galliano&apos;s catwalk shows all featured variations on the Medusa do, with fluffy, snake-like braids exploding from models&apos; heads. EVER-CLEAN HAIR Living Proof do a collection of styling treatments (No Frizz Styling Spray, \u00a318, spacenk.co.uk) which look set to banish the need for dry shampoos and, of course, the awful bore of actually washing one&apos;s hair. Their sprays feature polyfluoroester, which they say effectively blocks humidity and actually repels dirt, so you can go for ages without a blow dry and, indeed, a bath. QUIFFS To get a glamorous quiff, as seen on Kristen Stewart and Scarlett Johansson, backcomb the roots, spray into place with L&apos;Or\u00e9al Professionals Tecni Art Air Fix (\u00a38.90, feelunique.com), and then secure at the back with pins. I: IV SALINE DRIP Screw massages: the new thing is relaxation in a drip. Yes, an IV drip. The Drip &amp; Chill treatment (\u00a3225, efmedispa.com) trickles a carefully prepared cocktail of vitamins into your bloodstream for about 20 minutes as you sit and sip the spa&apos;s special alkaline water. The menu offers a choice of Immuno, Vitality, Power, Metabolism or Stress booster. J: JERRY HALL The hair! The drawl! The lazy eyes! Beauty-wise, 70s Jerry was channelled on both the Marc Jacobs and the Armani catwalks this season. Glossy cheekbones, massive hair, sticky lips and the promise of a\u00a0VH1 reality show about toyboys, somewhere in your future. K: KOALA EYES Instead of the traditional smoky eye, the brand-new look is koala \u2013 you white out the whole ocular area. That means no mascara and bleached brows. If that&apos;s a little much for you to try all at once, experiment with one or the other, or (boring) swap your black mascara for brown. L: LED LIGHTS LEDs have come a long way since they were famous for being the things that told you your telly was on standby. Now, they make you prettier. The HydraFacial (\u00a399, mayfairpractice.com) uses red and blue LEDs to repair damaged skin cells and treat inflammatory skin. And with LED Light Therapy Skin Rejuvenation (from \u00a3120, 020 7499 3848) you get into a pod that they promise uses dry heat and intense LED light to tone the skin, make you thinner and, by stimulating the serotonin inhibitors, make you happier, too. M: MOUTH FACE-LIFTS American facialists and massage therapists claim massaging the muscles inside the upper lip, cheek and jaw area promotes blood circulation and skin-cell oxygenation, resulting in a tighter, smoother complexion and brighter eyes as well as improved elocution. Elsewhere, dentists are experimenting with scalpel-free facelifts by applying veneers to the back teeth to boost volume in the face, and lifting the mouth by lengthening the top front teeth. N: NAILS NASA NAILS The beauty of this trend is that you don&apos;t have to make a decision. Using Spectachrome technology, originally invented for Nasa&apos;s space programme, Del Sol nail varnish changes colour in sunlight. So, green goes blue when you step outside, then when you&apos;re back at your desk, you are back to green. Our favourite is the jewel-coloured red to purple (Heartbreaker, \u00a39.50, inspirationail.com). BLACKBERRY BLING THUMBNAIL As seen on the front rows of all the shows, single thumb nails decorated with Swarovski crystals, tapping away on a phone. No need to waste time on fingernails. Who looks at them? FRENCH MANICURES This season, when doing your French manicure, think &quot;crazy&quot;. Think &quot;wild&quot;. Think of the design as a woman who went missing on an Ibiza hen weekend and reappeared with fluorescent braids and a glittery hoodie. Instead of the white tip and fleshy base, they&apos;re multicoloured, they&apos;re clashing and they&apos;re a little bit fun. Try stick-on nails (Paris Hilton by Elegant Touch, \u00a36.50, asos.com), decals (Dashing Diva) or the excellent colour combination boxes from Yves Saint Laurent (YSL Manicure Couture Duo, \u00a324, boots.com). LOVAL NAILS The &quot;in&quot; shape for nails? Glad you asked. It&apos;s loval (long and oval), as seen at Christian Dior this season. O: OVERSIZED CRAYONS Accessorize (monsoon.co.uk) launches a huge new make-up range this month, with loads of glitter and colour and fun things, our favourite being the chunky Eye Crayons at \u00a33 each. Use them for graphic swooshes of colour and experiment with rainbows. P: PINK PEPPER It&apos;s the smell of the season. Recent perfume launches such as Love Chlo\u00e9, Gucci Guilty, Givenchy Play and Play Intense, Bleu de Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier&apos;s Le Male Terrible and Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gioia all contain this sweet, spicy basenote. All available from selfridges.com. Q: QUEUE FOR... The most exciting make-up launch in ages \u2013 Tom Ford has extended his luxe Black Orchid fragrance range, with dense lip colours and an ultra-shiny dark-cherry shade of nail varnish (0870 034 2566; tomford.com). R: RED EYES If not now, at the crossroads of itchy eyes from hayfever and bloodshot eyes from a stinking cold, then when? When is the time to try the edgy, yes, but surprisingly flattering trend for red eye shadow? (Passionate, \u00a311, maccosmetics.co.uk) S: STINK BOMBS Yes, they are stink bombs, but no, they don&apos;t smell at all farty. Cire Trudon&apos;s Boules Puantes (united-perfumes.com) launch in November. Available in six scents, including Moroccan Mint Tea, Leather and Tobacco and Wax Wood Floor of Versailles, these little glass vials are intended for guerilla drops, in moments of perfume need. T: TOBACCO CHIC The idea is not to look as if you&apos;ve been smoking since you were six, instead to use cigarette colours (mocha eye shadow, beige lips, fag behind the ear) to conjure up 90s grunge. Works best with greasy blonde hair, as seen at Alexander Wang. U: UNUSUAL INSPIRATION Ellis Faas (whose colour range, Human Colors, is now available at Liberty, liberty.co.uk) used to be a special-effects make-up artist. Working to create the perfect wound, the Amsterdam-based Faas says: &quot;I decided to start using those colours in a beautifying way rather than a gory way. Why not take the purple in a bruise,&quot; she thought, &quot;and use it as an eye colour?&quot; V: VENDING MACHINES In lieu of snacks and pop, the U*tique machine (utiqueshop.com), which launched in LA this year, will dispense skincare and haircare items, and make-up by high\u2011end and niche labels. The touch screen offers product-ingredient lists and video demonstrations, with products displayed inside coloured bubbles. And in London, Selfridges asked super-stylist Katie Grand to stock their LOVE vending machine in the St Martins Lane Hotel through last month&apos;s London Fashion Week \u2013 she chose exclusive Dior nail varnishes and Diptyque Mimosa candles alongside Alexander Wang dresses and a vintage Rolex watch. W: WIGS Think afro on afro on afro. At Louis Vuitton, models wore hairpieces made from five wigs, piled on top of each other and held in place with precarious bows. X: XEN-TAN Truly, the perfect self-tan if you&apos;re worried about going pale for winter. It has olive tones, doesn&apos;t smell revolting and streaks stay at a minimum. (Deep Bronze, \u00a319.95, xen-tan.co.uk) Y: YOUTUBE TUTORIALS Are make-up artists quivering with fear? Thousands of YouTube tutorials are threatening to put them out of a\u00a0job as more and more of us turn to the web to learn how to do our own stay-fixed bridal make-up, vintage hairdos and smoky eye shadow. Z: ZOO-BREATH FRESHENER Finally! A posh breath freshener for animals. Santa Maria Novella (lafco.com) has created a 12-product line aimed at pets. Along with a mouthwash gel to alleviate halitosis, the collection includes a detangling lotion, ear and eye cleaners, paw ointment and deodorants. Deodorants!

From Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, the last few months have seen an increase in anti-immigrant, specifically anti-Muslim, policies and a backlash against ethnic minorities reflected in electoral breakthroughs for the far-right in the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, France, and Italy. Listening to the Zeitgeist, mainstream governments of the centre-right have been trying to curb the live-and-let-live approach by, for example, banning the burqa or minarets. Last week in the Netherlands, a rightwing minority government took office pledging to curb immigration, restricting Islamic headgear, and deporting immigrants with criminal records. The coalition depends for its survival on the parliamentary support of Geert Wilders, the anti-immigrant firebrand and perhaps the most aggressive anti-Islam politician in Europe. In Vienna, the far-right leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, more than doubled his vote to 27% following a xenophobic campaign that featured free computer games which involved firing at mosques, and calls for the city&apos;s &quot;blood to remain Viennese&quot;. In some working-class areas of the city, Strache&apos;s Freedom party took 37%. Last month in Sweden, which has traditionally practised Europe&apos;s most open-door policy towards immigrants, a party with neo-Nazi roots, Sweden Democrats, broke through into parliament for the first time thanks to an &quot;enough-is-enough&quot; campaign against immigration. In France, the beleaguered Sarkozy administration has banned the burqa \u2013 a policy being emulated in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland \u2013 and fought its biggest battle in years with EU headquarters in Brussels over the summary deportation of Roma or Gypsy families. The backdrop to the backlash is economic gloom, austerity packages, and public spending cuts, with voters worried about their jobs, living standards, and children. Mainstream leaders are desperate to shore up support, and extremist populist mavericks resort to scapegoating immigrants in a time of troubles on everything from lost jobs, soaring welfare bills, social housing, and crime rates. The far-right is benefiting from the failures of mainstream politics. The perceived entrenchment of parallel societies in Europe&apos;s big cities is seen as the root of the problem as well as the failure to integrate immigrants. Wilder prophesies the &quot;islamification&quot; of the Netherlands. Thilo Sarrazin, whose bestselling book about Germany&apos;s self destructive mission on immigration, warns of a Turkish Muslim takeover. When Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, visited Berlin recently, Merkel complained to him about forced marriages and honour killings among the large Turkish and Kurdish minorities. The far-right is prospering, taking the votes of traditional working class centre-left supporters while mainstream social democracy struggles. Many middle-class liberals \u2013 horrified by the implications for free speech of the Danish cartoons crisis and the Islamist murder of Theo Van Gogh in Amsterdam \u2013 are also divided over immigration and its impact in traditionally permissive societies such as the Netherlands, Sweden, or Denmark. Ageing, shrinking, in decline, and anxious to save its &quot;social model&quot;, Europe, of course, needs immigrants to do the jobs, fund the pension schemes, deliver the tax revenues that it is accustomed to enjoying. It knows it cannot do without immigration but it has yet to come up with a satisfactory way of organising it.", "sentences": ["Many middle-class liberals \u2013 horrified by the implications for free speech of the Danish cartoons crisis and the Islamist murder of Theo Van Gogh in Amsterdam \u2013 are also divided over immigration and its impact in traditionally permissive societies such as the Netherlands, Sweden, or Denmark."], "title": "Economic gloom fuels far-right growth in Europe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/far-right-growth-europe", "tags": ["The far right", "World news", "Islam"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-17T20:31:01Z", "article": "What&apos;s the best way to enhance your enjoyment of the arts? We&apos;ve pumped those in the know for their expertise \u2013 critics, curators, artists, practitioners and professionals \u2013 and have amassed a\u00a0haul of useful advice. So if you&apos;ve ever\u00a0been curious about the\u00a0ideal way to see a show, get stuck in\u00a0\u2013 and please share\u00a0your own tips below. Which are the best seats in the house? For opera and theatre, in the thick of it:\u00a0centre of the stalls halfway towards the back, or as close to the orchestra pit\u00a0as you can. You want to get a panorama of the stage but not be looking down \u2013 unless it&apos;s dance, when\u00a0sitting towards the middle of the first circle means you can see the patterns and how the whole thing comes together. Alan Davey, chief executive, Arts Council England What is the optimum way to appreciate architecture? Walking is the only way. You want a good mix of weather and a day off. Manchester is a great place for this: it can be sunny, but always rains a little bit, so you&apos;re forced inside occasionally. You&apos;ve got to push yourself, break some rules and go to places you&apos;re not allowed. You can&apos;t appreciate architecture until you&apos;ve been told off for going to a room you&apos;re\u00a0not supposed to. Tim\u00a0Abrahams,\u00a0associate editor, Blueprint magazine Which works withstand repeated viewings? A great work is more than a one-liner. Personally, I would plump for anything\u00a0by C\u00e9zanne. His composition, the light, the beauty and intelligence \u2013 he was an extraordinary artist and always pushing the form. Will\u00a0Gompertz, BBC\u00a0arts editor Is it ever OK to heckle at a live performance? Not unless you enjoy being humiliated in public \u2013 always remember that, if you heckle, the comedian is the one\u00a0with the microphone. And if you\u00a0don&apos;t mind being picked on, sit\u00a0in\u00a0the front rows. Shappi Khorsandi, comedian How much should I trust reviews? The simple answer is that it depends what they&apos;re saying and who&apos;s saying it. Evelyn Waugh said that reading reviews is &quot;like sitting in a railway carriage and hearing a fellow traveller pointing out objects of interest and getting them all wrong&quot;. Mostly true, but some theatre critics do have a gift for describing a performance and giving an account of how the audience\u00a0responded. Others, following editorial policy, record merely whether the show is a hit or a miss. Others still are prescriptive: they write about the play or production or performance they would like to have seen, rather than the one they did. In short, they write about themselves rather than the event. If the overwhelming bulk of reviews are bad, it&apos;s foolish not to concede that you have a failure \u2013 but that&apos;s not the same as conceding that you&apos;ve done bad work. Richard Eyre, theatre director Is a theatre programme ever worth the money? A good programme adds to the pleasure\u00a0of an evening. It should tell you all you need to know about the background to the play and the writer. Best value in London: National Theatre programmes, which are pocket\u00a0encyclopedias; and Royal Court ones, where the programme is the play-text. Michael Billington, Guardian\u00a0theatre critic Which venues have the best and worst acoustics? I don&apos;t really care about a venue&apos;s acoustics; if I wanted a perfect sonic experience, I&apos;d stay at home and listen through my Grado headphones. Live rock isn&apos;t about a perfect sonic experience: if a band&apos;s powerful enough, they can overcome anything a venue throws at them. I always thought Alexandra Palace in London had terrible acoustics until I\u00a0saw Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds there: they sounded magnificent. Likewise, Brixton Academy has swallowed bands that weren&apos;t ready to play a venue that size (such as the Strokes); but REM and Coldplay, bands obviously used to playing bigger\u00a0places, sounded great there. Alexis Petridis, Guardian rock and pop\u00a0critic Should I read the caption to an artwork before looking at it \u2013 or after?  Do both: before, because you get an understanding of where an artist is coming from; and after, because the work can make a more sense. A lot of conceptual art is about the ideas, so it makes sense to get a framework. Ekow Eshun, outgoing artistic director, ICA Sometimes captions illuminate, but often they are dull, or try to tell you what to think. Generally, I ignore them. Use your eyes. Adrian Searle, Guardian art critic Artists use titles to encrypt or deceive as much as to assist the audience in reading their work. It depends on the artist. Ryan Gander, artist How do I get the perfect cinema experience? Choose your film carefully. And make sure you sit in the reclining seats, which cost a bit more. They&apos;re definitely worth it. I go in the afternoon: you have the whole cinema to yourself. Charlotte Rampling, actor Which performance of a show is the one to catch? Halfway through the run \u2013 when the cast is relaxed, but not bored. Not on press nights and not on Saturday nights, when their heads are too caught up with &quot;important people&quot; watching. Midweek matinees and Monday nights are best; the actors are less worried and enjoy it more. Rory Kinnear, actor Where can I see the most innovative new work? Try the Kaai or Kunstenfestival in Brussels, Hebbel Theatre in Berlin, PS\u00a0122 in New York, Frascati in Amsterdam, BIT in Bergen. In the UK, there&apos;s the National Review of Live Art in Glasgow or the Nuffield Theatre in Lancaster.  Tim Etchells, Forced Entertainment theatre troupe How can I tell if an actor doesn&apos;t know his lines? Copious sweating, stuttering and uncertainty. It&apos;s like being on a plane when the pilots aren&apos;t sure what they&apos;re doing. It&apos;s not always that actors don&apos;t know the lines, more a momentary lapse in concentration. Lyn Gardner, Guardian theatre critic What should I wear to the opera? Halfway between what you&apos;d wear for the ballet and what you&apos;d wear to a black tie party. If the ballet is a pale cashmere sweater and sparkly skirt, and black tie is a strapless LBD, the opera is perhaps a slinky but not skintight silk dress. You should have something of the night about you, but not in a sleazy way. For men? You can&apos;t go wrong with a dark, slim suit. Jess Cartner-Morley, Guardian fashion\u00a0editor Do critics ever consider the value for money a show offers? No. On that basis you would say that a five-hour epic that&apos;s truly ghastly must be of more value than Samuel Beckett&apos;s Breath, which lasts 30 seconds. One might be aware, when reviewing something in the West End, that people will be asked to pay \u00a350 or more, but on the whole critics don&apos;t account for that at all. Lyn Gardner \u00a0Is it worth buying tickets for preview performances? If it&apos;s the easiest way of getting tickets, it&apos;s well worth it. It&apos;s great to see something before reviewers, so you can judge for yourself. Alan Davey Not the first one. It&apos;s going to be shaky and awkward. Roy Williams, playwright What&apos;s the best way to enjoy an exhibition? Rain is always useful; it&apos;s the perfect weather for introspection. And mid-afternoon, midweek \u2013 when it&apos;s always nice and quiet. Jennifer Higgie, co-editor, Frieze magazine Is there a way to buy a ticket to a sold-out show? Yes. Shows sell out months in advance and people change their mind. Be flexible, always call the box office, and go for the returns. In plenty of West End theatres, if you arrive an hour before curtain-up, you can get house seats at a fraction of the normal price. Tania Harrison, arts curator, Latitude festival Is it worth taking children to the theatre? Children enjoy the attendant things with theatre: the ice-cream, lights going down, the magic of it. Any good production can make that come alive and it&apos;s probably more important to see how their tastes develop. The worst way is to force it, and insist they see Shakespeare, or enjoy Tennessee Williams. Children don&apos;t have to buy into the hegemony of what is good. Rory Kinnear Where can I find the next big thing in pop? The weekly indie club White Heat in London&apos;s Soho has uncovered its fair share of alternative stars: Klaxons, the Horrors and Bloc Party all played there before they had record deals. Krissi Murison, editor, NME What&apos;s the best destination for a culture-stuffed holiday? London, Paris and New York remain amazing places to visit for sheer complexity and intensity. Rio de Janeiro has one of the most dynamic art scenes in the world, as do Mumbai, Dehli, Beijing, Shanghai, Beirut, Cairo and Tel Aviv. Besides the great European capitals, Glasgow, Oslo and Stockholm offer a true polyphony. Hans Ulrich Obrist, curator, Serpentine gallery, London Should I research an artist or play before seeing their show? Never read the play first if it&apos;s new, and always see the work before getting the context. Try to find out what it means to you first before reading up on it. Judith\u00a0Knight, director of ArtsAdmin Where can I spot the art stars of tomorrow? Simple: go to art-school degree shows. Both the BA and MA ones at St Martin&apos;s, Wimbledon, Chelsea and Glasgow will be packed with dealers, but you get a good sense of what&apos;s happening in art and which trends are emerging. Ekow Eshun How long should I spend looking at a single painting? There is no &quot;should&quot; about it. Look for as long as you like. Sometimes a glance is sufficient, an hour not long enough. One might return to works over years, or even decades, and they will continue to offer new insights. The\u00a0work itself might not change, but you do. Adrian Searle Some works might seem off-putting or even dull, but with persistence you might find them profoundly satisfying. Go to a museum to learn, not to consume. Jonathan Jones, Guardian art critic Do any arts venue cafes or restaurants offer decent food? Theatre and museum restaurants rarely offer good value, but some do have other attractions. The Whistler murals at Tate Britain&apos;s dining room are an attraction, and the wines there are famously impressive. Tate Modern&apos;s seventh-floor dining room has impressive City views. And the Wallace Collection&apos;s restaurant has a fantastic atrium setting. But one always ends up thinking: if only the food lived up to the surroundings. Richard Harden, co-editor of Harden&apos;s London Restaurants Should I attempt to see an artist&apos;s entire oeuvre?  It&apos;s impossible to see everything, but often one can fully experience an artist through just one artwork, or by exploring a single aspect of that artist. I&apos;ve always had the dream to see all the works of Vermeer. There are only a little over 70 works and an exhibition of all of them would be extraordinary, a\u00a0real epiphany. Hans Ulrich Obrist Which museum has the best gift shop? The Baltic&apos;s gift shop is probably the\u00a0best shop in Newcastle or Gateshead, let alone the best art or museum store. The Tate and V&amp;A also do it well. The National Gallery offers print-on-demand reproductions for any picture in the building on canvas: plus posters and greeting cards are all popular.

Deutsche Bahn is taking on Eurostar, which operates services to Paris and Brussels, by preparing to run 200mph trains from the capital to Frankfurt, Cologne, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The company offered travellers a glimpse of the new entrant by bringing a state-of-the-art Intercity-Express (ICE) train into St Pancras station yesterday following safety tests under the tunnel involving 300 volunteers. &quot;The new services to London are not only a milestone for us. They are a milestone for the entire European railway sector,&quot; said DB&apos;s chairman, Dr R\u00fcdiger Grube. Theresa Villiers, the transport minister, said she expected the service to grab market share from airlines operating the same routes, following the example of Eurostar, which now controls three-quarters of the air-rail market between London and the French and Belgian capitals, carrying 9 million passengers annually. &quot;The experience of high-speed rail across the rest of Europe shows that these services are really attractive for a lot of people and will take a lot of share from the airline market.&quot; However, new safety tests will be needed before DB officially launches the service because it plans to use an updated version of the ICE model. DB said it would run three return journeys a day, with trains from London splitting at Brussels to reach Amsterdam or Frankfurt. DB said it expected the journey from London to Frankfurt to last just over five hours, with both London to Cologne and London to Amsterdam taking four hours. Villiers admitted that some of the journey times were a little outside the four-hour envelope that rail executives normally cite as a precondition for competing with airlines, but said DB&apos;s plans were &quot;really positive&quot; for Britain&apos;s burgeoning high-speed rail market. &quot;The journey times are slightly longer but I believe that DB has got a good project here.&quot;", "sentences": ["Deutsche Bahn is taking on Eurostar, which operates services to Paris and Brussels, by preparing to run 200mph trains from the capital to Frankfurt, Cologne, Amsterdam and Rotterdam.", "DB said it would run three return journeys a day, with trains from London splitting at Brussels to reach Amsterdam or Frankfurt.", "DB said it expected the journey from London to Frankfurt to last just over five hours, with both London to Cologne and London to Amsterdam taking four hours."], "title": "High speed rail in Britain enters new era as ICE prepares to start service", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/19/high-speed-rail-europe-db", "tags": ["Rail transport", "Rail transport", "Rail travel", "Channel Tunnel", "Transport", "UK news", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-22T09:01:00Z", "article": "A German freight ship struck a small Dutch passenger ferry in a canal near Amsterdam today, capsizing the smaller vessel and knocking the skipper and any other passengers who may have been on board into the water, national police said. &quot;There&apos;s one person missing, possibly more,&quot; spokesman Frans Zuiderhoek said on Dutch television. &quot;At this moment we don&apos;t know how many people were on board the ferry.&quot; He said neither the skipper nor any other victims had been found more than two hours after the collision occurred at 7am (6am BST).

A retrial was ordered. Wilders, who is enjoying soaring support at home and propping up a new minority anti-immigration government established last week, has been in the dock since earlier this month on five charges of inciting racial and religious hatred for his robust denunciations of Islam as fascist and demanding the Qur&apos;an be banned. During the trial he has been lionised as a modern-day Galileo as well as branded a &quot;little Hitler&quot;. Today was the final scheduled day of the trial, with the verdict from the panel of three judges at Amsterdam district court due next week. But in the past 48 hours it emerged that one of the appeal court judges who ordered Wilders to stand trial had dinner in May with a potential witness, a Dutch expert on Islam, and that the judge had sought to convince the professor of Arabic studies why Wilders had to be prosecuted. Last night, Wilders, who has remained silent throughout the trial, tweeted that Dutch justice was like the mafia. This morning, Bram Moszkowicz, Wilders&apos;s lawyer, asked to summon the witness and was refused. He formally protested that the judges were biased against the defendant, a complaint that was upheld by another judges&apos; panel, which ordered a retrial with a new bench. The highly unusual event means that it is likely to be months before a new trial can be held. Wilders, whose Freedom party came third in elections in June and who has deftly manoeuvred himself into the role of sleeping partner with the new minority coalition of rightwing liberals and Christian Democrats, has argued that the trial is a farce, a disgrace, and an assault on free speech. It appeared things were going his way because in testimony last week, the Dutch prosecution service argued there was no case to answer, dismissed all five charges against Wilders, and said he should be acquitted. The prosecution service initially declined to bring charges against Wilders related to newspaper articles he has written, likening Islam to nazism and because of his incendiary anti-Muslim film Fitna. But prosecutors were ordered by an appeal court in January last year to press charges. It was one of the appeal judges, Tom Schalken, who had dinner with the Arabist, Hans Jansen, who told a Dutch newspaper today that the judge had tried &quot;to convince me of the correctness of the decision to take Wilders to court&quot;. Moszkowicz had sought to have the trial judges removed on the opening day of hearings after one of them passed comment on Wilders&apos;s decision to make use of his right to remain silent during the proceedings. That complaint was dismissed. The trial has heard a series of Muslims and Dutch citizens of immigrant origin or from mixed marriages argue that Wilders is &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;divisive&quot;, and that he makes them fear for their futures in The Netherlands. Moszkowicz told the court that Wilders was a straight-talking, campaigning politician seeking to prevent Qur&apos;an-inspired violence. &quot;Regardless of the danger to his own life, he speaks about the dangers he sees around him that result from immigration,&quot; the lawyer told the court. &quot;In his eyes, Islam is a totalitarian ideology.&quot;", "sentences": ["Today was the final scheduled day of the trial, with the verdict from the panel of three judges at Amsterdam district court due next week."], "title": "Geert Wilders hate speech trial collapses in Netherlands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/geert-wilders-trial-collapses", "tags": ["Netherlands", "The far right", "World news", "Islam", "Geert Wilders", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-27T13:57:46Z", "article": "The memoir of a former Boston prison librarian has revealed some of the literary preferences of American inmates. And according to Avi Steinberg, aka &quot;Bookie&quot; to the inmates of Suffolk County House of Correction, popular requests are The Diary of Anne Frank, Robert Greene&apos;s Machiavellian self-help manual The 48 Laws of Power, and anything by Sylvia Plath. Steinberg&apos;s Running the Books: The Adventures of an Accidental Prison Librarian relates how Steinberg, as a wayward Harvard graduate who had written his thesis on nothing more testing than Bugs Bunny, answered a Craigslist ad and found himself permanently employed working for a prison library in Boston. There he lent books to both men and women inmates, building relationships over the bookstacks. Steinberg&apos;s experiences seem to have made him somewhat wary of the notion that books have the power to transform \u2013 not least after the occasion when he was mugged in a park by an ex-con who boasted that he&apos;d still got two overdue titles that Steinberg had issued to him. &quot;Transformation was not necessarily the main story,&quot; he reflects. &quot;It happened in some instances but they were notable exceptions. Prisoners weren&apos;t there to transform themselves, or be transformed \u2013 but they would still come to the library.&quot; The prisoners&apos; book choices are suggestive: Anne Frank was effectively coping with incarceration in her Amsterdam attic, and Plath is an obvious choice for those less than contented with their lot. Participants in Steinberg&apos;s women&apos;s writing group insisted on checking out an author&apos;s photo before they would read the book, with interesting reactions. Flannery O&apos;Connor&apos;s portrait got a positive verdict \u2013 &quot;She looks kind of busted up, y&apos;know? She ain&apos;t too pretty. I trust her&quot; \u2013 but the judgment on Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was blunt: &quot;That man is a liar&quot;. Erwin James, who has detailed his own experiences of imprisonment in the UK in his journalism and memoirs including A Life Inside, said that strangely enough, inmates like to read prison memoirs. &quot;Despite the high rates of illiteracy \u2013 60% across the board \u2013 books about prison are very popular with prisoners, just as films about prison are,&quot; he said. &quot;My own books, Jimmy Boyle&apos;s diaries, Jeffrey Archer&apos;s Prison Diaries \u2013 even though everyone is scathing about what he writes \u2013 and Jonathan Aitken&apos;s Porridge and Passion are all popular. When you are in jail, everyone interprets your experience for you \u2013 the media, the politicians \u2013 and people want literature that helps them to articulate the experience to themselves.&quot; Crime fiction, particularly Martina Cole&apos;s, is also much in demand, James said. &quot;Her books are the most borrowed in prison libraries, and the most stolen, because she writes her crime fiction from the point of view of the criminals and their families.&quot; True crime, such as books about the Krays, also goes down well, though James says he fears the distorting effects on young criminals of titles that glamorise violence. Inmates also love history, he said, and romance: &quot;Anything that brings some colour into their lives.&quot; Despite daily requests, Steinberg&apos;s library refused to lend prisoners copies of The 48 Laws of Power, the book about survival skills reportedly beloved of some of America&apos;s top rappers \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly for a manual which counsels you to &quot;conceal your intentions&quot; and &quot;discover each man&apos;s thumbscrew.&quot; But James has no truck with such controls. &quot;To my mind banning any literature is pointless,&quot; he said. &quot;People will only read it when they come out.&quot;", "sentences": ["Prisoners weren&apos;t there to transform themselves, or be transformed \u2013 but they would still come to the library.&quot; The prisoners&apos; book choices are suggestive: Anne Frank was effectively coping with incarceration in her Amsterdam attic, and Plath is an obvious choice for those less than contented with their lot."], "title": "Memoir reveals prisoners' book preferences", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/27/memoir-prisoners-book-choices", "tags": ["Libraries", "Books", "Culture", "Prisons and probation", "Society", "Society", "Anne Frank"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-10-29T22:16:41Z", "article": "The Bojinka plot (1995) A plan, named after a Serbo-Croat term for explosion, to bring down as many as 12 US-bound airliners using liquid-based explosives was foiled after a fire broke out in a Manila apartment, which had been converted into a bomb factory.

It is one of the most powerful explosives made today and is a favourite among terrorists because its colourless crystals are hard to detect in a sealed container. PETN is relatively stable and is detonated either by heat or a shockwave. A little more than 100g of PETN could destroy a car, experts say. Richard Reid, the &quot;shoe bomber&quot;, tried to set off a PETN device on an American Airlines jet to Miami in 2001, and this summer a suicide bomber tried to assassinate a member of the Saudi royal family with a PETN-based bomb inside his body. &quot;If you can lay your hands on a reliable source, it would be the explosive of choice,&quot; said Hans Michels, an explosives expert at Imperial College, London. In December, PETN was found in the possession of 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. According to US security officials he had attempted to blow up Northwest Airlines flight 253 as it approached Detroit airport from Amersterdam. Abdulmutallab was in a window seat and had the device strapped to his left leg, against the body of the plane. The idea was almost certainly to blow a hole in the aircraft so decompression would tear it apart. Abdulmutallab&apos;s bomb involved a syringe and a soft plastic container filled with 80g of PETN. Experts believe the syringe may have been converted into an electrical detonator or, more likely, it was was filled with a liquid detonator, such as nitroglycerin, which would have made the device extremely hard to detect through the usual airport security measures. Abdulmutallab cleared security in Lagos and Amsterdam after passing through a metal detector and having had x-rays done of his hand luggage. The lack of an explosion on the flight meant there was almost certainly a failure between the primary and the main charge so that the PETN did not fully detonate. However, a test explosion on a decommissioned Boeing 747 in March showed that the flight would have landed safely even if Abdulmutallab&apos;s bomb had detonated successfully. In the test, carried out by Dr John Wyatt, an explosives adviser to the UN, the plane&apos;s fuselage did not break open.

At 20 he would study in England, where his first cousin, Wole Soyinka, was already making waves as a literary lion. Instead, Fela Ransome-Kuti became infamous, an outlaw musician who declared himself president of his own &quot;Kalakuta Republic&quot;, a sprawling compound in the suburbs of Lagos that housed his recording studio and offered sanctuary to the dispossessed. At his club, the Shrine, his band played until dawn while dozens of singers and dancers writhed and glittered amid drifts of igbo smoke. Here, Nigeria&apos;s corrupt dictators were denounced and ancient Yoruban deities honoured, all to a relentless backdrop of the &quot;Afrobeat&quot; that Fela had distilled from the musical collision of Africa and black America. His music and outspokenenness made Fela a hero to Africa&apos;s poor, but he would pay a high price for his insurrectionary micro-republic, which was repeatedly raided, and he and his followers would be arrested and beaten. In early 1977, the military junta had had enough \u2013 Fela&apos;s record Zombie, mocking the army&apos;s do-as-you&apos;re-told mentality, may have been the tipping point for head of state General Obasanjo, who had once been in the same primary school class as Fela. A thousand soldiers overwhelmed Kalakuta, brutalising and raping as they went, then razing the compound to the ground. Fela was beaten close to death, and his elderly mother thrown from an upstairs window, afterwards dying of her injuries. Fela defiantly established a short-lived political party and continued to spar with the authorities. &quot;ITT (International Thief Thief)&quot;, for example, deplored the exploitation of Africa by multinationals. Increasingly, he carried his music and message to an international audience, though the west&apos;s media acclaim was never matched by record sales or stadium concerts. Tours that entailed a 50-strong entourage and albums of 20-minute songs didn&apos;t help. Nor did his imprisonment for two years on trumped-up currency charges on the eve of a 1984 world tour. Later still, Fela became a student of the spirit, only leaving home to play twice a week at the Shrine. At his death from an Aids-related illness at the age of 58 in 1997 Fela left behind seven children, 50-odd albums and a musical legacy that has been kept fiercely alive by his sons Femi and Seun, and by his erstwhile drummer Tony Allen, who last month celebrated his 70th birthday with an all-star concert in London. Belatedly, Afrobeat has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among young European and American music fans. Yet the most surprising aspect of Fela&apos;s afterlife arrived two years back when the biographical musical Fela! became the unexpected toast first of off-Broadway and then Broadway itself, garnering rave reviews and a string of awards. Never able to conquer the United States while alive, Fela Kuti had finally been taken to its cultural heart, captivating a new generation of black luminaries such as Jay-Z (one of the show&apos;s co-producers) and Alicia Keys. Next month the production opens at London&apos;s National theatre, with African-American actor Sahr Ngaujah alternating in the lead role with Britain&apos;s Rolan Bell. Fela Kuti is hardly the first rebel outsider to be posthumously embraced, but the success of Fela! is not without irony; the likelihood is that more westerners will enjoy this virtual Fela than ever heard or saw the living man. For Fela&apos;s children, this is a cause for celebration: daughter Yeni is unreservedly positive. &quot;It has introduced him to so many people who would been ignorant of him, his life and beautiful music,&quot; she told me. Apart from the show&apos;s dazzling choreography and terrific music (drawn mostly from Fela&apos;s gilded 70s output), what impresses is the nuanced portrait of Fela himself, who is presented not in the usual militant stereotype, but as a compromised, flawed, even unbalanced soul. &quot;The show is faithful to Fela&apos;s character,&quot; says Rikki Stein, who was Fela&apos;s manager for 15 years, and who recalls &quot;a tornado of a man who liked to play, eat, have sex and get high. But he was also sweet \u2013 he loved humanity, he was principled. He was a lot of fun to be around. He&apos;d show up in the lobby of a five-star hotel wearing nothing but a pair of Speedos.&quot; The extravagance of Kuti&apos;s personality is captured cannily by Sahr Ngaujah&apos;s onstage incarnation. The actor was raised in Atlanta, the son of a Sierra Leonean father and Cherokee mother, and remembers hearing Fela&apos;s music as a child (his father was a DJ). Ngaujah is also a sometime resident of Amsterdam and London; a world citizen with an engaging presence. Asked what he has learned about Fela from his role, Ngaujah testifies first to Fela&apos;s courage: &quot;He was fearless enough to be an individual. On another level he&apos;s an archetype in modern clothing; a warrior, a trickster, while in his relationship with his mother, Funmilayo, you can see a very old motif \u2013 mother and son \u2013 at work. &quot;Technically, it&apos;s been a demanding role, because at the very least you want a convincing representation of a real person. Each time we rehearsed I focused on a different aspect of Fela; his walk, the way he held a cigarette, the timbre of his voice, his pronunciation. What I learned is that if you talk like this&quot; \u2013 and here Ngaujah rolls his eyes mischievously and goes into a languid Lagos drawl \u2013 &quot;then you have to be very cooool!&quot; His impersonation offers a flash of Fela&apos;s seductive power, and that charisma is the reason why Fela! exists \u2013 the show&apos;s architects, producer Steve Hendel (an oil trader by profession), writer Jim Lewis and choreographer Bill T Jones were all fans way before they hatched the idea of creating a musical. In retrospect, Fela&apos;s life has all the necessary ingredients \u2013 a great soundtrack, extraordinary showmanship and dancing, plus a story that involves heroism and martyrdom \u2013 but to stage it still required a leap of\u00a0faith. Fela!&apos;s success has inevitably awakened interest in its subject \u2013 Kuti&apos;s sprawling back catalogue has been dusted down and partially reissued \u2013 and reanimated the careers of his sons Femi (48) and Seun (28), both of whom bear a striking physical resemblance to their father and whose music likewise follows the Afrobeat mould created by Fela in the late 1960s. Seun, indeed, now fronts his father&apos;s old band, Egypt 80. Afrobeat was essentially a synthesis of Ghana&apos;s jazzy highlife with Yoruban polyrhythms and James Brown funk. Brown, enormously popular in west Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, provided Fela with a model for a stage show that included dancers, extended instrumental workouts and lengthy call-and-response vocals. The influence may have been mutual; when Brown toured Nigeria in 1970 he and his band visited the Shrine. Yet Fela&apos;s musical roots are more tangled than might appear. When he came to London as a 20-year-old he had been sent to study medicine. Instead, he enrolled at Trinity College of Music and studied piano and composition. Asked, in 1984, which musician he most respected, Fela declared it was George Frideric Handel and said that he particularly admired Dixit Dominus and was making &quot;African classical music&quot;. Music ran in the Kuti family; Fela&apos;s Anglican father was a gifted pianist, while his grandfather had recorded hymns in Yoruba for a forerunner of EMI back in 1925 (one of which is used in Fela!). In London, Fela visited R&amp;B clubs and formed a band, Koola Lobitos, that played highlife and jazz. Fela first called his music &quot;Afrobeat&quot; in 1967, but it was a visit to Los Angeles with his group in 1969 that completed Afrobeat&apos;s alchemy. Fela met black power activist Sandra Smith, who introduced him to the politics of black militancy, to the rhetoric of Eldridge Cleaver, Stokely Carmichael and LeRoi Jones, to the sight of dashikis on the pavement, to the &quot;black and proud&quot; mood of soul music. While Smith tried to learn what being &quot;African&quot; meant, Fela suddenly perceived the process of neocolonial control that reigned in his homeland. &quot;Being African didn&apos;t mean anything to me until later in my life,&quot; he said in the mid-80s. &quot;When I was young we weren&apos;t even allowed to speak our own languages in school. They called it &apos;vernacular&apos;, as if only English was the real tongue.&quot; On his return to Nigeria, Fela renamed his band Africa 70 and started writing the strident, satirical numbers that would make him both hero and renegade, always using pidgin English to cast his message wide. &quot;Gentleman&quot;, for example, questioned why Africans aped western dress: &quot;Him put him shirt put him tie put him coat\u2026 him go sweat all over him go smell like shit.&quot; Musically, the early 70s was Fela&apos;s golden era; the peerless Tony Allen left following the Kalakuta raid \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m a musician, I didn&apos;t sign up to be a fighter,&quot; he told me, and other musicians disliked the &quot;hengers on&quot; that proliferated at court. Fela changed his name to Anikulapo Kuti at this point, rejecting Ransome as a &quot;slave name&quot;; his new title meant &quot;One who holds death in a pouch&quot;. His advocacy of African tradition extended to religion, running contrary to his father&apos;s Christianity, though it&apos;s tempting to see Fela&apos;s &quot;Shrine&quot; as a version of his father&apos;s pulpit. His denunciation of corruption and support for the underclass tied in with his mother&apos;s crusading, though her championship of women&apos;s rights must have been affronted by her son&apos;s sexual politics. On &quot;Lady&quot; Fela castigated modern womanhood for thinking itself equal to men, while his infamous 1978 marriage to 27 &quot;wives&quot; \u2013 mostly his singers and dancers \u2013 has often been brandished against him. For his part Fela declared polygamy an African tradition and claimed that by marrying them he was protecting his wives against charges that they were prostitutes. Ever the contrarian, in 1986, he divorced them all, saying that no man should own a woman&apos;s body. His daughter Yeni has ambiguous feelings about this. &quot;I learned at an early age that men were polygamous, so I just accepted it. For me, as a kid, it was fun having so many stepmothers, though now, at 49, I wonder how my mother Remi, who was born and raised in England, really felt.&quot; The paradoxical character of Fela was there even at his death. His last record, &quot;Condom Scallywag and Scatter&quot; deplored condoms as un-African. Aids, he declared, was a white man&apos;s disease. Yet confirmation that it had indeed laid waste to Fela \u2013 news delivered by his brother Beko, a noted doctor and public health campaigner \u2013 jolted Aids awareness in Africa. Aside from Fela! \u2013 which threatens to become a yet more international phenomenon \u2013 it is hard to gauge Fela Kuti&apos;s long-term impact. Afrobeat has never been more popular among westerners; Rikki Stein estimates that there are some 100 Afrobeat bands around the globe, yet only two of them \u2013 Femi&apos;s Positive Force and Seun&apos;s Egypt 80 \u2013 are in Nigeria. These days the country&apos;s charts are made up mostly of R&amp;B crooners and hip-hop acts. &quot;The Afrobeat heritage is still there,&quot; says novelist and commentator Diran Adebayo. &quot;Femi is very popular for starters, and the hip-hoppers will use Afrobeat loops in their music like their American equivalents will use old funk records. &quot;But across Africa there has been an MTV-isation, with a lot of mid-Atlantic radio stations that have promoted a consumerist lifestyle\u2026 America is still the land of dreams.&quot; Fela himself is no longer the b\u00eate noire he was once painted, reckons Adebayo. &quot;He has a cuddlier image, he&apos;s become something of a national treasure. Nigeria respects money, and he&apos;s become bankable. Plus Femi is clean-living; he&apos;s in the tradition of the Kuti family as cultural leaders.&quot; Both Femi and Seun maintain the political outspokenness of their father, albeit in more general terms. &quot;Musicians have a responsibility to motivate the young,&quot; Seun tells me by email, &quot;though I don&apos;t appreciate western celebrities coming to Africa saying they are here to help. They never come without a camera. We don&apos;t want handouts. &quot;Life here is so hard, people don&apos;t have time to think about anything but survival, which is why I say, &apos;Stand up and think&apos;, rather than &apos;Stand up and fight&apos;. I don&apos;t think African art, in general, is representing the cause of the continent. The corporations push commercial things: cars, clothes\u2026 it&apos;s a brainwash. People here respect Afrobeat artists because they know we are trying to give the people some kind of voice.&quot; Seun was raised for many years by his uncle Beko \u2013 &quot;His conservative lifestyle was the perfect foil to my father&apos;s eccentricity&quot; \u2013 and doesn&apos;t share Fela&apos;s religious inclinations, though he does talk of Fela being &quot;in a Godlike state&quot; at the end of his life. &quot;He had been through so much. He was a man on knowledge.&quot; Given his early demise, Fela seems to have tempted fate when he gave himself the title of Anikulapo, the holder of death. For the moment, however, through his sons and his music, Fela lives. Fela! starts previewing at the Olivier theatre, London SE1, on Saturday (6 November); to coincide, Wrasse Records are releasing a series of box sets spanning his career as well as Fela!

Led by the sacked government drugs adviser David Nutt with colleagues from the breakaway Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, the study says that if drugs were classified on the basis of the harm they do, alcohol would be class A, alongside heroin and crack cocaine. Today&apos;s paper, published by the respected Lancet medical journal, will be seen as a challenge to the government to take on the fraught issue of the relative harms of legal and illegal drugs, which proved politically damaging to Labour. Nutt was sacked last year by the home secretary at the time, Alan Johnson, for challenging ministers&apos; refusal to take the advice of the official Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which he chaired. The committee wanted cannabis to remain a class C drug and for ecstasy to be downgraded from class A, arguing that these were less harmful than other drugs. Nutt claimed scientific evidence was overruled for political reasons. The new paper updates a study carried out by Nutt and others in 2007, which was also published by the Lancet and triggered debate for suggesting that legally available alcohol and tobacco were more dangerous than cannabis and LSD. Alcohol, in that paper, ranked fifth most dangerous overall. The 2007 paper also called for an overhaul of the drug classification system, but critics disputed the criteria used to rank the drugs and the absence of differential weighting. Today&apos;s study offers a more complex analysis that seeks to address the 2007 criticisms. It examines nine categories of harm that drugs can do to the individual &quot;from death to damage to mental functioning and loss of relationships&quot; and seven types of harm to others. The maximum possible harm score was 100 and the minimum zero. Overall, alcohol scored 72 \u2013 against 55 for heroin and 54 for crack. The most dangerous drugs to their individual users were ranked as heroin, crack and then crystal meth. The most harmful to others were alcohol, heroin and crack in that order. Nutt told the Guardian the drug classification system needed radical change. &quot;The Misuse of Drugs Act is past its sell-by date and needs to be redone,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to rethink how we deal with drugs in the light of these new findings.&quot; For overall harm, the other drugs examined ranked as follows: crystal meth (33), cocaine (27), tobacco (26), amphetamine/speed (23), cannabis (20), GHB (18), benzodiazepines (15), ketamine (15), methadone (13), butane (10), qat (9), ecstasy (9), anabolic steroids (9), LSD (7), buprenorphine (6) and magic mushrooms (5). The authors write: &quot;Our findings lend support to previous work in the UK and the Netherlands, confirming that the present drug classification systems have little relation to the evidence of harm. They also accord with the conclusions of previous expert reports that aggressively targeting alcohol harm is a valid and necessary public health strategy.&quot; Nutt told the Lancet a new classification system &quot;would depend on what set of harms &apos;to self or others&apos; you are trying to reduce&quot;. He added: &quot;But if you take overall harm, then alcohol, heroin and crack are clearly more harmful than all others, so perhaps drugs with a score of 40 or more could be class A; 39 to 20 class B; 19-10 class C and 10 or under class D.&quot; This would result in tobacco being labelled a class B drug alongside cocaine. Cannabis would also just make class B, rather than class C. Ecstasy and LSD would end up in the lowest drug category, D. He was not suggesting classification was unnecessary: &quot;We do need a classification system \u2013 we do need to regulate the ones that are very harmful to individuals like heroin and crack cocaine.&quot; But he thought the UK could learn from the Portuguese and Dutch: &quot;They have innovative policies which could reduce criminalisation.&quot; Representatives of both countries will be at a summit in London today, called drug science and drug policy: building a consensus, where the study will be presented. UK reformers will be hoping the coalition government will take a more evidence-based approach to classification and tackling drugs than Labour did. The Liberal Democrats supported Nutt over his sacking, while Conservative leader David Cameron, who got into trouble at Eton, aged 15, for smoking cannabis, acknowledged the Misuse of Drugs Act was not working during his time as an MP on the Home Affairs select committee. Nutt called for far more effort to be put into reducing harm caused by alcohol, pointing out that its economic costs, as well as the costs to society of addiction and broken families, are very high. Taxation on alcohol is &quot;completely inappropriate&quot;, he said \u2013 with strong cider, for instance, taxed at a fifth of the rate of wine \u2013 and action should particularly target the low cost and promotion of alcohol such as Bacardi breezers to young people. Don Shenker, the chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said : &quot;What this study and new classification shows is that successive governments have mistakenly focused attention on illicit drugs, whereas the pervading harms from alcohol should have given a far higher priority. Drug misusers are still ten times more likely to receive support for their addiction than alcohol misusers, costing the taxpayer billions in repeat hospital admissions and alcohol related crime. Alcohol misuse has been exacerbated in recent years as government failed to accept the link between cheap prices, higher consumption and resultant harms to individuals and society.&quot; &quot;[The] government should now urgently ensure alcohol is made less affordable and invest in prevention and treatment services to deal with the rise in alcohol dependency that has occurred.&quot; The Home Office said last night: &quot;We have not read the report. This government has just completed an alcohol consultation and will publish a drugs strategy in the coming months.&quot; A Department of Health spokesperson said: &quot;In England, most people drink once a week or less. If you&apos;re a women and stick to two to three units a day or a man and drink up to three or four units, you are unlikely to damage your health. The government is determined to prevent alcohol abuse without disadvantaging those who drink sensibly.&quot;Two experts from the Amsterdam National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and the Amsterdam Institute for Addiction Research point out in a Lancet commentary the study does not look at multiple drug use, which can make some drugs much more dangerous \u2013 such as cocaine or cannabis together with alcohol \u2013 but they acknowledge the topic was outside its scope. They add that because the pattern of recreational drug use changes, the study should be repeated every five or 10 years.", "sentences": ["The government is determined to prevent alcohol abuse without disadvantaging those who drink sensibly.&quot;Two experts from the Amsterdam National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and the Amsterdam Institute for Addiction Research point out in a Lancet commentary the study does not look at multiple drug use, which can make some drugs much more dangerous \u2013 such as cocaine or cannabis together with alcohol \u2013 but they acknowledge the topic was outside its scope."], "title": "Alcohol 'more harmful than heroin or crack'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/nov/01/alcohol-more-harmful-than-heroin-crack", "tags": ["Alcohol", "David Nutt", "Drugs policy", "UK news", "Society", "Drugs", "Health", "Politics", "Science", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-01T19:11:31Z", "article": "A privately owned work by the Venetian master painter Titian, unseen in public for over 30 years, is to appear at auction with a guide estimate of between $15m-$20m (\u00a39.3m-\u00a312.4m), Sotheby&apos;s announced today.

This is the player who supplanted him at Ajax, by and large got the better of him during their brief stint back together at Real Madrid and has certainly done so at international level with Holland. Van der Vaart, though, is something of a rarity in the professional game. Variously described as down to earth, unselfish and the friendliest footballer you will meet, he once said that &quot;jealously is a disease. I don&apos;t have it in my character.&quot; When Van der Vaart lays eyes on Sneijder at White Hart Lane tonight, before his Tottenham Hotspur team takes on Sneijder&apos;s Internazionale in Champions League Group A, he will embrace him warmly and the minds of both men will doubtless rewind to the time when, as rising stars at Ajax, they were referred to as Ren\u00e9 and Willy, after the inseparable Van de Kerkhof twins, who played together for Holland during the 1970s. Van der Vaart and Sneijder have plenty in common. They grew up in tough working-class neighbourhoods, they attended the fabled Ajax Academy and they made their debuts for the club as precocious teenagers. Van der Vaart is 16 months older than Sneijder and it was he who enjoyed the breakthrough first. Later in their careers, they both completed the dream move to Real for eight-figure sums \u2013 Sneijder cost \u20ac27m; Van der Vaart \u20ac13m \u2013 while off the field, they have each snared famously attractive wives. It is perhaps the pair&apos;s greatest similarity, though, that has come between them. When Van der Vaart made it into the Ajax first-team, so stunning was his impact that he was hailed as the new Johan Cruyff. A Dutch magazine featured him on its cover, together with the words &apos;Cruyff, Van Basten, Van der Vaart.&apos; But when Sneijder emerged \u2013 he made his debut in February 2003 \u2013 the Ajax coach, Ronald Koeman, had a problem. He saw the diminutive attacking midfield playmakers as too similar in style and he came to the conclusion that he could not accommodate them both in the team. In the two-and-a-half seasons that Van der Vaart and Sneijder spent in the Ajax squad, Koeman tended to choose between them and, invariably, it was Sneijder that he preferred. Van der Vaart endured a torrid final season at the club, in which he found he could not see eye-to-eye with Koeman, and he left for Hamburg in the summer of 2005. The same discussion about the pair has played out at international level. Bert van Marwijk, the Holland coach, feels that he cannot start with two No10s and, after initially using Van der Vaart in the role, he switched to Sneijder. At the World Cup in South Africa, Van Marwijk accommodated Van der Vaart at left midfield before he dropped him when Arjen Robben regained fitness. Van der Vaart found himself as the 12th man as his country advanced to the final. Van der Vaart and Sneijder are fundamentally different personalities and it is often said that the latter&apos;s ruthless and clinical edge has set him apart. While Van der Vaart has always wanted to play beautiful football alongside his compatriot, Sneijder, from an early age, considered Van der Vaart to be a direct rival, somebody that he had to better, to usurp. Van der Vaart is much loved in Holland for his continued desire to try outrageous tricks and deft chips; Sneijder, particularly after a season under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Inter, in which he won everything, is more direct, more lethal. He is regarded as the consummate winner. To borrow a phrase from Amsterdam, Sneijder has long been the bluf boy of the class. It is about self-confidence, about knowing how good you are and showing it. Van der Vaart has it too but not in the same measure. Sneijder advertised his cocksure nature as a 20-year-old, after Koeman had dared to start him as a substitute. He came off the bench, scored, turned towards his coach and raised his middle finger. Sneijder appears to embrace glitziness off the pitch. When Mourinho threw his pre-wedding party into jeopardy last January by taking Inter to Dubai at late notice for a training camp, Sneijder responded by hiring a private jet and flying all the guests over to the Gulf. &quot;We&apos;re in recession and the airlines need people spending the money,&quot; Sneijder said, his tongue only halfway into his cheek. He and Yolanthe are the Dutch equivalent of Posh and Becks. Van der Vaart, by contrast, says that he only goes to one premiere a year these days with his wife, Sylvie. Sneijder confidently took David Beckham&apos;s No23 shirt when he joined Real from Ajax in 2007 but, a year later, when the Spanish club signed Van der Vaart from Hamburg, Sneijder felt slighted. Why did they need a new Dutch No10? They already had him. Ironically, neither player was given a proper run in the role, with various Real managers using them mainly as faux left-wingers yet, in their one season together, it was Sneijder who was the bigger noise. Attention now turns to White Hart Lane, with Van der Vaart having been denied the opportunity to face Sneijder at San Siro the week before last because of suspension. It will be a special moment for both men.

And when will we get our full 2011 fixture list?  3.55pm: Some good news for Winter Whimsy lovers, we have more tomorrow, with Stephen Bates updating the story of Maurice Tate&apos;s grave.       3.49pm: Sky Sports&apos; @danieldonovan tweets confidently: &quot;Warwickshire have v good chance after that draw!&quot;  3.44pm: Group C looks tough, with 2010&apos;s unluckiest team, Somerset, Notts, Lancs and Essex.  3.42pm: As a London-based Yorkshire supporter I&apos;m looking forward to some Sunday afternoons at Lords, Canterbury and Hove. Until I see the fixture list for the season, at which point I will discover that the Sussex game is on a Wednesday evening before the holiday season and that the missus has booked our holidays when we play at Lords. Such are the trials of being a county supporter.  3.40pm: What I didn&apos;t have time to tell you during that mini-rush of action was that Bob Willis had taken over Nick Knight&apos;s role making the draw. And now Big Bob is offering some thoughts on the future shape of the domestic season...  3.37pm: To recap Group A:NetherlandsDerbyshireMiddlesexWorcestershireSussexYorkshireKent Group B:ScotlandHampshireDurhamNorthantsWarwickshireSurreyLeicestershire Group C:UnicornsNottinghamshireGlamorganGloucestershireEssexSomersetLancashire  3.36pm: Group A - KentGroup B - LeicestershireGroup C - Lancashire  3.36pm: Group C - Somerset  3.36pm: Group B - Surrey  3.36pm: Group A - Yorkshire, Yorkshire, Yorkshire  3.35pm: Group C - Essex  3.35pm: Group B - Warks  3.35pm: Group A - Sussex  3.35pm: Group C - Gloucestershire  3.34pm: Group B - Northants  3.34pm: Group A - Worcestershire  3.34pm: Group C - Glamorgan  3.34pm: Group B - Durham  3.34pm: Group A - Middlesex  3.33pm: Group C - Notts  3.33pm: Group B - Hampshire  3.33pm: Group A - Derbyshire  3.32pm: Alan Fordham is outlining the set-up for the tournament, as below.

Re: the 2011 season format, as Halftracker said on Twitter: &quot;Afraid that typical ECB took too long to meet and discuss next year&apos;s schedule, so they&apos;ve stuck with same structure for 2011...Though it does mean that we&apos;ll have a 16 game group stage 20/20 again, I think most would have preferred a reduction to 10 games.&quot; Draw coming up in about 20 minutes....  12.30pm: So, this is it, the Big One that county cricket fans have been waiting for, the draw for the group stages of the Clydesdale Bank 40. Sky Sports News will be broadcasting the action live and the Guardian&apos;s County Cricket Live Blog will be, er, liveblogging it. Sky&apos;s coverage will be hosted by the English cricket&apos;s very own Ant &amp; Dec, Nick Knight and Alan Fordham. Hang on a second, some of you may be saying, how can they be doing the draw for 2011 when the schedule for next year&apos;s county cricket season has yet to be decided by the ECB&apos;s working party? Well, apparently they left it so late that 2011 is going to be the same as 2010 - some may say that that will make it a baffling, non-sensical fixture list lacking in shape and form, while others may be pleased that at least it will mean consecutive season&apos;s being unchanged. Feel free to debate below the line. The format for the Clydesdale Bank 40 draw will be as follows: Three groups of seven.Three teams are pre-determined: Group A - NetherlandsGroup B - ScotlandGroup C - Unicorns There will be 18 numbered balls (allocated alphabetically): 1 Derbyshire Falcons2 Durham Dynamos3 Essex Eagles4 Glamorgan Dragons5 Gloucestershire Gladiators6 Hampshire Royals7 Kent Spitfires8 Lancashire Lightning9 Leicestershire Foxes10 Middlesex Panthers11 Northamptonshire Steelbacks12 Notts Outlaws13 Somerset14 Surrey Lions15 Sussex Sharks16 Warwickshire Bears17 Worcestershire Royals18 Yorkshire Carnegie The first ball drawn randomly out of the hat will go into Group A, the second Group B, the third Group C, the fourth into Group A etc etc The draw is scheduled to start at 3.30pm.Share your thoughts below or email Steve Busfield or on Twitter", "sentences": ["Amsterdam here I come (sometime in the spring/summer/autumn of 2011)."], "title": "County Cricket - CB40 draw as it happened | Steve Busfield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/02/county-cricket-live-clydesdale-bank-40", "tags": ["Sport", "Cricket", "YB40"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-03T13:26:49Z", "article": "I want to give my 16-year-old daughter a fantastic holiday in Europe next summer as we&apos;ve had a really tough year; two interesting weeks, not too packaged, no car rental, moderate budget. As a single mum safety is important too.Elaine You might find a small group adventure tour to your liking. Several companies do these very well, and get you to places that you would otherwise have found tough to reach without hiring a car. Intrepid Travel&apos;s (intrepidtravel.com) 15-day Baltic Explorer (from \u00a31,485pp excluding meals) travels from Helsinki in Finland to Berlin exploring the cities and natural scenery in between \u2013 you pass through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. If you&apos;d rather do your own thing, I&apos;d suggest a combination of two or three cities, possibly linked by rail, with the scope for excursions. Your daughter qualifies for cheaper rail fares, making four days of rail travel in Italy within a month \u00a363 for her and \u00a3126 for you. It&apos;ll be hot, but I&apos;d imagine you&apos;d both love the adventure of taking the train between cities and the combination of art, shopping, gelato and pizza. Just within Italy there&apos;s a huge choice but Rome to Venice via Florence \u2013 and Pisa if you wish \u2013 or Bologna is a marvellous linear journey easily done without a car. You could take the train there and back via Paris if you wanted (see raileurope.co.uk for details and fares) or take a budget flight. If your daughter has a longer holiday than usual this year, then go earlier for the best prices and fewest crowds, the latter being the main downside of Italy at this time. Readers&apos; suggestions are welcome. My girlfriend and I want to go to Iran in April, flying from Tehran to the southern city of Shiraz to start our journey back to Tehran as suggested in the Lonely Planet, but it doesn&apos;t seem possible to book the internal flight. The only flight options we are offered are Tehran to Shiraz via Dubai, which seems ridiculous. How can we book internal flights in Iran?Matthew Morris It may be that you&apos;re a little early. Iran Air (iranair.co.uk) has online booking on internal flights, but when I tried to book a date in early April I was routed via Kuwait. Aha, I thought, I was asking to travel via Imam Khomeini International, the main international hub, rather than the older Mehrabad terminal, which handles the bulk of domestic traffic, but the results were still unsatisfying. When I looked to go from Mehrabad to Shiraz in December however, I was offered a selection of direct flights, bookable online and costing \u00a348 one way, including taxes. I have asked Iran Air when its April flights will be bookable and will post a comment below when I hear back. In the meantime, you can concentrate on the slightly trickier business of securing an Iranian visa. I&apos;d love to know how you get on with all of this \u2013 do post back here if and when you have success. I am heading to Morocco next Easter with my young family (adventurous boys plus intrepid wife). Thought it would be interesting to enter from the Spanish mainland, ie fly to Malaga and catch boat to Tangier. Is this a good idea and where would you stay for your first night in Tangier? Any advice about trains to let us go deeper into the country and see places like Marrakech would be welcome.Mike Tait The busiest sea crossing between Spain and Morocco runs between Algeciras and Tangier and is the best and most exciting way to arrive. There are also fast boats from Tarifa to Tangier. If you really like ferries, you can make your way from S\u00eate in France and Genoa in Italy but these are much slower services. Direct Ferries (directferries.co.uk) has information and links on ferries across Europe. Although there are lots of crossings between Algeciras and Tangier, you will find ferries busy, especially at the end of Easter week, so advance booking is a good idea. Once in Tangier, there are plenty of budget options around the port gate and medina, but you may find yourself feeling swamped by touts. The budget options in the Ville Nouvelle are often better so consider hopping in a cab there. Hotel El-Munira (no website, doubles \u00a315-20) on Rue Magellan is a good bolthole and was where William Burroughs wrote the Naked Lunch. If you find it full, there&apos;s plenty more choice nearby. To get from Tangier to Marrakech you can take an overnight train, or a day service changing at Rabat \u2013 see oncf.ma for times. There are also bus connections which can be quicker but are not as sociable. We&apos;re travelling from Manchester to Mongolia next July for the third time, to visit our daughter and granddaughters who live there. The best option seems to be flights with Air China, with only a one-hour stopover in Beijing. Do you think this will be long enough? We are not sure whether we would have to change terminals in which case one hour does not seem long. The alternative is to go via Heathrow and Moscow with Aeroflot. We travelled with Aeroflot the first time we went and survived but do not want to be stuck in Sheremetyevo airport for any longer than necessary! The stopover time on the return flight is only 50 mins \u2013 this would be great if there were no delays. What do you think?Lynn Barrett Round the World Flights (roundtheworldflights.com) suggests that 60 minutes is the minimum travelling time through Sheremetyevo and would recommend two to threee hours for the change you&apos;re undertaking in Beijing. Even this sounds like a bit of a squeeze and could make for some stressful incoming flights. To see alternatives you may find it useful to have a look at the recently revamped ITA Trip Planner software, which is freely available at http://matrix.itasoftware.com/cvg/ \u2013 login as a guest. They also have a mean, free iPhone application. Both can search for flight itineraries and give you a useful steer on available options and indicative prices. I sympathise when it comes to Sheremetyevo but one route through here appears a better option than the next best route through Beijing, which appears to involve day-long layovers in each direction. A combination of KLM and Aeroflot via Amsterdam requires five hours at Schiphol and two in Moscow, so you may decide this is a better bet. Departures in July travelling this route should cost around \u00a31,020 depending on who you book with and when.", "sentences": ["A combination of KLM and Aeroflot via Amsterdam requires five hours at Schiphol and two in Moscow, so you may decide this is a better bet."], "title": "Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2010/nov/03/ask-tom-holiday-advice", "tags": ["Travel", "Iran holidays", "Italy holidays", "Tangier holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-03T20:28:35Z", "article": " Good evening, and a very chic and fashionable welcome to Week 5 of The Apprentice. This means we&apos;re almost half way through the series, and I think we can safely say that as far as separating the wheat from the chaff goes, there is still a startling abundance of chaff.  For example, we&apos;re still being treated to a weekly dose of Stuart Baggs (the brand), who I believe Vanilla Ice had in mind when he wrote the lyric &quot;if being an arrogant little tosspot was a drug I&apos;d sell it by the gram&quot;. However Joanna is top of my list for an imminent firing, mainly for being shouty, argumentative and generally grating, none of which are likely to get her much mistletoe action at the Amstrad Christmas Party.  So my current bet for a final four is Banker Chris, Liz, Stella and Jamie \u2013 the rest are just sandwich fillings of blandness, although Paloma could go either way. Of course historically my predictions have always proved to be utterly useless, but I&apos;d still be more than happy to share them with the nation on the You&apos;re Fired! panel whenever the BBC fancies putting the call in *checks phone, drums fingers patiently*. This evening I am without my glamorous assistant @Ladyribenaberet sending me the highlights from the comment box \u2013 she is on holiday in Jordan. I&apos;m assuming she means the country, but I guess we can&apos;t entirely dismiss the possibility that Katie Price has gone timeshare. Ba-boom tish. Anyway, I shall have to assume that you are being as hilarious as ever down there, and no doubt keeping up with the action better than I am. Multitasking is hard, but I&apos;m committed to giving it at least 104%. See you at 9!  8.58pm: Right, we&apos;re off! TUM-te-TUM-te-TUM-te-TUM, abstract camera angles, wheely suitcases etc. We are promised &apos;strong language&apos;, so block your ears if you&apos;re of a sensitive disposition. Previously on The Apprentice - our teams sold bunch of deeply uninspiring products to some retailers who weren&apos;t all that bothered but wanted to be on the telly. Apollo (or possibly Synergy) won after Liz managed to persuade a leading online baby retailer to buy 10,000 infant equivalents of a Global Hypercolour t-shirt. Melissa was fired for being more repellent than a vuvuzela in a lift.  9.02pm: Stella answers the phone, fully dressed with hair and makeup done. Maybe she sleeps like that. Jamie, however, is wearing nothing but a white towel, and I for one am very supportive of this. They are off to London&apos;s fashion retail academy. Fashion is the MOST BORING THING IN THE WORLD, says Stuart, and compares it to &quot;selling magic beans&quot;, which has neither logic or sense, which are actually kind of the same thing, but hey, Stuart is talking about MAGIC BEANS. He really is a tool of the highest order. They are off to the Trafford Centre in Manchester to sell clothes in an &quot;empty retail unit&quot; (aka SHOP). Liz is team leader of Synergy, and Paloma is team leader of Apollo.  9.05pm: Alex describes himself as a &quot;retail guru&quot;, confirming this by repeating the word &quot;retail&quot; ad nauseum. Retail is about &quot;getting people to the honey pot&quot; he tells us, a strategy that only works if your customer is Winnie-the-Pooh. He also knows the Trafford Centre like the back of his hand, Selfridges being tattooed on his middle knuckle.  In the first sweeping generalisation of the evening, Jamie says that Manchester people are behind Londoners, fashion wise, because they have to wear shoes on a night out, or something. I have no idea what he is talking about, but he should never underestimate the buying power of a Cheshire WAG, shoeless or otherwise.  9.09pm: They are checking out fashion designers. Liz is looking for budget rather than premium. None of them have a clue what they&apos;re talking about, but are doing an excellent job of blagging it.  Liz&apos;s team have gone to see the designer of Shirley Bassey&apos;s wardrobe. They are as enthralled by the sequins as I am horrified.  9.12pm: Paloma&apos;s team also like Sequin Hell. Pixie Geldof wears it, which is surely reason enough to go out in a paper bag tied with string instead. But what do I know, I&apos;m liveblogging in M&amp;S pyjamas and a sweatshirt with a broken zip. Sequin ladies go with Liz&apos;s team. Paloma is disappointed, which prompts a small crease in her immaculate forehead.  9.15pm: Instead, Paloma&apos;s team opt for a designer who makes clothes from recycled materials. Stuart thinks that recycled clothing is &quot;what tramps do&quot;, because he is an epic moron. Its \u00a3300 for a dress, so we&apos;re definitely talking London tramps. Actually, Alex is putting up a decent fight to oust him from his moron pedestal this week, being an expert in just about everything. Of course he knows nothing, but Paloma continues to feed himself enough rope to hang himself with.  9.19pm: Paloma opens her shop &quot;bringing London labels to Manchester&quot;, because mostly they never leave the capital, London actually being a remote island full of clothes that only London people are entitled to wear. Liz&apos;s shop isn&apos;t actually open yet, which in retail terms is what&apos;s known as a &apos;risky strategy&apos;.  9.21pm: No-one is buying Paloma&apos;s expensive recycled clothing, maybe because Chris tells his customer that the hideous tie dress &quot;shapes her figure well&quot; in a deeply creepy way. Over in the Shirley Bassey dress shop, Stella is taking one for the team by positioning herself in the shop window. A word from the wise, Stella - if you&apos;re going to borrow the visual merchandising strategy of an Amsterdam prostitute, it&apos;s probably best not to dress like the nougat Quality Street no-one likes. Just a thought. Ha! Nick has been to Amsterdam too. I imagine his eyebrows have never been that far north.  9.24pm: Alex is going for the Stuart Baggs &apos;bash them over the head&apos; school of retail, trying to &quot;generate excitement&quot; by giving incredibly detailed directions to his womenswear store to adolescent boys. He then persuades the centre advertising people to plug the store on the food court TV screen, which would be a reasonably clever strategy were he not quite so smug about it. Both teams are doing quite well, apart from Paloma&apos;s expensive recycled stuff, which no-one wants. Paloma tries telling male customers that he looks &quot;smoking&quot;, but alas stops short of blowing the ends of her fingers.   9.28pm: Comely Chris is charming a lady into buying the \u00a3300 dress made from old ties that used to belong to dead people. Unbelievably, she buys it. He almost shouts &quot;REALLY?&quot;  9.30pm: At 5pm, Joanna asks if there is &quot;anything like a marketing strategy they could put into place&quot;, a statement so meanlingless it could have been written by Melissa with an added sprinkling of Alex. They take the clothes off the racks and try selling them outside of the store, market-trader style. Jamie finds this distasteful, so just stands around looking like he can smell something bad. Possibly it is the bullshit of Alex. Last minute push, and it&apos;s all over. Hard to call this one.  9.34pm: In the boardroom, Liz says she chose sparkly dresses because she thought they would go down well for a Saturday night out in the north of the country. Alas they didn&apos;t come in drag queen sizes, or she&apos;d have made a killing. Both teams took over \u00a33,000, but Liz&apos;s team won by a mere \u00a3500. Which means Paloma&apos;s team are up for the chop. Liz&apos;s team go to Windsor races. Hey, there&apos;s a recession on. In the Cafe De Fail, Paloma&apos;s team are ruminating. Alex clearly made for his location choices, but he DID get the TV advertising. Could Paloma go for bad management and bad range choices? Or someone else we just didn&apos;t notice?  9.42pm: The recycled clothes were clearly a bad choice, but Paloma starts digging her own grave by saying they weren&apos;t.  Sandeesh is waffling, with her massive unblinking puppy eyes. Lord Sugar clearly doesn&apos;t like her, but Paloma says she did a good job. Don&apos;t be complacent, Sandeesh, she is RUTHLESS.  Alex describes himself as &quot;over eager&quot;, which is possibly understatement of the YEAR. Paloma is bringing Alex back in with Sandeesh because of her &quot;overall performance as a candidate&quot;, even though she just said Sandeesh was excellent. See? Lord Sugar is not loving her doing his job for him. Sandeesh kicks off. Alex keeps his head down. You&apos;re turn is coming, my boy.  9.49pm: Alex believes he is being used as a scapegoat. He talks like someone teaching English as a foreign language, ensuring. he enunciates. every. word. separately. from. the. previous. one. Paloma crushes Alex&apos;s balls for a bit, then Nick describes him as &quot;sometimes a bit effusive, but not TOTALLY irritating&quot;. I LOVE Nick. Paloma &quot;don&apos;t take no prisoners&quot;, says Lord Sugar - she goes for a last ditch bit of begging, and when that doesn&apos;t work crushes Alex&apos;s balls a bit more. She&apos;s undoubtedly ruthless to the extreme, and not hugely likeable. I think Lord Sugar might be a bit scared of her. She would crush him under her killer heels.  And so it comes to pass - PALOMA is fired! I&apos;m not sad about this, I didn&apos;t like her. Who&apos;s for a spot of YOU&apos;RE FIRED!?  10.10pm: Does anyone else find You&apos;re Fired a bit dull when the contestants have been media trained to death and stuffed full of humble pie? I want them to come on and let rip.  Ooh, it&apos;s big-chinned DEBRA with the evil killer death stare from last year! She has sage advice about not losing your temper in the boardroom.  10.14pm: It&apos;s not a brilliant You&apos;re Fired, to be fair. Paloma is a droid and potential sociopath, and I have no idea who two thirds of the panel are. Even Nick Hewer can&apos;t save it. Next week, our remaining ten have to design and market a new cleaning product. Stuart Baggs comes up with the killer line &quot;Hasta La Vista, Gravy&quot;, which I expect to see yelled at the camera, Barry Scott-style. It&apos;s the only way. In the &quot;bits we didn&apos;t dare to show in the main show&quot;, Commando Chris describes a size 16 dress as for a &quot;big old unit&quot;. It&apos;s amazing how quickly you can go off someone, isn&apos;t it?  10.28pm: And with a crap gift and a seat on a morning telly sofa tomorrow, Paloma is off. So that&apos;s it for this week! Thank you very much for joining in and being utterly brilliant - I&apos;ll be back here next week for some more livebloggery, and don&apos;t forget to follow Stuart Heritage&apos;s X Factor liveblog on Saturday, because it&apos;s hilarious.

Parts of the airport were evacuated and the army bomb disposal squad called in after security staff found a suspicious package in the departures area. The assistant chief constable of Strathclyde police, Rhuraidh Nicolson, confirmed the incident had proved to be a false alarm.He said: &quot;While this incident has turned out to be a false alarm, there is no doubt that the initial action taken by the staff at the airport was absolutely correct. &quot;&apos;I&apos;m sure that the relatively small number of people who had their travel plans disrupted will understand the necessity of carrying out such operations.&quot; The package was discovered at 7.55pm and the departures area cleared as a precaution about nine minutes later. A Glasgow airport spokesman said the package was found in the central security area where passengers are searched before they board a plane. Passengers who had already passed through the security scanners were allowed to fly on, but the discovery forced the airport to close down the security screening area. This disrupted two of the last three late evening departures \u2013 an EasyJet service to Gatwick and a British Midlands flight to Heathrow \u2013 because passengers were unable to get through the security screening area. It is thought both flights have been prevented from taking off. The only other late evening flight, the 20:55 service to Bristol, took off an hour late. A BAA spokesman said: &quot;We apologise for the inconvenience this caused to a relatively small number of passengers, however the safety and security of staff is our highest priority.&quot; Other areas of the airport, the second busiest in Scotland, remained open during the incident and it still accepted incoming flights. The discovery of viable bombs on freight aircraft coming from Yemen late last week has heightened fears about airport security. Glasgow airport was the target of a car bombing attempt in June 2007 when two men, Kafeel Ahmed, an engineer from Bangalore, India, and Bilal Talal Samad Abdullah, a doctor from Iraq, drove a Jeep laden with propane gas cylinders into the terminal building. Their homemade device only partly went off but Ahmed later died in hospital from severe burns.

Two of Canada&apos;s largest pension funds, the Ontario Teachers&apos; Pension Plan and Borealis, the infrastructure investment arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (Omers), have paid \u00a32.1bn to operate Britain&apos;s only high-speed railway line for the next 30 years. It is the first privatisation deal done by the coalition government as it sets about slashing Britain&apos;s record debt. Other bidders are thought to have included Eurotunnel and two of its shareholders, Infracapital and Goldman Sachs, as well as Morgan Stanley&apos;s infrastructure fund, 3i&apos;s infrastructure fund and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The deal comes in a week that saw the Canadian government block the hostile takeover bid for Potash Corporation by the Anglo-Australian mining group BHP Billiton, and as the Canadian dollar, which has recently been boosted by strong commodity prices, reversed losses this week. It briefly regained parity with the US dollar today and rose against the pound after news of a fall in unemployment. The RMT union slammed the rail link sell-off as &quot;just another act of political vandalism on the UK railways&quot;. Bob Crow, the RMT general secretary, said: &quot;The most modern section of the UK rail network has been sold off for a song in what amounts to nothing more than a fire sale of the family silver to prop up the financial deficit caused by the bankers and speculators in the first place. &quot;Even worse, the sale of High Speed One could pave the way for the busting up and selling off of Network Rail in a lethal re-run of the Railtrack disaster. That&apos;s what the train operators and their lobbyists are demanding as the dash for profits cuts across safety and drags us back to the poisonous cocktail that led to Potters Bar, Hatfield and a series of other rail disasters.&quot; Philip Hammond, the transport secretary, defended the decision, saying: &quot;It is a big vote of confidence in UK plc and a big vote of market confidence in the future of high-speed rail. It also shows that the decisive action this government has taken to reduce the deficit is already paying dividends and that investors believe once again that Britain is open for business.&quot; The Canadian pension funds are adding High Speed One, as the Channel tunnel rail link is officially known, to a list of UK investments. Ontario Teachers is the biggest shareholder in Northumbrian Water with a 27% stake and, as a 0.42% shareholder in Vodafone, recently led a protest vote against its chairman, Sir John Bond. In response, the telecoms group appointed headhunters to find a replacement and is expected to announce a successor by next summer. The property arm of Omers recently struck a 50-50 joint venture deal with British Land to build the \u00a3340m Cheesegrater building in the City of London. In the summer, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), teamed up with Canada&apos;s biggest buyout firm, Onex, to take the London-based car parts and bath-maker Tomkins private. CPPIB forms part of a consortium that snapped up Anglian Water in 2006.

On election day, it went down to a nearly nine point defeat. While high-profile supporters of the legalisation effort immediately declared that they would try again in 2012, the legalisation movement has clearly suffered a serious setback. In all likelihood, the defeat of Prop 19 has put a stop to a fascinating citizens&apos; movement to bulldoze, at a state level, one of the central pillars of the ill-conceived federal &quot;war on drugs&quot;. The question is, why did its support crater in the final weeks? It certainly wasn&apos;t for lack of money: the billionaire philanthropist George Soros poured over $1m into the &quot;yes&quot; campaign over the final weeks; Richard Lee, the pot-promoting founder of &quot;Oaksterdam University&quot;, a center for the study of pot cultivation in downtown Oakland, put in even larger sums; many luminaries of the liberal-leaning computing and social networking industries also kicked in serious money. Conventional wisdom has it that US Attorney General Eric Holder&apos;s statement about how the Feds would draw a line in the sand, and use taxes paid on marijuana transactions as evidence of laws being broken, shattered its support. That might well be part of the reason for the polling decline in the weeks leading up to the election. It served to put a break on the &quot;yes&quot; campaign&apos;s momentum. But it doesn&apos;t fully explain the election night numbers themselves. By my reckoning, it&apos;s an incomplete explanation for two reasons. First, in this election cycle, none of the statements emanating from the White House and the surrounding administration appeared to impact voters in any pro-active way. Even in California, which bucked the national trend by voting solidly in favour of a Democratic slate, disillusionment with DC politics is a potent force. It&apos;s unlikely that one in four pro-Prop 19 supporters withdrew their support on election night simply because the administration in DC asked them to. Second, so few people, especially the younger people who were thought to be the backbone of Proposition 19&apos;s support, are reading the newspapers or watching the serious news shows anymore that it is doubtful many of them were aware of Holder&apos;s position one way or the other \u2013 or, indeed, of who Holder even is. And, while California&apos;s two main gubernatorial candidates, Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman, as well as the US Senate candidates, the contenders for the state attorney general&apos;s office, and other senior elected figures came out against the notion of legalised marijuana via the initiative process, the advertising campaign for the &quot;no&quot; camp was half-hearted at best. In an election season in which Meg Whitman threw nigh on $150m into a vanity production that went nowhere, the big bucks were not flung into an anti-marijuana campaign. In fact, much of the money flowing into adverts was from the &quot;yes&quot; camp. Additionally, many unions supported the measure, as did a number of civil rights groups and law enforcement organisations representing police officers of colour. Rare in a political season dominated by conservative special interest groups and business lobbies, this wasn&apos;t one of those elections skewed in a more conservative direction by a tsunami of rightwing, big-business money. And that&apos;s probably because many businesses, in fact, would, behind the scenes, likely have been quite happy to have a new, legalised narcotic market to tap into. They weren&apos;t about to come out firing all guns in favour of legalisation; but neither were they going to go all-out to defeat the initiative. So, what went wrong for Prop 19 in the end? To start with, Governor Schwarzenegger essentially neutralised the issue a month before the election by signing a law rendering personal possession of pot less than a misdemeanor \u2013 turning it into an &quot;infraction&quot; \u2013 akin to a parking ticket \u2013 one that no longer leaves a person with a criminal record. The action delighted marijuana advocates, and was widely publicised statewide. With medical marijuana already legal and so widely available that many parts of Oakland, Berkeley and Los Angeles now look like Amsterdam, dotted with barely disguised pot cafes, and with anybody willing to pony up a couple of hundred dollars able to get a &quot;medical marijuana recommendation&quot; from self-styled &quot;kush doctors&quot; many Californians already felt their access to pot was safe and secure. Schwarzenegger&apos;s action furthered them in this belief. So, despite the hopes of Prop 19&apos;s supporters, people weren&apos;t inspired to come out to vote just because a legalisation initiative was on the ballot. Following on from this, voter turnout in California was utterly dismal \u2013 as it has been for the past several midterm elections in the state. While absentee ballots are still being counted, turnout appears to be somewhere in the 50% range for registered voters, and well under that as a percentage of the total adult citizen population. The legalisation campaign was banking on a surge of participation from young voters and others on the periphery of the political process, people who don&apos;t always have the best voter participation record. To win, Prop 19 needed to bring out non-traditional voters, in much the same way as the Obama campaign succeeded in doing in 2008. Instead, they sat the 2010 elections out.", "sentences": ["With medical marijuana already legal and so widely available that many parts of Oakland, Berkeley and Los Angeles now look like Amsterdam, dotted with barely disguised pot cafes, and with anybody willing to pony up a couple of hundred dollars able to get a &quot;medical marijuana recommendation&quot; from self-styled &quot;kush doctors&quot; many Californians already felt their access to pot was safe and secure."], "title": "Prop 19's blowback for marijuana in California | Sasha Abramsky", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/06/prop-19-california", "tags": ["Prop 19", "California", "US midterm elections 2010", "US news", "US politics", "Drugs", "Drugs policy", "Drugs trade", "Law"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-07T18:21:35Z", "article": "The writer Harry Mulisch, who has died of cancer aged 83, was unsurpassed in 20th-century Dutch literature but missed out on the international recognition that writing in a more widely read language would surely have brought him. He was far from alone in his belief that he should have been awarded the Nobel prize for literature. Modesty was not one of his qualities and Mulisch made no secret of the fact that he was highly intelligent and an exceptional and versatile writer, his arrogance leavened by a strong sense of humour and occasional self-deprecation. One of his most famous remarks was that he was the second world war \u2013 in person. The conflict was the most important event in his life and the driving force behind much of his writing. The son of Karl Mulisch, an Austrian banker who fled to the Netherlands after the first world war, and a Jewish mother, Alice Schwarz, Harry lived through the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands as a teenager in the town of Haarlem, where he was born. Most of his later life was spent in Amsterdam, where he had a canalside mansion, typically Dutch in looking modest on the outside but lavishly appointed inside. Mulisch Sr collaborated with the occupiers, running a formerly Jewish bank to collect the assets of Dutch Jews deported to the death camps. As the son of a Jewish woman, Harry himself was a candidate for deportation, and was forced to leave school early in 1944, but his father used his influence not only to save his son but also to secure the release from a concentration camp of Alice. Her other relatives died in the Holocaust. The couple had divorced before the war and she left for America in 1945. Karl was sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment by the Dutch after the war for collaboration. Harry had hoped to make a career as a scientist, but was driven to earn his living as a writer. His background, with its moral complexities \u2013 including the bitter irony of owing his life to a traitor father \u2013 equipped Mulisch to tackle head-on the profound Dutch national trauma caused by the German invasion. The Netherlands had declared itself neutral before the war, as in 1914. The Dutch in general were no prewar admirers of Hitler, but were usually favourably disposed to their German neighbours, to whom many were directly related and with whom they did the bulk of their trade. Thus the invasion in May 1940 was not just an act of war, but a colossal betrayal that generated a hostility that lasted for many decades after 1945 and was unmatched in any other country attacked by the Nazis. Such is the context of Mulisch&apos;s most famous novel, De Aanslag (1982; translated into English as The Assault, 1985). A Dutch pro-Nazi police chief is assassinated by the resistance and his body dumped on the doorstep of an innocent family. The occupiers respond with indiscriminate reprisals against civilians, including the parents of a boy called Anton, who survives to evaluate these events as a mature man. A first-class thriller, the book also examines how the occupation is often redacted in Dutch memories. Just one moral question among many it raises is how the resistance justified murdering a Nazi lackey, an act with no effect on the war, while knowing in advance that the Germans would shoot civilians in revenge. The Assault was translated into 32 languages and the Dutch film of the book won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1987. It is a standard school text. If The Assault is his best-known work, De Ontdekking van de Hemel (The Discovery of Heaven, 1992; also filmed) is widely held to be his best. Not the easiest of reads, it was chosen as the best book ever written in Dutch in a nationwide poll in 2007. The central story is a friendship between two intellectual male friends in a love-triangle with a female musician, who gives birth to a boy who turns out to be a messenger from God. The book is a pyrotechnic display of fine writing, human drama, intellectual debate and profound knowledge of science and history, with dashes of mysticism and fantasy. Mulisch produced 13 novels and at least 20 other books \u2013 essays, plays, opera librettos, poetry, short stories and reportage, including an outstanding account of the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the supreme bureaucrat of the Holocaust, executed by the Israelis in 1962. His last novel, Siegfried, returned to the second world war and features a successful writer of world renown, while postulating a love-child of Hitler and Eva Braun. It was published in English in 2003. He won the Anne Frank prize in 1957, an honorary doctorate from Amsterdam University, the Prize of Netherlands Letters (a lifetime achievement award in 1995) and was decorated by the Dutch, French and German governments. British response to his work was less enthusiastic, with critics suggesting that Mulisch may have suffered in translation. Mulisch married Sjoerdje Woudenberg in 1971. They had two daughters. The couple never divorced and remained friends even after Mulisch began a relationship in 1992 with Kitty Saal, with whom he had a son.

Instead of locking up thousands of drug addicts and mentally ill offenders, he wants to offer them hospital treatment. &quot;Serious criminals who pose a threat to the public will always be kept locked up, but in every prison there are also people who ought to be receiving treatment for mental illness rather than housed with other criminals. The public would be better protected if they could receive that treatment in a more suitable setting,&quot; he said. The idea will outrage the hanging-and-flogging wing of Clarke&apos;s own Conservative party, who are content to live with a prison population approaching 85,000, each costing around \u00a345,000 ($73,000) a year. But not even the most ardent bang-em-up enthusiast could argue that the present system is working. New figures from Clarke&apos;s ministry show that 61% of prisoners are reconvicted within a year of being released. Fourteen jails in England and Wales, mostly holding short-term inmates, have reconviction rates of more than 70%. A survey revealed that more than two-thirds of prisoners used drugs in the 12 months before they were convicted, while 7% said they started taking heroin while in prison. Speedy Canadians  The latest bargain in the great international fire sale of British infrastructure has been snapped up by a couple of Canadian pension funds. For \u00a32.1bn, they have acquired the right to operate the UK&apos;s only high-speed rail line, connecting London with the Channel tunnel, for the next 30 years. Transport secretary Philip Hammond defended the sale. &quot;It is a big vote of confidence in UK plc and a big vote of market confidence in the future of high-speed rail,&quot; he said. Canadian pension funds already own several chunks of UK plc, including both property and utility companies. The Channel tunnel rail link is likely to prove a lucrative investment, with the German state operator Deutsche Bahn planning to challenge the current Eurostar monopoly by running trains to London from Cologne, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Brussels. Costlier campuses  Some bits of our national infrastructure can still turn a pretty buck. Universities, for example, will soon be able to charge students tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year, almost three times the current level, although they must increase the number of scholarships and bursaries they offer to the poorest. The prospect of students graduating with debts of \u00a330,000 or more has been marginally softened by new arrangements for paying back loans. Graduates will be obliged to repay 9% of their incomes over \u00a321,000. Curiously, there will be penalties for the most successful graduates with high salaries who want to pay off their loans earlier. The new regime poses a dilemma for the Liberal Democrats, junior partners in the governing coalition. All the party&apos;s MPs signed a pre-election pledge to oppose any rise in fees, and some insist they will vote against the proposals. King David&apos;s courtiers  David Cameron has taken on a number of new staff at 10 Downing Street. One is a personal photographer, Andrew Parsons, who will record key events in the life of the prime minister and other senior government members. One of his first snaps shows Cameron feeding his new daughter, Florence. Also on the Downing Street payroll is Nicky Woodhouse, who ran the WebCameron webcasts during the election campaign, and Anna-Maren Ashford, the Tory party&apos;s brand manager (whatever that means). She will now be working on strategy, rather than image-promotion. Yet another new recruit is Isabel Spearman, former PR adviser to a handbag designer. She is working four days a week in No 10, helping the prime minister&apos;s wife, Samantha, run her life. She will also help choose outfits for SamCam, as she is widely known, to wear at functions at home and abroad. At least the prime minister and his wife don&apos;t have to worry about the cost of the new hirelings. The bill is being picked up by us, the taxpayers. Game on, but not here  The burgeoning video games industry has cut its workforce by 9% in the past two years. It&apos;s not because the games are no good, but rather that developers are seeking more lucrative returns abroad. Industry leaders blame the government for failing to implement tax breaks planned by the last Labour administration. They claim that skilled developers are being lured to countries like Canada and France, which both offer some generous tax packages. Still the British games industry is rubbing along fairly well, generating world sales worth more than \u00a32bn a year for such classic games as the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider series and the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Morning-after mobile  Talking of new technology, British boffins have come up with an ingenious new use for mobile phones: the diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases. People who think they are infected will be able to put a tiny sample of saliva or urine on to a small chip, which they can then plug into their phone or computer, go online, and receive a diagnosis within minutes. The system will be able to detect common conditions including herpes, chlamydia and gonorrhoea. The Medical Research Council has given a \u00a34m grant towards developing the technology. Health experts home it will stem the growing spread of sexually transmitted infections, which reached a record 482,696 cases last year.

The comments came as BAA recorded a 3.4% increase in passenger numbers for October, boosted by a recovery in business travel. Passenger numbers at its six UK airports rose by 318,000 to 9.75 million last month, up from 9.44 million a year ago, and helped by a 1.2% increase in the number of flights. At Heathrow, 410,000 more passengers passed through the airport, a 7.2% increase to 6.1 million, and cargo handled leapt by 14.7%, an indication that the economic recovery is holding up. Long-haul trips between Heathrow and China and Hong Kong climbed by 16.1%, to 173,000. The increase came even though the hub&apos;s limited capacity means it can only directly serve two destinations in China compared to three from Paris, four from Frankfurt and five from Amsterdam. While long-haul trips between all BAA airports and North America increased by 7.5% to 1.43m and other long-haul journeys by 3.2% to 1.84m, such routes could be affected by the increase in air passenger duty last week. Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA, said: &quot;The continued strength of Heathrow reflects an upturn in global economic activity. Low sterling and interest rates make the UK a competitive place to do business. However, government spending cuts, a sharp increase in air passenger duty and an imminent VAT rise are weakening the prospects for in-bound tourism and British leisure travel.&quot; Passenger numbers at Stansted were down in October, dropping 3.1% to 1.72\u00a0million, as fewer leisure travellers passed through the airport, BAA said. Travellers flying out of UK airports face increases of up to 55% in air passenger duty, the tax levied on airlines which is normally passed on to consumers when they buy their tickets. This means that a family of four flying to far-flung destinations such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Australasia will pay \u00a3340 in duty on top of fares \u2013 up from \u00a380 in 2006. &quot;We have the highest passenger duties in the world by some margin,&quot; said a BAA spokesman. &quot;The cost of long-haul flying for a family of four will go up significantly.

All the stories of Arthur, Merlin, and his knights of the Round Table, of the Lady of the Lake, Guinevere&apos;s fatal love for Lancelot, and of the quest for the Holy Grail, which inspired artists from Tennyson and William Morris to Indiana Jones and Monty Python, are in the three huge volumes of the Rochefoucauld Grail. The image of Joseph of Arimathea walking across the water to bring the Holy Grail to Britain, with the believers standing safely on his cloak and the doubters sinking to their doom, could have come straight from the Monty Python musical Spamalot. The volumes with 107 jewel-like illustrations against backgrounds of pure gold leaf were probably made in Flanders in the early 14th century for the Baron de Rochefoucauld while he was a representative of the French king. The grail is seen as one of the greatest medieval manuscripts still privately owned. &quot;It is the most extraordinary thing, a manuscript of royal quality, on a stupendous scale \u2013 I put my back out twice carrying the three volumes,&quot; Dr Timothy Bolton, a manuscript specialist at Sotheby&apos;s, said. &quot;It would have taken 200 cows to get the vellum, and the illuminations are in rare and costly minerals, against a background of thick gold made from coins beaten flat. Are we selling it cheap compared to its 14th-century cost? Of course we are. &quot;The scenes have a riotous energy, and often stretch beyond the boundaries of the picture frames, with lofty towers poking through the borders at the top, and figures tumbling out of the miniatures onto the blank page as they fall or scramble to escape their enemies.&quot; The huge book was made within a few decades of the first attempt to compile the entire English and French tangle of Arthur and grail stories. Most surviving early copies of the stories have been read to the point of disintegration, but this one seems always to have been kept as a trophy possession, rarely even opened, never read. It survived the fate of many early manuscripts of being broken up and sold off sheet by sheet, remaining in the French family for almost 500 years. The final of the four original volumes is now divided between the Bodleian in Oxford and the John Rylands university library in Manchester. These three volumes were acquired in the 19th century by Sir Thomas Phillips, whose extraordinary collection once held more than 60,000 medieval manuscripts. Since then it has been sold just twice.

The lineup: Jack Goldstein, Roo Bhasin, Michael Thompson, Christopher Dawson, Jason Warner. The background: You often hear it said of a band that, to fully appreciate them, &quot;You&apos;ve got to see them live&quot;. Well, tell that to all the great studio units from Steely Dan to Scritti Politti. And tell it to today&apos;s laptop lost boys (Washed Out, How to Dress Well) who doubtlessly make more sense in their bedrooms than they do treading the boards because they&apos;re less about showmanship than the artful use of technology to manipulate sound, which is a whole different kind of performance. We say this because last night we went to see Fixers play in London and let&apos;s just say that their recorded work to date was probably not best served by its live presentation. Put it this way: the five-piece, about whom there is a considerable buzz, weren&apos;t the only ones yesterday to give students a bad name. Or to put it another way: one member of the audience, after watching frontman Jack Goldstein prance and mince his way through Fixers&apos; set, after witnessing those hand gestures and that mannered tilt of the head, was moved to declare that she wanted to &quot;punch his face in&quot;. Note that it was a female. We dread to think what the men in the crowd had in mind. Meanwhile, Fixers&apos; live sound was a bit of a blare and the five boys in the band looked a bit of an uncharismatic mess of jeans, T-shirts and scarves (yes, scarves). And yet Fixers, via the trail of recorded fragments that have been scattered our way \u2013 on MP3, SoundCloud and MySpace \u2013 are a wondrous thing. They are from Oxford (as are Trophy Wife \u2013 cue furious talk of a new Thames Valley scene) but have more in common with the Brooklyn brigade. Think MGMT and Animal Collective, with a similarly fresh take on psychedelia. And think the Beach Boys (they&apos;re massive BBs fans) when Brian Wilson was in bed (or was it his sandbox, or the tent in the living room?) with Van Dyke Parks \u2013 the a cappella intro to Another Lost Apache is a superb homage to the Smile/Smiley Smile-era. Amsterdam (an oblique reference to BBs&apos; 1973 album Holland?) features slowed-down Spectoresque drums, spectral guitar and all manner of psych spaciness while Iron Deer Dream also places Beach Boys in a hard-rock context. A couple of their tracks, namely the enticingly titled Crystals and Majesties Ranch, are apparently rich in handclaps, sleigh bells and various lustrous sonics (our SoundCloud versions stopped playing halfway through). Basing much of our assessment of them, then, on Another Lost Apache, the devil really is in the detail, the Good Vibrations guitar, layered harmonies and barber shop doo-doos, even the pouring-water FX. All of this inevitably got lost in the live translation, where Goldstein&apos;s impressively ethereal soprano became just another of those Chris Martin-ish sensitive-balladeer voices. We keep harping on about this because these days bands&apos; reputations and followings are made on what they can achieve onstage. So ignore the in-concert bludgeon (and lack of a coherent &quot;sexy&quot; image) and focus on the dexterous songcraft because Fixers are potentially huge homegrown purveyors of the new US psych-pop. The buzz: &quot;A gorgeous summer salad of west coast psychedelia and spaced-out, lysergic sunshine pop.&quot; The truth: No supermodels for this bunch, but Brian Wilson would be proud (as would Brian Eno).

Had he done so, he probably wouldn&apos;t still be on air 30 years later. &quot;I didn&apos;t think I could add the Jewish problem to all the other problems in people&apos;s lives as they ate their cornflakes,&quot; he says. &quot;So I thought, what can I give people? And I went, as I constantly do, back to my own experience. Dad was out of work, Ma was in hospital for a long time with a blood problem and I was brought up by my grandmother, who was an old Russian peasant woman, a very pious one. I remembered that what kept us going at that time [the Depression-racked, war-haunted 1930s] was the humour, so\u00a0I started telling jokes.&quot; He has a bracing view of what God offers. &quot;Sometimes people write to me and say, &apos;Dear Rabbi, can you give me a prayer or a mantra, or some object of piety which can take away my problem?&apos; The answer is you can&apos;t, because if I knew of such a thing I would use it for myself. I tell them, &apos;What you&apos;re asking from me is not religion but magic.&apos; Religion turns problems inside out and you see things in them you never saw before. But it&apos;s a very difficult thing to tell people on the radio in the morning \u2013\u00a0that there are no answers to this.&quot; So what does he tell troubled people who are seeking God? &quot;I tell them some of the things which have helped me,&quot; he says. &quot;There is no proof or disproof of God; it&apos;s not a theorem. But you can wander into any place of worship you like and just start chatting as honestly as you can with whatever&apos;s there, with no service going on \u2013 keep away from the service \u2013 and see what happens.&quot; He did exactly that at the age of 13, when he was a Marxist atheist who&apos;d been compelled to go through with his barmitzvah, marking his transition from boy to man. He raged against God for making him gay \u2013 he says he was already lusting after the school football captain \u2013 and for doing nothing to help the Jews in Germany. &quot;I sat back in a kind of fury and what I got back in my mind was, &apos;Well Lionel, you&apos;ve certainly become an adult, even if you haven&apos;t become a man.&apos; Something was communicating with me because I got unexpected answers, and it was enough for me to be\u00a0curious about what goes on.&quot; He was lonely and scared as a young adult \u2013 as a Jew and a homosexual he describes himself as having been in two ghettoes. He lasted only a few weeks as a trainee officer doing national service, had a breakdown, made what he calls a half-hearted attempt at suicide and tried to sustain a relationship with a young woman at Oxford, where he studied history. One morning, heading back to his college after a disastrous attempt at lovemaking with his girlfriend, whom he adored but felt no desire for, he took shelter from the rain in a doorway. The door opened and an elderly woman beckoned him in. It was a Quaker hall, full of farmers holding a religious meeting. &quot;I was very touched by them because it reminded me of my grandmother&apos;s religion. There was the same innocent simplicity, and in the end I testified. I said that I suddenly realised my problems might not be a judgment on me or my punishment; perhaps they were my opportunity.&quot; He describes that moment as &quot;falling in love with love&quot;, with the idea that the only possible response to the evil in the world was to attempt to do good. &quot;It was as if all the anger inside me disappeared. I was a very bitter person at that time, but suddenly something seemed to burst. I found myself giving away things, overdoing it of course, so much so that the chap I shared rooms with at Oxford refused to share rooms with me again. He said he didn&apos;t mind me giving away things, even when some of the things were his, but praying for him aloud was beyond the pale.&quot; Blue was set on a religious course, much to his parents&apos; chagrin \u2013 they had hoped he would be a wealthy lawyer or businessman. &quot;Religion was the only thing which made the world make sense to me,&quot; he says. &quot;Marxism I thought would do so, but it never did. Zionism \u2026 well, I was no good for a kibbutz. I didn&apos;t even like gardening, let alone agriculture, and the dream of a lovely wife and children with freedom in their eyes meant nothing to me. But this private religion of mine did seem to tell me how to go on ahead. I didn&apos;t exactly believe it, but I began to trust it. I suddenly started becoming a lighter, happier person; I became quite souffle-ish.&quot; Blue thought about being a monk before reverting to Judaism and starting to train as a rabbi in London. In his mid-20s, he had another crisis and went to Amsterdam to experience all the sex he had been dreaming of, spending three months in cafes and gay saunas. &quot;It was 1955 and Amsterdam was the Greenwich Village of Europe,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I don&apos;t think I saw daylight while I was there. I said yes to everything and met some extraordinary people. I thought I&apos;d dumped the God business. But I remember sitting in a gay sauna in Amsterdam, thinking, &apos;What are the 10 commandments of gay life in this situation?&apos;&quot; He enumerates them for me and they are all about treating your partners well. He was, he says, still thinking as a minister. &quot;The religion had stuck to me. I saw both hell and heaven in those cafes and saunas.&quot; His old rabbi came to see him in Amsterdam and asked him to return to the seminary. &quot;&apos;No, I can&apos;t,&apos; I said. &apos;I&apos;m going to show you how I&apos;m living.&apos; I showed him all around Amsterdam at night, and we went and had coffee at 4 o&apos;clock in the morning in a cafe, and he started crying. I thought, &apos;Oh my God, I shouldn&apos;t have done this to him.&apos; And then I saw that the tears weren&apos;t of anger but of merriment. He said he hadn&apos;t seen anything like it since the Weimar republic, and the sooner I got back [to the seminary in London] the better. &apos;I can only have one of you Lionel,&apos; he said, &apos;but one of you I&apos;d better have.&apos; He also told me that the art of civilised life was having your cake and eating it, but being careful about it.&quot; And thus was a sweet-toothed radio rabbi with a healthy commitment to sex born. Blue came out modestly in the 1960s, was accepted by the Jewish religious authorities but given low-key rabbinical roles, and would probably never have been heard of again if radio hadn&apos;t discovered him. His early breakthrough was on commercial radio, and his first slot could have been his last: his talk on the latest miracles attributed to the Virgin Mary was juxtaposed with an ad for a new bra. But his quirkiness and humour carried him through. In his personal life, he had two long relationships before finding Jim, whom he met through a personal ad in Gay Times. While confident that heaven awaits him, he shows no eagerness to leave Finchley. He has survived two bouts of cancer and heart problems as well as battling with epilepsy and now Parkinson&apos;s. He doesn&apos;t strike me as souffle-ish exactly \u2013 he has been in therapy all his life \u2013 but he is content. His mother lived into her 90s and he likes to quote one of her last gnomic utterances: &quot;Lionel, what you&apos;ve done in life you&apos;ve done, and the rest is gravy.&quot; He says they share a &quot;bobbing-up quality&quot; and of course has a funny story to underline the point. His mother, who was a secretary, once had to make a vegetarian lunch for her bosses and was given a vegetable juicer to make a soup. She didn&apos;t think it was working and put her hand in to test it, slicing off part of her finger. Before going to hospital, she bravely made a point of serving up the blood-and-flesh-flecked soup to her strictly vegetarian bosses. &quot;When she came out from being bandaged up she said, &apos;Lionel, isn&apos;t it wonderful? It was carrot soup, so it was the right colour. It&apos;s lucky it wasn&apos;t cabbage.&apos;&quot; Truly, God moves in mysterious ways. The Godseeker&apos;s Guide is published by Continuum (\u00a39.99) Blue jokes: Words from the rabbiA chap is on London Bridge looking into the water below and thinking that he&apos;s had it, he can&apos;t take any more of life; he hasn&apos;t got a job, all hope has gone. He&apos;s about to throw himself in when he hears a voice behind him. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do that if I were you.&quot; He looks round and sees an old woman dressed in rags, with everything she owns in one or two plastic bags. &quot;What business is it of yours?&quot; he says to her fiercely. &quot;I&apos;m a fairy,&quot; she says, &quot;a good fairy. Give me a kiss and I can solve all your problems.&quot; Thinking his problems are at an end, he embraces her passionately. When the clinch is over, she punches him in the stomach and says, &quot;How old are you mate?&quot; &quot;Fifty,&quot; he says. &quot;Fifty,&quot; she laughs, &quot;and you still believes in fairies!&quot; A Rothschild goes into Petticoat Lane market and stops at a stall. &quot;How much are these cucumbers?&quot; he asks. &quot;Half a crown,&quot; says the stallholder. &quot;Half a crown!,&quot; says Rothschild. &quot;Are cucumbers so scarce in this market?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the stallholder, &quot;but Rothschilds are.&quot; \u2022Mr Cohen goes into a restaurant crying his eyes out and saying, &quot;It&apos;s the anniversary of my mother&apos;s death.

The initiative will cover not just Unilever&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions, waste and water use \u2013 but the impact caused by its suppliers and consumers, from agricultural growers to the packaging and waste water produced by consumers of Unilever brands, which include Dove, Persil, Bertolli, Flora and PG Tips. &quot;More than two thirds of greenhouse emissions and half the water in Unilever products&apos; lifecycle come from consumer use,&quot; said the company, &quot;so this is a commitment on an unprecedented scale.&quot; The Anglo-Dutch group also intends to improve the nutritional quality of its food products \u2013 with cuts in salt, saturated fats, sugar and calories \u2013 and link more than 500,000 smallholder farmers and small scale distributors in developing countries to its supply chain. The group&apos;s new Sustainable Living Plan \u2013 to be launched simultaneously in London, Amsterdam, Delhi and New York \u2013 is the result of 12 months&apos; planning. Chief executive Paul Polman told the Guardian that the plan was essential because &quot;continuing to increase our environmental impacts as we grow our business is not viable&quot;. He said he was &quot;decoupling&quot; growth from the group&apos;s environmental aims and that the changes constituted a &quot;new business model&quot;. Polman said it was essential that companies took responsibility for the damage they are doing to the planet as concerned consumers were starting to &quot;vote with their wallets on responsible products&quot;. &quot;Consumers want more&quot;, he said. &quot;They see food shortages, malnutrition and climate change, and governments are not addressing those problems. Companies that do this will get a competitive advantage. Those that do not will put themselves at risk.&quot; He added that it also represented an opportunity for multinational corporations to improve the battered image of big business: &quot;This is a unique opportunity to step up to the plate and change the reputation of business.&quot; The new sustainability plan aims to slash the carbon, water and waste impact of its products in half &quot;primarily through innovation in the way we source, make and package them&quot;. Measures will range from reducing truck mileage to producing washing powders that work at lower temperatures and coming up with new products to cut the amount of hot water used in baths and showers, although the company admits: &quot;We do not yet know how we will do this&quot;. Other targets include \u2022 sourcing 100% of agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2015, including 100% sustainable palm oil. Unilever buys 3% of the world&apos;s annual supply of palm oil. \u2022 change the hygiene habits of 1bn people in Asia, Africa and Latin America to help reduce diarrhoea \u2013 the word&apos;s second biggest cause of infant mortality. Unilever will push sales of its Lifebuoy soap brand and teach consumers when to wash their hands to achieve this aim. \u2022 make drinking water safer in developing countries by extending sales of its Pureit home water purifier \u2022 improve standards of living by working with agencies such as Oxfam and the Rainforest Alliance to link 500,000 smallholders and small-scale distributors to the Unilever supply chain. Polman denied that some of the aims in the plan were designed primarily to boost sales of Unilever products and that sustainability inevitably means consuming less. &quot;There are billions of people in the world who deserve the better quality of life that products like soap, shampoo and clean drinking water can provide... We shouldn&apos;t be ashamed of growth. &quot;But growth at any price is not viable. We have to develop new ways of doing business which will ensure that our growth does not come at the expense of the world&apos;s diminishing natural resources.&quot; Unilever is the world&apos;s second biggest food and personal care goods company. It is the biggest seller of packet tea in the world through its Liptons and Brooke Bond labels and the world&apos;s biggest ice cream manufacturer, through Wall&apos;s and Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s. Other major brands in the company&apos;s portfolio include Cif, Omo, Knorr and Hellmans. The new sustainability initiative is not entirely new territory for the company, which sells its products in 170 different countries. The firm has been a sector leader of the Dow Jones Sustainabiity indices for more than a decade. The Unilever plan comes in the wake of an array of new sustainability pledges from larger rival Procter &amp; Gamble. The US group, whose brands include Pampers, Ariel and Gillette, recently set a number of environmental-based targets designed &quot;to improve more consumers&apos; lives in more parts of the world more completely&quot;. P&amp;G&apos;s targets include: powering its plants with 100% renewable electricity, using 100% renewable or recycled materials in all products and packaging, sending zero waste to landfill, maximising the conservation of resources and delivering effluent water quality that is as good or better than water used.", "sentences": ["The group&apos;s new Sustainable Living Plan \u2013 to be launched simultaneously in London, Amsterdam, Delhi and New York \u2013 is the result of 12 months&apos; planning."], "title": "Unilever unveils ambitious long term sustainability programme", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/15/unilever-sustainable-living-plan", "tags": ["Unilever", "Business", "Healthcare industry", "Environmental sustainability", "Environment", "Global development", "Procter & Gamble", "Food & drink industry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-15T07:00:03Z", "article": "Under a railway arch in Shoreditch, east London, on a dark September evening, a crowd gathered to watch an advertising shoot for the new Toyota Auris Hybrid. The commercial \u2013 which involved a crew of 45 and seven projectors \u2013 used a complex technique known as projection mapping to throw a mix of &quot;keyframe, 2D, 3D, algorithmic and dynamic animation&quot; on to an Auris, bringing the car to life in a blaze of pulsing ice blue lights. Made by the digital agency glue Isobar, &quot;Get Your Energy Back&quot; set out to dramatise the technology within the car, which recycles energy as it drives. Glitzy and costly TV car ads are nothing new, of course, but what sets the Auris campaign apart is that it wasn&apos;t conceived as a 30-second TV spot. Rather the Shoreditch event itself, along with its digital afterlife, was the advert. The event was repeated on a loop that night and watched by handpicked influencers, including key bloggers, plus passers-by who were encouraged to film it on their phones and share pictures and footage on social networking sites. &quot;Some of those videos were getting 6,000-7,000 views, so [the event] created its own buzz,&quot; says Andy Kinsella, glue&apos;s innovation director. &quot;We could track the reaction online and store it all on a campaign hub. It wasn&apos;t your typical Toyota brand communication where it&apos;s &apos;Sell the car, sell the car!&apos;. Nowadays great advertising builds communities and inspires participation. It gives people a reason to interact with a brand.&quot; From branded events and art installations to social network-based innovations such as peer-to-peer recommendations and &quot;real time&quot; geo-location promotions, the advertising industry is being rebooted. Traditional agencies are scrambling to reinvent themselves, as brands seek to open digital &quot;conversations&quot; with their customers. &quot;The industry has gone through a massive flux and the pace isn&apos;t easing up at all,&quot; says Kinsella. In the process, modes of advertising such as digital and &quot;experiential&quot;, once viewed as experimental add-ons, have become mainstream \u2013 and even, as with the Auris shoot, the entire campaign. It is a seismic shift, says Fernanda Romano, the global creative director of digital and experiential advertising at Euro RSCG, that is long overdue. &quot;In Brazil we have a saying that if the water hits your ass then you&apos;d better start swimming. The tipping point was last year when the massive advertisers \u2013 Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, Sony and PepsiCo \u2013 really got scared about the internet and started to put a load of money into digital. &quot;Finally, the brand owners \u2013 the CEOs and CMOs [marketing heads] - and the mainstream agencies understood that digital is not an afterthought, it has to be at the core of advertising, because that&apos;s where many people are living today.&quot; Last month, the adam &amp; eve agency and the digital specialists upsetmedia broke new ground by covering the full spectrum from branded art installation to commercial microsite in a campaign for John Lewis. Johnlewisharmony.com was launched as a live interactive display on London&apos;s South Bank, with a 3D house filled with rooms lit by the department store&apos;s lighting products. The Guillemots&apos; Fyfe Dangerfield performed, with a synchronised lighting display. Over the ensuing 18 hours, passers-by queued at a touchscreen to choose from 10m songs, with their choices then lighting up the house like an audiovisual jukebox \u2013 in effect, writing with light. The online campaign allowed visitors to click through to the products. &quot;This was about putting advertising in an art space,&quot; says Matt Cook, upsetmedia&apos;s co-founder. &quot;The South Bank get a lot of requests to do branded promotions, but they turn most of them down for being too corporate and they have an arts-based remit. We were able to put our installation in there because it was primarily an experiential public event.&quot; The event generated social media traffic, with visitors posting pictures and sharing songs. Cook says the venture offered the client benefits unobtainable in traditional advertising: &quot;They can get very specific information about their customers from the website \u2013 such as which products they&apos;re going to, in what sort of numbers.&quot; He adds: &quot;We always try to have a Facebook component to what we do. One of the first things clients say to us now is &apos;how will this help us populate our social media platforms?&apos;&quot; Populating social media platforms is a specialty of Stockholm- and Amsterdam-based Perfect Fools, a digital shop that produces quirky, disruptive content. In October, its Skittles campaign &quot;Dazzle the Rainbow&quot;, created with TBWA London and Academy Films, featured the stunt artist David Phoenix challenging the Facebook community to submerge him in the sweets over 24 hours in a central London shop-front. Every visitor who clicked through to the live event via the Skittles Facebook page (which has 1.65m &quot;Likes&quot;), added Skittles that were then showered on Phoenix every 15 minutes. &quot;It ended up taking about 10 hours to completely cover him,&quot; says Patrick Gardner, Perfect Fools&apos; chief executive. &quot;The job was done with 1.8m Skittles.&quot; &quot;The shift to social is about growing and deepening a conversation with a group of people who are interested in your brand,&quot; he explains. &quot;Instead of just running campaigns which say &apos;Buy our product&apos; and &apos;Here&apos;s our latest message&apos;, it&apos;s about maintaining a long-term discussion, fuelling it with entertaining things to talk about. The smartest brands today are developing robust Facebook groups with up to millions of active users.&quot; But Facebook groups with content-filled branded pages just &quot;scratch the surface of possibilities with social media&quot;, says Euro RSCG&apos;s Romano. In particular, she predicts peer-to-peer recommendation \u2013 especially the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button \u2013 will be one of two new frontiers for the industry, with social platforms using Facebook friends to recommend brands. &quot;Facebook knows a lot about me, and the more details I put on my profile, the more it knows,&quot; she says. &quot;So if I &apos;like&apos; a new soft drink, then they&apos;ll go to friends with the same likes and interests as me and market the product using my endorsement. This is potentially an incredible &apos;machine&apos;, where brands are not doing the advertising, but your friends are.&quot; Similarly, GPS-enabled smartphones mean that when people check in on Facebook Places or Foursquare, virtual lives and real lives converge, she says. &quot;Until now, what was missing was being able to connect where we are physically to where we are online, in real time. That allows for so many things to happen. For instance, when I arrive in Heathrow and you check in on Foursquare, shops \u2013 knowing my likes \u2013 could contact me with special offers.&quot; It may all sound a little too close to the movie Minority Report, in which personalised ads holler at Tom Cruise from billboards. But this isn&apos;t sci-fi any more. In many ways, a rebooted ad industry is already there.", "sentences": ["One of the first things clients say to us now is &apos;how will this help us populate our social media platforms?&apos;&quot; Populating social media platforms is a specialty of Stockholm- and Amsterdam-based Perfect Fools, a digital shop that produces quirky, disruptive content."], "title": "Digital technology and social networking breathe new life into advertising", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/15/advertising-social-networking-digital-technology", "tags": ["Advertising", "Social networking", "Social media", "Digital media", "Media", "Facebook", "Foursquare", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-15T07:29:00Z", "article": "A drug given to wounded soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan may be putting their lives in further danger by causing heart attacks and strokes. The treatment is used to stop serious bleeding in injured troops, but trials show the drug increases the risk of blood clots forming in arteries, which can kill or cause complications that result in amputation. The dangerous side effects are all the more concerning because years of trials have yet to prove the drug is any better at saving the lives of injured soldiers than a placebo. The drug, called NovoSeven, was licensed more than a decade ago to stop bleeding in haemophiliacs, but is used by military doctors and in civilian hospitals on an &quot;off-label&quot; basis to treat patients suffering from major blood loss due to trauma or surgery. The drug, also known as recombinant factor seven, costs several thousand pounds per patient but an effective alternative called tranexamic acid costs just \u00a35 per patient. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence confirmed that NovoSeven was used by UK forces as &quot;a medicine of last resort&quot;, when all other attempts to stem bleeding had failed. The US military also uses the drug. Prof Ian Roberts, an expert in trauma care at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, warned in 2006 that NovoSeven was being used off-label before trials had clarified whether or not it helped save lives. &quot;There are both civilian patients and wounded soldiers who will have been given this drug and the best evidence shows they would not have benefited, but would have experienced heart attacks, strokes and possible amputations,&quot; Roberts said. By continuing to use the drug, the military and hospital surgeons were leaving themselves vulnerable to legal action, he added. &quot;You cannot defend giving this treatment outside of a randomised controlled trial,&quot; he said. He added that the US military, which has used NovoSeven for years, should explain why it embraced the drug. &quot;What advice were they acting on? Was the advice they received truly independent, or were people compromised in any way? It is important to know,&quot; he said. Dr Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, chief science officer at Novo Nordisk, the Danish company that makes NovoSeven, said the drug posed very low risk when used under licence to stop bleeding in haemophiliacs and for certain rare blood clotting disorders. &quot;We cannot encourage as a company, by any means, the off-label use of NovoSeven. This is not something we are promoting and it is not something we are responsible for.&quot; Thomsen estimates that between 10% and 20% of NovoSeven is used off-label. &quot;Every now and then, physicians do use it as a last resort in patients that are otherwise likely to die,&quot; he said. Roberts believes the case for using NovoSeven is weakened further by the availability of a much cheaper alternative drug, tranexamic acid, which is known to save lives in bleeding patients without dangerous side effects. A trial of tranexamic acid, called Crash-2, was published in the Lancet in June. Marcel Levi, professor of internal medicine at Amsterdam Medical Centre, published a review of NovoSeven trials in the New England Journal of Medicine last week that was funded by NovoNordisk. &quot;If you look at whether the drug stops bleeding, or whether fewer transfusions are needed, then many studies are positive. If the only thing that matters is mortality, then it is much harder to prove that this is a useful drug,&quot; he said. Beverley Hunt, a consultant haematologist who worked on the Crash 2 trial at Guy&apos;s and St Thomas&apos;s Hospital in London, said: &quot;The issue around the use of factor seven in patients with massive blood loss is that there is a lack of evidence to show us how clinically efficacious it really is, what dose to use and when to use it. The problem with using an agent that alters blood clotting is that it is a tightrope walk in reducing the risk of bleeding without increasing the risk of blood clots. &quot;The recent data showing that its use is associated with a 5% risk of arterial thrombosis means we should not be using it early in the management of massive blood loss. If however despite normal good practice, somebody is bleeding to death and you have nothing left, are you willing to take a 5% risk of arterial thrombosis, and the answer is yes you are.&quot;", "sentences": ["Marcel Levi, professor of internal medicine at Amsterdam Medical Centre, published a review of NovoSeven trials in the New England Journal of Medicine last week that was funded by NovoNordisk."], "title": "Blood-clotting drug given to wounded soldiers can cause heart attacks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/nov/15/blood-clotting-drug-wounded-soldiers", "tags": ["Drugs", "Medical research", "Science", "Military", "UK news", "US military", "US news", "World news", "Health", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-15T15:36:02Z", "article": "Europe&apos;s plans to let countries choose for themselves whether to grow or ban GM crops would be unacceptable under EU and probably international law, says official legal advice offered to member state governments and leaked to the Guardian. The advice is highly embarrassing for the European commission (EC) which has long advocated more openness by member states about the technology. The EC appeared to make a major concession in July when it told the 27 member states that they could decide for themselves. But the 15-page legal document, prepared by the legal service of the EU Council of Ministers, states that the EC proposal has an &quot;invalid legal basis&quot; and leaves &quot;strong doubts&quot; about the compatibility of the proposal with EU and World Trade Organisation laws. &quot;This confirms that there are legal problems with the EC proposal. It must now be amended by the parliament and the member states,&quot; said the Greenpeace GM campaigner Marco Contiero in Brussels. However, legal experts said that far from being a defeat for the commission, the opinion gave it the political legitimacy to now push through many new GM crops. &quot;Member states are caught between a rock and a hard place \u2013 if they accept the proposal as it stands, any bans will be extremely vulnerable to legal actions by biotechnology companies, GM farmers, world trade partners, or even the EU commission itself. But if they reject the proposal, the commission will have free reign to authorise a plethora of new GM crops for cultivation,&quot; said Thijs Etty, assistant professor of EU law at the VU University of Amsterdam. EU countries must now decide whether to vote down the proposal entirely, accept it as it stands, or pressure the EC to amend its text, said Etty. Europe has been deeply split on GM crops for nearly 20 years. Countries including Britain and the Netherlands want the right to grow them on a large scale, but others, led by Italy and Austria, want to be allowed to impose bans. Only two crops are authorised, but a further 24 are in the pipeline. The legal opinion coincides with a major new EU-wide poll showing that opposition to GM food has hardened slightly. According to the latest Eurobarometer poll, conducted in all 27 member states, 61% of people do not want to see the crops grown compared with 57% in 2007. It further suggested that Europeans believe that GM food is fundamentally unnatural (70%), is not safe for their health or that of their family (59%), is not safe for future generations (58%), and benefits some people but puts others at risk (57%). Less than a third of those interviewed believe GM food is good for the economy. Last month more than a million Europeans signed the first ever citizens&apos; initiative calling for a freeze on new authorisations of GM crops. A formal request to the commission to legislate against the crops will be handed to the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, in Brussels in the coming weeks. GM in Europe \u2022 Only two GM crops can be legally grown in the EU: a GM maize strain (MON 810) was authorised for commercial cultivation in 1998 and a GM starch potato known as Amflora was authorised for cultivation and industrial processing in March 2010. \u2022 More than 20 other requests for authorisation of GMO cultivation, or for their renewal, are ongoing. \u2022 Austria, Hungary, France, Germany, Greece and Luxembourg have prohibited the cultivation of the GM maize MON 810 in their territories. \u2022 In addition, Austria, Luxembourg and Hungary have notified the European Commission of their decision to prohibit the cultivation of the Amflora potato. Poland has legislation in place forbidding the marketing of all GM seeds. \u2022 Spanish farmers grow around 80,000ha (198,000 acres) of GM maize.", "sentences": ["But if they reject the proposal, the commission will have free reign to authorise a plethora of new GM crops for cultivation,&quot; said Thijs Etty, assistant professor of EU law at the VU University of Amsterdam."], "title": "Legal doubts over EU plans to give states choice on whether to grow GM", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/15/legal-doubts-over-gm-crops", "tags": ["GM", "European commission", "Farming", "European Union", "World news", "Science", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-15T17:21:00Z", "article": "Each month, the Music Alliance Pact \u2013 a team of 34 music blogs from around the world, including this one \u2013 simultaneously post tracks chosen by each blog.

The project was crafted by three talented musicians from Buenos Aires and Mr Merritt himself revised and approved the adaptation of his songs. El Gal\u00e1n De La Paternal (The Luckiest Guy On The Lower East Side) is the first single and you can download it here as a MAP exclusive. The whole album is available on iTunes. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Ghoul - 3Mark       I&apos;m excited that over the next six months we&apos;ll be getting both a mini-album (in January) and a full-length release from Sydney experimental/glitch/pop crew Ghoul. It&apos;s been a long wait, but Ghoul have grown a lot since self-releasing their debut mini-LP A Mouthful Of Gold in 2008. Both the production and the songwriting have taken epic leaps toward a more nuanced, crisp sound that relies less on jazz streaks and tangential arrangements to maintain attention and more on melody and detail. 3Mark is a sign of great things to come. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoLabirinto - Anatema       Epic, dark post-rock is at the core of Sao Paulo-based band Labirinto, whose first full-length album is already one of the best Brazilian releases of 2010 and is also remarkable due to its gorgeous artwork. Anatema is the main song on the album, which is available from their Bandcamp. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicRadio Radio - Dekshoo       On the surface, Radio Radio may seem like a joke: a couple of hipsters from New Brunswick rapping in extremely slangy French about stuff like Kenny G, luggage and, on this song, penny loafers. Dig just a little deeper, though, and you&apos;ll find the band members are actually expert satirists, skewering just about every target they can find (except for Kenny G; their love for him seems serious). With brilliant lyrics and fun music, it&apos;s no wonder the band was included in this year&apos;s Polaris Music Prize shortlist. CHILE       Super 45La Reina Morsa - Fiesta Peque\u00f1a       Originally from southern Chile, La Reina Morsa&apos;s members took up permanent residency in Santiago with their own music projects. But their common tastes brought them together to release their debut album D\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n Las Jugueter\u00edas? (&quot;Where Are The Toy Stores?&quot;), the brand new sensation for the current season. Fiesta Peque\u00f1a (&quot;Tiny Party&quot;) is the first single, a great presentation card for this band which creates a pop sound that features acoustic guitar, bizarre animal visions and a sweet, child-like naivety. We strongly recommend you download the full album for free, directly from the Sello Cazador website. CHINA       WooozyJJay - Nostalgic Melody       JJay&apos;s ear-melting vocals coasting smoothly over dreamy soundscapes peppered with catchy, thudding beats and soaring synths have earned him a serious fanbase. JJay first moved from Beijing to Shanghai to study while also forming several post-punk bands. After earning a master&apos;s degree in science in the US, he returned to Shanghai and met B6 with whom he shared a passion for Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk and Royksopp. Once the voice of IGO with B6, possibly the first synthpop band in China, JJay is now pursuing solo work after the band split in 2009. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaEl Tigre - Quien Como Yo       Sebastian aka El Tigre is a rapper from Medellin. His new crew, Los Extraditables, are actually giving the world a new theory: Drugs aren&apos;t the only thing that can be exported from Colombia - good music can be too. Quien Como Yo is a classic dancehall track with a nightclub vibe. DENMARK       All ScandinavianThe Kites - Summer Missus       Exactly one year ago I featured quartet The Kites and their very infectious pop-rock in the Music Alliance Pact. A month later they released the great four-track EP, The Kites Are On, and recently they followed up with this bittersweet gem, co-produced by neo-disco prodigy Vinnie Who aka Niels Bagge. Both the EP and Summer Missus are available for free at their website - so go download it. FINLAND       Glue70vierailijaa - T\u00e4rkeint\u00e4 On (Puutarhanhoito)       With a gentle touch of female voices blending together and an elegant progressive instrumentation, 70vierailijaa create charming dreamy pop to melt the cold winter nights. Their recently released self-titled debut album is full of traditional Finnish themes and melodies, but with the refreshing twist of soft indie music, in an addictive mix of old and new and of local and global sounds. GERMANY       BlogparteiA Forest - A Stereotype       A Forest definitely run the unfair risk of being overlooked. Their musical mixture of souly electronica does not want to paint the town red. Instead, they create cautious, almost fragile songs on their debut album, Leaves Leaves Fall Fall Rain Fall, that get under your skin. The featured single, A Stereotype, is a perfect example for this sound which is founded on jazzy rhythms and soulful voices, especially from Fabian Schuetze. A Forest will release a new, as-yet untitled EP in March. GREECE       MouxlalouloudaFilm (featuring Hildur Krist\u00edn) - Harmur Fuglsins       Harmur Fuglsins, an atmospheric song with cinematic aesthetics that effortlessly creates images of tender, hearth-side warmth, is the bewitching outcome of a collaboration infused by the strikingly contrasting geographical and artistic backgrounds of Film and R\u00f6kkurr\u00f3&apos;s Hildur Krist\u00edn Stef\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir. Curling around an eloquently subtle arrangement armed with guitars, delicate noises, pounding drums, sombre sonic textures, melodic synth lines and electronic facets and combined with the marvelous, ethereal vocal touches of Hildur brings out its tremendous beauty with every listen. ICELAND       I Love Icelandic MusicSykur - Rocketship       First we had Sykurmolarnir, known worldwide as The Sugarcubes. Now an Icelandic electronic trio of youngsters from Reykjavik goes under the alias Sykur (&quot;Sugar&quot;). Their shows are fun-filled, sexy and energetic and they collaborate with local rappers and pop and rock singers. Rocketship, which has guest vocals from \u00datid\u00far singer Rakel Mj\u00f6ll, is taken from Sykur&apos;s debut album Fr\u00e1b\u00e6rt E\u00f0a Fr\u00e1b\u00e6rt, which was released a year ago on the Icelandic Record Records label. INDIA       IndiecisionSulk Station - Contentment       Bangalore downtempo act Sulk Station define themselves as &quot;mellowdramatic pop&quot;, a term that captures the essence of their ambient soundscapes particularly well. The young duo&apos;s minimal yet stark productions are powered by vocalist Tanvi Rao&apos;s lazy delivery. Contentment grows from a Zero 7-esque drone to a swirling dance track which wouldn&apos;t be out of place at an EDM club downtown. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarBangkutaman - Ode Buat Kota       Ode Buat Kota, which means &quot;an ode to the city&quot;, is taken from Bangkutaman&apos;s latest concept album about hard life in Jakarta - the pollution, traffic, crime, house loans, etc. Their music is influenced by The Stone Roses, The Byrds and The Mamas &amp; The Papas. They are one of the most well-respected bands in Indonesia.  IRELAND       Nialler9Kasette - You Were More       Kasette consist of a trio of school friends who formed a music partnership while on a J-1 visa in Vancouver. They have just released their debut EP entitled A Mixed Tape which showcases the girls&apos; brand of chamber folk-pop. Simple and soft, Kasette&apos;s music is in its infancy but it&apos;s already lilting and lovely. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelDesert (featuring Joakim Broden) - Lament For Soldier&apos;s Glory: Order 227       Israel is comprised of many Russian-born people, some Jewish, some not. Lament For Soldier&apos;s Glory: Order 227 by Desert taps into Russian history, describing Stalin&apos;s cruel command that any soldier captured by the enemy was considered a traitor. Its haunting melodies and driving rhythms sonically depict pain and determination. And as all of Desert served (or are still serving) in the Israeli army, they know what it means to fight for survival. Vocalist Joakim Broden of Sweden&apos;s Sabaton (Nuclear Blast Records) lends his talents to the tale of war and blood. ITALY       PolaroidSybiann - Monsoon Breath       You don&apos;t really want to know where this is going to end up. Kraut, post-rock, noise, Liars, Deerhunter... it&apos;s a scary, puzzling orgy of sounds. The amazing debut album of this young band from the town of Ravenna will fire up the imagination of anyone who has the guts to listen to it. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaMovus - Al Filo Del Origen       Movus is a five-piece band from Guadalajara. Theirs is a very cinematic post-rock sound, filled with peaks and valleys of instrumental narratives. For their second album Maxa FireKeeper (produced by Jimmy LaValle from San Diego&apos;s The Album Leaf), they were inspired by the Huichol Indians&apos; myths: Maxa is a deer that guards the mystical fire of the universe. Al Filo Del Origen (translated as &quot;at the rim of the origin&quot;) is as epic as Explosions In The Sky and as evocative as a new soundtrack to the Dr Who sci-fi series. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDaily Bread - About Birds And Bees       This raw trio from the north of the Netherlands label themselves as &quot;sexy garage dance&quot;. They&apos;re certainly sexy, glamming it up at times, banging out taut, fast, noisy grooves reminiscent of Franz Ferdinand or !!! - albeit with a female vocal on top. Particularly live, they&apos;re all about big beats, sweat and dancing. However, About Birds And Bees tunes into a summery Sixties garage-pop vibe instead. And they&apos;ve delightfully avoided any tweeness precedent by writing a deliciously poppy, organ-driven ode to the one-night stand. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatDisasteradio - No Pulse       Disasteradio is Luke Rowell&apos;s one-man synthpop outfit. No Pulse comes from his second album Charisma. With this album, Disasteradio has shifted the balance a little more on to songs rather than sounds compared to past releases. The end result is an album with vocodered vocals and a crunchy new wave feel - part Devo, part Gary Numan and part computer game. Charisma is available on Bandcamp and you can watch the video for No Pulse on YouTube. NORWAY       EardrumsYoung Dreams - Young Dreams       Young Dreams is a Bergen-based collective who make beautiful pop with equal doses of tropical flavours and Phil Spector/Brian Wilson influences. The project started in 2009 and now has as many as 10 members, including profiled musicians such as Matias Tellez and Chris Holm. Young Dreams will release two 7&quot; singles in early 2011 and their debut album is in the making. They will also perform at the upcoming by:Larm festival. PERU       SoTBThe Satellite - El Sol       The Satellite began their activities as a band in 2006 with a slight tendency towards post-rock, fusion and experimentation, using any sound that was available. In 2008, with a consolidated style, they released their second EP, 124, which contains El Sol. The band is currently composing more musical pieces and looking forward to making a debut album which they hope will come out very soon. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Emmy Curl - Seafire And Its Waltz       Emmy Curl lives in a northeast Portuguese town and has studied classic guitar in a music conservatory. However, her songwriting and singing is closer to a mix of ethereal and alternative folk than to anything classical. Imagine a blend of Lisa Germano and Suzanne Vega. She is one of a number of promising unsigned Portuguese artists and is due to have her first European tour. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseThy Veils - The KnifeChild       Daniel Dorobantu comes from Timisoara and is the mastermind behind this beautiful experimental/ambient project. A bit dark and somehow persistent, Thy Veils&apos; music is that soundtrack you always wanted for your weird dreams. And if you have trouble dreaming, visit the official site, where a slideshow of the band&apos;s videos (The KnifeChild included) will help with the visuals. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopBwani Junction - Two Bridges       You should know fairly instantly whether Edinburgh&apos;s Bwani Junction are the band you&apos;ve been waiting for when I tell you that they sound like a cross between The Libertines and Vampire Weekend. They are unsigned but, given the buzz that surrounds them, probably won&apos;t be for much longer. Two Bridges is already a singalong anthem among their rapidly increasing fanbase. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Nicholas Chim - Midnight       Nicholas Chim is a singer-songwriter who walks the thin line between being absolutely self-indulgent and giving every iota of emotion that he conveys through his music. What results is some of the most earnest songs that shine in their simplicity; yet, the complexity of his arrangements and lyrics come forth distilled and pure. Nicholas is in the middle of recording his second album, Forgiefan, but has kindly shared a contemplative, folksy offering from it entitled Midnight. He hopes you enjoy the music as much as he did writing it. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Merseystate - Jersey Girl       With a rock sound that has been compared to other stellar acts but is still uniquely their own comes Merseystate. They are the culmination of alternative rock at its best. Jersey Girl officially launched them on to the music scene last year. It&apos;s a deftly-crafted song that tugs at you then whirls into melodic pop euphoria. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKAutumn Vacation - Dreamy Even In Deception (Fooled But Dreamy)       Autumn Vacation showcases the songwriting skills of Bobby Chung - the mastermind behind former MAP artist Julia Hart - and the warm, addictive voice of Gyepy, who could previously be heard as the female vocalist of Broccoli, You Too? The duo recently put out a self-titled album full of what they hope to be perceived as thought-provoking easy listening, providing the same sense of peacefulness as strolling in a park. As lovely as anything else from the band, Dreamy Even In Deception is a light and sweet pop tune that is bound to make you crave more. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     Musikorner6pm - Letters Play       Formed in mystical Santiago de Compostela in 2003, 6pm are an electronic/indie duo that has found inspiration in ambient/shoegaze bands such as Sigur R\u00f3s, M\u00fam, Styrofoam or even The Postal Service. Letters Play, taken from their rather uknown last EP called Tape Worms, is certainly a breath of air in the Spanish ocean of indie music, where we rarely find inspiring ambient electronic tracks. 6pm are working on their sophomore album, set to be released sometime next year. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseJohan Hillblom - Sneak Preview       Sneak Preview by Johan Hillblom may be underproduced but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s amateurish. The trumpet solos are great, the odd beats cool, and Johan&apos;s crooning vocals clear and crisp. The lyrics are personal and clever without being pretentious. Examples include &quot;you should see the gallery in my cellphone, you look like an angel from every angle&quot; and &quot;once when I was drunk I accidentally poked you on Facebook, and what&apos;s worse you didn&apos;t poke back&quot;. If you are looking for the next Jens Lekman or Montt Mardi\u00e9 (or the next cast member of Glee for that matter), look no further. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Circle Brothers - Hands At The Steel       You say Nick Cave, I say Alban Ringli. Never heard of him? Alban Ringli is the singer of Swiss indie-folk outfit The Circle Brothers and he gives his two bandmates (who also happen to be his brothers) a special touch in a Nick Cave manner. They have just released their new record Love &amp; Disorder. It sounds gloomy and anxious but still has a gleam of hope. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     UNITED STATES: I Guess I&apos;m FloatingTV Girl - On Land       San Diegan dudes TV Girl know how to make one hell of a pop song. On Land is quickly becoming one of our favorites of the year, matching the earnestness of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah&apos;s debut with the hooks of MGMT&apos;s most memorable songs. Their debut EP is a free download on Bandcamp. Keep your eyes peeled for TV Girl in 2011, they&apos;re gonna dominate it. VENEZUELA     Flag of Venezuela     BarquisimentoMochuelo - La Reina Del Lugar       Venezuelan rock band Mochuelo are known for their electronic sounds and all of the members pour their influences into one unique concept. Their guitar distorsions, contagious rhythms and sweet female vocals saw this band walk away with first prize in the 2005 New Bands Festival. La Reina Del Lugar is from their second album, Un Tanto Mas.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDaily Bread - About Birds And Bees       This raw trio from the north of the Netherlands label themselves as &quot;sexy garage dance&quot;."], "title": "November's best new music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/nov/15/november-new-music-map", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Indie", "Blogging", "Media", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-16T17:06:14Z", "article": "Stung by criticism that its celebrated nightlife has been guillotined, Paris is throwing a series of parties, music events and club nights to prove the sparkle has not gone out of the City of Light.

Concerts will be held from 8pm until midnight with clubs taking over the relay from midnight until dawn. The five-day event is being sponsored by the Paris town hall and tourism groups.

Organisers of Les Nuits Capitales say Paris has been hit by noise laws, the smoking ban and a lack of transport because the Metro closes at around 2am at weekends. They also claim Paris has become a city of party-poopers. Eric Labb\u00e9, one of the organisers, told the Guardian: &quot;It&apos;s a small but very dense place with housing everywhere and this means noise is a problem for the neighbours. &quot;As a society, people are much less tolerant and very quick to use the law as the first recourse.

He came because he couldn&apos;t film in Prague; the political situation there made it impossible. Places like Czechoslovakia, and even Poland, were completely under Russia&apos;s thumb. But Yugoslavia was different: Tito had split with Stalin in 1948, and American money had flooded in. Much has changed. Watching The Trial now is like time travel. With this work, in which I overlaid stills from the film with photographs of the same locations in the present day, I wanted to comment on what is happening in Zagreb now. It was much easier to get a film off the ground here under the &quot;soft&quot; communism we had then. Now, film companies in Croatia are no longer run by the state; they have sold off the studios&apos; land, and all the places that would have served this kind of high-end production have gone digital. This particular shot has Anthony Perkins, who played Josef K, standing at the top of the stairs. When the film was made, this building was a school for workers, teaching them to read and write. It was an important, well-maintained building, but today it&apos;s a lot dirtier, and covered in graffiti. I deliberately used an archaic technique to make this shot, so that it felt linked to Welles&apos;s film-making process. I took photographs of the original film frames, and then went to the same location and took another picture from the same angle. Then I put the two negatives together, and produced another photograph. It was a complex process. No labs for processing film exist any more \u2013 the craft is dead \u2013 so I did everything myself. I constructed a lab in my studio and developed the pictures by hand. It would have been easy to do it all in Photoshop, but then the end result would have a completely different feeling. I don&apos;t want to say this is better, as each medium has its own merits, but this way worked. The image, which includes the frame, is a demonstration of how the current government treats the cultural heritage from the Communist period. The government now is mostly rightwing, and they simply don&apos;t want to deal with it. This building is associated with the Communist period, and even though it is still used by lots of people, they don&apos;t look after it. Just like much other culture of the Communist era \u2013 art and\u00a0literature, for example \u2013 it isn&apos;t considered valuable. It&apos;s a real problem. Our heritage is disappearing.

In the 1950s he played a major part in the launch and development first of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and then of the European Economic Communities. Born in Amsterdam, he was the son of Philip Kohnstamm, a professor of\u00a0theoretical physics and a colleague of Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest and other luminaries of the period who were regular visitors to the family home. Max was educated at Amsterdam University and in the US. His burning ambition for European integration was born out of traumatic personal experience during the second world war. Max, whose family was part-Jewish, was imprisoned in a\u00a0concentration camp in the Netherlands whose inmates would be regularly selected for execution in reprisals for Dutch resistance actions. During a period of internment in another camp, he met Kathleen Sillem, a young nurse of mixed Dutch and Irish background. They married clandestinely in 1944. After liberation, Queen Wilhelmina of\u00a0the Netherlands, having been told that Max was one of the brightest young intellectuals of his generation, asked him to act as her private secretary. When she heard his story, she helped organise a second, formal, wedding ceremony. It was during this period that Max met Jean Monnet, the charismatic French leader of the movement for European integration. He invited Max to join him on a visit to Germany. The destruction and impoverishment he witnessed convinced Max that Europe must break the cycle of ever more destructive wars. He joined Monnet in campaigning for the Schuman Plan (named after the then French foreign minister, Robert Schuman), which led to the creation of the ECSC. He served as first secretary of the ECSC High Authority between 1952 and 1956. In 1956 Monnet and Max launched the Action Committee for the United States of Europe, with Max becoming secretary general and then vice-president until 1975. The committee drew on a broad coalition of politicians (Max was a member of the Dutch Labour party), intellectuals, artists and young activists, who saw the creation of the common market as the first step towards &quot;an ever closer union&quot; of the states and people of\u00a0Europe, in the words of the founding Treaty of Rome in 1957. Max&apos;s fluency in French, English and German \u2013 and, later, Italian \u2013 helped him establish close personal links with politicians, writers, social reformers, academics and others convinced of\u00a0the European cause from across the continent. While calmly realistic about Britain&apos;s ambivalent role in the European Union, Max remained convinced that in the end, the British would understand that the future lay with Europe. From 1975 to 1981 he was the principal of the European University Institute in Florence. Max believed that theory should lead to practice and not substitute for it. He was frequently consulted by successive generations of\u00a0European Union leaders for advice. But his vision of the future never stopped at the borders even of a vastly expanded EU after the end of the cold war. He frequently cited the words of Monnet that European integration would itself only be &quot;a step on the road to a new global order&quot;. A modest and self-effacing man, Max remained an active participant in the fortunes and misfortunes of European integration well into old age. I personally appreciated his clarity and longterm vision when, in his 80s, he joined Stanley Crossick and myself in establishing a new, pro-European thinktank in Brussels, the European Policy Centre, where he became life president. When he retired, his home in the Belgian Ardennes was always open to visitors of all ages and backgrounds.

A million British tourists visit Amsterdam each year, but a big draw for a considerable number will vanish if the Dutch justice minister goes ahead with plans to ban foreigners from buying cannabis in the country&apos;s famous coffee shops. &quot;Of course tourists are welcome to visit the Netherlands but not only to visit the coffee shops,&quot; said the justice minister, Ivo Opstelten. &quot;In the near future, if we work out the processes, the coffee shops will not be accessible to tourists.&quot; The justice ministry confirmed the intention to implement the new coalition government&apos;s manifesto pledge within the run of the current parliament.

If they can&apos;t go to coffee shops they will buy it from Dutch people on the streets. It&apos;s bullshit.&quot; Despite the criticism there was also scepticism in the city that the ban would ever be implemented. There are more than 200 coffee shops across Amsterdam that are licensed to sell individuals a maximum of 5g of cannabis a day for personal use. But the Dutch authorities have been losing patience in recent years. In 2007 they banned those coffee shops that sell weed from also selling alcohol. Wim ven der Weegen, a spokesman for the Dutch ministry, said the famously liberal stance on soft drugs had &quot;attracted a lot of negative effects&quot;, including the coffee shops becoming a tourist attraction. &quot;What our minister said is, we should return the coffee shops back to their original purpose, that is, being a facility for the local community,&quot; he said.

It turned out I was sharing the platform with a writer on the media whom I had long admired, not least for his searching New York Review of Books essays on how the US press covered the war in Iraq \u2013 Michael Massing. I did the best I could to describe the present state of the media as I saw it. Massing was much more original. He plunged straight into the media trends of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, a period when the old spiritual and cultural order dominated by the Roman Catholic church was breaking down and a new one was struggling to emerge. With the invention of printing, books by the thousand were tumbling off the presses, and scholars were gripped by a kind of fever as they searched for new ideas about how to organise society. In tracts and treatises they furiously debated such issues as the nature of man, the powers of God, and the true path to salvation. The historian John Man puts the Gutenberg revolution like this:   &quot;Suddenly, in a historical eye-blink, scribes were redundant. One year, it took a month or two to produce a single copy of a book; the next, you could have 500 copies in a week. Hardly an aspect of life remained untouched \u2026 Gutenberg&apos;s invention made the soil from which sprang modern history, science, popular literature, the emergence of the nation-state, so much of everything by which we define modernity.&quot;  Massing is not the only writer to be fascinated by the parallels between that period and today&apos;s revolution in communication, which \u2013 in the opinion of many \u2013 is as great as that of Gutenberg. The difference today is that change is happening much faster \u2013 so fast that we are, as an industry, collectively suffering from what deep-sea divers refer to as the bends. We are travelling through a period of extreme change faster than our corporate bodies can cope with. It&apos;s painful \u2013 and, if not treated quickly and correctly, can be fatal. I want to discuss the possibility that we are living at the end of a great arc of history, which began with the invention of moveable type. There have, of course, been other transformative steps in communication during that half millennium \u2013 the invention of the telegraph, or radio and television, for instance \u2013 but essentially they were continuations of an idea of communication that involved one person speaking to many. That&apos;s not dead as an idea. But what&apos;s happening today \u2013 the mass ability to communicate with each other, without having to go through a traditional intermediary \u2013 is truly transformative. It is a change that was only imaginable by previous generations. I recently reread the formative book Culture and Society by the great literary critic and cultural historian Raymond Williams, written a little over 50 years ago. This is what he wrote in 1958:   &quot;Much of what we call communication is, necessarily, no more in itself, than transmission; that is to say, a one-way sending. Reception and response, which complete communication, depend on other factors \u2026&quot;  That is the revolutionary change we are living through today \u2013 this transformation from transmission to communication. Williams would have added another significant difference: a move from impersonal media \u2013 which was what print was \u2013 to personal. Many of us who grew up in the world of transmission face the existential question of whether we can stay in business doing transmission alone. That is the profound question that lies behind attempts to wall off, or sell, our content \u2013 or the contrary instinct to seek to embed it as centrally as possible in the new ways in which information, response and counter-response are developing. Before I discuss what this digital revolution means, I want briefly to step back and look at the effect it is having on the overall media ecology. It&apos;s always been a given that the business we journalists are in is not quite like other businesses. What it does matters too much. That&apos;s why it has sometimes rather grandly been called the fourth estate \u2013 a part of society as important as government, the courts or the church. Some would say more so. Virtually every adult over the age of 30 grew up with the idea that the fourth estate consisted of just two parts \u2013 press and broadcasting. Each was owned, financed and regulated in different ways and each gave rise to different ideas of what journalism was. The privately owned press was, in general, more opinionated, partisan, politically engaged and lightly regulated, if at all. Broadcasting \u2013 whether publicly financed or commercial \u2013 usually came with the requirement that it strove for impartiality. It had an obligation to reflect all parts of the political spectrum and special duties to cover news that, left to the market alone, wouldn&apos;t be covered. There was much to cherish in the balances and tensions inherent in this duopoly. A reader or viewer could measure the message of one medium against the other. There was the tent peg of attempted impartiality by which to measure the wild west of the printed word. But now there&apos;s a new kid on the block. A third wing to the fourth estate, if that&apos;s not too mixed a metaphor. You could even argue there are two new kids on the block \u2013 the original world wide web (essentially another form of transmission) and web 2.0, the advent and rapid maturing of so-called social, or open, media. No one owns the digital space and it is barely regulated. It brings with it an entirely new idea of what journalism is \u2013 indeed, for some, it calls into question whether there is any such distinct thing as &quot;journalism&quot;, a theme I tried to tackle in my Cudlipp lecture in January this year. This double revolution within just over 20 years is having a dramatic effect on the accepted norms and categorisations of information. We are seeing the splintering of the fourth estate. Digital is biting most fiercely on the press, if only because we have somehow to earn our own living (I will qualify that in a moment) and don&apos;t enjoy the sheltered protection of licence fees or government funding. As digital eats into the press, so the press has turned its fire on public broadcasters, imagining that if only they went away, everything in the garden would once more come out in bloom. And so the balance between these three separate ideas of journalism begins to teeter. Before looking at these digital forces in close-up I do want to touch on the tenuous nature of the present balance and ask whether the status quo can \u2013 or should \u2013 hold in its present form. We all know that digital forces are threatening to weaken, or even destroy, the traditional basis, role and funding of the press. And we know that digital enables everyone to disrupt everyone else&apos;s business. Text publishers can get into moving pictures and the broadcasters can get into text. It was only a matter of time before it would seem overwhelmingly obvious \u2013 and economically irresistible \u2013 for people to converge, consolidate and integrate. But before we rush to sweep away the differentiation that exists at the moment, just pause to consider the virtues of the present balance. Because the press is what it is \u2013 magnificently opinionated and partisan \u2013 it has pretty unfettered licence to attempt to set the narrative about its bedfellows in the media. And the dominant narrative about publicly funded broadcasting, in the UK, at least, is not a flattering one. Other than BP, Royal Bank of Scotland or the Church of Scientology, it&apos;s hard to think of a large organisation that has routinely had such a hostile press as the BBC has recently had. It&apos;s not simply its size, or the way it&apos;s run, that is criticised (sometimes with good reason), it is the very idea of public service broadcasting that is being questioned. Some have even gone as far as claiming that public funding turns public broadcasters into Orwellian merchants of propaganda; that the BBC resembles the dying embers of 1970s-style centralised, industrialised planning. That it spouts a paternalistic &quot;we-know-best&quot; view of knowledge. Whenever I feel doubts creeping in, I put aside the newspapers and look at the iPlayer \u2013 that extraordinary device for playing and replaying BBC content. There you find a richness of programming that could never be provided by any form of market funding. It is exactly what an open space of publicly available information should look like \u2013 a richness of learning about science, history, technology, parenting, business, economics, food, music, the environment, physics, religion, ethics and politics \u2013 all within one week. That&apos;s before we even get on to drama, comedy or sport. Or radio. Or the BBC&apos;s web pages, its orchestras or the World Service. Or the programmes it makes for the regions, for the hard of hearing, the partially sighted or for children. And then there&apos;s its news, with the kind of global coverage that comes from its unique network of 200 foreign correspondents. It&apos;s news of a rare quality \u2013 serious news that&apos;s inquiring and challenging; news that&apos;s balanced and fair; news that reveals things and places them in context; news that&apos;s international in scope; news that&apos;s useful, news that opens your mind and helps your understanding; news that is transparent in its ethical standards and processes of self-criticism. The BBC is still the finest news operation in the world. How does it do it? Through subsidy. Now subsidy also gets a bad press. But, in reality, few of us are in a good position to ridicule subsidy. The American essayist Walter Lippmann, in his famous 1922 book, Public Opinion, made it plain that the press could not live without the subsidy of advertising. He wrote of the reader:   &quot;Nobody thinks for a moment that he ought to pay for his newspaper \u2026 The citizen will pay for his telephone, his railroad rides, his motor car, his entertainment. But he does not pay openly for his news \u2026 He will, however, pay handsomely for the privilege of having someone read about him. He will pay directly to advertise \u2026 The public pays for the press, but only when the payment is concealed.&quot;  In the middle of all the turmoil we&apos;re living through, it&apos;s clear that the subsidy model of serious general journalism is \u2013 with one or two exceptions \u2013 the only one that actually works at the moment. That subsidy may be a trust, an oligarch, a patriarch, a billionaire, a sister company, a licence fee, an income direct from public revenue \u2026 or an advertiser. In the turbulence of the coming years \u2013 when, as the new media academic Clay Shirky puts it, the &quot;old model is breaking faster than the new stuff gets put in place&quot; \u2013 all media may come to rely on some form of medium-term subsidy. If you include advertising, then all media are members of what some like to call the &quot;subsidariat&quot;. We are fooling ourselves if we expect people to meet the real, direct cost of providing the news. But, looking forward into the eye of the unknowable digital storm, it seems to me rather reckless to propose dismantling or hobbling the one model of funding for traditional media that has any kind of predictability about it. What about the press? That the idea of public broadcasting \u2013 one of the glories of modern civilisation \u2013 could be so vigorously challenged leads to another attempt to overturn an idea that, until recently, was a given: that there should be a plurality of ownership of the main forms of media. I&apos;m not going to labour this point, because it&apos;s quite a simple one to grasp, even if it&apos;s a hard one to articulate in law. The 1949 Royal Commission on the press didn&apos;t waste more than a few paragraphs on the subject: I&apos;m guessing they didn&apos;t feel the principle needed much explanation. Indeed, it is a sign of the current turmoil that one should have to argue a case that, at any other time in history, would have seemed too obvious to make. Too great a concentration of ownership in the media has always been considered a bad idea, whether you were on the right or the left. But the revolution we&apos;re talking about is changing all that. It seems self-evident to some that a combination of fierce economic pressures and an ever greater convergence of text, data and moving pictures leads to one obvious solution: consolidation. Consolidation also brings economies of scale. If regulatory regimes can&apos;t handle that, well, get rid of the regulators, goes the argument. The economic and technological arguments are serious ones, but if they prevail we will \u2013 soon \u2013 see more and more power and influence concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The consolidators will argue that the digital space is itself part of the new plurality. And here, too, they have a point \u2013 though many would argue that we&apos;re not yet at the moment when digital has the same kind of weight as a few concentrated voices. But if it seems obvious that media plurality is not just a nice-to-have, but a vital cornerstone of democracy, shouldn&apos;t it be the starting point for the public policy debate, rather than sliding in behind the business, economic, managerial or technological arguments? In the UK the most immediate pressures are being felt in the local press, where there has already been much consolidation over the years. And, of course, most topically, there is the prospect of a merger between a wholly owned BSkyB and the four newspaper titles owned by News Corp. That would give one company control of nearly 40% of Britain&apos;s press as well as a broadcaster with nearly \u00a36bn in revenues compared with the \u00a33.5bn licence fee of the BBC. Now, I realise that even raising this question immediately translates, in the minds of some, into an argument about Rupert Murdoch. It&apos;s not. There&apos;s no one I would want to have that much power. Not the Scott Trust, not the BBC, not Arthur Sulzberger, not the moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. Not even the saintly David Attenborough. But, as it happens, the events of the past year or so, in the aftermath of revelations of phone hacking at the News of the World, do illustrate the nature of the problem. They raise questions that are not so much about the hacking, troubling as those are, but about how other forces in society \u2013 whether it is other media organisations, the police, the regulator or parliament itself \u2013 behave when faced with the muscle of a very large, very powerful and sometimes very aggressive media group, especially one that is keenly interested in exerting political influence and expressing powerful views on how media regulation should operate. Something is dangerously out of kilter when elected members of parliament confess \u2013 as they recently have \u2013 that they have held back from probing into, or criticising, one particular media company for fear of what that company might do to them. Or when that company&apos;s former employees \u2013 who know what went on and also what the company is capable of \u2013 are too frightened to speak publicly about what they know. Knowing of the chilling effect one large media company can have on public life and institutions, how could it be good public policy to allow a still greater concentration of power across not just one wing of the fourth estate, but two? You can devise all kinds of metrics of reach, engagement and come up with any number of definitions of what constitutes a market in order to justify it \u2013 and, believe me, people will \u2013 but it would still feel wrong. That&apos;s why newspapers and broadcasters in the UK have for the first time in history come together to oppose the move and why, in a recent House of Lords debate inspired by David Puttnam, virtually every speaker also lined up against it. As Lord Gavron said in the debate, this strength of feeling was not motivated by a knee-jerk prejudice against the name Murdoch. He actually praised Rupert Murdoch from personal knowledge as being &quot;straight, loyal and honourable&quot;. But he warned that, if the government allowed this deal through, &quot;we could end up with a Russian oligarch, an Arab prince, or a hedge fund billionaire&quot; in a similar position of control. And now to the third sphere, the one that&apos;s causing all the trouble. The digital space is \u2013 without going into complex arguments about net neutrality \u2013 owned and regulated by no one. So it is a very different type of medium from the two I&apos;ve discussed so far. It&apos;s developing so fast, we forget how new it all is. It&apos;s totally understandable that those of us with at least one leg in traditional media should be impatient to understand the business model that will enable us magically to transform ourselves into digital businesses and continue to earn the revenues we enjoyed before the invention of the web, never mind the bewildering disruption of web 2.0. But first we have to understand what we&apos;re up against. It is constantly surprising to me how people in positions of influence in the media find it difficult to look outside the frame of their own medium and look at what this animal called social, or open, media does. How it currently behaves, what it is capable of doing in the future. On one level there is no great mystery about web 2.0. It&apos;s about the fact that other people like doing what we journalists do. We like creating things \u2013 words, pictures, films, graphics \u2013 and publishing them. So, it turns out, does everyone else. For 500 years since Gutenberg they couldn&apos;t; now they can. In fact, they can do much more than we ever could. All this has happened in the blink of an eye. That&apos;s one problem \u2013 the rapidity of the revolution, the bends \u2013 and the other is that we journalists find it difficult to look at what&apos;s happening around us and relate it to what we have historically done. Most of these digital upstarts don&apos;t look like media companies. EBay? It buys and sells stuff. Amazon? The same. TripAdvisor? It&apos;s flogging holidays. Facebook? It&apos;s where teenagers post all the stuff that will make them unemployable later in life. If that&apos;s all we see when we look at those websites then we&apos;re missing the picture. Very early on I forced all senior Guardian editors on to Facebook to understand for themselves how these new ways of creativity and connection worked. EBay can teach us how to handle the kind of reputational and identity issues we&apos;re all coming to terms with our readers. Amazon or TripAdvisor can reveal the power of peer review. We should understand what Tumblr or Flipboard or Twitter are all about \u2013 social media so new they&apos;re not even yet Hollywood blockbusters. I&apos;ve lost count of the times people \u2013 including a surprising number of colleagues in media companies \u2013 roll their eyes at the mention of Twitter. &quot;No time for it,&quot; they say. &quot;Inane stuff about what twits are having for breakfast. Nothing to do with the news business.&quot; Well, yes and no. Inanity \u2013 yes, sure, plenty of it. But saying that Twitter has got nothing to do with the news business is about as misguided as you could be. Here, off the top of my head, are 15 things that Twitter does rather effectively and which should be of the deepest interest to anyone involved in the media at any level. 1. It&apos;s an amazing form of distribution It&apos;s a highly effective way of spreading ideas, information and content. Don&apos;t be distracted by the 140-character limit. A lot of the best tweets are links. It&apos;s instantaneous. Its reach can be immensely far and wide. Why does this matter? Because we do distribution too. We&apos;re now competing with a medium that can do many things incomparably faster than we can. It&apos;s back to the battle between scribes and movable type. That matters in journalistic terms. And, if you&apos;re trying to charge for content, it matters in business terms. The life expectancy of much exclusive information can now be measured in minutes, if not in seconds. That has profound implications for our economic model, never mind the journalism. 2. It&apos;s where things happen first Not all things. News organisations still break lots of news. But, increasingly, news happens first on Twitter. If you&apos;re a regular Twitter user, even if you&apos;re in the news business and have access to the wires, the chances are that you&apos;ll check out many rumours of breaking news on Twitter first. There are millions of human monitors out there who will pick up on the smallest things and who have the same instincts as the agencies \u2013 to be the first with the news. As more people join, the better it will get. 3. As a search engine, it rivals Google Many people still don&apos;t quite understand that Twitter is, in some respects, better than Google in finding stuff out. Google is limited to using algorithms to ferret out information in the unlikeliest hidden corners of the web. Twitter goes one stage further \u2013 harnessing the mass capabilities of human intelligence to the power of millions in order to find information that is new, valuable, relevant or entertaining. 4. It&apos;s a formidable aggregation tool You set Twitter to search out information on any subject you want and it will often bring you the best information there is. It becomes your personalised news feed. If you are following the most interesting people they will in all likelihood bring you the most interesting information. In other words, it&apos;s not simply you searching. You can sit back and let other people you admire or respect go out searching and gathering for you. Again, no news organisation could possibly aim to match, or beat, the combined power of all those worker bees collecting information and disseminating it. 5. It&apos;s a great reporting tool Many of the best reporters are now habitually using Twitter as an aid to finding information. This can be simple requests for knowledge that other people already know, have to hand, or can easily find. The so-called wisdom of crowds comes into play: the &quot;they know more than we do&quot; theory. Or you&apos;re simply in a hurry and know that someone out there will know the answer quickly. Or it can be reporters using Twitter to find witnesses to specific events \u2013 people who were in the right place at the right time, but would otherwise be hard to find. 6. It&apos;s a fantastic form of marketing You&apos;ve written your piece or blog. You may well have involved others in the researching of it. Now you can let them all know it&apos;s there, so that they come to your site. You alert your community of followers. In marketing speak, it drives traffic and it drives engagement. If they like what they read they&apos;ll tell others about it. If they really like it, it will, as they say, &quot;go viral&quot;. I only have 18,500 followers. But if I get retweeted by one of our columnists, Charlie Brooker, I reach a further 200,000. If Guardian Technology picks it up it goes to an audience of 1.6 million. If Stephen Fry notices it, it&apos;s global. 7. It&apos;s a series of common conversations Or it can be. As well as reading what you&apos;ve written and spreading the word, people can respond. They can agree or disagree or denounce it. They can blog elsewhere and link to it. There&apos;s nothing worse than writing or broadcasting something to no reaction at all. With Twitter you get an instant reaction. It&apos;s not transmission, it&apos;s communication. It&apos;s the ability to share and discuss with scores, or hundreds, or thousands of people in real time. Twitter can be fragmented. It can be the opposite of fragmentation. It&apos;s a parallel universe of common conversations. 8. It&apos;s more diverse Traditional media allowed a few voices in. Twitter allows anyone. 9. It changes the tone of writing A good conversation involves listening as well as talking. You will want to listen as well as talk. You will want to engage and be entertaining. There is, obviously, more brevity on Twitter. There&apos;s more humour. More mixing of comment with fact. It&apos;s more personal. The elevated platform on which journalists sometimes liked to think they were sitting is kicked away on Twitter. Journalists are fast learners. They start writing differently. Talking of which \u2026 10. It&apos;s a level playing field A recognised &quot;name&quot; may initially attract followers in reasonable numbers. But if they have nothing interesting to say they will talk into an empty room. The energy in Twitter gathers around people who can say things crisply and entertainingly, even though they may be &quot;unknown&quot;. They may speak to a small audience, but if they say interesting things they may well be republished numerous times and the exponential pace of those re-transmissions can, in time, dwarf the audience of the so-called big names. Shock news: sometimes the people formerly known as readers can write snappier headlines and copy than journalists can. 11. It has different news values People on Twitter quite often have an entirely different sense of what is and what isn&apos;t news. What seems obvious to journalists in terms of the choices we make is quite often markedly different from how others see it \u2013 both in terms of the things we choose to cover and the things we ignore. The power of tens of thousands of people articulating those different choices can wash back into newsrooms and affect what editors choose to cover. We can ignore that, of course. But should we? 12. It has a long attention span The opposite is usually argued \u2013 that Twitter is simply an instant, highly condensed stream of consciousness. The perfect medium for goldfish. But set your TweetDeck to follow a particular keyword or issue or subject and you may well find that the attention span of Twitter users puts newspapers to shame. They will be ferreting out and aggregating information on the issues that concern them long after the caravan of professional journalists has moved on. 13. It creates communities Or, rather, communities form themselves around particular issues, people, events, artefacts, cultures, ideas, subjects or geographies. They may be temporary communities or long-terms ones, strong ones or weak ones. But they are recognisably communities. 14. It changes notions of authority Instead of waiting to receive the &quot;expert&quot; opinions of others \u2013 mostly us journalists \u2013 Twitter shifts the balance to so-called &quot;peer to peer&quot; authority. It&apos;s not that Twitterers ignore what we say \u2013 on the contrary (see distribution and marketing, above) they are becoming our most effective transmitters and responders. But, equally, we kid ourselves if we think there isn&apos;t another force in play here \u2013 that a 21-year-old student is quite likely to be more drawn to the opinions and preferences of people who look and talk like her. Or a 31-year-old mother of young toddlers. Or a 41-year-old bloke passionate about politics and the rock music of his youth. 15. It is an agent of change As this ability of people to combine around issues and to articulate them grows, so it will have increasing effect on people in authority. Companies are already learning to respect, even fear, the power of collaborative media. Increasingly, social media will challenge conventional politics and, for instance, the laws relating to expression and speech. Now you could write a further list of things that are irritating about the way people use Twitter. It&apos;s not good at complexity \u2013 though it can link to complexity. It can be frustratingly reductive. It doesn&apos;t do what investigative reporters or war correspondents do. It doesn&apos;t, of itself, verify facts. It can be distracting, indiscriminate and overwhelming. Moreover, I&apos;m simply using Twitter as one example of the power of open, or social, media. Twitter may go the way of other, now forgotten, flashes in the digital pan. The downside of Twitter also means that the full weight of the world&apos;s attention can fall on a single unstable piece of information. But we can be sure that the motivating idea behind these forms of open media isn&apos;t going away and that, if we are blind to their capabilities, we will be making a very serious mistake, both in terms of our journalism and the economics of our business. We can now glimpse better what Raymond Williams was anticipating when he wrote about what he thought of as true communication 60 odd years ago. For him it meant what he called &quot;active reception and living response&quot;. For that to exist, he thought, you needed &quot;an effective community of experience&quot; and a &quot;recognition of practical equality&quot;. Indeed, Williams thought we couldn&apos;t survive as a common culture without such a mechanism. Of course, social media is not enough on its own. I&apos;m not in any way trying to elevate it above traditional media. We should be pleased, not resentful, that Twitter is in some measure parasitical \u2013 that many of the referrals and links take people to so-called legacy-media companies, who still invest in original reporting, who still confront authority, find things out, give context and explain. But I do believe we should be relentless in learning all we can about how people are using this post-Gutenberg ability to create and share \u2013 and import those lessons back into our own journalism and businesses. It&apos;s not about all rushing to be on Twitter. We can make our own media collaborative and open, too. Distribution, breaking news and aggregation? At the Guardian and Observer we have more than 450 people on Twitter, together with 70 different single-subject sites or section feeds. Our journalists are out there, reaching a different audience from the core Guardian readership, seeking help, ideas, feedback, joining in the common conversations. Reporters use open media as a way of finding sources, communities and audiences. The notion of a story \u2013 with a finite starting and finishing point \u2013 is changing. Liveblogging can bring audiences of millions around specific events. Linking allows you to place your journalism at the heart of issues, news and information. Instead of trying to write everything ourselves we&apos;re increasingly a platform as well as a publisher. It started with Comment is free in 2006. Soon our cultural coverage will be just as open and collaborative. We&apos;ve done it with our network of environmental and science blogs: traffic on the former has risen by 800% since the start of the year. We benefit from expert content and increased audiences. They share the revenue. We can trace the beginnings of a virtuous circle. We harness readers in our shoe-leather investigations, whether it&apos;s hunting down tax avoidance; or tracing people who may have digital records of police assaults; or enlisting 27,000 readers to sift through 400,000 records of MPs&apos; expenses; or alerting readers to super-injunctions that stop us telling them things. Guess what? The readers love to be involved. They, too, like being critics, commentators and photographers. They love helping to defeat injunctions and being asked to share their particular knowledge or pool their expertise. You harbour a feeling that some of the stuff they create is poor? I agree. Let&apos;s learn from eBay about reputations, ranking and identity. We&apos;re experimenting with open data and open APIs. We want to experiment distributing our content to where the audiences are \u2013 preferably with advertising attached. Some of the more radical ideas will work, some won&apos;t. But a failure to experiment is more dangerous than trying new things. This open and collaborative future for journalism \u2013 I have tried the word &quot;mutualised&quot; to describe something of the flavour of the relationship this new journalism has with our readers and sources and advertisers \u2013 is already looking different from the journalism that went before. The more we can involve others the more they will be engaged participants in the future, rather than observers or, worse, former readers. That&apos;s not theory. It&apos;s working now. And, yes, we&apos;ll charge for some of this \u2013 as we have in the past \u2013 while keeping the majority of it open. My commercial colleagues at the Guardian firmly believe that our mutualised approach is opening up options for making money, not closing them down. I won&apos;t criticise people who want to try a different path. You can&apos;t preach plurality and argue for a single model of journalism or against attempts to find alternative ways of financing what we do. I&apos;ve always argued it&apos;s a good thing that different organisations are trying different routes to the future. And the models that are currently emerging are very different. Our web traffic last month averaged just over 2 million unique browsers a day. One independent company which measured the Times&apos;s UK web audience during September found that their web traffic \u2013 not including iPad apps \u2013 had fallen by 98% as people progressed past the paywall. More sophisticated analysts than me calculate that the content behind the paywall is therefore generating a total global audience of about 54,000 a month, of whom about 28,000 are paying for the digital content (the remainder being print subscribers).  That&apos;s not a criticism of the Times: that path may well make sense for how they see the future. The jury on the relative financial models for different approaches will remain out for a while yet. But these comparative figures point to completely different ideas of scale, reach, audience, engagement, ambition\u2026 and of journalism itself. So that is a very brief tour around this splintered fourth estate. I suspect we would never invent the BBC today \u2013 the spirit of the age is against it. The issues about plurality are complex. When things are threatening to disintegrate it needs the greatest wisdom to know how and when to intervene both to enable change while preserving what&apos;s precious \u2013 or, more than that, necessary. As for digital, I am with the utopians \u2013 fully aware that some see that as a term of abuse. To quote one blogger, the social web is not really about the end of what came before, but the starting point for what comes next: richer and more complex societies. I am sometimes giddy with the possibilities new technologies offer us for being better journalists: for reaching even larger audiences; for having more influence; for being embedded in the most astonishing network of information the world has ever seen or could ever have imagined. As with the early 16th century, it&apos;s our privilege, as a generation, not only to imagine the future of information, but to take the first steps on the road to recrafting the ways in which it is created and spread.

The artist Wassily Kandinsky tried to re-create the visual equivalent of a symphony in each of his paintings. And Vladimir Nabokov wrote, &quot;One hears a sound but recollects a hue, invisible the hands that touch your heartstrings. / Not music the reverberations within; they are of light. / Sounds that are colored, and enigmatic sonnet addressed to you.&quot;  All had synaesthesia, a harmless neurological condition in which activity in one sensory modality, such as vision or hearing, evokes automatic and involuntary perceptual experiences in another, due to increased cross-talk between the sensory pathways in the brain.  &quot;It&apos;s generally agreed that there&apos;s cross-activation, so that activity in sensory area A will activate area B,&quot; says David Eagleman of the Baylor College of Medicine, &quot;but we don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s due to a difference in wiring or in the chemical cocktail.&quot; Eagleman chaired a symposium at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego earlier this week, in which he and others presented the latest findings about the condition. Once thought to be extremely rare, synaesthesia is now believed to affect between 1 and 4% of the population. Several years ago, Eagleman and his colleagues set up a website, containing a battery of tests to objectively verify synaesthetic experiences, and to date more that 9,000 synaesthetes have registered on the site. Self-reports on the website reveal that there are over 100 different forms of synaesthesia, and these can be clustered into 5 main groups. In the most common form of the condition, letters, numbers and units of time such as weeks and months evoke the experience of colour; in others, sounds evoke smells, tastes or sensations of touch; in yet others, pain, touch, temperature, orgasms and emotions evoke colours.  Some synaesthetes taste shapes or the textures of objects on their tongue, while others, with the recently described mirror-touch synaesthesia, experience tactile sensations when they observe others being touched.  Synaesthetes can be broadly divided into two groups. &quot;Projector&quot; synaesthetes experience these cross-activated perceptions in the external world, whereas &quot;associators&quot;, experience them only in the mind&apos;s eye. And there are two main hypotheses to explain the neural basis of this increased sensory cross-talk. According to one, there is increased connectivity between normally distinct sensory pathways, because of greater neuronal outgrowth during brain development, or because exuberant connections were not properly &quot;pruned&quot;. According to the other, the sensory cross-talk occurs because of a lack of proper inhibition.  That synaesthesia can be induced by drugs such as LSD, and that synaesthetic experiences can wax and wane with, for example, changes in mood, suggests a role for inhibitory processes mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA, but the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and there is also evidence for the other.  Romke Rouw of the University of Amsterdam described experiments showing structural differences between the brains of synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes. Using a technique called diffusion tensor imaging, Rouw and her colleagues have shown that some synaesthetes have increased connectivity between adjacent regions on the ventral surface (or underside) of the temporal lobe, areas which are involved in processing texture, colour and form. Rouw&apos;s group has also shown that some synaesthetes exhibit increased activation in the superior parietal cortex, which is known to contain neurons that integrate different types of sensory information. Using another neuroimaging technique called voxel-based morphometry, they also found that some synaesthetes have increased grey matter volume in this region, and that associators, but not projectors, have more grey matter in the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory. Danko Nikoli\u0107 of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt pointed out that concepts can trigger synaesthetic experiences too. For example, grapheme-colour synaesthetes experience the colours associated with the number 7 when presented with 5 + 2. The same letter can also evoke different synaesthetic experiences according to its context \u2013 the grapheme &quot;0&quot;, for example, evokes one colour when presented in a sequence of letters and another when presented in a sequence of numbers.  Nikoli\u0107 even described two professional swimmers for whom different swimming styles evoke different colours. So in some synaesthetes, concepts and meanings also give rise to concrete perceptual experiences. Nikoli\u0107suggests that this should be thought of as &quot;ideaesthesia&quot;, or sensing ideas. Studying synaesthesia can teach us about how sensory systems normally work, but they may also tell us something about the processes underlying sensory disturbances. According to Michael Banissy of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience in London, nearly one third of amputees report mirror-touch sensations in their missing limbs. He has also shown that mirror-touch synaesthetes outperform non-synaesthetes in facial recognition tasks, because they appear to be more empathetic.  One focus of Eagleman&apos;s synaesthesia research is what he called &quot;perceptual genomics&quot;, or the identification of genes involved in the condition. He says it&apos;s possible that hundreds of genes are involved, and that these are likely to encode proteins with diverse functions, from GABA channels that mediate inhibitory neurotranismission, to axon guidance molecules involved in the initial wiring the brain. They have already identified a hotspot on chromosome 16, which seems to harbour a number of genes involved in synaesthesia.  &quot;There are 300 genes in the hotspot,&quot; says Steffi Tomson, a graduate student in Eagleman&apos;s lab who is involved in the gene hunt. &quot;100 of those are expressed in the brain, and we&apos;re focusing on those.&quot; And the fact that synaesthesia runs in families will help to identify the genes involved. &quot;Now we&apos;re selecting more families,&quot; Tomson adds, &quot;and have just submitted two synaesthetes for full exome sequencing. We&apos;re also going to look at the neural networks involved in synaesthesia, to try to understand how they are organised.&quot; Mo Costandi writes the Neurophilosophy blog", "sentences": ["Romke Rouw of the University of Amsterdam described experiments showing structural differences between the brains of synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes."], "title": "Synaesthesia - crossovers in the senses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/nov/19/synaesthesia-cross-overs-senses", "tags": ["Neuroscience", "Science", "Health", "Biology", "Genetics", "Biochemistry and molecular biology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-20T00:06:26Z", "article": "THE WINNER Saline solution Would the air taste salty?

It&apos;s not every day you find yourself in a building made completely out of sodium chloride, unless you happen to be on the world&apos;s largest salt flat. Bolivia is split down the centre by the gigantic Altiplano plateau, where the Salar de Uyuni, a thick crust of pure white salt, stretches in every direction to the horizon. With so much salt lying around, and so many tourists flocking to see it, some entrepreneurial genius decided to combine the two and make a salt hotel.     How's your room? Tasty \u2026 Alex's girlfriend Holly at the salt hotel    Despite strict rules against licking the construction, I felt compelled to test the validity of the Hatullcha Salt Hotel and found it to be satisfactorily salty. The walls are made with solid bricks cut from the depths of the salt crust and stuck together with a salt-based cement. Our beds, chairs and tables were all chipped into icy-looking blocks, too. I was slightly disappointed that the windows and toilets weren&apos;t also made of salt, but I suppose that wouldn&apos;t be entirely practical. The overall effect is, strangely, remarkably festive; it&apos;s easy to mistake all the whiteness for snow, and the sub-zero temperatures complete the effect. Somewhat inevitably, our dinner conversation centred around plans to build a rival pepper palace, with options to expand into the herb hotel sector with buildings made entirely out of coriander and parsley \u2013 all to be taken with a pinch of salt, of course. Take away the novelty factor and the salt hotel is actually a pretty grim place. Besides licking the walls, there&apos;s not a lot to do there apart from shiver, eat and sleep, none of which is particularly comfortable or pleasant. The real attraction, of course, is the location. Salar de Uyuni is stunning, and totally surreal. It is a place without perspective, where speed, time and distance seemingly cease to exist. You can drive for an hour without any perceptible change in the landscape, and without knowing how far you have gone. It is like nowhere else on earth.

The 10oz rib eye was fine \u2013 not without flavour, not tough, served medium rare, as asked. Likewise the service, by a nice Hungarian chap, was good. I worry he&apos;s wasted there. But that good steak set everything else into relief. A starter sharing platter with rings of deep-fried calamari appeared to have all the texture and flavour of surgical support\u00a0hose. A bolus of breaded chicken breast was desperate and dry, skewers of prawns simply odd. Spare ribs were the colour of an old lady&apos;s velour sofa and edible, in the sense that I ate them.

We had one glass of wine and one dessert and ran up a bill of more than \u00a390. Even the rib eye, in my opinion, doesn&apos;t make that acceptable. The New York strip was dense, flavourless and unrested. Why import your beef all the way from Argentina \u2013 feel the carbon footprint \u2013 simply to do this to it? Worse were the b\u00e9arnaise and peppercorn sauces, which were possibly the nastiest things I&apos;ve put in my mouth since a game of truth or dare at college (don&apos;t ask). We must assume they made them from scratch, which makes the fact they tasted like they had been reconstituted from powder all the more remarkable. The peppercorn sauce, in particular, was vile. It looked like the sort of thing you might extract from a long-untended wound. You could achieve the effect of their onion rings at home by opening a bag from the freezer. Chips, unforgivably, were lukewarm and flaccid. A lemon meringue pie had cold, soggy pastry. I have long wondered how these places stay in business.

After he&apos;d managed to get his first manuscript accepted by Fischer, a prestigious German publishing house, just before his 23rd birthday, it was promptly pulped a year later. That was 1934: Keilson&apos;s Das Leben Geht Weiter (&quot;Life Goes On&quot;) was his publisher&apos;s last novel by a Jewish author before the Nuremberg race laws came into effect. After the war, he enjoyed a brief revival. In 1962 his second novel, The Death of the Adversary, was a bestseller in the US; Time nominated it as one of its top 10 books of the year. The other authors on that list \u2013 Borges, Faulkner, Nabokov and Roth among them \u2013 later piled on Nobel Prizes and Pulitzers, but Keilson sank into obscurity once more. Obscurity, that is, until 2007, when translator Damion Searls chanced on a copy of his third book, Kom\u00f6die in Moll, in a bargain bin outside a bookshop in Austria, and embarked on a campaign to get it back into print. This year, just 77 years after his debut, Keilson is finally breaking into the international market. His works are currently being translated into nine languages, and Searls&apos;s translation of Comedy in a Minor Key, written in 1947, is about to come out in Britain for the first time. In August, the book was reviewed by novelist Francine Prose in the New York Times, who concluded at the end of her first paragraph (&quot;for busy, harried and distractible readers who have the time and energy only to skim the opening paragraph of a review&quot;) that the book was a masterpiece and its author &quot;a genius&quot;. Keilson will be 101 years old next month. Life goes on, indeed. When we meet, on an extremely windy November morning in his house in a village outside Amsterdam, he&apos;s animated, quick-witted, and just a little cagey about his renaissance. &quot;I thought that review was a bit extreme, don&apos;t you think? When I first read it, I thought: &apos;Is that really me?&apos;&quot; So does he think he&apos;s a genius or not? &quot;I&apos;m not even a proper writer!&quot; he shoots back. Then, after a moment&apos;s pause: &quot;Slowly, perhaps, there&apos;s a change happening inside me. Maybe I did manage to produce something which goes beyond the everyday. It&apos;s not unusual for works of literature to be rediscovered decades after they were written. But the odd thing with my situation is that I am still alive while that&apos;s happening.&quot; Born a German Jew near the Polish border in 1909, the son of a textile merchant who had been awarded the Iron Cross in the First World War, Keilson has a biography that is also a history of Europe&apos;s catastrophic start to the 20th\u00a0century. His memory of the years between the wars is vivid, though there are gaps and the occasional mix-up: &quot;The backpack is full,&quot; he explains, which sounds like a bad translation of a Dutch proverb but turns out to be original Keilson, meaning that you can&apos;t add any new impression without chucking out an old one. He has a crystal-clear picture of his first brush with the nationalism that was about to grip the country. At school he read out a poem by the satirical Jewish poet Heinrich Heine (first line: &quot;When I think of Germany at night/thoughts of sleep are put to flight&quot;). Convinced that a Jew ought not to feel so ambivalent about the Fatherland, one of his classmates stood up and said: &quot;The body of students rejects discussion of his poem. It fouls its own nest.&quot; In 1935 he showed his first wife, a trained graphologist, Hitler&apos;s signature. &quot;That man is going to set the world on fire,&quot; she said. Both she and his publisher were urging him to leave Germany, but Keilson tried to muddle through for a while. Having trained as a doctor but now unable to practise, he worked as a sports teacher and a swimming instructor \u2013 ironically one of the reasons why he has managed to outlive many of his tormentors of the time. Even today, he does basic exercises on his walking frame, though he regrets that he might struggle to finish the Berlin to Potsdam relay run in which he used to compete in his prime. In 1936 he and his wife fled to Holland, where Keilson got himself a fake passport and lived in hiding a few doors down from his wife, who gave birth to a daughter from an invisible father in 1941. Comedy in a Minor Key is dedicated to Leo and Suus Rientsma, the couple who sheltered Keilson, and the experiences it describes are partly autobiographical. Wim and Marie, a normal Dutch couple in their 20s, have taken in a Jewish former perfume salesman, who lives in a secret room in their attic. One day, the man falls ill with pneumonia and dies.\u00a0 If the storyline sounds familiar \u2013 Comedy in a Minor Key was first published in 1947, the same year as Anne Frank&apos;s Diary \u2013 the tone is not. Keilson is less interested in the grand historical sweep of events \u2013 crucially, the refugee doesn&apos;t end up in Auschwitz \u2013 and more concerned with quiet, everyday moments: blacking out windows, and the social awkwardness of this enforced intimacy. It&apos;s funnier than we think a book on this subject ought to be, and brilliantly captures the black humour of Wim and Marie&apos;s situation: how do you get rid of the corpse of a person who isn&apos;t supposed to exist? When Marie tells her sister-in-law about the man in their attic, it&apos;s a classic case of keeping up with the Joneses. &quot;One? I&apos;d take two or four! Just not three together, that&apos;s bad in arguments and so on. It&apos;s always two against one. By the way, you don&apos;t have anyone else waiting in the wings, do you? I need to take in another three soon.&quot; When the book is sad, it&apos;s never so in a manipulative way. At one point Wim and Marie have to go into hiding themselves, in what seems to be an old people&apos;s home. The question they might ask themselves is: are they going to stay here until they turn as grey and withered as their co-inhabitants? In many ways Comedy in a Minor Key isn&apos;t a book about the horrors of the Second World War, but a book about the very precise fear of seeing your youth drastically curtailed.\u00a0 It&apos;s also a really good read: a tightly structured book with sharp plot twists. The only thing that slightly confused me while reading it was how nice everyone was. Neighbours, relatives, postmen: everyone seems to be fighting on the right side, against the Nazis. I caught myself secretly hoping for the arrival of the jackbooted villain. &quot;But that&apos;s Holland for you,&quot; Keilson says. &quot;Of course there were Nazis in my village, two whole families of them on my street alone. But I had a lot of friends who helped me. And I knew that I could rely on them.&quot; What was it about the cultural climate in Holland exactly that produced such a different sort of person to Germany at that point in history? &quot;The Dutch are self-critical. They have the critical instincts of a good tradesman. They ask themselves: how much is that going to cost me? The Germans were different then. It&apos;s incredible to think that they gave enough power to a petit bourgeois that he could start a world war without asking themselves what would happen if the whole plan went awry.&quot; After Keilson had been in hiding for a month, his hosts asked him to join the Vrije Groepen Amsterdam, a resistance movement operating from the city&apos;s university. They equipped Keilson with an even better fake ID \u2013 checked over by the Amsterdam police \u2013 and he spent the rest of the war travelling around Holland by train, helping to arrange housing for refugee children, and using his medical training to help them deal with the shock of leaving their families. After the war he remained in the Netherlands, requalified as a doctor and became a psychoanalyst. He later used his wartime experiences in his dissertation Sequential Traumatisation of Children, the first systematic study of young people who suffered persecution by the Nazis. I express my disappointment that the touchy-feely Dutch resistance movement sounds less glamorous than their trigger-happy French equivalent. &quot;I could never handle guns, so armed struggle was out of the question for me. But what we did was its own type of anti-Nazi propaganda \u2013 because in Holland you simply don&apos;t deal with children in the way the Nazis did. Goebbels killed his own children \u2013 I never heard of anything like that happening in the Netherlands.&quot; Tragically, the trauma of parental loss eventually became a much more personal subject. His relief at the end of the war was overshadowed by the death of his parents, whom he had persuaded to join him in Holland in 1939. They had refused to go into hiding and were eventually caught and transported to Westerbork concentration camp. &quot;I was convinced they would let them stay there because of my father&apos;s Iron Cross.&quot; Only after the end of the war did he find out that they had both died in Auschwitz. Keilson&apos;s feelings about his part in their fate are difficult to pin down. Talking to him, you sense that his responsibility still troubles and pains him, but also that he has accepted it as something that is going to be part of his life until the end. &quot;You can&apos;t delete that sadness,&quot; he says. &quot;And I won&apos;t delete it.&quot; He explains further by pointing me to the title of his novella. &quot;Music is always written in a major and a minor key: they need each other to make the right sound. It&apos;s the same with sadness and happiness. The Germans produced such great music, but they didn&apos;t get their head around that bit. I am not going to blame Angela Merkel for that, though. Hatred might have been a natural reaction to my parents&apos; death, but I have learnt that hatred only leads to self-destruction.&quot; In The Death of the Adversary, the more philosophical of Keilson&apos;s novels, an anecdote relayed to the narrator reiterates that point. The tsar of Russia has given his nephew, the German kaiser, a herd of majestic elks as a present. The kaiser fences off a large area of woodland for the animals, but after only a short time one elk after the other is found dead, without any apparent signs of an attack. A vet is called to investigate. Reporting back to his royal leader, he confirms that the climate is perfect for the animals, the grass fresh and the water in the area unspoiled. &quot;So why are they dying?&quot; the kaiser asks. &quot;Because they are missing one thing,&quot; the vet replies, &quot;the wolves.&quot; It&apos;s easy to see why Keilson struggled to find a publisher for the book in Germany or Israel in the 1960s: the Holocaust survivor who could &quot;see the other side of the story&quot; doesn&apos;t really fit the narrative. As Keilson&apos;s second wife Marita Keilson-Lauritz, a retired literary historian, comes in to collect our coffee cups, I can&apos;t deny I am feeling a little unsettled by this utterly level-headed centenarian. You expect doctors to be analytical and selfless, but when it comes from someone in\u00a0 such a notoriously narcissistic profession as novel writing, it catches you unawares. &quot;Does he never lose his patience?&quot; I ask Marita a few days later on the phone. &quot;Does he never get angry with the weather, or your noisy neighbours, or the zip on his jacket?&quot; &quot;Of course he does,&quot; she laughs. &quot;He&apos;s no saint. It&apos;s precisely because he knows that that he finds it easier to understand other people&apos;s flaws and excesses.&quot; When I get up to say goodbye, I spot a\u00a0chunky trophy on a side table. Marita helpfully explains that it is the German newspaper Die Welt&apos;s annual literary prize, which Keilson won in 2008, a year before Philip Roth, two before Claude Lanzmann. &quot;Did I really win that thing?&quot; Keilson mumbles behind our backs. His wife rolls her eyes, and for a second I worry his memory has let him down, until I detect an impish smile on their lips. I remember the young twentysomething couple in Comedy in a Minor Key and wonder if Hans Keilson is really turning 101 this year or whether he&apos;s just finally enjoying the youth and success that was denied to him in the 1930s.  Comedy in a Minor Key by Hans Keilson (Hesperus, \u00a39.99) is published on 26 November", "sentences": ["When we meet, on an extremely windy November morning in his house in a village outside Amsterdam, he&apos;s animated, quick-witted, and just a little cagey about his renaissance.", "It&apos;s incredible to think that they gave enough power to a petit bourgeois that he could start a world war without asking themselves what would happen if the whole plan went awry.&quot; After Keilson had been in hiding for a month, his hosts asked him to join the Vrije Groepen Amsterdam, a resistance movement operating from the city&apos;s university.", "They equipped Keilson with an even better fake ID \u2013 checked over by the Amsterdam police \u2013 and he spent the rest of the war travelling around Holland by train, helping to arrange housing for refugee children, and using his medical training to help them deal with the shock of leaving their families."], "title": "Hans Keilson interview: \"Genius?

The world looked on in awe. A year later Bolt did it again, becoming the first to better 9.6 when he set the world record of 9.58. His athletic feats led many of the world&apos;s most distinguished scientists to ponder just how fast a human can possibly run. Some are already sure of the limits. In 2008 the French Institute of Sport concluded that athletics world records would hit a ceiling in the year 2060. The Institute analysed all 3,260 world records set since the first modern Olympics in 1896 and found that, while athletes were performing at 75% of their potential in 1896, in 2008 they were functioning at 99%. Others looked more closely at Bolt&apos;s potential. A scientific paper produced by Cornell University analysed the Jamaican&apos;s Beijing run of 9.69 in which he famously slowed down to celebrate his victory. Had he not done so, the scientists believe, he could have won in 9.55sec. They went on to predict that Bolt was capable of breaking the 9.5 barrier. Another study by Mark Denny of Stanford University claimed that the absolute limit for any sprinter would be 9.48. Bolt himself, despite a year plagued by injury, says he would like to set an unbeatable mark before he retires. &quot;I&apos;m hoping I get to be the one to get to 9.4 because that&apos;s where I think the record will probably never be beaten. I think it will stop at 9.4 \u2013 but you never know.&quot; They are all wrong, according to one of the world&apos;s leading experts in the field. Frans Bosch, professor of biomechanics and motor learning at Fontys University in the Netherlands and a specialist in athletic performance, is one of the speakers at a groundbreaking conference in London this week. He believes that many predictions, often based on statistical calculations, are fundamentally flawed. &quot;As long as nobody knows the limiting factor in sprinting, then a prediction in that area makes no sense,&quot; says Bosch. &quot;If you look at all the predictions that have been made so far, they&apos;re all based on one small aspect of sprinting. When you only look at that you lose perspective.&quot; Bosch discusses the various theories, among them the assertion that sprinters&apos; muscles will simply break down if pushed to their limits or that the brain is the decisive factor but is unable to process the signals fast enough. His own interest lies in the role that shock absorbers play in the movement stability of a sprinter. There is a great deal more to learn, says Bosch \u2013 a point on which many more scientists agree. &quot;It&apos;s very early stages in understanding,&quot; he says. &quot;It could be many, many years still before we know more. If you look at a very important development in science over the last 15 years called dynamic systems theory and complex theory, we have learned that the answers to our questions are actually further away than ever before. We&apos;re probably not getting closer to the answer, we&apos;re just getting closer to asking the right questions.&quot; Bosch uses the example of a BBC documentary in which the 400m world record holder Michael Johnson analyses Bolt&apos;s 9.58sec world-record run and points out his technical flaws in running \u2013 losing power by moving too much from side to side. &quot;It could easily be that, if he corrects it [in the way that Johnson suggests], he could be slower,&quot; Bosch says. &quot;You usually see if someone has a poor sprinting technique because he&apos;s rocking to the side of his stand leg. So, if you have your left foot on the ground, then you&apos;re rocking to the left \u2026 that&apos;s been perceived as a flaw in technique. But with Usain Bolt it&apos;s the opposite. When his left foot is on the ground he&apos;s rocking to his right, when his right foot is on the ground he&apos;s rocking to his left. And if you look carefully at why this is happening it&apos;s because he&apos;s capable of producing forces on the ground much quicker than somebody else just because he&apos;s rocking.&quot; So Johnson&apos;s theory is wrong? &quot;Yes, exactly. They don&apos;t know why Bolt&apos;s doing that and he [Bolt] doesn&apos;t know it himself.&quot; Bosch believes that sprinting is so complex, and so variable in each individual, that &quot;nobody, not even Michael Johnson, can calculate or tell or explain what the ideal technique for the body of Usain Bolt would be.&quot; While the world is wowed by Bolt&apos;s achievements, Bosch views the French sprinter Christophe Lemaitre as an equally fascinating model for study \u2013 not, as most observers point out, because of his white skin but because of his body type which, like Bolt&apos;s, is long and lean. &quot;Lemaitre is interesting because he&apos;s not strong at all, his physical capabilities are absolutely moderate \u2013 he clean and jerks 60kg and snatches 45kg [in the gym], which is almost at a recreational level. But what you see now more than before is sprinters like Bolt or Lemaitre, who are not as strength-based as the Ben Johnsons of this world, and are very tall. Maybe another body composition is emerging that is even more suited for reaching these tremendous speeds.&quot; Even tiny genetic details within the human body can explain certain capabilities. Using a virtual model of a human body at the University of Amsterdam, scientists found that the point at which muscles are attached to the human skeleton can affect its performance. &quot;They calculated a vertical jump, looking at what the influence was of the calf muscle, and they found it had no influence whatsoever of the jumping height,&quot; Bosch says. &quot;Then they changed the lever of the calf muscle at the knee joint by about 2mm and they found it had a massive influence. It&apos;s only now science is beginning to model and calculate these things.&quot; Dr Eddie Coyle, a professor at the University of Texas, is a specialist in the physiological factors that limit human endurance in sport and has worked with the cyclist Lance Armstrong for many years. He, too, will speak at the three-day UKSEM conference (UK Sport and Exercise Medicine) at which dozens of the world&apos;s leading experts in exercise, nutrition and human performance will present papers. After Haile Gebrselassie ran the marathon in 2hr 3min 59sec in 2008 there was renewed speculation over whether anyone could run the distance in under two hours. Coyle is confident it is possible. &quot;Science says that we can predict a two-hour marathon and I think people have the ability, eventually, to run about 1hr 58min,&quot; Coyle says. &quot;The two most important factors are how economical the runners are, how much energy they expend while they&apos;re running. The very best runners expend 30% less energy than an average runner. We don&apos;t know what that is due to. Some people think it&apos;s because they have less mass in their lower legs. That takes less energy. We don&apos;t really have any other credible theories \u2026 but it&apos;s unlikely there&apos;s one factor. Another factor is their ability to consume oxygen at higher rates while producing very little lactic acid.&quot; Coyle says the 1:58 mark is based on the data and research available at the moment but, if there was more information to work with, that time could be reduced further still. Gebrselassie, 37, is unlikely to be the man to take on that challenge but Coyle has earmarked another runner who could: Sammy Wanjiru, the Olympic marathon champion in 2008. &quot;It was hot in Beijing and he still ran close to two hours,&quot; says Coyle of the Kenyan&apos;s Olympic record time of 2:06:32, almost three minutes faster than the previous best set in 1984. &quot;That&apos;s a pretty impressive time for such oppressive conditions and he was so young at the time, only 21, which means he&apos;s got time to improve still.&quot; Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, believes that human nature will continue to confound sports scientists by throwing up unpredictable variables. &quot;People say Bolt&apos;s a freak. Actually he&apos;s not. Look at the history of athletics, of people defying expectations. &quot;Tiger Woods redefined the expectations of golf, so now we have golfers doing gymwork to become more powerful. Martina Navratilova, when she came along, was seen as a freak. She played such aggressive tennis, no one had ever seen a woman play like that before. Again she rewrote the script so that we then had Steffi Graf and the Williams sisters. Now when I look back at Navratilova playing it doesn&apos;t look at all strange to me but at the time it was a real &apos;wow&apos; moment. Just as those athletes have done, the rules will continue to be rewritten throughout this century and we will continue to be surprised. The human element will always defy sports scientists.&quot; For details of the UK Sport and Exercise Medicine conference, visit uksem.org", "sentences": ["Using a virtual model of a human body at the University of Amsterdam, scientists found that the point at which muscles are attached to the human skeleton can affect its performance."], "title": "Hold on to your hats: scientists do not know how fast people can run", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/21/athletics-world-records", "tags": ["Athletics", "Usain Bolt", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-11-23T23:26:00Z", "article": "The Scottish FA has set a Thursday deadline to avert a refereeing strike, before they implement a contingency plan that involves parachuting officials in from other countries.

The contingency plan has met with its own troubles, though; Icelandic referees have said they will not step into any breach, with cool initial responses also received from Wales and Ireland. &quot;We will support our colleagues in Scotland,&quot; said the Icelandic referee Kristinn Jakobsson. &quot;The referees all around the world is one team, so I think we are going on the same line.&quot; Regan moved to distance himself from any suggestion that referees could be forced to declare allegiances to any one team when taking up officiating. The move had received provisional backing from the Celtic chairman, John Reid. &quot;Comments like that aren&apos;t particularly helpful,&quot; Regan added. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult to justify why you would ask somebody to do that. We are hopeful that talks will be fruitful this week and they can officiate at matches at the weekend. We are hopeful that we can come to a satisfactory conclusion. &quot;It [the strike] appears to be about making a stand and withdrawing labour for the weekend but we are hopeful that, if we can give them assurances about support going forward, we can get them to rescind that decision.&quot; The implementation of a referees&apos; charter, with rules laid down for both clubs and officials, could form part of that action. Regan refused directly to implicate Celtic, who have been involved in an ongoing battle with officialdom, in the current row. He did, though, point to wider factors in this controversy. &quot;Clearly there are sectarian issues at play,&quot; Regan said. &quot;I think that&apos;s something that has been around for a long time and its naive to think that can be removed overnight.

STADIUM PIPE DREAMS (2) Last week we looked at ambitious stadium plans that failed to get off the ground and as ever you&apos;ve been in touch with some more prime examples. &quot;In the mid-1980s Amsterdam developed ideas and ambitions to stage the 1992 Olympic Games in the city,&quot; writes Johan van Slooten. &quot;The heart of Amsterdam&apos;s Olympic park would be a large new Olympic stadium which could also facilitate Ajax Amsterdam (who were in desperate need of a bigger stadium at the time). It was a rather unusual design: the stadium resembled a huge football cut in half which is held by two giant hands. &quot;Although Amsterdam didn&apos;t get the Games, the plans for the stadium weren&apos;t shelved and were even officially presented in 1987 (a year after Amsterdam was denied the Games). In the end, Amsterdam found the plan to be too ambitious and instead went for the rather conservative design for what is now known as the Amsterdam ArenA.&quot; Though not on the scale of the Dutch giants, one idea &quot;floated&quot; for Cambridge United this year is certainly equally eccentric. &quot;For ambitious stadium ideas, you have to go a long way to beat the fabulous Cambridge United floating Stadium which was suggested in June this year,&quot; writes Steve Radcliffe. In 1995 the then Luton chairman unveiled plans for the \u00a330m Kohler Dome, a 20,000-capacity stadium with a fixed roof but a retractable pitch by junction 10 of the M1. Despite receiving planning consent, the Kohler Dome never came to fruition (and plans for a retractable pitch at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry were also ditched). Plans for the Hatters to build a stadium, announced in 2007, have been put on the back burner. And we might now have been watching the first season of Premier League football at Blackpool&apos;s swanky International Colosseum Stadium had plans of the mid-90s got off the ground in the north-west. The stadium \u2013 planned along similar lines to the Toronro Skydome \u2013 would have had a retractable roof but instead it is good old Bloomfield Road that remains home to the Tangerines. SPOT-KICK SPECIALISTS &quot;After watching Sligo Rovers&apos;s Ciaran Kelly save all four penalties in the FAI Cup final shoot-out against Shamrock Rovers on Sunday,&quot; began Tom Welby last week, &quot;I wondered which keeper has saved the most consecutive spot-kicks?&quot; Kelly&apos;s superb shot-stopping (the third in particular is a fantastic save ) was matched by Helmuth Duckadam in the 1986 European Cup final when the Romanian saved all four of Barcelona&apos;s penalties in the shoot-out, but we cannot find anyone who has managed to save all five. And while we are talking about penalty shoot-outs, it is worth mentioning Brentford&apos;s Richard Lee. In 11 appearances this season he has racked up four shoot-outs (those four coming in his first six appearances of the season). Has any goalkeeper taken part in more in a single season, never mind 11 games? Send your answers to the usual address KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Has there ever been an instance where a fan gave his jersey to a player before or during a game because the kit man forgot to pack a spare?&quot; asked Niall Kiernan in 2006. The answer to this question of sartorial silliness is ... yes. The first to take a step down the catwalk of shame was the former Bolton midfielder Djibril Diawara. After he was called up late to Sam Allardyce&apos;s squad to face Arsenal in September 2001, the knickers of the kit man Russell Byrne-Fraser went all-a-twist as, inexplicably, the kit had been sent the day before without Diawara&apos;s jersey. Byrne-Fraser rustled up a replacement shirt by swapping a training top with Bolton fan Lee Houghton at Arsenal tube station. After name and number were ironed on at the Arsenal club shop, it all ended happily when Diawara came on as a substitute. &quot;When I took the shirt off I was holding in my beer belly to see if they wanted me to go the whole hog and sit on the bench,&quot; said Lee. &quot;I don&apos;t know what size Diawara is but I&apos;m 14st and my shirt looked tight on him.&quot; Tracey Hunt, a baker from Salisbury, was another unlikely saviour, coming to the, ahem, knead of Bournemouth in 1999, when an SOS was sent out to supporters on a coach heading to Notts County. The kit manager Bernie Morton had packed two shirts for the striker Steve Fletcher but none for his midfield namesake Carl. Tracey gladly handed over her top, to which the appropriate lettering was added, not that it helped much: the Cherries lost 5-1, with Carl Fletcher substituted at half-time. Before a game at Hearts, the Dundee kit man forgot to pack Gavin Rae&apos;s shirt, as Mike Gallacher explains. &quot;The kit guy wandered over to the Dundee end and asked if anyone could lend a top. He was given one by a girl (who must have been a bit on the husky side) \u2013 problem solved. Rae&apos;s only complaint was the girl had obviously gone overboard with the perfume and he was getting funny looks from the Jambo players.&quot; Other strip sagas where players had to turn to the fans include the Brondby defender Soren Colding, as Nikolaj Steen Moller explains. &quot;He had no jersey for the game against B93 in 1998 so a fan with &apos;Colding 14&apos; on the back of a current-style shirt was found in the crowd.&quot; And Alan Kimble was caught shirtless on Wimbledon&apos;s trip to Derby in 1997, forcing the kit man to borrow one from a travelling fan. The blank kit, with no name or number, did not stop the referee Uriah Rennie booking him for a foul, before, to cap things off, the game was abandoned after 57 minutes due to floodlight failure.

With the recent end of season shenanigans in F1 where four contenders could statistically win the title in the last game of the season,&quot; begins Paul Baker, &quot;I was wondering which league had the most amount of teams fighting for the championship on the final day? And conversely, which league has had the most amount of teams fighting relegation on the last day?&quot; &quot;In the South Africa-USA friendly last Wednesday, the teenage striker Juan Agudelo scored the winning goal for the USA,&quot; notes Jim Goloboy. &quot;Agudelo has made only a couple of appearances at senior club level and hasn&apos;t scored.

Last month, Thomson was the referee who was forced to abandon the Italy v Serbia European qualifier after seven minutes due to mayhem on the terraces. On Tuesday night in the Amsterdam Arena he must have thought he was in calmer waters as Real Madrid comfortably scored four goals to no reply against Ajax in the Champions League, yet with the clock on 85 minutes Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s team proved otherwise. Briefly, Real contrived to have two men dismissed for second yellows in the last five minutes of the game, conveniently forcing them to miss the last, meaningless group game against Auxerre but be ready with a clean slate when the competition resumes again after Christmas. If you missed this priceless bit of low cunning and dubious drama, simply search for Xabi Alonso red card or Sergio Ramos red card and judge for yourself whether the two endlessly hesitant takers of restarts knew what they were doing. With five minutes to go Alonso takes an eternity to launch a free kick from his own half, stopping at least twice on the run up then each time going back to take a longer one. With Ajax players complaining bitterly, the referee eventually comes across to produce the necessary second yellow and order him off. Then, in the 90th minute, no less, Ramos takes a goal kick instead of the goalkeeper and is similarly tardy, clearly to the annoyance of the Ajax captain. The Ajax captain happens to be Luis Su\u00e1rez, that well known Uruguayan pillar of fair play, the one who gained notoriety in South Africa by keeping out a goal-bound shot with his hands then celebrating as Ghana&apos;s Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent last-minute penalty. Su\u00e1rez has also just been dubbed &quot;the cannibal of Ajax&quot; by the Dutch press, fined by his own club and could be banned for seven matches by the Dutch Football Federation after biting an opponent on the shoulder in the last league game against PSV, but never mind that for now. Su\u00e1rez complains furiously about Ramos&apos;s unsporting behaviour, and even though the result is certain and the game is in its dying seconds, the referee decides he has a point and shows the Real defender red. To complete the pantomime, Ramos shakes Thomson&apos;s hand before leaving the pitch, Mourinho jumps up in his technical area and begins reorganising his troops as if he has just lost a key player with the game scoreless and an hour still to play, and afterwards, naturally, everyone from Madrid denies that there was any kind of pre-arranged plan. So what should happen now? Before considering that, let us return to what happened on the night, and see if anything else could or should have been done differently. It is easy to say that Thomson should have seen through the ruse, but even if he did, what alternative action could he have taken? Leaving aside considerations of premeditation and convenience, he was confronted by two clear examples of unsporting behaviour, timewasting, and reluctance to restart the game. Maybe, to make the official&apos;s job easier, the Ajax players and spectators ought not to have complained but fallen about laughing instead, indicating that now the result was beyond them they couldn&apos;t care less how long it took Real to restart. Maybe, but football doesn&apos;t really work like that, and neither do referees have a remit for such lenience. Their chief consideration at such times is to get the game restarted as quickly as possible \u2013 otherwise players would undoubtedly start re-tying their bootlaces or changing their shin-pads before taking free kicks \u2013 and regardless of whether he knew what Real&apos;s timewasters were up to Thomson had little choice but to observe the normal rule book. Uefa now have a choice over whether to take any further action or sweep the matter under their capacious carpet. They probably ought not to do anything retrospectively, since any wrongdoing on the part of Alonso and Ramos would, even if proven, amount only to exploitation of an obvious and long-standing loophole in the rules as they presently stand. Plenty of other players have done the same. They could consider bringing in an umbrella charge for the future, that of bringing the game into disrepute, which carries a two- or three-match suspension, in the hope that such a threat would dissuade players from skulduggery. Perhaps something even more clever could be dreamed up. Dead rubbers could be excluded for suspension purposes, for example, or players warned in advance of these foreseeable and fairly regularly occurring situations that anything resembling a deliberate booking would count double. Or maybe Uefa should simply ignore the fuss and carry on. It is not, after all, as if a major injustice has been perpetrated. Nothing comparable to what Su\u00e1rez got away with in Soccer City in July. While one could feel a bit sorry for the referee in Amsterdam, sympathy was limited for the Ajax captain, and it is hard to cast Mourinho and his players as villains. Perhaps when you have qualified with a couple of games to spare, then taken a 4-0 lead away from home in your penultimate group match, you have earned the right to bend the rules a little.

One of his startups was sold to Microsoft and became what is now known as Microsoft CRM, but his focus now is on games that don&apos;t seem to be games - such as the ReCaptcha project created by Luis von Ahn, in which humans filling in a CAPTCHA are also contributing to the computer-aided scanning of old printed books and articles. The company itself is only a few months old, but Ravenet is insistent that Dublin is the place he wants the company to be \u2013 &quot;we&apos;ve looked at all sorts of countries, we&apos;ve lived in Paris and Amsterdam&quot; \u2013 and that it is hiding its expertise in online gaming under a bushel. Among the games Ravenet is developing is one called &quot;Charity Ball&quot;, to raise awareness of cystic fibrosis by a combination of teamwork, locatlon-based checkins, vouchers linked to restaurants, and information about the disease. He also thinks that we don&apos;t use the best computers in the world \u2013 the human brain \u2013 quite enough to tackle online problems, relying instead on brute horsepower instead of the subtle capabilities of our neurons... \u2022 What&apos;s your pitch? &quot;We create social games with the purpose of accomplishing work while people are having fun. Luis von Ahn is our deity \u2013 200m people use ReCaptcha to metatag data every day. Games get used for everything from protein identification to spotting solar flares.&quot; \u2022 What makes your business or product unique? &quot;We&apos;ve been working together for 20 years, and we&apos;ve created and sold a lot of technology companies.&quot; \u2022 What&apos;s your background? &quot;We built the Microsoft CRM \u2013 the division that acquired us merged with Great Plains. We were turning providing computer support for customers into a game. That was 2002. We were based in Washington DC when Microsoft bought us, so we went to Redmond, then we made it back over the wall and out after [an earn-out period of] three years. We were used to working in a small group of about 30 people. We&apos;ve sold stuff to Raytheon, we&apos;ve done top secret software development work for the Pentagon. We&apos;re library experts, so we&apos;ve built software libraries for the NSA and the Los Angeles Times.&quot; [I haven&apos;t yet been able to independently verify the claims about Raytheon or the NSA - CA.] &quot;We moved to Europe after spending a year sailing around the world. We were living in Paris. Some of the possibilities in games excited us. Take [the infectious bacterium] MRSA. Hospitals are spending millions trying to get people and especially doctors to scrub properly, but they couldn&apos;t get people to wash their hands as often as they needed to. We turned it into a game with a handprint, and all of a sudden we got senior surgeons who wouldn&apos;t before taking real care to clean their hands.&quot; \u2022 Who in the tech business inspires you? Louis: &quot;Luis von Ahn.&quot; Steve McLelland: &quot;Rovio [makers of Angry Birds].&quot; Louis: Also gwap.com and Houthoff Buruma] a Dutch company, which created a game for law firms where it put people into fictional scenarios for mergers and acquisitions to find out which recruits were the best at it.&quot; \u2022 What&apos;s your biggest achievement? &quot;Realising that instead of having a complete set of specialisms before starting development, that the problem is so new that we can plan it as we go along. So we have developed a platform which incorporates what we have learnt so far. We think that a game might have a three- to six-month lifespan, and then where do we go from here? We developed it to solve that problem. So we can use an idea to teach people in China about the health risks of using communal chopsticks, for example.&quot; \u2022 What&apos;s your biggest challenge? &quot;Pulling the talent together. It takes a special type of individual to buy into a startup that isn&apos;t looking to just flip itself to the first buyer that comes along.

He&apos;s doing things that are intuitive for people to do. It&apos;s the whole Google model, of getting people to tell us what matters and what doesn&apos;t, rather than relying on complex algorithms and indexing. Our plan is to start knowledge games so that we can take tasks that are insanely complex for machines and make non-tasks by giving them to humans to do in a way that people enjoy doing. It&apos;s the really complex things that you need done, the sensory information, that computers have such problems with. We don&apos;t get insight through linear processing [by computers]. We need to step ourside the implied solutions.&quot; \u2022 What&apos;s an example of a &quot;non-game game&quot;? &quot;Google Images has something where you get users to enter more information about an image: first you get an image of a flower and you enter some detail about it \u2013 it&apos;s a flower \u2013 and then some more \u2013 it&apos;s a tulip \u2013 and then some more - it&apos;s a Dutch tulip.

I put my foot through the screen. After Coronation Street, what do you do for an encore? I had a drink while I thought about it, and one turned into a million.&quot; In the early 1970s, he was also buying morphine from a &quot;bent&quot; chemist. &quot;I used to have hugely upset tummies and in those days you could buy preparations with a quantity of morphine in them. &quot;I soon discovered it settled not just my tummy but the cold, lonely, aching place inside, too.&quot; He finally stopped in 1981. Warren, who blames those days in part on his &quot;addictive personality&quot;, wonders how he kept going. &quot;How I managed to survive the bad years of the drinking and the drugs, I have no idea,&quot; he says. He almost didn&apos;t. After contracting toxic hepatitis in the late 1970s, Warren was given three months to live. He says it was only the appearance of what he thought was a guardian angel while he was ill that made him stop drinking. Now 73, Warren works as a consultant on Coronation Street, the show he was desperate to see made as a young staff writer at Granada. So much did he want audiences to hear his tales of an ordinary northern street, told in northern voices, that Warren hopped on to the top of his boss&apos;s filing cabinet and refused to leave until he was allowed to pitch the show.

Its success is partly attributed to Warren&apos;s ear for dialogue, particularly in women such as Sharples, Elsie Tanner, Hilda Ogden, Betty Turpin and Bet Lynch. At the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in the summer, Warren told of how he used to sit under his grandmother&apos;s table as a child, listening to the grownups, honing his writer&apos;s ear and &quot;pondering&quot;. &quot;I was the outsider \u2013 but, you see, the outsider sees more, the outsider hears more, the outsider has to do that to survive.

But the bomb was a fake and had been provided to Mohamud as part of a long-term sting by undercover FBI agents. &quot;The threat was very real,&quot; Arthur Balizan, a senior FBI agent in Oregon, told Reuters. &quot;Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale.&quot; &quot;This defendant&apos;s chilling determination is a stark reminder that there are people even here in Oregon who are determined to kill Americans,&quot; US attorney Dwight Holton said. &quot;We have no reason to believe there is any continuing threat arising from this case.&quot; Officials said Mohamud had been in contact with an unnamed individual believed to be in north-west Pakistan and involved in terrorist activities.

Van Persie, who suffered the injury at Blackburn Rovers at the end of August, was passed fit at the beginning of this month but his return to the Arsenal team has been muted. In the six matches for which he has been\u00a0available he has appeared in only two, as a substitute, against Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 his total game time has been 54 minutes \u2013 and last week Wenger left him behind in London when the squad travelled to Portugal for the Champions League group game against Braga. The manager wanted him to work on his fitness, which he did, but the fact that Van Persie spent further time wearing a protective boot on his left foot indicated that the club&apos;s medical staff were not entirely convinced that the injury had healed. Van\u00a0Persie was an unused substitute in the 4-2 win at Aston Villa on Saturday. The 27-year-old has made one other appearance this month, which is something of a moot point at Arsenal. He played in the second-half of Holland&apos;s 1-0 friendly victory over Turkey in Amsterdam on 17\u00a0November, setting up the goal for Klaas\u2011Jan Huntelaar. Wenger was furious with the Holland coach, Bert van Marwijk, for naming Van\u00a0Persie in his provisional squad, insisting that he was not fully fit and fearing the potential for the player to suffer a set back if he featured. Wenger&apos;s stance did soften as Van\u00a0Marwijk finalised his squad and the game approached, largely because Van\u00a0Persie had come on against Newcastle on 7\u00a0November, and the two managers reached what he suggested was a beneficial agreement for all parties in that Van\u00a0Persie would play for only 45 minutes. After the game, Van\u00a0Persie described the situation as &quot;win-win&quot;. The forward said: &quot;Everything went according to plan. The training that I&apos;ve had with the Dutch team, I have not had at Arsenal.&quot; Wenger, though, is no fan of international football, particularly not friendlies, and Van\u00a0Persie&apos;s desire to play for his country, having failed to complete a full match at club level all season, may have grated. Wigan&apos;s visit offers the opportunity for Van\u00a0Persie to blow away the cobwebs, and show not just his manager but the Arsenal support that he could yet be their trump card as the season heads towards its turn. As Wenger has been quick to stress, Arsenal are only two points off the Premier League&apos;s summit and are a home win over the Group H whipping boys Partizan Belgrade away from the Champions League&apos;s last 16. &quot;Robin will certainly play, yes, but I haven&apos;t decided my starting line-up yet,&quot; Wenger said. &quot;Theo Walcott and Nicklas Bendtner will be involved but I don&apos;t want to give the team out. The only thing I can\u00a0promise is that we will take the game\u00a0seriously.&quot; Wenger was asked whether Van\u00a0Persie&apos;s selection would necessitate a change of style as he was a different type of striker to Marouane Chamakh, who has played so\u00a0far this season. &quot;Yes, a little bit,&quot; Wenger\u00a0replied. &quot;Robin can play on his own up front and he can play in behind so I\u00a0will have to think about that overnight.&quot; Wenger will be without the centre-half S\u00e9bastien Squillaci, who has a knee problem but, remarkably, Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 is back in the squad. The Ivorian was taken from the pitch on a stretcher against Braga last Tuesday with damage to a medial knee ligament and Wenger said that he would be out for &quot;four weeks minimum&quot; and possibly up to six. He remained firm in that conviction on Thursday but Ebou\u00e9 has now turned out to be fine. &quot;When we made the scan,&quot; Wenger said, &quot;his knee was swollen but the ligament was intact and the tests were successful.&quot; As he has done so far in this season&apos;s Carling Cup, Wenger will field a strong starting XI, and it could mean disappointment for the Mexico forward Carlos Vela who, according to his brother, may soon begin to consider his future at Emirates Stadium. &quot;He just wants the chance to show what he can do for Arsenal and maybe if that doesn&apos;t happen, he will think about his future,&quot; said Alejandro Vela, who plays for the Mexican side\u00a0Cruz Azul. &quot;Important clubs are interested in his services.

When icy conditions take hold, it&apos;s tempting to give art criticism a winter twist and take a look at the vividly white worlds created by great painters in the past. But when you peer into one of Avercamp&apos;s ice fairs, what are you really seeing? Much as we celebrate this week&apos;s cold conditions in Britain as picturesque and fun, this is obviously only one side of the story. What can ice and snow really have been like in Europe 400 years ago? There was no heating except fires; no cars to keep travellers warm; no modern winterwear. So why do the skaters and fairgoers in Avercamp&apos;s paintings seem so happy? Is he just a purveyor of cosy fictions? You could argue that paintings like his are literally meant to be heartwarming. When he pictures people slipping and sliding on a glassy smooth pond in front of a mansion among snow-covered houses and black winter trees, perhaps what he is doing is giving his beholders the resolution and verve to make the best of weather that might otherwise get them down. Think of the homely pleasures of winter, his paintings seem to say, and ignore its harshness. Avercamp was painting in a tradition that included Pieter Bruegel the Elder&apos;s great snow scenes. But he himself added to and intensified that tradition, making winter his life&apos;s work as an artist. A new book published by Yale University Press argues that Hendrick Avercamp in fact created the ice fair genre as a type of entertaining picture (as opposed to Bruegel&apos;s more complex use of snow and ice). This Amsterdam-born artist was born deaf-mute, and you can picture him standing apart from the crowd, observing it unnoticed. His paintings are in fact suspended between joy and stillness: the fast-moving figures skate and sledge under iron and silver skies. It&apos;s like seeing a little world enclosed in a bottle. Of course, there is a generic, composed artifice to these paintings, but a reality too: he made open-air watercolour drawings of real places that inform his finished paintings. Holding ambiguities in balance \u2013 the cold and the exotic fun of winter, say \u2013 might be what art is for. A work of art exists to say more than one thing: if everything were simple, there would be no need for art. The mute of Kampen (de Stomme van Kampen) is at one and the same time a liar and a truth-teller.

The company has reported a 9% rise in full-year profits, helped by a growing contribution from its education business which is less exposed to discretionary spending. Its holiday breaks business is seeing fluctuations in demand, but is benefiting from theatre trips to shows like the Lion King and Wicked. In the camping business it believes it can extend the life of its mobile-home fleet by around two years, benefiting its medium-term cashflow. It said current trading was in line with expectations, although the outlook was challenging. Sales so far this financial year \u2013 which started in October \u2013 are down 1%. Meanwhile, to boost its education business further, it has agreed to pay \u00a330.9m for a 50% stake in German student and school-tour specialist Meininger. It has the option to buy the rest over the next two to three years. Chief executive Martin Davies said:  Our goal is to become the leading brand in the European trip market, covering all the major destinations such as Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Milan. This transaction takes us a step closer to that goal.  Holidaybreak&apos;s shares have climbed 11p to 281p, and Mark Brumby at Langton Capital said:  The &apos;outlook for 2011 remains challenging&apos;, but the group has better visibility (with regard to educational trips) than do most operators and remains well-placed to prosper.   Commenting on the German deal, Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said:  The acquisition of Meininger demonstrates the scale of the opportunity in education and management&apos;s ability to source compelling investment opportunities. In this respect the deal could be transformational and prove to be the catalyst for a substantial re-rating.

For example? In an Amsterdam airport, misdirected urine in the gents was reduced by 80% by painting a housefly on the porcelain that users could aim at. Small intervention, big change.

Joris Luyendijk had his crisis early \u2013 when he was 31, to be precise. He was Middle East correspondent for the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad, was widely admired, had just covered the Gulf war . . . and he packed it all in to write a book. A book that sought to demonstrate that it was almost impossible for a journalist to say anything worthwhile about the Middle East, where societies are closed, sources are often in the pay of the secret service, and western media lack the patience to get to grips with &quot;the Arab world&quot;, a term he in any case rejects. That book, published in the Netherlands in 2006 and in the UK last year with the title Hello Everybody!, is a punchy dissection of the way the media operates, and shows how easy it is for governments to manipulate information. He argues that journalists did a poor job after 9/11, failing to admit it was impossible to gauge support for al-Qaida among ordinary Muslims and failing, too, to explore the roots of anger with the west. He also says the Israelis&apos; media savvy makes it easy for them to win the propaganda war with the Palestinians, and that in the Gulf war &quot;the authoritative Anglosphere media adopted the perspective of the American PR machine&quot;. Hello Everybody! is not a piece of agitprop. It&apos;s an insider&apos;s guide to the impossibility of seeing the whole picture, of getting inside the houses \u2013 and the minds \u2013 of those living on the &quot;Arab street&quot;. And Luyendijk, who did a PhD in anthropology in Cairo, speaks Arabic \u2013 or at least the urban slang that passes for Arabic in Egypt&apos;s capital. Plenty of Middle East correspondents don&apos;t. Their bosses&apos; knowledge of the region is even more limited: one of his editors told him to hasten to Iran, where his Arabic would come in useful (only 1% of the population speak Arabic). Middle East dictatorship and western media dumbness make a potent mix, hopelessly biased against understanding. But now back home in the Netherlands and calling himself a &quot;meta-journalist&quot; \u2013 a term, he says, that is guaranteed to empty rooms \u2013 he thinks he may be edging towards a solution. This should be worth hearing. &quot;What will you have? I spent a long time in the Middle East and have to offer you something,&quot; Luyendijk says when I arrive at his office, slap bang in the middle of Amsterdam&apos;s red light district. He disappears and comes back a few minutes later with a perfectly executed espresso. He shares a floor of a three-storey building with a group of freelance writers and designers \u2013 &quot;it&apos;s like a newsroom, but without the hierarchy,&quot; he tells me. He retains an arm&apos;s length relationship with NRC Handelsblad, but the success of Hello Everybody! has bought him freedom. He hosted a chatshow on Dutch TV in 2006/7 that burnished his celebrity status, has just completed a stint as professor of journalism at the University of Tilburg, and a few days before we met had launched his latest book, which he describes as &quot;an anthropological survey of the political class in Holland&quot;. Add his good looks, angular cheekbones and spiky, close-cropped hair to this burgeoning portfolio career, and I think I&apos;m starting to dislike him as much as the politicians, lobbyists, PR people and journalists skewered in his new book. His main focus over the last couple of years, however, has not been the book, but an attempt to develop a new way of doing journalism. One legacy of his time in the Middle East was a belief that oil added to the problems of the region, fostering autocracy, corruption and an arms race. He is also interested in sustainability, so started a weekly column on electric cars in NRC Handelsblad. &quot;I talked to lots of people, but instead of doing the research and then sharing my conclusions with my readers, I tried to share the journey,&quot; he says. &quot;I started at zero. I knew nothing about electric cars, but they seemed great, so I began an experiment to see if you could seduce readers to go along with your curiosity, rather than saying from a pedestal: &apos;This is the truth about the electric car.&apos;&quot; At the outset, he wanted to test whether it would be a good idea for NRC Handelsblad to be distributed solely by electric cars. &quot;There&apos;s no neutral position for a paper when it comes to sustainability,&quot; he says. &quot;Either you pollute or you don&apos;t.&quot; He says a weekly column proved the perfect vehicle for the experiment. &quot;I was not subject to the competition of the newsroom, where I would have to inflate my stories to get them into the paper. If I&apos;d done an interview and it was hopelessly boring and the PR person tried to inflate it, I would write about the attempts of the PR person to inflate it, rather than go along with the inflation.&quot; The column was called &quot;Starts with himself&quot; \u2013 perhaps it trips off the tongue better in Dutch. &quot;If you improve the world, you have to start with yourself,&quot; he says. &quot;Our idea was sustainability is always boring, but what if it&apos;s not about making the world sustainable, but making yourself sustainable? Then you become the protagonist in your own story, and you write about the obstacles in your way to becoming sustainable.&quot; The main obstacle being yourself. The columns were a big success \u2013 even the boring ones \u2013 and built up a loyal following, but he pulled the plug after 18 months and before he had reached the end of the journey, when he had planned \u2013 if the conclusion was that electric cars were a good thing \u2013 to ask his readers for \u20ac100 each to buy a fleet of them for the paper. NRC Handelsblad was being sold and it all became too bureaucratic and complicated. But rather than abandon all the material and contacts he had gathered, he got in touch with a software company that specialised in staging internet dialogues between experts and building &quot;mind maps&quot; to establish areas of consensus between them. Suddenly, he saw a new way of doing journalism: instead of a journalist talking to half a dozen &quot;experts&quot; holding a range of opinions and trying to come to a reasonable conclusion based on what they say, he would let them talk to each other and allow conclusions to emerge organically. He thought this would be a way to see the whole picture, and could be applied to many areas beyond the relatively restricted one of electric cars. &quot;On climate change,&quot; he explains, &quot;you get all these assertions, but never a consensus. This is a way of establishing what people agree about and where there are areas of meaningful disagreement. If you bring in lots of people, you can filter out the biased stuff.&quot; The wisdom of crowds \u2013 as opposed to the individual perspectives of the usual suspects who get invited to opine by the media; and the idea of information as an ocean rather than a series of rivulets.     Luyendijk\u2019s belief that oil fuelled the troubles of the Middle East was the starting point for his new journalism. Photograph: Kamal Akrayi/EPA    His electric car project is now heading for a new life \u2013 on the internet, where it will be the first of what he hopes will be a series of &quot;agoras&quot; (the agora was the place of assembly and debate in the ancient Greek city-states). The metaphor of an agora in cyberspace, where experts and interested lay people meet to thrash out issues concerning the electric car (or oil, energy, sustainability, the Middle East), is captivating: an online world peopled by Greeks rather than geeks; an ocean that might, after all, be navigable. Luyendijk says &quot;the old model of journalism is broken&quot; \u2013 but so what? It didn&apos;t really work anyway. &quot;The best time is ahead of us,&quot; he insists. &quot;It will be possible on our site to have different entry points. If you are an expert, you go in at one point; if you are a novice, you enter somewhere else. The whole idea of what an article is will change.&quot; He reckons we are still at year zero in terms of journalism adapting to the internet. &quot;The first cars were horse carriages where they had taken out the horse, stuck in an engine and said: &apos;Ha, there we are.&apos; Everyone said: &apos;Who&apos;s going to sit in that?&apos;, and somebody had to walk in front with a flag. This is what we&apos;re doing now. We have the horse carriage, which is the story. We stick it on the internet, and we think: &apos;Ha, that&apos;s it.&apos; But once a story&apos;s on the internet, where there is no deadline and no limitations in terms of space, the whole thing begins to change. What papers do at the moment is collect stories that were written for a paper knowing that tomorrow fish will be in the paper, and they just dump them on the web. But we need a completely different way of presenting them.&quot; Papers, he believes, will disappear, though he offers no timescale. Once they have gone, the rationale for the &quot;story&quot; goes, too. One of the central conclusions of Hello Everybody! is that there is never just one story in the Middle East. In every situation, there are many stories, depending on your perspective. Luyendijk quit conventional journalism because he was always being railroaded into telling a linear story, packaged for one-off consumption. In the new net world, he believes, it will be possible to tell many stories, work on their development with other people in the agora via crowdsourcing, be open about saying &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;, be provisional in drawing conclusions, and endlessly return to the same subject. The agora exists in perpetuity; the debate never ends. Luyendijk shows no interest in the subject that obsesses media organisations: how to make this transition work financially. &quot;Imagine people trying to invent the airplane, and from day one they have to present an airtight business case,&quot; he says. &quot;No airplane would have got off the ground ever. If you&apos;re going to innovate and from day one you have to explain how that&apos;s going to make money, it&apos;s not going to fly. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have had any of the ideas with the electric car if I&apos;d been thinking commercially. You won&apos;t have ideas if your first angle is, how is this going to make money?&quot; The start-up costs of the agora site are being underwritten by the Dutch lottery, and some income is coming from chairing panel discussions on sustainability issues, but he just trusts that in the longer term a financial model will emerge. &quot;In an information society, if you have good information there must be a way of making money from it,&quot; he says. &quot;Also, your costs will be so much lower because you no longer have to pay for distribution.&quot; Luyendijk, who is now 38 and married with three young children, sees himself as an anthropologist who stumbled into journalism by accident when Dutch newspaper Volkskrant signed him up to report on the Middle East in 1998 on the strength of his book about Egypt, A Good Man Sometimes Hits His Wife (he has a winning way with titles). Volkskrant did not see the job as especially significant. Then 9/11 happened and Luyendijk was suddenly its star man. He says that according to the rule of cui bono, he should be a prime suspect for the 9/11 attacks, because he was one of the main beneficiaries. That catastrophe made him as a journalist \u2013 but it broke him, too, because he came to disbelieve the pretensions of journalism. Now he is groping for a new way of telling stories, of embracing complexity. I ask him what he thinks he&apos;ll be doing 10 years from now. &quot;I have no idea,&quot; he says. &quot;I would get really worried if I had the answer to what I&apos;ll be doing in 10 years. I&apos;m making a lot of enemies now [with the new book], so maybe I&apos;ll be living in a different country.&quot; In chilled-out Amsterdam, this contingent life seems natural. An old-style interview would have a neat conclusion or killer quote with which to finish. But I am tiring after an early flight, the interview rather dribbles away and, in any case, old-style journalism is dying. There is no neat conclusion; no killer quote; no dramatic denouement; just a rather spurious full stop. Hello Everybody!

Next week we&apos;ll be going live again, and then doing so fortnightly with our regular blog in the weeks in between. For the latest on coffee shops I asked the Netherlands Board of Tourism and Conventions, who must be fed up of talking about this subject. They confirmed that the new coalition government in the Netherlands has recently announced its intention to introduce restrictions for usage of coffee shops in Holland. This may mean that in the future foreign tourists will be unable to access coffee shops. These measures have been proposed in order to reduce the use of soft drugs among young people as well as cutting down crime and street nuisance near coffee shops. Dutch MPs will decide upon the suggested proposals in the near future. How such a ban would be enforced is not clear. Frankly I&apos;m at a loss as to why anyone would spend any time in these places, which are by quite some distance the least interesting thing about Amsterdam and tend to be tourist traps. Bars such as House of Bols (houseofbols.com) and MiNiBAR (minibaronline.com) are more reflective of the nightlife agenda in Amsterdam. There&apos;s always something interesting going on in the city, including many cultural and musical events. Of particular note are the lounge evenings at the Van Gogh museum every Friday\u00a0during which lounge chairs, video projections, live music, DJs and a bar transform the museum&apos;s central hall into a relaxed place to meet.\u00a0 Moreover, with the opening of the Hermitage Amsterdam in 2009 and the reopening of the Stedelijk Museum in 2011 and Rijksmuseum in 2013 the art scene in Amsterdam, already rich, will be going into overdrive. I&apos;m hoping to travel to South Africa in September next year and really want to visit the fossil fields at Sterkfontein. I&apos;m not sure whether to stay in Johannesburg or out at the site.\u00a0 Finding accommodation at the site is difficult but I am concerned about staying in Johannesburg.\u00a0Any advice?Tom Marshall Johannesburg has a fearsome reputation in some quarters, but the story is very different from many of those who live there or have visited the city. Yes, you need to be on your guard and yes, crime does happen, but most visits there are trouble free and plenty of people love the place. Have a read of this post from the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree and also mug up on the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office&apos;s travel advice for South Africa which has some good general safety tips. One thing that rarely gets noted about Johannesburg is how close it is to some wonderful attractions, with Sterkfontein being a case in point. Sterkfontein&apos;s fossil fields are known locally as the Cradle of Humankind (cradleofhumankind.co.za), a 47,000-hectare area that forms one of the world&apos;s most important paleontological zones. The Sterkfontein Caves, where the remains of more than 600 hominid fossils have been found, are a must-see. You&apos;ll find half and full-day tours easy to arrange from Johannesburg if you decide to stay in the city but there&apos;s also enough to justify an overnight stay, but you&apos;ll need a car to get around. For that reason a tour from Johannesburg may be a better bet. Many visitors opt to stay in the suburbs of Johannesburg, and aiming for somewhere a little way away from the city centre is a good idea as you can get settled and get local advice on where to head to and where to steer clear of. If you&apos;re on a budget, Brown Sugar Backpackers (brownsugarbackpackers.com) is a good place to meet other travellers and also has a useful tour agency attached. Alternatively, if you&apos;d rather stay in a guesthouse with a variety of rooms, pool and garden, Sunbury House (sunburyhouse.com) in Melville is a short walk from the bars and restaurants of this area of Johannesburg. We are a mature group and are going to be travelling around Cuba for two weeks in Jan/Feb. We&apos;d like to stay in casa particulares but they appear to only ever rent out two rooms. We need three \u2013 a double, a twin and a single. Do you have any idea how we might find places really near each other without my pouring over a street map for every place we intend to visit? Gail Romanes Legally Cubans with a licence to operate casa particulares have for many years only been allowed to rent out two rooms, with no more than two people in each one. You won&apos;t generally find any Cubans prepared to break the terms of this agreement. There are rumours that this legislation is being relaxed, but the most recent chatter I can find on this point is inconclusive. You&apos;re best off keeping an eye on Cuba sites such as Cuba Junky (cuba-junky.com) but it&apos;s unlikely anything is going to change by the time you travel. You could try searching at casaparticularcuba.org which lists some establishments with more than two rooms, but these tend to be more upmarket options than traditional.

A. STATE 99125 B. B. SOFIA 1046Classified By: AMBASSADOR JAMES PARDEW, FOR REASON 1.4(C). 1. (U) This cable is in response to ref A request for information about organized crime in Bulgaria and the Balkans. Where direct sources are not cited, connections are largely based on information from operational contacts and open-source publications. ----------------------- OVERVIEW AND ACTIVITIES ----------------------- 2. (SBU) The strength and immunity from the law of organized crime (OC) groups is arguably the most serious problem in Bulgaria today. OC activities underlie corruption and the ineffectiveness of the legal system in Bulgaria, and inhibit the country,s economic development. Bulgarian OC is particularly involved in international money laundering, drug trafficking, and counterfeiting. OC groups range from local street thugs involved in extortion to sophisticated international narcotic dealers and money launderers. An estimated 118 organized crime groups were operating in Bulgaria at the end of 2004, according to the National Service for Combating Organized Crime (NSBOP) of the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior (MoI), though many of these groups are relatively small and the landscape is dominated by a handful of big players. Organized crime continues to be pervasive in many spheres of Bulgarian life, despite domestic and international efforts to combat it. To date, not a single major OC figure has been punished by the Bulgarian legal system, despite an on-going series of OC-related assassinations. U.S. law enforcement agencies with offices in Sofia are supporting the effort to reduce OC in Bulgaria. The Fraud Prevention Unit in Embassy Sofia&apos;s Consular Section maintains a list of known and suspected major organized crime figures, and Embassy Sofia has an aggressive policy of preventing OC figures from traveling to the United States. 3. (SBU) OC groups are known to be involved in narcotics trafficking, prostitution, extortion and racketeering, various financial crimes, car theft, and trafficking in stolen automobiles. Human trafficking for sexual exploitation, counterfeiting, and debit and credit card fraud also are some of the most common criminal activities engaged in by Bulgarian organized crime. Crime groups involved in human trafficking are extremely mobile, and victims are often sold or traded amongst various groups. Many groups use a host of legitimate businesses domestically and abroad to launder the proceeds of their illegal activities. Several well-known businessmen linked to organized crime have parlayed their wealth into ownership of sports teams, property developments, and financial institutions. (An organized crime activity that received special attention due to its growth in 2004 was VAT (value-added tax) fraud. The Ministry of Finance estimated that VAT fraud cost the Bulgarian treasury over $700 million in losses annually.) 4. (SBU) Counterfeit currency -- both U.S. dollar and, increasingly, Euro banknotes -- is produced in Bulgaria and distributed primarily in France, Greece, Italy, and Spain by small groups of Bulgarians who return to Bulgaria immediately after making delivery. While there is thought to be cooperation between Bulgarian groups and other international organized crime groups, the couriers, middlemen and distributors are predominantly Bulgarian. The quality of counterfeit currency is continuously improving due to increasingly sophisticated printing facilities and the involvement of professional individuals with considerable printing skills. A June 2005 raid in northeast Bulgaria -- part of a joint operation between Bulgarian law enforcement and the U.S. Secret Service -- netted more than $3 million in high-quality counterfeit $100 banknotes (ref B). This was the second largest counterfeit seizure in European history. 5. (C) U.S.-based investigations of transnational crime groups have dismantled significant drug trafficking organizations run by Bulgarian nationals in Los Angeles and Tampa. These groups imported multi-kilo quantities of cocaine and multi-thousand doses of ecstasy into the United States. They had drug connections through Amsterdam and some financial backing of an Israeli national. While most members of these groups were convicted and imprisoned in the U.S., three who were charged in California and Florida are still wanted international fugitives who may have returned to Bulgaria to exploit the country&apos;s current policy of not extraditing its citizens. The three fugitives are IVAYLO ANGELOV PETKOV (Bulgarian citizen born 18 May 1965), IVAN DOBREV (Bulgarian citizen born 25 May 1959), and STEFAN TZVETANOV STOYANOV (Bulgarian citizen born 9 January 1966). 6. (SBU) Other investigations in the U.S. have identified Bulgarian nationals manufacturing and selling false identity documents for use in organized bank fraud, mortgage fraud, credit card fraud, and alien smuggling. -------------------------------------- WHO&apos;S WHO IN BULGARIAN ORGANIZED CRIME -------------------------------------- 7. (C) Since the fall of Communism in 1989 and the turbulent 1990s, Bulgaria&apos;s organized crime scene has undergone major changes, much like the rest of Bulgaria&apos;s economic, political, and social landscape. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is thought to have connections to Russian organized crime, including the notorious Russian crime figure, MICHAEL CHORNY (see RUSSIAN INFLUENCE). XXXXXXXXXXX Before he was shot dead in Amsterdam in December 2003, KONSTANTIN DIMITROV (Bulgarian citizen born 21 November 1970, also known as &quot;SAMOKOVETSA&quot;) was one of the biggest smugglers in Bulgaria and the country&apos;s top drug lord. XXXXXXXXXXXX As the largest player in the drugs market, XXXXXXXXXXXX controls trafficking routes, production facilities, and distribution networks. The group is also involved in trafficking stolen automobiles from Western Europe to the former Soviet Union. Its other criminal activities include extortion and racketeering, illegal arms trading, gambling, prostitution, and smuggling. XXXXXXXXXXXX The group is thought to have the largest share in Sofia&apos;s escort and intimate services businesses, which are used as fronts for prostitution and trafficking in women for sexual exploitation. XXXXXXXXXXXX illegal activities include money laundering, privatization fraud, intimidation, and extortion and racketeering. XXXXXXXXXXXX The group&apos;s criminal activities include prostitution, narcotics, and trafficking stolen automobiles. L. (C) RUSSIAN INFLUENCE Russia continues to exercise significant influence over the Bulgarian economy through energy imports, including crude oil, natural gas and nuclear fuel. XXXXXXXXXXXX Despite the fact that he is no longer the owner of XXXXXXXXXXXX Russian mobster MICHAEL CHORNY is thought to retain influence over the company through his ties to members of XXXXXXXXXXXX. The court decision suggests that Chorny is still in control of XXXXXXXXXXXX, as the judge presiding over the Supreme Administrative Court panel for the BTC case also revoked the Government,s decision banning Chorny from entering the country. In addition, Chorny has connections to XXXXXXXXXXX CHORNY has also maintained influence over a number of companies by transferring ownership to XXXXXXXXXXXX LUKOIL,s representative in Bulgaria is XXXXXXXXXXX The Russian petroleum company is estimated to be the largest corporate taxpayer in Bulgaria. It also controls Russian oil exports to Bulgaria. Lukoil&apos;s Bulgarian operations, through XXXXXXXXXXXX, are suspected of strong ties to Russian intelligence and organized crime. XXXXXXXXXXX ---------------------------------------- POLITICS: THE NEXUS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME ---------------------------------------- 8. (C) Organized crime has a corrupting influence on all Bulgarian institutions, including the government, parliament and judiciary. In an attempt to maintain their influence regardless of who is in power, OC figures donate to all the major political parties. As these figures have expanded into legitimate businesses, they have attempted -- with some success -- to buy their way into the corridors of power. During the 2001 general elections, a number of influential &quot;businessmen,&quot; including XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX, heavily financed and otherwise supported the XXXXXXXXXXXX campaign. XXXXXXXXXXXX10. (C) Below the level of the national government and the leadership of the major political parties, OC &quot;owns&quot; a number of municipalities and individual members of parliament. This direct participation in politics -- as opposed to bribery -- is a relatively new development for Bulgarian OC. XXXXXXXXXX Similarly in the regional center of XXXXXXXXXXX, OC figures control the municipal council and the mayor&apos;s office. Nearly identical scenarios have played out in half a dozen smaller towns and villages across Bulgaria. ------- COMMENT ------- 11. (C) Despite continuing pressure from the U.S. and the EU, past Bulgarian governments have done little to reduce the presence of organized crime. As a result, OC has increased its influence and is able to operate with virtual impunity. The Bulgarian public recognizes OC,s corrupting influence, and people are clearly frustrated by the government,s inability or unwillingness to deal with the problem. We continue to provide technical assistance to reform-minded elements of the Bulgarian government and judiciary -- and to speak out on the need to fight corruption and organized crime -- but real political leverage on this issue lies with the EU.

If you haven&apos;t heard of Dulwich Picture Gallery by the end of the year then you&apos;re deaf.&quot; The south London gallery opened 200 years ago to house a remarkable collection that had been built up over five years for the King of Poland, who wanted to build a royal collection from scratch. His abdication in 1795 left two London-based art dealers with some fine paintings which, in turn, led to the creation of what is one of the world&apos;s oldest public galleries. Then it charged sixpence to keep riff-raff out. Today the riff-raff are welcome, but they must pay \u00a35 to see a permanent collection that is one of the most important collections of old masters anywhere. It is this reputation and history that had galleries saying yes to Dejardin&apos;s request for loans. One of the most eye-catching is the self-portrait of Van Gogh \u2013 he&apos;ll be Mr July \u2013 from the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam. It was specifically requested by Dejardin, not least because a 19-year-old Van Gogh walked from central London to the gallery in 1873 and made a mess of the visitor&apos;s book by blotting ink all over it. Unfortunately all that is known of his experience, said Dejardin, is that he &quot;had a nice day&quot;. Dejardin said the loans were like &quot;a year-long advent calendar of your dreams&quot;.

In a move that risked outraging local and Arab opinion, Ali Abdullah Saleh told Barack Obama&apos;s deputy national security adviser, John Brennan, in September 2009: &quot;I have given you an open door on terrorism. so I am not responsible,&quot; according to a secret dispatch back to Washington In reality, despite the offer of an &quot;open door&quot;, Yemen has restricted access for US forces in order to avoid playing into the hands of Saleh&apos;s domestic critics. The cables expose for the first time the true scale of America&apos;s covert military involvement in the Arab world&apos;s poorest nation amid deep concern in Washington that it has become the haven for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap). The group has carried out a series of attacks on western targets, including the failed airline cargo bomb plot in October and the attempt to bring down a US passenger jet over Detroit on Christmas Day last year. While Saleh&apos;s government publicly insists its own forces are responsible for counter-terrorism operations, the cables detail how the president struck a secret deal to allow the US to carry out cruise missile attacks on Aqap targets. The first strike in December last year, which killed dozens of civilians along with wanted jihadis, was presented by Saleh as Yemen&apos;s own work, supported by US intelligence. But a cable dated 21 December from the ambassador Stephen Seche recorded that &quot;Yemen insisted it must &apos;maintain the status quo&apos; regarding the official denial of US involvement. Saleh wanted operations to continue &apos;non-stop until we eradicate this disease.&apos;&quot; A second attack took place on 24 December. A few days later, in a meeting with General David Petraeus, then head of US central command, Saleh admitted lying to his population about the strikes. &quot;We&apos;ll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,&quot; Saleh told Petraeus on 2 January. That prompted the deputy prime minister, Rashad al-Alimi, who was also at the meeting, to joke he had just &quot;lied&quot; by telling parliament the bombs in Arhab, Abyan, and Shebwa (the al-Qaida strongholds) were American-made but deployed by Yemen. Petraeus had flown to Sana&apos;a to tell Saleh that Barack Obama would allow US ground forces &quot;armed with direct-feed intelligence&quot; from satellites or surveillance aircraft to be deployed in Yemen on counter-terrorist operations. But in contrast to his suggestion of an &quot; open door&quot;, Saleh rejected the offer, expressing concerns about US casualties. Instead it was agreed to have &quot;US fixed-wing bombers circle out of sight outside Yemeni territory ready to engage Aqap targets should actionable intelligence become available&quot;. US personnel would have to stay in the Yemeni command centre. Saleh said &quot;mistakes had been made&quot; in the earlier strikes, lamented the use of US cruise missiles that were &quot;not very accurate&quot; and welcomed the use of aircraft-deployed, precision-guided bombs instead. Petraeus told Saleh he had requested $150m (\u00a395m) in security assistance for Yemen for 2010, a substantial increase over the 2009 amount of $67m. Later in 2010, discussions were reported on raising US security assistance to Yemen to more than $1bn. The US air strikes were praised by Saudi Arabia, the cables show. The deputy interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, told General James Jones, Obama&apos;s national security adviser: &quot;The Saudis have been monitoring conversations of al-Qaida operatives in Yemen very closely and whereas before the attack they were hearing relaxed 20-minute phone conversations over cellphones, after the attack the phones went virtually silent. This suggests that at least for now these operatives are more focused on their own security rather than on planning operations.&quot; Bin Nayef&apos;s support for operations against Aqap is perhaps unsurprising. He survived an assassination attempt in Jeddah in September 2009 when a Saudi Aqap operative named Abdullah al-Asiri feigned repentance for his jihadi views in a meeting with the prince then blew himself up with a bomb concealed in his anus. The secret dispatches also detail how Yemen repeatedly failed to implement anti-terror training for airport officials, allowed cargo to pass through x-ray machines unchecked and refused to co-operate over American suspicions about the movement of students through Islamic institutions. On 31 January 2010 America&apos;s most senior counter-terrorism official warned the Yemeni president of the need for tougher airport security after the US embassy reported that security advice had gone unheeded for more than a decade. In a face-to-face meeting with Saleh, Daniel Benjamin &quot;reiterated the US government&apos;s desire to ensure that no international terrorist attack originates again from Yemen&quot;, according to a cable from the embassy in Sana&apos;a. He urged Saleh to accept fresh US help to &quot;strengthen screening procedures at all of Yemen&apos;s international airports&quot;. The meeting took place in the aftermath of the failed Christmas Day terror attack on a Northwest Airlines plane over Detroit. The Nigerian &quot;underpants bomber&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up the flight from Amsterdam, was radicalised in Yemen while claiming to be there as a student. Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, a Saudi-born militant active in Yemen, is alleged to have been responsible for making that bomb and is also suspected of building the computer printer bombs found on flights from Sana&apos;a, destined for Chicago, one of them in transit in the UK. Aqap claimed responsibility for both plots. The US cables reveal that Yemen balked at the state department&apos;s request to share information about student&apos;s movement in and out of the country, despite intelligence to suggest some of its universities and madrasas play a key role in al-Qaida recruitment. Benjamin told Saleh the US wanted to &quot;establish a mechanism for sharing information on passengers travelling via air to and from Yemen as well as foreign nationals who have come to Yemen to study at language or religious institutions&quot;. But Yemen&apos;s security committee said the request was &quot;too broad&quot;. At times the relationship between the US and the Yemeni president appears strained. Saleh said he was satisfied with America&apos;s counter-terrorism assistance to date, but &quot;appealed for the acceleration of additional support, citing helicopters and vehicles with IED-jamming devices&quot;. He described the Americans as &quot;hot-blooded and hasty when you need us&quot;, but &quot;cold-blooded and British when we need you&quot;. In 2009 Seche reported airport security in Yemen was poor and US anti-terror training for airport officials and security staff offered since 1998 had not been effectively implemented. &quot;There have been numerous occurrences of x-ray screeners not watching their monitors constantly, and ineffective access control procedures,&quot; he said. Customs officials were ineffective, &quot;underpaid, poorly trained and receptive to corruption,&quot; he said. A tour of the airport by a US security delegation in June 2009 revealed &quot;several lapses in airport security practices \u2026 regarding passenger screening, cargo security, and secure identification display area badge and access procedures&quot;. The cables reveal how the US saw Yemen&apos;s ability to fight al-Qaida on the ground as weak despite the country&apos;s emergence as the next most important front in the fight against the group. Until January 2010, its main counter-terrorism control centre was equipped with only three computers, counter-terrorist officers on the ground only communicated sporadically using mobile phones which often failed, and the only mapping available was paper charts, Seche told Washington. Recent Yemeni counter-terror operations had been &quot;impeded by a lack of clear commands, miscommunication between counter-terrorism elements regarding roles, information that was not shared until after the operation, and a reliance on sporadic cellphone calls between various units in the field during the course of the operation&quot;. Seche quoted Yemen&apos;s counter-terrorism unit commander, Kamal al-Sayani, admitting that &quot;almost 80% of relevant information never makes it to the tactical counter-terrorism unit leaders in the field&quot;. US officials expressed concern that close support for Saleh could backfire: &quot;While Yemeni counter-terrorism activity and co-operation have been strong in recent months,&quot; Arab allies were told on the eve of a London conference on aid to Yemen, &quot;we are concerned that Saleh&apos;s willingness to target Aqap will wane if domestic opposition paints Saleh as a pawn of the United States for these actions. Public Arab support to Yemen&apos;s counter-terrorism activities may help Saleh weather internal criticisms in this regard&quot;. Diplomats were privately sceptical about Yemeni determination. &quot;To the extent that our public statements continue to reflect a sensitivity to the &apos;amour-propre&apos; of Yemen&apos;s leadership on this subject, we can expect the Yemeni government to continue to publicly affirm its seriousness about prosecuting its counter-terrorism objectives and perhaps to match these expressions of intent with actions on the ground,&quot; the ambassador said.", "sentences": ["The Nigerian &quot;underpants bomber&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up the flight from Amsterdam, was radicalised in Yemen while claiming to be there as a student."], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Yemen offered US 'open door' to attack al-Qaida on its soil", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-yemen-us-attack-al-qaida", "tags": ["Yemen", "Al-Qaida", "US foreign policy", "The US embassy cables", "US national security", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-04T00:05:46Z", "article": "1.

The Obama administration is planning a major reshuffling of diplomats, military officers and intelligence operatives at US embassies around the world out of concern that WikiLeaks has made it impossible \u2013 if not dangerous \u2013 for many of the Americans to remain in their current posts, writes Philip Shenon. &quot;In the short run, we&apos;re almost out of business,&quot; a senior US diplomat told the Reuters news agency, according to a follow-up of the Daily Beast article in the Independent. The fate of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, continues to attract much attention. The New York Times reports that hundreds of WikiLeaks mirror sites have sprung up to prevent efforts to censor its disclosures. Similarly the Guardian reports on an online backlash to shut the site down. Australia&apos;s attorney general, Robert McCelland, said that Australia would provide consular assistance to Assange if he returned to Australia. But at the same time he said his country was providing &apos;&apos;every assistance&apos;&apos; to US authorities in their investigation against WikiLeaks. Here are the headlines from the Guardian&apos;s latest trawl through the cables: \u2022 Al-Jazeera changed coverage to suit Qatari foreign policy\u2022 Cables portray Saudi Arabia as a cash machine for terrorists\u2022 Lebanon told allies of Hezbollah&apos;s secret network\u2022 Brazil denied existence of Islamist militants\u2022 WikiLeaks cables blame Chinese government for Google hacking You can follow all of last week&apos;s disclosures and reaction on our live blogs on the cables. And for full coverage go to our US embassy cables page or follow our US embassy cable Twitter feed @GdnCables.  8.06am: A new edition of the weekly German magazine Der Spiegel is published today with a slew of new stories from the cables.  The magazine, one of the five media organisations \u2013 including the Guardian \u2013 to have had early sight of the cables, focuses on what they reveal about the conflict in Iraq. The Americans allowed themselves to get entangled in the Sunni-Shia conflict while being systematically outmanoeuvered by the Iranians, according to 5,500 about the war and its aftermath. It also looks at what the cables say about Xi Jinping, China&apos;s probable future leader and the inner workings of the Chinese politburo. In an interview with the magazine, Prince Turki bin Faisal of Saudi Arabia, says America&apos;s &quot;credibility and honesty&quot; has been damaged by the leaks. He describes the cables as &quot;a hodgepodge of selectivity, inaccuracy, agenda pursuit, and downright disinformation&quot;.  8.24am: The Today programme presenter Jim Naughtie is in all sorts of trouble after substituting a crucial letter in the surname of culture secretary Jeremy Hunt, and then corpsing his way through the headlines.      Naughtie: among the leading BBC news staff who have signed a letter expressing 'dismay' at proposed budget cuts    Before the gaffe Naughtie sneered at the Guardian&apos;s WikiLeaks coverage. In a review of the papers at 6.12am he sarcastically described today&apos;s Guardian&apos;s splash as &quot;another story that will make us all fall off our chairs with astonishment&quot;.  8.49am: Much of the media continues to portray Julian Assange as a Bond villain holding the world to ransom. Here&apos;s today&apos;s Daily Mail:  Julian Assange has distributed to fellow hackers an encrypted &apos;poison pill&apos; of damaging secrets, thought to include details on BP and Guantanamo Bay. He believes the file is his &apos;insurance&apos; in case he is killed, arrested or the whistleblowing website is removed permanently from the internet.  The release of the &quot;terror targets&quot; plays into that view.   8.59am: The broadcaster al-Jazeera has denied that it is being used as a tool of Qatari diplomacy, as one of the cables claims. In a statement it said:  &quot;This is the US embassy&apos;s assessment, and it is very far from the truth. Despite all the pressure Al Jazeera has been subjected to by regional and international governments, it has never changed its bold editorial policies which remain guided by the principles of a free press.&quot;  9.21am: More evidence that the release of the cable about the key infrastructure sites is being used as stick to beat WikiLeaks. Here&apos;s a tweet from Times columnist David Aaronovitch.       I don&apos;t see how the strategic sites cable fits into J Assange&apos;s heroic rubric of disclosure. It looks more like like vandalism. #wikileaks  9.39am: The Guardian took a weekend break from liveblogging the cables, but the Nation didn&apos;t. They work harder in America. Here&apos;s Greg Mitchell&apos;s roundup of Sunday&apos;s WikiLeaks news. My colleague Peter Walker is working on a summary of the WikiLeak revelations from today and over the weekend. While we wait for that, the respected analyst, Juan Cole, has a roundup of the weekend&apos;s top 10 disclosures about the Middle East.  9.58am: While US students have been told that reading the cables could harm their careers, students in Indian are being told the opposite. Trainee diplomats at India&apos;s Foreign Services Institute (FSI) have been urged to emulate the prose style displayed by the diplomats in the cables.  &quot;The Ministry of External Affairs is asking its youngsters to read them [the cables] and get a hang of the brevity with which thoughts and facts have been expressed,&quot; the Indian Express reports.  I&apos;d recommend cables written by former US ambassador in Moscow William Burns, especially this one about a drunken wedding in Dagestan. The cable is described as an &quot;insightful, literate, and wry field report&quot; by Reuel Marc Gerecht in the New Republic. He also likes the cables by Tatiana Gfoeller, the ambassador to Kyrgystan who reported on Prince Andrew&apos;s rudeness.  10.23am: This is useful \u2013 a search engine for all the hundreds of cables already published by WikiLeaks. You can use it to see what everyone else is searching for too.  10.36am: Vancouver police have been asked by a lawyer to investigate whether a former aide to the Canadian prime minister broke the law when he called for the assassination of Julian Assange. Last week Tom Flanagan called for the contract killing of the WikiLeaks founder in a live TV discussion. He later said he regretted the remarks. Gail Davidson, a co-founder of the group Lawyers Against the War, has made a formal complaint to the police in Canada, according to the Vancover Sun. In his online chat with Guardian readers last Friday Assange said those who called for his killing should be charged with incitement to murder.  11.09am: The Yemeni government faces some awkward questions later this week about why it lied about US attacks against al-Qaida. &quot;We&apos;ll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,&quot; Yemen&apos;s president Ali Abdullah Saleh told David Petraeus in a now infamous cable in January this year. Yemen&apos;s parliament will question the deputy prime minister over the cables, MPs told Reuters.   Rashad al-Alimi, Deputy Prime Minister for Security and Defence Affairs, has been asked to attend parliament on Wednesday to discuss the content of the secret U.S. documents, several MPs confirmed. A government official told Reuters Alimi would go to parliament to answer parliamentarians&apos; questions, but said the information in the leaked documents were inaccurate. &quot;Of course this (information in the cables) is not true. Everyone in the world is complaining about the inaccuracies of these documents,&quot; he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   11.30am: The company behind @Tweetbackup, the only Twitter account followed by WikiLeaks, has become the latest Tech provider to consider cutting off support to the whistleblowing stie. &quot;We just became aware of the Wikileaks account on Friday,&quot; vice-president of marketing at Backupify told Networkworld. &quot;We&apos;re currently evaluating the situation.&quot;  12.12pm: Sir Malcolm Rifkind, former UK foreign secretary and chair of the intelligence and security committee, has spoken out against the release of the cable listing those key infrastructure sites and resources. Speaking to BBC News, he said:      Malcolm Rifkind MP Photograph: Guardian    This is a gift to any terrorist organisation trying to work out what are the ways in which it can damage the United States. It is grossly improper and irresponsible of Mr Assange and his WikiLeaks organisation to allow that information into the public domain.   12.58pm: Salon&apos;s Glenn Greenwald continues to be one of the biggest cheerleaders for WikiLeaks and the disclosure of the these documents.  1.37pm: The United States needs to work &quot;put in a lot of hard work&quot; to re-establish confidence with the international community, according to Afghanistan&apos;s foreign minister. Speaking at news conference Zalmai Rassoul said: &quot;Confidence should come back at all levels, it&apos;s going to be a difficult job, but it&apos;s necessary.&quot;  1.43pm: David Leigh, the Guardian&apos;s investigations&apos; editor who has done much of the reporting on the cables, responds to the Times story about &quot;terror sites&quot;. He says the Guardian chose not to publish the story.       Strange to see the Times publishing a sensitive #Wikileaks cable which the #Guardian declined to do. Murdoch is helping terrorists?  1.51pm: The foreign secretary William Hague said WikiLeaks&apos; publication of those vital global sites was &quot;reprehensible,&quot; according to the BBC. Was the Times also reprehensible for highlighting it? Was it being irresponsible by trying to highlight the irresponsibility of WikiLeaks? And were the Guardian right not to publish it? This is tricky stuff and way beyond my pay grade. Please help me out in the comments section.  While you ponder all that here&apos;s that summary of what&apos;s we&apos;ve learned today, with links to summary&apos;s of the revelations for each of the previous seven days.  2.21pm: Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee has repeated his suggestion that those responsible for the leaks should be executed.  Last week he called for the death penalty for the whistleblower. At a Bet El Dinner for the Jewish community in New York last night he said whoever leaked the material should be &quot;prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law&quot;. His comments were greeted with applause.  Huckabee is trying to have it both ways. He went on to say that Israel should draw comfort from what the cables revealed about the the Arab world&apos;s hostility to Iran.             2.36pm: James Ball an investigative journalist working with WikLleaks, asks why hasn&apos;t The Guardian been hit by tech companies in the same way as WikiLeaks. In a defiant post for the Index of Censorship, he writes:  Duplicate copies of Wikileaks are now loaded hundreds of different servers worldwide. Even PayPal&apos;s closure of Wikileaks&apos; account has so far proved little more than an annoyance. But even these could all vanish tomorrow, thanks to an even more traditional fallback: old media. The New York Times, Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Monde and El Pais are all running Wikileaks material. All shared the same editorial judgement as Wikileaks having seen the material: they judged it in the public interest and chose to run it. At this point, these sites are running the same cables as Wikileaks. They have contributed to the redactions. The Guardian website, at the time of writing, actually contains more US material than Wikileaks&apos; own. None have faced the political or technical backlash of the main Wikileaks site, yet all would have to be taken offline to bury the Embassy Cables story.   2.44pm: Wow, we certainly didn&apos;t know this:      General Than Shwe, leader of Burma's junta. Photograph: STR/EPA    The leader of Burma&apos;s military junta was considering buying Manchester United for $1bn, according to the latest cable seen by the Guardian.  Than Shwe, commander in chief of the armed forces and a fan of United, was urged to mount a takeover bid by his grandson, according to a cable from the US embassy in Rangoon. It details how the regime was thought to be using football to distract its population from ongoing political and economic problems.  Would the general have got through the Premier League&apos;s fit and proper persons test? My boss tweets: &quot;Would&apos;ve been better than the Glazers&quot;, grumbled one Man U fan not far from the Guardian newsdesk.       3.00pm: Interpol have issued this online wanted poster for Julian Paul Assange. Here&apos;s the notice. It confirms that Assange is wanted by the Sweedish authorities in connection with allegations about &quot;sex crimes&quot;.  He denies the charges.  Yesterday, Assange&apos;s lawyers they were being watched by the police.  Jennifer Robinson and Mark Stephens of the law firm Finers Stephens Innocent told the Guardian they had been watched by people parked outside their houses for the past week. &quot;I&apos;ve noticed people consistently sitting outside my house in the same cars with newspapers,&quot; said Robinson. &quot;I probably noticed certain things a week ago, but mostly it&apos;s been the last three or four days.&quot; Stephens said he, too, had had his home watched. Asked who he thought was monitoring him, he said: &quot;The security services.&quot;   3.15pm: Here&apos;s that William Hague outrage in full. Speaking to BBC radio he said:   There is great concern of course about disclosing a list of targets that could be of use to terrorists or saboteurs. I think it is absolutely reprehensible the publication is carried out without regard to wider concerns of security, the security of millions of people       Time to call it a day again. Come in Richard Adams.       3.32pm: Thank you Matthew, and good morning from a chilly Washington DC, where many State Department officials are returning to work with jetlag after their hurried trips abroad to &quot;explain&quot; the contents of the US embassy cables to their foreign counterparts.  3.47pm: Triumphs in journalism, part 874 (Washington Post edition): as we blogged here last week, on Thursday the Washington Post&apos;s Al Kamen buried a story in his column that the Federal government was forbidding employees to access the WikiLeaked US embassy cables since they were still classified. By Sunday the Post finally got around to reporting the same fact in a news story. Are standards slipping at the Post? Well, today&apos;s front page manages two cliches and a mixed metaphor in the space of one six-word headline (seen here in the top left corner): &quot;Customs pushed envelope to hit goal&quot;.      Columbia University. Well, the nice-looking bit. Photograph: Corbis    4.06pm: Last week there was consternation after a section of Columbia University sent an email to its students warning them against accessing or tweeting the leaked US embassy cables because of the future repercussions for their career in the US government. Now the dean of Columbia&apos;s School of International and Public Affairs sends a clarification to the &quot;SIPA community&quot;:  Last Tuesday, SIPA&apos;s Office of Career Services received a call from a former student currently employed by the US Department of State who pointed out that the US government documents released during the past few months through WikiLeaks are still considered classified. The caller suggested that students who will be applying for federal jobs that require background checks avoid posting links to these documents or making comments about them on social media sites such as Facebook or through Twitter.  OCS emailed this cautionary suggestion to students, as it has done many times with other information that could be helpful in seeking employment after graduation. We know that many students today share a great deal about their lives online and that employers may use that information when evaluating their candidacy. Subsequent news stories have indicated that the Department of State has issued guidelines for its own employees, but has not issued any guidelines for prospective employees.  Freedom of information and expression is a core value of our institution. Thus, SIPA&apos;s position is that students have a right to discuss and debate any information in the public arena that they deem relevant to their studies or to their roles as global citizens, and to do so without fear of adverse consequences. The WikiLeaks documents are accessible to SIPA students (and everyone else) from a wide variety of respected sources, as are multiple means of discussion and debate both in and outside of the classroom. Should the US Department of State issue any guidelines relating to the WikiLeaks documents for prospective employees, SIPA will make them available immediately.  Sincerely, John H Coatsworth, Dean  Fact: Columbia University was originally named King&apos;s College when it was founded in 1754 by George II.  4.31am: Time magazine is running its annual poll of readers for its Person of the Year award \u2013 and Julian Assange is currently number one in the ratings, with more than 200,000 votes. He&apos;s even leading Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 and every year Turks for some reason try and game this poll \u2013 which is saying something. Oh, Glenn Beck&apos;s fifth and Sarah Palin is in 10th place. Link bait, anyone?  4.34pm: Switzerland&apos;s PostFinance bank announces it has closed an account belonging to Julian Assange, saying: &quot;The decision comes after it was revealed that Assange provided false information regarding his place of residence when opening the account.&quot; Here&apos;s the statement:  PostFinance has ended its business relationship with Wikileaks founder Julian Paul Assange. The Australian citizen provided false information regarding his place of residence during the account opening process. Assange entered Geneva as his domicile. Upon inspection, this information was found to be incorrect. Assange cannot provide proof of residence in Switzerland and thus does not meet the criteria for a customer relationship with PostFinance. For this reason, PostFinance is entitled to close his account. If there is any indication that the information provided by an account holder may not comply with the detailed valid provisions, PostFinance investigates the circumstances in detail and draws the appropriate conclusions.   4.52pm: In response to the PostFinance bank&apos;s announcement, WikiLeaks sends out its own press release:  The Swiss Bank Post Finance today issues a press release stating that it had frozen Julian Assange&apos;s defense fund and personal assets (\u20ac31,000) after reviewing him as a &quot;high profile&quot; individual. The technicality used to seize the defense fund was that Mr Assange, as a homeless refugee attempting to gain residency in Switzerland, had used his lawyer&apos;s address in Geneva for the bank&apos;s correspondence. Late last week, the internet payment giant PayPal, froze \u20ac60,000 of donations to the German charity the Wau Holland Foundation, which were targeted to promote the sharing of knowledge via WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks and Julian have lost \u20ac100,000 in assets this week. One of the most fascinating aspects of the Cablegate exposure is how it is throwing into relief the power dynamics between supposedly independent states like Switzerland, Sweden and Australia. WikiLeaks also has public bank accounts in Iceland (preferred) and Germany. Please help cover our expenditures while we fight to get our assets back.   5.05pm: Latest from the US embassy cables \u2013 the Guardian&apos;s Damian Carrington reports that the US used diplomatic moves to block an Iranian scientist from a post on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, because sharing the position with an American scientist would look bad:  The US privately lobbied IPCC chair Dr Rajendra Pachauri, as well as the UK, EU, Argentina and Mali representatives, and had put its embassies to work from Brazil to Uzbekistan. It wanted to prevent the election of Dr Mostafa Jafari as one of two co-chairmen of a key working group. The other co-chair was to be an American scientist, Prof Christopher Field. The US state department noted that sharing the IPCC position with an Iranian would be &quot;problematic&quot; and &quot;potentially at odds with overall US policy towards Iran&quot;.   5.20pm: Here we go: the US attorney-general says he has unspecified &quot;significant&quot; actions in the works against WikiLeaks regarding a criminal investigation, although he won&apos;t say what they are exactly they may be:  Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that he has authorized &quot;significant&quot; actions related to the criminal investigation of WikiLeaks as the website faces increasing pressure worldwide for publishing sensitive US diplomatic cables. &quot;National security of the United States has been put at risk,&quot; Holder said. &quot;The lives of people who work for the American people have been put at risk. The American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that I believe are arrogant, misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way. We are doing everything that we can.&quot; Holder, speaking at a news conference on financial fraud, declined to answer questions about the possibility of the US government shutting WikiLeaks down, saying he does not want to talk about capabilities and techniques at the government&apos;s disposal.  The great difficulty for the US authorities is that WikiLeaks and Assange haven&apos;t actually broken any US laws, according to most legal observers. Which makes the whole prosecution thing a bit tricky.  5.41pm: So Eric Holder has a Secret Plan to fight WikiLeaks? More detail from Holder&apos;s press conference at the Department of Justice just now, with some useful quotes via Reuters:  US Attorney General Eric Holder said on Monday the Obama administration was considering using laws in addition to the US Espionage Act to possibly prosecute the release of sensitive government information by WikiLeaks. &quot;That is certainly something that might play a role, but there are other statutes, other tools at our disposal,&quot; Holder told reporters. The Espionage Act dates back to 1917 and was focused on making it illegal to obtain national defense information for the purpose of harming the United States. Holder described the law as &quot;pretty old&quot; and lawmakers are considering updating it in the wake of the leak.... Holder also said that he authorised a number of unspecified actions as part of the criminal probe the Justice Department is conducting into the WikiLeaks matter. &quot;I authorised just last week a number of things to be done so that we can get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable,&quot; Holder said. He repeatedly refused to elaborate whether that would include search warrants. &quot;I personally authorised a number of things last week and that&apos;s an indication of the seriousness with which we take this matter and the highest level of involvement at the Department of Justice,&quot; he said.   6.09pm: Did you know that in the US there&apos;s a Progressive Librarians Guild? Neither did I, but there is and it has a statement out in the wake of the Library of Congress blocking access to WikiLeaks&apos;s website:  The Progressive Librarians Guild (PLG) condemns in the strongest possible terms the blocking of WikiLeaks by the Library of Congress and rejects on all grounds their arguments in defense of this move. The action is a violation of American librarianship&apos;s historic commitments to the public&apos;s right to know, to freedom of the press, and to the very essence of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is also in violation of the American Library Association&apos;s most fundamental commitments to intellectual freedom as embodied in the Library Bill of Rights.   6.21pm: The Guardian reports on the Swiss action to close Julian Assange&apos;s bank account (in which we also learn that Assange&apos;s middle name is Paul) and some of the latest details:  It was also reported this afternoon that Scotland Yard had received the paperwork required to arrest Assange over allegations of sexual assault in Sweden. But the [London] Metropolitan police declined to comment on the claim, attributed by Press Association to unnamed sources.  The BBC is more certain, writing:  Britain has received a European arrest warrant from Sweden for the Wikileaks&apos; founder Julian Assange. The warrant is being processed by the Serious Organised Crime Agency and will be sent to the Metropolitan Police as he is thought to be in the London area.   6.40pm: Another entry for the &quot;WikiLeaks needs to grow up&quot; club: info-guru Clay Shirkey has just published an &quot;on the one hand, on the other hand&quot; analysis of the WikiLeaks cables \u2013 and concludes by just wringing his hands:  Over the long haul, we will need new checks and balances for newly increased transparency \u2013 Wikileaks shouldn&apos;t be able to operate as a law unto itself anymore than the US should be able to. In the short haul, though, Wikileaks is our Amsterdam. Whatever restrictions we eventually end up enacting, we need to keep Wikileaks alive today, while we work through the process democracies always go through to react to change.   6.53pm: It&apos;s delightful that the Swiss have suddenly become so fastidious about stopping non-residents from opening Swiss bank accounts. The AP reports:  PostFinance spokesman Alex Josty told The Associated Press the account was closed Monday afternoon and there would be &quot;no criminal consequences&quot; for misleading authorities. &quot;That&apos;s his money, he will get his money back,&quot; Josty said. &quot;We just close the account and that&apos;s it.&quot;        7pm: Hot off the Twitter-press, Heather Brooke has posted an alarming tweet on her@newsbrooke account: &quot;Rumour is that arrest is imminent and that Julian Assange is going to turn himself in&quot;. Similar rumours went around on Friday so take with a pinch of salt.  7.20pm: US news organisations including the Associated Press have begun dropping the &quot;whistleblower&quot; adjective in describing WikiLeaks, as Michael Calderone reports at The Cutline blog:  The Associated Press, for one, used &quot;whistleblower&quot; as late as last Thursday in describing WikiLeaks but has since opted against it. &quot;We&apos;ve had &apos;whistleblower&apos; in some copy but have decided not to use it any longer,&quot; AP spokesman Paul Colford told The Cutline. &quot;Our description now reflects the site&apos;s own name: a website that specialises in displaying leaked information.&quot; Colford didn&apos;t say whether or not the AP considers &quot;whistleblower&quot; to be inaccurate, but simply said that &quot;we think we have a better, clearer description, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re using.&quot; Meanwhile NBC News spokeswoman Lauren Kapp also told The Cutline that the network was retiring &quot;whistleblower&quot; in its WikiLeaks reports, even though it called WikiLeaks a &quot;whistleblower&quot; on last Monday&apos;s &quot;Nightly News with Brian Williams.&quot; Reuters, which used &quot;whistleblower&quot; following the State Dept. leak, no longer uses it, either. &quot;Our style guidelines ask that reporters not describe WikiLeaks as a whistleblower,&quot; Reuters spokeswoman Erin Kurtz said.  As Calderone notes, the term &quot;whistleblower&quot; is likely to be viewed positively, as an individual speaking out against wrongdoing.  7.41pm: Peter Alexander of NBC News tweets:  Assange&apos;s lawyer tells @NBCNews time &amp; place being negotiated for mtg w #Assange. Unclear if he&apos;ll be arrested.   7.49pm: It looks as if Julian Assange is going to hand himself in \u2013 Heather Brooke tweets:  UK police have extradition request from Sweden. Assange&apos;s lawyer making arrangements to meet with police for interview   8.05pm: Julian Assange&apos;s lawyer said tonight that he and his client were in the process of arranging to meet British police for a question and answer session. &quot;Julian Assange has not been charged with anything,&quot; Mark Stephens told BBC television. &quot;We are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that&apos;s needed.&quot; Stephens could not give details about when that might be arranged.  8.10pm: As the possibility of Julian Assange turning himself in looms, we&apos;re going to close this live blog and hand things over to my colleagues in London \u2013 so for all the latest WikiLeaks news click here.", "sentences": ["In the short haul, though, Wikileaks is our Amsterdam."], "title": "WikiLeaks US embassy cables: as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/dec/06/wikileaks-us-embassy-cables-live-updates", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "WikiLeaks", "Julian Assange", "Al-Jazeera", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Qatar", "Saudi Arabia", "Lebanon", "Iran"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-06T17:35:53Z", "article": "Looking for something fun to do this winter? Here&apos;s a fun citizen-science project that twitchers, birders, parrot enthusiasts, naturalists and their families can participate in: the World Parrot Count.  This international census is organised by the Parrot Researchers Group, which is part of the International Ornithological Union (IOU). Day-to-day coordination is done by Roelant Jonker, a doctoral student in the department of environmental sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and by Michael Braun, a graduate student in the department of biology at Heidelberg University in Germany.  The census, which will take place in January 2011, is designed to gather information about feral parrots: their habits and numbers. Since the coordinators cannot visit every city in the world where feral parrots reside, they are asking for your help: they want you to locate and count feral parrots in their roost trees and report this information on the World Parrot Count website, hosted by Leiden University.  &quot;Organisations like Observado, Sovon and my own City Parrots have been counting parakeets in different collaborations over the years,&quot; wrote Mr Jonker in an email.  Mr Jonker and Mr Braun are charged with developing strategies for conserving the increasing numbers of endangered parrot species.  &quot;When I look ahead, I see an ever-growing human population for the planet,&quot; writes Mr Jonker. &quot;With finite resources available, the conservation of many species will inevitably do without the ... attention they deserve. The focus of conservation biology has already shifted from preserving everything to preserving what is most precious -- for example the biodiversity hotspot concept.&quot; A biodiversity hotspot is a region that has a significant reservoir of native wildlife and plantlife that is under threat from humans. At least 25 areas around the world are recognized as biodiversity hotspots with nine more potential candidates. Together, these sites support nearly 60% of the world&apos;s plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with a very high number of endemic species. To achieve World Parrot Count&apos;s goals, the team realised that an organised census of feral parrots around the world was necessary. The first of these counts was conducted in 2004. Already, this small data set revealed that feral ring-necked parakeets, Psittacula krameri, of The Hague and Amsterdam are growing in number and are colonising new cities.  &quot;We know this because the roost counts from 2004 had about half the birds that we counted [in the following] year and we found new roosts in towns where parakeets were not known in 2004,&quot; explained Mr Jonker.  These data also provide unexpected insight into the feral parrots&apos; habitat preferences.  &quot;So we know they are expanding but also that they prefer urban areas to the agricultural and forested lands between towns. Now we [want] to get the same information for the many different urban parrot species around the globe for comparisons.&quot;  Starting in the 1960s, just a few of the smaller and less expensive parrot species successfully established feral breeding populations in a few locations where they are not native. These birds either escaped or were intentionally released. But now, more than 50 of the 356 extant parrot species have established viable breeding populations in urban and suburban areas, mostly throughout the Northern Hemisphere.  For example, I&apos;ve seen ring-necked parakeets in London and in Tokyo; red-masked parakeets, Aratinga erythrogenys, in San Francisco; hybrid conures in Seattle, and monk (Quaker) parakeets, Myiopsitta monachus in Brooklyn.  But these parrots are controversial.  &quot;Most [people] really like them but others are quick to remind them [that parrots] don&apos;t belong here and should be seen as alien invasives,&quot; remarked Mr Jonker.  But unlike other free-roaming alien species, such as domestic housecats, dogs, pigs, goats, and other animals, there aren&apos;t any published studies suggesting that feral parrots pose a problem to either native flora or fauna. Even ornithologists, bird watchers and naturalists are not sure what impacts, if any, that growing feral parrot populations have on native wildlife.  This is because, with rare exceptions, feral parrots live almost exclusively in or near cities, feeding on bird table offerings and other items that humans directly provide to them. They also feed on plants that humans cultivate -- many of which are alien species, too.  There is no scientific evidence that feral parrots out-compete native species for nest sites because most native cavity-nesting birds don&apos;t breed in cities unless (like woodpeckers) they construct their own nests or (like tits) use abandoned cavities or bird houses provided by humans.  Parrots are creative in their nesting behaviours: if they cannot find appropriate nesting sites, they&apos;ll come up with alternatives.  &quot;A population of ring-necked parakeets in Germany now actually prefers to breed in the nooks and crevices of city buildings -- a niche not usually exploited by native birds,&quot; report Mr Jonker.  Further, the &quot;urban habitat&quot; is a profoundly disturbed and altered niche that most native animals fled long ago, leaving the biologically impoverished concrete jungles to man and his coterie of pets, pests and domestic animals. Whilst most feral populations of parrots consist of common species, some are endangered in their native lands. Mexican yellow-headed amazons, Amazona oratrix, have become established in parts of Texas and -- perhaps surprisingly -- in Stuttgart, Germany (a city that suddenly has rocketed to the top of my &quot;must visit soon&quot; list).  Mr Jonker&apos;s main research interests include understanding why parrots are so successful in cities and how this quality can benefit parrot conservation in general. He finds that urban and suburban areas are attractive to parrots because they provide security. Cities offer suitable habitat; parks, zoos, botanical gardens and even golf courses. People don&apos;t walk around cities with shotguns in-hand and they rarely hunt birds for food. Further, some city-dwellers regularly feed birds and most large urban areas don&apos;t have many parrot predators.  So learning more about the growing urban populations of yellow-headed amazons and other endangered species can provide conservationists and parrot researchers with valuable information that might be useful for propagating rare or endangered parrots in cities for conservation purposes.  &quot;Many parrots have proven able to live in cities,&quot; Mr Jonker pointed out. &quot;We&apos;ve counted over 50 species. Since natural habitats tend to [become] more and more degraded, fragmented or even disappear altogether, it is only logical to shop for alternative habitats that could help the survival of parrots. We believe cities in the native ranges of these parrots could be such an alternative.&quot;  It is not known if certain species might be better candidates for this project, but among the new world parrots, Amazona, Brotogeris and many of the Aratinga species have shown remarkable abilities to colonise cities.  &quot;But this ability is by no means restricted to these genera,&quot; said Mr Jonker. &quot;[But] I would concentrate on species that need conservation. The species on the IUCN redlist will be our guide.&quot;  As proof of concept, the team is developing a plan to release captive-bred golden conures, Guaruba guarouba, in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil. These birds, a gift from a couple who resides in Brazil, were tentatively scheduled for release by the Bel\u00e9m Zoo in 2010. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funds to pay for airfare and pre-release enclosures, this project has stalled.

You dimly remember how a couple of years ago the Tory leader got excited by this book Nudge \u2013 with its anecdotes about how the staff at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport etched flies into the urinals to help men with their, um, aim, and its central message that sometimes people need a gentle push to eat better and save more money. And you read about how, just a few weeks after he got into No 10, Cameron set up a Nudge Unit to apply the thinking to public health, personal finance and the rest of government policy. And because you&apos;re a savvy media consumer, who still flicks through newspapers and keeps a few internet browsers open all day and listens to Radio 4 (if only for the swearwords), you also know the prosecution case on all this. That it&apos;s the government&apos;s way of tricking you into doing what it wants (such as signing up to be an organ donor). Or alternatively, that Nudge co-author-turned-government-adviser Richard Thaler is merely stating the obvious. So humans are more like Homer Simpson than Mr Spock; and for that they give you the keys to Downing Street? Like you, I&apos;ve seen the columns for and against. But I have yet to see the most serious charge made against the Nudge agenda: that the prime minister has taken a bunch of insights that are important, and potentially radical if applied to policy \u2013 and chopped them into a party pack of fun-sized ideas, handy for shovelling into white papers and media briefings, but robbed of their political power. What Nudge has become is a case study in how big ideas get corrupted. Let me explain what I mean. Richard Thaler is one of the world&apos;s top behavioural economists, who studies how people actually make decisions rather than how the classic economic models say they make them. As such, he has led the way in pointing out that much of what conventional economics thinks about individual behaviour, and how markets and economies work, is just a bunch of sloppy generalisations. While shopping, working, or even deciding on who to share their lives with, individuals are less thoughtful and less calculating than modern-day economists and politicians typically assume. Any critic who points out that that&apos;s hardly news to the women at Saatchi, the men at Tesco and, heavens, his own blessed grandma is spot on. But still, it poses a massive challenge to most economists and policy-makers. They work on the basis that people know what they&apos;re doing in buying and selling goods and services \u2013 and so that the markets in which they do those things generally work pretty well. The argument that markets generally work best has been made by successive governments, Tory and Labour, over the last three decades. And they have moved to introduce and extend markets in more and more areas of public life \u2013 from hospitals to schools to water suppliers. And it&apos;s happening again with universities, where the Browne review takes as one of its fundamental assumptions that &quot;students are best placed to make the judgment about what they want to get from participating in higher education&quot; \u2013 a lovely example of market-speak. Yet behavioural economics and a whole bunch of other sub-disciplines within economics point out that markets can sometimes work disastrously. Indeed, Nudge is pretty much a textbook on how we often misjudge decisions that seem footling at first but affect the rest of our lives. Browne may believe that our 18-year-old selves can easily make the potentially life-changing choices of the best modules of the best degree at the most suitable institutions. But he should have a look at a paper published this March by one of Thaler&apos;s behavioural colleagues, Uri Simonsohn. It shows that prospective students who visit a campus on a cloudy day are more likely to enrol there. Because students believe bad weather is a good reason to stay in and do homework, they think of (albeit temporarily) cloud-covered colleges as places for serious study. So a bit of drizzle can make all the difference between going to Newcastle, say, or to Kent. OK, hands up: that research was the most trivial thing I could find on university choice in one afternoon, but it fits with a whole raft of behavioural research that points out the limitations of the markets-know-best philosophy, and queries what exactly it is that conventional economics really knows. Not that you would know that from the Nudge agenda. Thaler has done some brilliant work on how to encourage people to save for their pensions \u2013 a big and important problem for which he has found innovative solutions. But in the vast bulk of Nudge and his work for Cameron he has opted to offer cute, technocratic solutions to mainly minor problems. Schoolkids getting fat? Redesign the canteen menu. Pesky hotel guests wasting towels? Stick up signs saying that other people behave much better. Oh, and your male customers missing the urinals? Etch a target into the porcelain. I would bet that Thaler will one day win a Nobel for his academic work, but in his current role as policy entrepreneur, brainstorming up and down Whitehall, he is not offering up his best insights. Of course, this is very handy for Cameron, who gets to wheel out a Chicago professor, tap into cutting-edge social science and feed the columnists some ideas-tofu. And when he wants to do serious policy, he can carry on marketising higher education, and inviting Pepsi, McDonald&apos;s and the rest to advise on how to get kids to eat better.", "sentences": ["You dimly remember how a couple of years ago the Tory leader got excited by this book Nudge \u2013 with its anecdotes about how the staff at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport etched flies into the urinals to help men with their, um, aim, and its central message that sometimes people need a gentle push to eat better and save more money."], "title": "Cameron's hijacking of Nudge theory is a classic example of how big ideas get corrupted | Aditya Chakrabortty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/07/david-cameron-hijacked-nudge-theory", "tags": ["Psychology", "Science", "Politics", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-07T20:59:00Z", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Friday 10 December 2010  The feature below examining what it&apos;s like to stay in a room at a new budget hotel in Amsterdam that comprises 215 shipping containers welded together incorrectly stated that &quot;it&apos;s a 14-metre square steel box&quot;. That would make it rather more roomy than it actually is \u2013 14 square metres.   Amsterdam is a good place to try new experiences. Sleeping in a shipping container is unlikely to be top of every visitor&apos;s list, but when I wake up after my first night at citizenM Centraal, the city&apos;s newest designer hotel, I feel like I&apos;ve seen the future of international travel \u2014 and it&apos;s a 14-metre square steel box. The hotel, made up of 215 shipping containers welded together over five floors, is one of a new breed of budget hotels that aim to make life easier for the cash-strapped 21st century traveller. It&apos;s a particularly Dutch idea \u2013 the lack of affordable housing in Amsterdam has meant local students have been living in homes made of shipping containers for years \u2013 but now it&apos;s becoming a huge hit with international travellers. As we&apos;re being asked to spend more on air taxes, checking in our baggage and even the privilege of using a credit card to pay for it all, hotels like this are springing up across the globe. The first budget hotels, such as Yotel and easyHotel, were constructed around airports and aimed at business travellers, but they&apos;ve become so popular with tourists that branches have started opening in city centres. They cater to those who travel light and don&apos;t mind forgoing a bit of space and privacy in exchange for affordable luxury in the world&apos;s most expensive cities. As I wash my hair in our room&apos;s &quot;rain shower&quot; cubicle before breakfast, I&apos;m able to watch my other half still asleep, curled up in our duvet, three feet from my navel. It feels a little strange, but it&apos;s all part of the experience, or so we&apos;re told. &quot;citizenM understands that mobile citizens want luxury without unwanted extras,&quot; says its self-consciously hip brochure, published on newsprint. &quot;That means great locations and great showers, big beds and big towels, free films and free Wi-Fi. In other words, big expectations for not so big prices.&quot; Those prices start at \u20ac79 a night \u2013 a snip compared to other Amsterdam hotels. &quot;Over the past year, we&apos;ve definitely noticed an increase both in the number of these hotels opening and also the number of bookings for them,&quot; says Andrew Warner, senior director of marketing at Expedia. &quot;They aren&apos;t just offering you a value-for-money proposition, but they&apos;re also giving you that sort of designer style you might expect from a more expensive hotel but at a very accessible price.&quot; &quot;This is the hotel equivalent of easyJet and Ryanair,&quot; says Nigel Pocklington of Hotels.com. &quot;The middle is getting squeezed. There&apos;s clearly a market for five-star luxury, and the expectations consumers have of that are ever-increasing, and the segment of consumers who are much more value-conscious are less happy to pay for a bog-standard three-star hotel. &quot;From what we can see, people who are staying in them are smarter and more experienced travellers because they&apos;ve figured out they can pay for things that are important to them, but not necessarily everything,&quot; he adds. &quot;It was a very clever concept when Ikea brought it to home furnishing, and frankly there are quite a lot of parallels there.&quot; He predicts that these kinds of hotels will start being rolled out across &quot;all of the classic weekend-break destinations over the next few years&quot;. citizenM certainly has global ambitions. There are two in Amsterdam \u2013 one at Schiphol airport and the new one in the city \u2013 while Britain&apos;s first branch opened its doors in Glasgow in September, and the first London citizenM will open on the South Bank next year. Another is being built in east London in time for the Olympics. Two sites in New York and Paris are also in the pipeline. Yotel, run by Simon Woodroffe of Yo! Sushi fame, is also cashing in on the trend. It has been offering rooms near airports since 2007 starting at \u00a325 for a four-hour stay. They&apos;ve been so popular that Yotel is opening a branch near New York&apos;s Times Square next year, which will house nearly 700 cabins. Its rooms are styled to look like first-class aeroplane cabins, with the biggest pods just 10 square metres. The easyHotel chain owns 13 budget hotels across Europe and one in Dubai, with five branches in central London. These are less about luxury \u2013 the cheapest rooms have a tiny six square metres of floor space and no windows \u2013 but with prices starting at \u00a325 a night, you get what you pay for, including easyJet&apos;s trademark screaming orange. &quot;It&apos;s really important that anyone who&apos;s thinking of staying in one of these hotels checks the reviews,&quot; says Warner. &quot;In some of the chains you might have to pay extra if you want your room cleaned. Some of them charge if you want toiletries or towels in the room. You need to be a little bit careful in terms of where some of the hidden costs might lie, which might push the price up beyond what you thought you were going to have to pay, for things you take for granted.&quot; Of course, these hotels aren&apos;t going to suit everybody. If you like a human being to check you in and help with your baggage, this certainly isn&apos;t for you. You need to be happy using gadgets and obviously not prone to claustrophobia. More than anything, you need to be sure you&apos;re very comfortable with the person who&apos;s sharing your room. While our toilets at citizenM had customisable light and temperature settings, the designers still hadn&apos;t figured out how to make them soundproof. If the future of international travel is affordable luxury, the traveller of the future might have to sacrifice a little bit of dignity to get it.", "sentences": ["The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Friday 10 December 2010  The feature below examining what it&apos;s like to stay in a room at a new budget hotel in Amsterdam that comprises 215 shipping containers welded together incorrectly stated that &quot;it&apos;s a 14-metre square steel box&quot;.", "Amsterdam is a good place to try new experiences.", "It&apos;s a particularly Dutch idea \u2013 the lack of affordable housing in Amsterdam has meant local students have been living in homes made of shipping containers for years \u2013 but now it&apos;s becoming a huge hit with international travellers.", "In other words, big expectations for not so big prices.&quot; Those prices start at \u20ac79 a night \u2013 a snip compared to other Amsterdam hotels.", "There are two in Amsterdam \u2013 one at Schiphol airport and the new one in the city \u2013 while Britain&apos;s first branch opened its doors in Glasgow in September, and the first London citizenM will open on the South Bank next year."], "title": "Stay in a shipping container \u2013 for hotel luxury on a budget", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/dec/07/shipping-container-hotel-luxury-budget", "tags": ["Hotels", "Amsterdam holidays", "Luxury travel", "Travel", "Netherlands holidays", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-09T10:21:38Z", "article": "Recession, what recession? Mulberry&apos;s luxury leather handbags are in big demand around the world, as the company increasingly becomes a global brand. The company&apos;s half year pretax profit has more than tripled from \u00a31.5m to \u00a34.7m, and it says full year figures will beat expectation. UK revenues rose 27% but US sales more than doubled and France up 189%, albeit from lower bases. During the six months to the end of September, it opened new stores in Hong Kong, Korea, Qatar and UAE. Since then it more have followed, including outlets in Sydney and Amsterdam and back home, a new flagship store in New Bond Street, London. It has agreed terms on a flagship store in Soho New York Chairman Godfrey Davis said   Mulberry has continued to increase sales and profitability during the first half of the year due to consistent demand for our products in all markets. Since September 2010 the pattern of strong demand has continued and the outlook for the second half of the year is very positive, with the full year performance likely to exceed market expectations.  But it said Christmas trading was key and it was still cautious about the global economic outlook. It maintained it will not offer discounts over the festive season, however. The new Alexa handbag range has joined its list of bestsellers, and it continues to develop its women&apos;s apparel and shoe business. In January comes the new Tillie family of bags. The company&apos;s shares have risen 4p to 874p on the news. Analyst David Stoddart at FinnCap said  The recent share price run had begun to price in another round of forecast upgrades. The interim announcement did not disappoint and we have increased our forecasts. We have lifted our target price sharply to \u00a310.40 to reflect the continuing outperformance of revenue and profit expectations. We continue to regard the global potential for the brand as substantial, and remain buyers.  Philip Dorgan at Altium Securities was also positive. He said:  Mulberry is developing into a truly global brand, as continued significant sales outperformance demonstrates. This should lead to sustained profit growth over many years and a move from sub 10% margins to over 20%. We are therefore increasing our pretax forecasts. For the current year, we are upgrading from \u00a313m to \u00a315m, for 2010/11 from \u00a318m to \u00a320m and for 2011/12 from \u00a322m to \u00a330m. We are increasing our target price again from 650p to \u00a310. The potential to move the brand from sales of \u00a370m last year to \u00a3200m over the next two years, means that we see scope to increase the target price further.

On a balmy evening, we sat around a long table overlooking a garden and a swimming pool. Thanksgiving dinner, that most American of rituals, had come to Johannesburg in South Africa. I was the sole Brit among a dozen US expats \u2013 my accent had never sounded so Monty Python \u2013 and joined in the talk of iPods and iPads, Barack Obama&apos;s prospects in 2012 and the struggle to find meat, fish and yoghurt in Johannesburg that can match that in the US, the consumer capital of the world. There is a cliche that Americans are insular beings who seldom own passports, but it seems to me that here they are more numerous \u2013 and conspicuous \u2013 than any other non-African expats. In recent weeks, I&apos;ve met people from New York, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. A film-maker from California said: &quot;I&apos;ve travelled a lot, but South Africa was the first time I felt I&apos;d come home. &quot;There were a lot of similarities, like the weather and landscape and food. It felt very comfortable. But the energy was completely different \u2013 open, untamed, a sense of possibility.&quot; Just as South Africans in London congregate in Wimbledon, there is an American enclave north of Johannesburg, near the American International School in Bryanston. But they come out in force for certain events, such as last week&apos;s exhibition and auction of pictures by Jo\u00e3o Silva, the New York Times photographer recently injured in Afghanistan. While other foreign ambassadors keep a low profile in Pretoria, America&apos;s Donald Gips can be found writing newspaper columns and giving interviews. His officials are seen at public events, posting messages on Twitter and discussing WikiLeaks on radio and television. Brooks Spector, a former US diplomat, is now the acting chief executive of South Africa&apos;s most famous playhouse, the Market Theatre. Guests at first nights of major productions often include representatives of the US grant-making body the Ford Foundation, another active presence here. Professor Lee Berger, from Georgia, is the Wits University palaeontologist who made the recent discovery of 1.9m-year-old skeletons that he claims belong to a previously unknown human ancestor. He described the fossils as a &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; in understanding human evolution. But what of other nationalities? Johannesburg is a magnet for people from all over the continent, including most of an estimated 2 million Zimbabwean refugees, but does not yet rank as a truly world city. From memory, I&apos;ve met three Australians, one Brazilian, two Canadians, one Dutch, two French, two Germans, one Indian, one Italian, two Swedes, one Taiwanese and one Thai and a dozen or so Brits, but many are journalists and others just passing through. I don&apos;t recall bumping into a single Chinese, Russian or Spaniard. One day, I was invited to lunch with the Norwegian ambassador to South Africa. He asked a question along the lines of: what do you know about Norway&apos;s activities in Africa? I wrestled with a blank expression, like Josh Lyman in The West Wing, and then asked him to tell me more. Go back further in time and South Africa has a rich history of immigration \u2013 black Africans from the north, Dutch traders in the 17th century, imported slaves from Indonesia, India-Ceylon, Madagascar and Mozambique, then the British, including the 1820 settlers. Last month marked the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the first indentured workers from India \u2013 their descendents now make up 2.5% of the population but, the government noted, punch well above their weight. A compelling TV series, Have You Heard from Johannesburg, reflected on the antagonism between Afrikaners and the Dutch during apartheid. The Dutch held street protests, invited Oliver Tambo, of the African National Congress, to speak and mounted exhibitions at the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam condemning the new Nazism in South Africa. They regarded the Afrikaners as a rotten apple that fell far from the tree. The Afrikaners felt isolated, alone and betrayed by their parents. Afrikaners remain prominent in South Africa today, but white people of British descent seem less so \u2013 perhaps in a characteristic strain of understatement. Except, that is, in certain neighbourhoods of Cape Town or, I have discovered, in cinemas broadcasting a play from the National Theatre in London. Of course, Britishness comes with certain symbolic expectations. The UK high commission \u2013 which has tweeters of its own \u2013 invited me to a screening of the Last Night of the Proms. The South African media were keen to know what I thought about Prince William&apos;s engagement to Kate Middleton. There was a minor rumpus when South Africa&apos;s national public broadcaster failed to cover the royal announcement on its evening news. But does being far from home help define my nationality, sharpening my awareness of what Britishness means? Not really. Victorian explorers might have felt sweet pangs of yearning, like lovelorn teenagers, for the mother country \u2013 but, in the digital age, you are never far from home. Jeremy Clarkson, Doctor Who and Wolverhampton Wanderers are still on my TV, the Guardian and the Telegraph are still on my screen, the sounds of Start the Week and I&apos;m Sorry I Haven&apos;t a Clue still float down the internet. Steve Jobs has killed the Englishman abroad. And, in any case, in a world of tribalism and arbitrary borders, I&apos;m a non-believer. Nothing in my experience here has persuaded me that nationality is anything more than a convenient label, like supporting a football team, that is ultimately less defining than class, gender, race, religion and other variables. I generally find I have more in common with an American journalist, or a South African journalist, than I do with a British carpenter or chemist. Likewise, the political commentator Eusebius McKaiser argues that there is no such thing as a &quot;South African&quot;. He wrote recently: &quot;Practically, what does a common South African national identity refer to? &quot;Do I have to like rugby? Soccer? Cricket? Must I have a braai at least once a month? Koeksisters on Sunday? Obsess about race, perhaps? Cry while watching reruns of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the following day threaten to leave for Sydney in a fit of seemingly typical South African mania? &quot;The problem is obvious. If you throw too many goodies into your list of things that make us South African, then you will exclude many people.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Dutch held street protests, invited Oliver Tambo, of the African National Congress, to speak and mounted exhibitions at the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam condemning the new Nazism in South Africa."], "title": "Johannesburg: A magnet for millions, but not yet a truly world city", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/09/johannesburg-letter-from-africa", "tags": ["South Africa", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-09T16:36:53Z", "article": "Pop phenomenon Lady Gaga has an undeniably distinctive style \u2013 she has donned cuddly Kermit the frog suits, transparent bubble dresses and outfits made entirely of raw animal flesh.

The new buses will go some way towards tackling this dire problem, says Hart. &quot;All that comes out of these buses is water vapour, so you don&apos;t get all of the nasty nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and particulate matter that diesel buses pump out into the air.&quot; The buses may also reduce carbon emissions \u2013 but only if the hydrogen they run on is generated using renewable electricity rather than electricity produced by burning coal, he said. One key hurdle to rolling out the buses across the UK is cost \u2013 but Edwards is optimistic that the situation will improve soon. &quot;This technology is currently very new, with these buses being designed to suit the London operating environment. As such, with development costs, these buses are typically more expensive than their traditional hybrid diesel counterpart. But as the technology is proven along with the environment benefits they bring, the commercial market for these buses should open up and we expect the costs to drop dramatically,&quot; he said. London is one of a handful of cities around the world to adopt hydrogen buses. In May 2003, Madrid became the first city in the world to run a regular hydrogen bus service. Hamburg, Perth and Reykjavik quickly followed suit. Berlin&apos;s Clean Energy Partnership project, which began in 2006, aims to put 14 hydrogen buses and 40 hydrogen cars on the road by 2016. The largest hydrogen project in the world \u2013 the Hydrogen Highway \u2013 is based in California and has so far built 30 refuelling stations.

A capacity crowd \u2013 more women than men, some in retro-style fur, houndstooth and animal prints \u2013 has turned out for the final of this year&apos;s Tournament of Tease, an amateur contest that has become an institution on London&apos;s burlesque scene. &quot;I come for the tassles!&quot; says Arthur, a 25-year-old financial trader and burlesque regular, who has dragged three wary colleagues along. &quot;It&apos;s very creative,&quot; he hastily adds. &quot;Anyone can join in.&quot; When I ask if he&apos;s also been to strip clubs, he wrinkles his nose. &quot;Sure, but that has nothing to do with this. There, it&apos;s a business thing \u2013 the girls do it for the money. Here, no one does it for the money.&quot; Does he find it hot? &quot;It&apos;s not really about that.&quot; &quot;Why did you invite us if it&apos;s not hot?&quot; asks one of his friends. &quot;To broaden your mind. It&apos;s fun!&quot; Fifteen years into its latest revival, burlesque remains contentious: reactionary or exploitative to some, liberating or carnivalesque to others. Women disrobing on stage is anathema to those who reject the commercialisation of the female body \u2013 an objection arguably complicated by the subgenre of &quot;boylesque&quot;, featuring male performers. And it&apos;s rejected on formal grounds by parts of the underground performance scene from which it emerged (&quot;I hate burlesque and would never book it,&quot; says Pablo Flack of East End venue Bistrotheque). But look at the figures. There are around two dozen burlesque shows a week in London, with up to 40 more across the UK. There are thriving scenes from Vancouver to Amsterdam, festivals, documentaries and a growing shelf of histories, academic studies and how-to guides. Crossover performers are stars: America&apos;s Dita von Teese is an industry in her own right, while the UK&apos;s Immodesty Blaize launches Dior cosmetics. &quot;People like to discover and be part of an underground scene,&quot; says Chaz Royal, producer of over 600 shows since 2001. &quot;A lot of patrons still feel they&apos;re witnessing something novel.&quot; Cementing its mainstream position, burlesque is hitting the big screen. In Burlesque (out Friday) a big-budget, rags-to-riches Hollywood musical, Christina Aguilera goes from waiting tables to headlining at a glam Los Angeles burlesque bar; and in the French film On Tour (released last Friday), producer Mathieu Amalric shepherds a troupe of performers around small French towns. The films present very different images of burlesque. In Burlesque, it&apos;s about learning rote dance moves for slick shows with no nudity \u2013 as showcased by Aguilera on Saturday&apos;s X Factor. In the smaller film \u2013 in which real-life pioneering New York neo-burlesquers including Dirty Martini and Julie Atlas Muz play themselves \u2013 the work is raunchy and self-determined, closer to the reality of a contemporary burlesque show. &quot;This reflects my personality,&quot; one performer tells their producer. &quot;It&apos;s what I want to do on stage, OK? It&apos;s not for you.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a mistake to try and make it commercial, to choose model-type women and hire choreographers to do flashy moves,&quot; Martini tells me by phone from Rome, where she&apos;s performing. &quot;What makes burlesque popular is the fact that people know it&apos;s DIY, that the performer has their own vision and reason to do it.&quot; Martini arrived in New York in 1993 as a classically trained dancer, but struggled to find work. She instead found inspiration in the satire of gay drag and in vintage burlesque footage showing performers of wildly differing body types. Soon Martini was on stage, pulling a feather boa out of her backside to the strains of Proud to Be an American. Many of the UK performers are trained in performance arts, but aside from a tiny number whose business acumen is more formidable than their talent, few make a living from burlesque. Fees range from around \u00a370 to \u00a3400 for star acts, estimates Sharon Kay, founder of RetroTease, the scene&apos;s online social network, and the Burlesque Baby booking agency and training academy. &quot;Most [performers] would love to do it full time,&quot; Kay says, &quot;but 70-80% do it because they love it. It&apos;s a big bonding opportunity and for a lot of people it&apos;s art.&quot; From bling to &apos;chavlesque&apos; Contemporary burlesque acts cover a gamut of formal approaches, from cheesecake glamour to social satire. There&apos;s no airtight definition but broadly speaking, burlesque involves the revelation of the female body (nipples and vagina excepted) through the self-conscious performance of rituals of femininity \u2013 some conventional, some less so. Whether you find it reactionary, carnivalesque, radical or banal will depend on your own tastes, political standpoint and, of course, the calibre of the performer. For Jacki Willson, author of the 2008 study The Happy Stripper: Pleasures and Politics of the New Burlesque, successful burlesque injects real bodies, personality, erotic pleasure and lived experience into stereotypes. Burlesque, she thinks, can be a healthy way of exploring the fact of women&apos;s &quot;object status&quot;. &quot;It brings to centre stage the idea of woman as spectacle,&quot; she tells me. &quot;We&apos;re still living in an environment where there&apos;s a complete onslaught of a certain image [of female beauty].&quot; Seen this way, burlesque is a form that explores areas of cultural ambiguity around bodies and identity. Stars like Von Teese and Blaize are at the ultra-glamorous end of the spectrum and it&apos;s not always clear that their painstaking enactment of conventional glamour \u2013 what Blaize has described as &quot;a velvety, decadent cocoon&quot; \u2013 offers much more than escapist glitz. Whatever punters at Blaize&apos;s recent performance in Mayfair got in return for their \u00a3180 tickets \u2013 bubbly, salmon and two 10-minute turns involving furs, bling and a glittering eight-foot rocking horse \u2013 social commentary was thin on the ground. The aesthetic of fans, corsets and stockings remains the most visible but least characterful side of burlesque. Production values are not the same as meaningful engagement \u2013 though aspirational audiences warm to the implicit suggestion that the accoutrements of glamour can substitute for stereotypically attractive looks, or indeed conspicuous talent. Other performers offer satire. Audacity Chutzpah does a feminist-themed routine moving from Pankhurst to power dressing. In her &quot;chavlesque&quot; act, Kiki Kaboom plays with class stereotypes, shedding a hoodie while demanding: &quot;You looking at me?&quot; And at the most outre end of the scene, Sabrina Sweepstakes unceremoniously removes her clothes before smearing clay over her head and carving grotesque features into it. Then there&apos;s boylesque, which tends towards camp. Some, such as svelte troupe More or Lesque, draw on dance training to deliver homoerotic pop-culture pastiches (Brokeback Mountain, James Bond), while Spencer Maybe generally sings before baring his flesh. Like burlesque, boylesque can be most potent when celebrating unconventional body types: hairy-and-loving-it troupe the Bears can tear a room apart. &apos;Any body can do it&apos; If the content can vary in tone and quality, there are certain consistent conventions; a burlesque show can seem almost like adult pantomime. Cheers are expected at key moments of undress \u2013 it&apos;s literally rude not to \u2013 and the women in the audience tend to offer even more vociferous encouragement than the men. From one perspective, the scene&apos;s current popularity means demand is sufficiently high for mediocre acts to thrive. But from another point of view, mediocrity is an asset \u2013 that is, audiences are willing to celebrate performers simply for having the confidence to put themselves on display. Amateurism \u2013 or at least a kind of permeability between performer and audience \u2013 is sometimes the point. At the Tournament of Tease final, for instance, two separate turns see performers rejected by men, moping to All By Myself then taking self-assertive pleasure in their bodies \u2013 one involving a lot of cake \u2013 to massive whoops of applause. In another, Betsy Boudoir, an older woman in a white two-piece suit mimes getting trapped in a lift then tearing her clothes off in a frenzy. Her timing is spot on, her enjoyment palpable. When Betsy is announced as winner, the 20-strong party accompanying her, including her mother and husband, go wild. &quot;With burlesque, it doesn&apos;t matter what age, shape, size colour you are,&quot; Betsy \u2013 aka 48-year-old Adele Bolkansky \u2013 tells me. &quot;It&apos;s about attitude. The human body is beautiful. Literally any body can do it.&quot; &quot;I really like the atmosphere here,&quot; says Lisa, a 48-year-old psychotherapist. &quot;It&apos;s not lewd. The women chose to perform. To get up there and be proud of their body in front of 250 people is very empowering. A lot of them seem to be working through stuff in their performances. It&apos;s a bit like therapy.&quot; Arthur&apos;s friends seem convinced, too. I ask one, Ricardo, how he found his first burlesque experience. &quot;Very interesting,&quot; he says. &quot;Surprisingly so. I\u00a0expected the worst \u2013 some kind of strip club. My colleague has been trying to drag me here forever. But this was creative, entertaining, very funny. Now I&apos;m upset he didn&apos;t bring me before.&quot;", "sentences": ["There are thriving scenes from Vancouver to Amsterdam, festivals, documentaries and a growing shelf of histories, academic studies and how-to guides."], "title": "Burlesque: the daily grind", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/13/burlesque-dita-von-teese-christina-aguilera", "tags": ["Burlesque", "Theatre", "Stage", "Film", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-14T21:30:03Z", "article": "Tuesday, 10 November 2009, 09:04C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 001179 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 11/05/2024 TAGS PGOV, SNAR, KCOR, GH SUBJECT: GHANAIAN CONCERN OVER DRUG SMUGGLING BY VIP PASSENGERSREF: ACCRA 1070Classified By: Ambassador Donald Teitelbaum for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) . 1. (C) SUMMARY: On November 4, the head of the UK&apos;s &quot;Operation Westbridge,&quot; the British government&apos;s anti-narcotics operation at Accra International Airport, told Poloff that President John Atta Mills wants itemizers for the Presidential suite at the airport to screen his entourage for drugs when leaving the country, and that the Narcotics Control Board&apos;s (NACOB) placement of officers in the VVIP lounge at the airport has led to a decline in the number of departing passengers using the lounge. O&apos;Hagan also said he believes that two of the USG-funded itemizers at the airport were rendered useless by sabotage and suggested that airlines might be willing to pay for itemizer maintenance. END SUMMARY 2. (C) Poloff met November 4 with Roland O&apos;Hagan, Project Manager for Operation Westbridge and an official with the UK Border Agency. O&apos;Hagan said that President Mills had expressed interest in acquiring itemizers for the Presidential suite at the airport in order to screen his entourage for drugs before boarding any departing flight. According to O&apos;Hagan, Mills wants these officials to be checked in the privacy of his suite to avoid any surprises if they are caught carrying drugs. The itemizers, similar to those provided several years ago by the U.S. Embassy through INL funding, would be sensitive, portable screening devices that can detect the drug content in minuscule drops of human sweat after recent external contact or for up to three weeks after ingestion. 3. (C) O&apos;Hagan also said that NACOB believes that the VVIP lounge at the airport has been a source of drugs leaving the country. Passengers leaving the lounge are driven directly to the plane and are not searched before departure. NACOB placed two officers in the lounge to screen departing passengers, and the number of passengers using the VVIP lounge has decreased. (COMMENT: The Executive Secretary of NACOB previously told Poloffs that bank managers, pastors, and their wives were given official passports and access to the lounge by the Kufuor administration and questioned why these middle class travelers were awarded privileges traditionally reserved for cabinet ministers. END COMMENT) 4. (C) O&apos;Hagan noted that among four itemizers provided to the GOG to detect drug smugglers among airline passengers, all are now non-functioning. According to O&apos;Hagan, two itemizers that the USG gave to NACOB are still operational. O&apos;Hagan said that the airport itemizers were kept in a dusty, un-air conditioned room that caused them to break frequently. He noted that the airport director promised in October 2008 to install an air conditioner in the store room, but that she left her job two weeks after making the promise, and an air conditioner has not been installed. 5. (C) Maintenance of the itemizers is an on-going concern. The equipment has broken frequently since it arrived, but O&apos;Hagan said that the last two operational machines were incapacitated by sabotage. He believes the machines were sabotaged because they were in a storage room, and the filters were removed. The knowledge required to remove the filters exceeded the basic knowledge of the operators. 6. (C) O&apos;Hagan said that he believes the airlines might be willing to pay for the itemizers to be repaired, and specifically mentioned KLM and Delta. He noted that the cost of maintenance on the itemizers is less than the cost of diverting flights on which passengers suffer drug overdoses. Within the last few months, said O&apos;Hagan, KLM has diverted to Spain two flights from Accra to Amsterdam because passengers started vomiting drugs. In both cases, the passenger died.

His songs have been described as &quot;digital symphonies&quot;, resulting from chopping up sounds, melodies, handclaps and so on from tracks such as R&amp;B queen Brandy&apos;s Angel in Disguise, as featured here \u2013 and reassembling them to form new shapes. In the Guardian&apos;s New Band of the Day column, Paul Lester hailed this as &quot;abstract R&amp;B arranged with a Cubist disregard for form&quot;. Sheer futurist invention. ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieNairobi - Minerals       Nairobi is a dub band based in Buenos Aires. Approaching dub from a diverse perspective, they create vibrant climates and fresh interpretations of the genre. This song is the first single from their second album, Wet, which was mixed at Mad Professor&apos;s studio in London and features Roberto Pettinato on saxophone. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Miracle - A Big Jet Plane       I recently discovered this 18-year-old rapper who was born in Ghana but now residing in western Sydney. The word is that he got signed to his label based on a song sampling Pete Murray&apos;s Better Days, a track he made for his high school music assignment and eventually became his first single. Personally, I liked his version of Angus And Julia Stone&apos;s hit Big Jet Plane better.  BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoDiego e O Sindicato - Amigo       Influenced by 70s Brazilian rock and tropicalism, amongst other musical styles such as psychedelic rock and even samba, Amigo is a great taster of Parte De N\u00f3s (&quot;Part Of Us&quot;), the first full-length record by Diego e O Sindicato, released last month. The album is available to download for free at Compacto.REC, a netlabel focused on independent Brazilian music. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicOlenka &amp; The Autumn Lovers - Sparrow       Olenka &amp; The Autumn Lovers&apos; newest album, And Now We Sing, is just about the finest folk-pop album you could ever ask for. It brilliantly blends together Eastern European-tinged folk, smoky jazz, country and a variety of other elements to create an album that&apos;s easily one of the best to come out in 2010. Sparrow showcases Olenka&apos;s Eastern European roots. CHILE       Super 45Los Nadieh - Lisa y llanamente       Los Nadieh are members of Potoco Discos, the independent label that houses Como Asesinar a Felipes (an excellent jazz trio with a DJ and MC), who proclaim to play &quot;the other kind of rap&quot;. That claim also defines the approach of this band from Valpara\u00edso, homesickly looking at the harbour city but showing their feelings by experimenting with the formal structures of hip hop. This scorn for risk is reflected on Desde El \u00daltimo Lugar, their debut, backed up by local heavyweight Foex (ex-member of FDA and a contributor to the increasingly successful Ana Tijoux). CHINA       WooozyRainbow Danger Club - Neighbors On The Rooftops       With riveting, epic melodies that soar and patter along majestically, the Rainbow Danger Club manage to effortlessly skirt the line between beauty and ugliness, light and dark, innocence and depravity. One of the greatest bands to emerge from the Shanghai music scene lately, they never cease to amaze audiences with their grandiose musicality and adeptness at crafting songs that don&apos;t seem to leave your head. Their debut EP, The New Atlantis, is not to be missed. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaCapzula - Lo Dejamos Asi       Capzula have been the surprise of 2010 in the pop/rock scene of Colombia thanks to their popular single Rock. Big things are expected of them in 2011 and their new single Lo Dejamos Asi clearly shows they can rise to that responsibility. DENMARK       All ScandinavianSleep Party People - A Dark God Heart       In late November, Danish label Vuf released the sixth in their renowned series of compilations titled The Vuf Compilation #6 - Back To Nature, sporting 12 tracks by established and upcoming Danish and Swedish artists, half working in alternative pop/rock and half in electronica. Among them is critically acclaimed one-man dreampop act Sleep Party People aka Brian Batz, whose hauntingly beautiful B-side A Dark God Heart is the final Danish MAP track of 2010. If you crave more, the compilation is available for free download here. ESTONIA       PopopMultiphonic Rodent - Printsess &amp; Page       Multiphonic Rodent is the nom de plume of multi-instrumentalist composer Erkki H\u00f5be. Mainly known as the founder member of Opium Flirt, he has been doing home recordings since 2005 and playing live as a one-man big band on guitars, percussion, keys and wind instruments since 2008. His multi-layered style is influenced by classical minimalism, avant-garde jazz and psychedelic rock, to name a few stylistic origins. FINLAND       GlueThe Friend - New Berlin Wall       The Friend play melodic indie-rock music to make people dance, or, in their own words, they play &quot;songs that are brisk, atmospheric, playful, three-and-a-half-minutes-long compact packages&quot;. Take a listen to their first single, New Berlin Wall, while we wait for their first full-length to be released early next year. GERMANY       BlogparteiDizzy Errol - Pride       Dizzy Errol is the one and only Turkish beatnik in Germany. His name perfectly describes his fuzzy, straightforward sound. Pride is the most powerful song on the album Motherlamp from 2010. Dizzy Errol is part of the artist collective Kamerakino, who recently released a compilation named Infant Munich Hits Rock Bottom, which is quite a nice sample of the city&apos;s underground music. GREECE       MouxlalouloudaAbbie Gale - Terry Torry A List       Abbie Gale&apos;s third studio album, No Inspiration, an impressive addition to their catalogue, showcases a sweeping collection of 11 songs that are at once riveting, dreamy and sonically lush, swelling and tranquil. Gripping melodies are embellished with whirling arrangements, spirited outbursts and Evira&apos;s wide-ranging, emotive, splendidly affecting vocals. Terry Torry A List feels simultaneously familiar and challenging. It&apos;s a compelling, intricate song in which to lose yourself. It gets under the skin and unfurls its majesty from the first play. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaN\u00f3ra - Opin Fyrir Mor\u00f0i       N\u00f3ra started in a dark garage on the west side of Reykjav\u00edk. In 2006, brother and sister Egill and Au\u00f0ur, along with their friend Hrafn, started as a trio. In 2008, the band became a quintet when Bragi and Frank joined. They play honey-glazed indie-pop influenced by Radiohead, Bob Dylan, TV On The Radio, The Mars Volta, The Pixies, Roy Orbison and Neil Young. Opin Fyrir Mor\u00f0i is taken from their debut album, Er Einhver A\u00f0 Hlusta? (&quot;Is Anyone Listening?&quot;), which was released in early summer. INDIA       IndiecisionTempo Tantrick - Psychoblabber       Tempo Tantrick is a trip hop duo from Bangalore. Their sound palette ranges from downtempo to pulsing EDM that finds a likely home in clubs open to both electronica and experimental. Psychoblabber falls squarely in the latter end of the Tempo Tantrick soundscape. The track features an irresistible, throbbing refrain reminiscent of Shiny Toy Guns. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarKelelawar Malam - Suara Kegelapan       Kelelawar Malam means &quot;Night Bat&quot;; Suara Kegelapan means &quot;Voice of Darkness&quot;. The band name and song title already set a hint of horror, and their lyrics were written as though they were intended for horror B-movie scripts, with old Indonesian villages as the setting. The music is heavily influenced by The Misfits.  IRELAND       Nialler9James Vincent McMorrow - If I Had A Boat       Having captivated Ireland with his falsetto folk ballads, McMorrow has signed to Vagrant Records in the US. A self-titled EP is currently acquainting itself with international ears and here&apos;s your chance to do the same. If I Had A Boat is the first song from the EP and a perfect introduction to McMorrow&apos;s oaky timbre. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelWinterhorde - The Tenth Wave       Winterhorde is a blacker than the blackest black metal band from the north of Israel. Unfortunately, Israel&apos;s north is pretty black right now itself with hundreds of acres of forest destroyed by the largest fire in the country&apos;s history with a death toll of over 40. In any case, Winterhorde&apos;s sonic path twists from symphonic melodies to sheer straight-up metal intensity, melding these two extremes with elegance and professionalism. Winterhorde will freeze your soul with its echoes of longing, darkness and unrelenting desperation. Good stuff created in a classic vein. ITALY       Polaroid(m+a) - (we)       Michele and Alessandro (hence the name of the band) are two young, talented boys from the town of Forl\u00ec. That&apos;s more or less all I know about this project. But then there are these amazing sounds: gloomy glitch electronica with a warm acoustic heart and a cool touch of fresh pop which goes from Radiohead to Plaid via Hot Chip, if you need some kind of weird recipe. This is a song from their incoming second album but you can download their first one for free at their website. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaTroker - Planeta Terror       Guadalajara-based &apos;jazz vinyl&apos; band Troker was formed in 2005 by six conservative musicians and has developed into a powerful, danceable and naughty funk-rock sound - a groovy horn section, violent drums, a sexy piano and spicy scratches that make the turntables work as a roll &apos;n&apos; roll instrument through a jazz-based structure. Planeta Terror is one of the delightfully sour tracks from their second album El Rey Del Camino. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamThe Benelux - Pet Needs Friends (Bear remix)       This Amsterdam indie quartet are fresh, frisky and dancefloor flammable. There are certainly retro guitar-pop elements at play here, such as their saucy bursts of swaggering guitar jangle. But any hints of classic garage rock are mixed with quirky synths and fun, big beat grooves. So much so that their Girl Singer EP is topped off with remixes by NON Records labelmates Palmbomen and Bear. The tracks lend themselves perfectly to dance-friendly interpretations - Soulwax come to mind in this sense - which is why we&apos;ve chosen the Bear remix of Pet Needs Friends as a party-starting introduction. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatPikachunes - Nervous       Miles Loveless&apos; commanding baritone strides atop his lofty synth lines and unrepentant drum machine tracks, riding a dance wave like that of LCD Soundsystem. On the bedroom producer&apos;s song Nervous, a Knight Rider-esque bassline cavorts with a floating, flutey synth that comes in with Loveless&apos;s emotionless, almost monotone voice providing a laconic environment for his social awkwardness to shine. Pikachunes released his debut self-titled album on Lil&apos; Chief Records last month, and he has a great video for the song Shout It Out. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceUno M\u00f8ller - Your Quiet Little House       Singer-songwriter Uno M\u00f8ller plays beautiful minimalistic pop with just the sound of his fragile voice coupled with the playful tones of an acoustic guitar. His debut album was released a few months ago on the British label Lazy Acre Records. He&apos;s also a part of Team Me, a promising band that has been praised both in and outside Norway. They&apos;ve been booked to play at \u00d8yafestivalen and by:Larm next year, but let&apos;s hope Uno has more time for his solo project too. PERU       SoTBKid Solano - Solano Swing       Think of a perfect party in a place where night is eternal and the collective dancing turns everyone into a jumping mass. Now imagine the perfect song to accompany those moments and the result would be something like Solano Swing. Make space in your record collection for the amazing lounge/breakbeat of Kid Solano. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Minta &amp; The Brook Trout - Large Amounts       Minta is Francisca Cortes\u00e3o - a talented singer, musician and composer who has been in other bands and works as a session and live musician. The Brook Trout are Mariana Ricardo, Manuel Dordio and Jos\u00e9 Vil\u00e3o, friends of Minta who collaborated on her first album, Minta &amp; The Brook Trout. Minta&apos;s sound will please fans of the likes of Beth Orton or Belle &amp; Sebastian. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseMakunouchi Bento - Anchorshaped Siren       Makunouchi Bento is an experimental project with influences from musique concr\u00e8te to IDM. Their lunchbox has many more surprises than anyone could imagine. There are two main directions in their sound - the use of electronic gadgets (Spectrum, C64, Amiga, Atari) and sampling as the key for a haunting cinematic atmosphere. This could easily be the soundtrack of a David Lynch film or a rainy, gray Romanian December afternoon. Their album, Swim\u00e9, can be downloaded for free from Bandcamp. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopRachel Sermanni - Eggshells       Rachel Sermanni is a talent worth swooning over. The 19-year-old from the Highlands cites her idols as Joni Mitchell and Eva Cassidy, which makes perfect sense when you find yourself enchanted by her pure, fragile vocals and poetic lyrics. A star in the making for sure. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...The Lard Brothers - Wish You&apos;ll Never Leave Time (Ownself Remix)       The Lard Brothers have carved a niche for themselves remixing and reworking songs by other Singaporean bands, sometimes roping in outside collaborators in the process. Their approach ensures their work isn&apos;t so much a rehash of existing material as it is a means of bringing the music community together, and giving us a fresh take on Singaporean music. Their latest release, the Bonsai Warriors EP, stays on the same track but fittingly leaves room at the end for a remix of themselves, a glorious uplifting on their 2008 original. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Reburn - Outta My Mind       Reburn is a five-piece alternative rock band whose mix of catchy beats and a quirky feel has seen them rise to the forefront of the local scene. Outta My Mind encompasses the band&apos;s sound, which is distinctly British-influenced with its polished tone and a slight indie edge. Reburn&apos;s motto is that the band was brought to life for no reason other than to make &quot;music for pleasure&quot; and that they do. Stylishly so. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKImage - Empty Universe       Female singer-songwriter Image has already been active for more than a decade, but it wasn&apos;t until fall this year that she presented her first digital EP, Metaphoricalizing. Determined to make music of veracity, Image combines both acoustic and electronic elements when giving life to the folk ethos she wishes to express. Empty Universe is the main track off Metaphoricalizing and will be recorded in an English version for her upcoming first CD album. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerOdio Par\u00eds - Ya No Existes       We don&apos;t have any reason to hate Paris, but apparently this five-piece band from Barcelona does. Odio Par\u00eds, who have supported The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, are influenced by shoegaze legends The Jesus And Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine, but they also take inspiration from Spain&apos;s biggest indie band, Los Planetas. Ya No Existes, their first single, is living proof of that as it recreates the characteristic distortion of the Andalusians&apos; early releases. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseLe Days - Ring Baby Ring       Le Days (aka Daniel Hedin) has announced the upcoming release of a debut album titled Dead People On Tape. The predominant instrument may be an acoustic guitar but this is by no means folk music. It&apos;s a disturbing blend of over the top emo and confessional rock \u00e0 la Jeff Buckley. The first single in all its tormented glory namedrops Judas, curses violently and lays its heart on its proverbial sleeve. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Bianca Story - Coming Home       You thought Switzerland was neutral? It&apos;s not. We&apos;re totally asking you to take sides with our quest to bring better music to the world. Our weapon of mass seduction: The Bianca Story, a five-piece from Basel. Their sound is best described as &quot;pop taken seriously&quot; - you get the catchy tunes but with added layers of depth. Their latest single, Coming Home, is an appetizer to their second album due for release in 2011. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingPainted Palms - All Of Us       San Francisco&apos;s Painted Palms aren&apos;t the first experimental pop band to take cues from Animal Collective, but they&apos;re perhaps the most unique of the bunch. Combining a wild assortment of genres from Afro-pop to krautrock to electro-pop, the tracks on their debut Canopy EP (free download here) are equally addictive as they are artful, bringing a smile to even the most jaded of listeners.

The Dutch government and major municipalities are preparing contingency plans to respond to the anticipated release in early February of a short film expected to be critical of the Koran and of Islam made by Dutch Parliamentarian Geert Wilders. Extensive Dutch and international press reporting on the film has indicated that the film is likely to be inflammatory, and possibly include comparisons between the Koran and Mein Kampf, as well as scenes of the Koran being burned or ripped up. Wilders, whose right-wing populist Freedom Party (PVV) has an anti-immigration platform, has made statements in the past year that the Koran is a &quot;fascist and violent&quot; book that should be banned in the Netherlands. Officials from the MFA and Office of the National Counter Terrorism Coordinator have told Emboffs that the Dutch government is concerned about the potential for violent reaction to the film, especially in the Muslim world, and will be proactive in addressing the film, both to disassociate the government from Wilders&apos; views and to ensure public safety at home. The city governments of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, which have large Dutch Muslim populations, are actively engaged in planning to act swiftly to prevent, and if necessary, suppress violence following the film&apos;s release. End Summary. ---------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- ---------------------- APPLYING THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DANISH CARTOON CRISIS ----------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ----------- 2. (C) Andre van Wiggen, Deputy Director of the MFA&apos;s Terrorism and New Threats Department, told Emboffs January 16 that the Dutch government has been discussing strategies for responding to an event similar to the release of the Wilders film &quot;since the Danish cartoon crisis.&quot; He said that the interagency security steering group established to ensure that the Dutch government would be adequately prepared to respond to threats to Dutch interests at home or abroad had been meeting &quot;intensively&quot; since the government first got word in mid-October of Wilders&apos; intent to make a film on the Koran. Van Wiggen said that Wilders had told National Counter Terrorism Coordinator (NCTb) Tjibbe Joustra that he would not release the film before early February, and had committed to notifying NCTb 24 hours in advance of its release. Separately, a contact at NCTb confirmed to RSO that Wilders had commited to providing NCTb 24 hours notice, and an opportunity to review the tape, prior to release. Van Wiggen expressed confidence that Wilders would abide by this commitment. He requested that this information be kept very close hold within the USG. The security steering group is chaired by the Deputy National Counter Terrorism Coordinator and includes representatives from the Interior, Justice, and Foreign Ministries and the AIVD intelligence service. 3. (C) Van Wiggen stated that the government was prepared to be proactive in responding to the film and reactions to it once it was released, but did not provide specifics. He said that the planning group had an idea of the film&apos;s content, and anticipated the film would cite certain verses from the Koran and end with a &quot;symbolic act.&quot; He did not indicate whether government officials had seen any portion of the film. He said the GONL anticipated a &quot;stronger&quot; reaction to the film abroad, in particular in the Muslim world, than in the Netherlands, where he said many were already displaying &quot;Wilders fatigue,&quot; which might blunt violent reactions. He said the security group&apos;s scenarios predicted that reactions abroad could be more widespread and violent than the reactions to the Danish cartoons. He did not rule out the potential for violent protests in the Netherlands, adding that a police and public safety coordinating group had also been established to develop contingency plans for maintaining public order, especially in the four largest cities. Ensuring adequate protection for foreign missions in The Netherlands, he said, was an essential component of the group&apos;s planning process. An official in NCTb&apos;s Surveilance and Protection Department told RSO in a separate conversation that NCTb and The Hague police meet at least bi-weekly to review security measures in the city, in particular with regard to high value buildings, including the U.S. Embassy. 4. (C) Van Wiggen stressed that while the government was prepared to be proactive, they also wanted to ensure that they took &quot;the right measures at the right time.&quot; In particular, he said, it was critical to avoid a self-fulfilling prophesy by overreacting, or appearing to predict violence, especially before the film was released. He also stated it was critical to avoid the appearance that the Dutch government would try to censor the film. He said that the Foreign Minister as well as both the Justice and Interior Ministers had met with Wilders in November to caution him about the potential negative repercussions of releasing the film, but had no intention of censoring it. He said that FM Verhagen had met in Madrid on the margins of the Alliance for Civilizations meeting with the Chair of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) to discuss the situation. The meeting was at the request of the OIC, which had contacted MFA to ask the government to take steps to suppress the film. The Foreign Minister, he said, had explained that any attempt to violate Wilders&apos; freedom of expression was out of the question; the government could not prevent the film from being made or released. Van Wiggen added that subsequent to its release, the content of the film would be evaluated to determine if it violated any criminal statutes in the Netherlands. 5. (C) Asked whether the government had reached out to governments or religious leaders in the Muslim world or to Western allies to request information on anticipated reactions among local populations or support in constraining violence in the wake of the film&apos;s release, van Wiggen said no. This was due to Dutch government reluctance to involve other countries in what was still a domestic issue. He said that the MFA had alerted Dutch embassies abroad to the potential for violent reactions to the film, but had not sent specific instructions for approaching host governments or elevating their security posture. It was up to each embassy to ensure that its security contingency plans were adequate and up to date. Van Wiggen noted that the MFA and embassies had received a large number of information requests about the situation from other governments, to which they were trying to be responsive. He noted that the government would welcome any information the USG might gather through its channels about potential reactions abroad to the film&apos;s release. 6. (C) Van Wiggen&apos;s comments track closely with Counter Terrorism Coordinator Joustra&apos;s comments to Representative Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) during his November 29 visit to The Hague (Ref B). Joustra indicated then that the Dutch government had serious concerns about the potential for a violent reaction to the film, at home and abroad. He said the Dutch had learned from the Danish cartoon crisis, and that it would have a proactive communications strategy in place to disassociate the government from the views which he anticipated would be expressed in the film. At the same time, Joustra said, they did not want to elevate the potential negative impact of the film by overreacting. He noted that the Dutch were more exposed in many Middle Eastern capitals than the Danes, due to their high-visibility fixed investments in the region. Joustra told Hoekstra that NCTb would closely monitor developments in the run-up to the release of the film (which at that time was believed to be mid-January) to determine whether it would be appropriate to raise the national threat assessment level, which is currently set at &quot;limited.&quot; He added that Wilders has repeatedly made inflammatory comments about Islam and the Koran in the past year, attributing the relatively mild reactions from Dutch Muslims to the fact that they are becoming accustomed to &quot;outrageous statements&quot; from Wilders (Ref C). ----------------------------------- -------------------------------- PREPARING TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC SECURITY ----------------------- -------------------------------------------- AT THE NATIONAL.... ------------------------------- 7. (C) A contact from the Dutch National Police (KLPD) Counter Terrorism squad (UCTA) confirmed to Legatt Ofice January 16 the anticipated early February release date. He said it was their understanding is that the film has not yet been completed. He said that UCTA was preparing a summary of national and local law enforcement preparations for the release of the film; that summary is expected to be completed and shared with foreign police liaison officers through the KLPD&apos;s International Police Liaison Office (DINPOL) by January 18. ... AND LOCAL LEVELS ----------------------------------- 8. (SBU) A senior Amsterdam regional police official told the Consul General January 16 that the police force has plans in place to respond effectively to any incidents of violence in the wake of the film&apos;s release. He acknowledged the possibility that there could be &quot;opportunistic&quot; or spontaneous outbreaks of violence in the city, but stressed that the municipal government would not tolerate any violence or criminal acts. He said that the police Community Liaison Officers had been in close touch with community groups and imams, to assess possible reactions and to urge calm. He noted that imams at several mosques in the city had already begun to call in their Friday sermons for calm in response to press reports about the film&apos;s anticipated content. He assured the CG that the police would be prepared to provide adequate protection to the Consulate General should any demonstrations approach the vicinity of the consulate. Similarly, an official from The Hague regional police assured RSO that they have plans in place to respond should violent incidents take place in the vicinity of the Embassy, which is two blocks from the Parliament buildings. 9. (U) Over the January 12-13 weekend, the Amsterdam police detained eight anti-Wilders protesters associated with the International Socialists who displayed placards with a photo of Wilders above a caption stating, &quot;Extremist - can seriously damage you and society&quot; in a take-off of health warnings on cigarette packets. Wilders stated that the protesters&apos; allegation that he was an extremist was &quot;too disgusting for words,&quot; but defended their right to protest since they did not make threats against him. He said the police should have &quot;let them get on with it.&quot; Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen also expressed surprise, and requested an explanation of why the police had detained the protestors. 10. (SBU) The director of the Rotterdam municipal government anti radicalization program told a visiting staff delegation from the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs committee on January 10 that the city&apos;s public security department was concerned about the potential for violence in the city following release of the Wilders film. He said that the city would work closely with community liaison officers to monitor community responses and to urge calm. In a separate conversation, a policy officer for the Platform for Islamic Organizations in the Rijnmond Region (SPIOR), an umbrella organization of 60 Islamic associations in the Rotterdam area, told the staffdel that SPIOR is working closely with its membership and the city to urge calm when the film is released. She said that the potential for violent reactions could not be ruled out, adding that there was a sense among many younger Muslims in particular that Islam has been repeatedly denigrated and the Wilders film would be a &quot;step too far.&quot; She expressed appreciation for the open communication between her group and the city government. 11. (U) According to press reports, Interior Minister Ter Horst, who overseas the national police and the domestic intelligence service, wrote to every mayor in the Netherlands in November to request that they be alert to tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims upon release of the Wilders film. The Ministry offered assistance, which several towns reportedly have accepted, in preparing contingency plans. The Minister&apos;s letter was leaked to the press on January 16. ----------------- COMMENT ----------------- 12. (C) The Dutch at the national and local levels have been open with us in acknowledging their concerns about the prospect for violence at home and abroad in the wake of the release of Wilder&apos;s film. The government appears prepared to respond swiftly to get out a message that will stress the importance of respect for freedom of expression while disassociating the Dutch government from Wilder&apos;s views on the Koran and calling for calm among key population groups at home and abroad. Mission elements will maintain close contact with national and local public safety officials to ensure mission security posture is appropriate. Results of January 16 EAC meeting reported Ref A.

France&apos;s leading commercial channel, TF1, doesn&apos;t skimp on the cheese course, as Ben Drew is about to discover. He has arrived in Paris on a lunchtime train from Brussels, where he played the previous night, for an appearance on the peculiarly Gallic festive special that is Les 500 Choristes F\u00eatent No\u00ebl. Half-asleep in a hoodie (&quot;I only got two hours&apos; sleep&quot;), the man known as Plan B is whisked to a TV studio, where he finds 500 trilby-clad choristers, a 30-step staircase and a hugely excitable director planning a Busby Berkeley-style number. It could faze a lesser man, but once Drew has donned the slick Armani threads of his soul-man alter ego, Strickland Banks, he nails his performance effortlessly, swaggering down the walkway and crooning She Said (a big hit in France) as the choir creep behind him, making white-gloved jazz hands as they go. &quot;I might have looked like I nailed it, mate, but I didn&apos;t enjoy it,&quot; Drew tells me later, back in his hoodie and sitting on a train speeding towards the evening&apos;s gig in Amsterdam. &quot;I turned up not knowing what to expect, and that makes me feel edgy. I like to know what is going on.&quot; Luckily for him, Plan B has been spectacularly up with the plot this year. His sumptuous retro-soul/hip-hop concept album, The Defamation of Strickland Banks, has been one of the signature records of 2010, an Amy Winehouse Back to Black-style career-making breakthrough that, closing in on a million sales, has been commercially bettered this year only by Take That and Lady Gaga. The album&apos;s narrative, telling the story of a fictional soul singer who is falsely convicted of the rape of a fan and imprisoned, and Drew&apos;s sweet, Smokey Robinson-style falsetto were a revelation after the patois-heavy ghetto-rap of Plan B&apos;s first album, 2006&apos;s Who Needs Actions When You Got Words. The transformation also led a few hardcore hip-hop fundamentalists to accuse him of selling out, a denunciation at which Drew still\u00a0bristles. &quot;I have always written different styles of music,&quot; he says. &quot;When I started out, I was singing soul and R&amp;B; it was rap that was my plan B. Strickland Banks is soul music, but lyrically I&apos;m still talking about real life, the shit I talk about in my hip-hop. It&apos;s a rapper trying to interpret soul in his own way. &quot;Initially, I recorded a double album \u2013 one soul record and one hip-hop \u2013 which worked together to tell Strickland&apos;s story. My record label boss told me he didn&apos;t like the hip-hop album, he didn&apos;t understand it and he wouldn&apos;t promote it. So we done a deal: he put out the soul album and gave me back the rap tracks, which I now own the rights to and I&apos;m gonna release next year as The Ballad of Belmarsh.&quot; Drew says the Belmarsh album will fill in some of the holes in the Strickland Banks story as well as furnishing us with some of its grislier, previously omitted details: &quot;Like how they put their fingers up his arse when they arrested him.&quot; It will also give a resolution to The Defamation&apos;s cliffhanger ending, which saw Banks back in the dock, awaiting the verdict of an appeal jury. &quot;It&apos;ll sell 100,000 copies max because it&apos;s a hip-hop record but I don&apos;t fucking care about that,&quot; he says. &quot;I just want to get it out.&quot; Yet even this enhanced package represents a dilution of Plan B&apos;s original vision for Strickland Banks. Drew envisaged the story as a film musical that he would direct, and which would appear in cinemas as a precursor to the release of the record. His label quailed at this ambitious plan, following the disappointing performance of his debut album. But his tenacity (&quot;I&apos;ll admit it, I&apos;m a stubborn cunt&quot;) has led to the shooting of half a dozen videos that tell the story in episodic\u00a0format. &quot;My bottom line is that I have always wanted to tell stories,&quot; he says. &quot;I love music and I love films, but at first I was only able to tell stories through music because film was out of reach, which was frustrating for me. But now, after Strickland, it don&apos;t seem so impossible.&quot; Indeed, Drew has had a parallel career as an actor ever since the release of his first album. He convincingly played a small-time crook and vicious thug in Noel Clarke&apos;s 2008 movie Adulthood and, arguably risking typecasting, was a small-time crook and vicious thug in the following year&apos;s Michael Caine vehicle Harry Brown. However, these boilerplate roles pale into insignificance next to his imminent directorial debut. Earlier this year, as Strickland Banks was breaking big, Drew approached Microwave, Film London&apos;s micro-budget funding service for aspiring filmmakers. They agreed to put up half of the \u00a3100,000 required to make Ill Manors, a self-penned slice of grimy cinema verite set in London. Drew is footing the rest of the bill himself, as well as writing the soundtrack during his European tour. With Microwave insisting that all filming is done inside 18 days, Ill Manors is now in post-production. It&apos;s a series of six vignettes of London street life, with characters seemingly drawn exclusively from the lawless, drug-dealing underclass colliding and interacting across each of the shorts: &quot;It&apos;s like a fucking British musical hip-hop version of Crash,&quot; Drew says. One of the mini-films has leaked online and is hypnotically, almost parodically bleak. Michelle is the tale of a teenage crack whore who steals the mobile phone of a local dealer. He takes revenge by pimping her out to local fast-food restaurant staff until her &quot;debt&quot; is repaid. Virtually every male character in the 15-minute film appears to lack any shred of human conscience or decency. Is sink-estate life really so feral and amoral? Drew stares at the French countryside through the train window for a full minute before he replies: &quot;Where I am from, those are the fuckers that stood out for me. There are some scary cunts out there; probably, a lot of people thought I was a scary cunt. But I understand why people turn out like that.&quot; Surely there is a danger that such brutal scenes reinforce the dystopian tabloid fiction of &quot;broken Britain&quot;? Drew winces at the thought. &quot;I don&apos;t like Cameron and I don&apos;t like his broken Britain theory. What worried me about Harry Brown was that it was a vigilante cowboy movie that played up to that shit. It showed the kids as evil but it never explained how they got that way. Ill Manors tries to show the reasons. If a kid is born to a crackhead mum on a council estate, and his dad fucks off, and he&apos;s told all of his life that he is a piece of shit, why wouldn&apos;t he turn out like that?&quot; To cast Ill Manors, Drew visited struggling schools in his home area of Stratford, east London, and trawled the Pupil Reform Units (PRUs) where delinquent pupils are given intensive one-to-one tuition. &quot;Where else was I\u00a0gonna go \u2013 fucking Rada?&quot; he asks. &quot;I\u00a0wanted kids with life experience. &quot;I went back to my own PRU, where I spent most of my school life, and those kids loved being involved in the film. Maybe it&apos;s the first positive thing that ever happened to them. I see myself at their age, angry and ignorant: they&apos;re not bad, just confused. Academic lessons don&apos;t mean anything to them. They should be watching Larry Clark&apos;s Kids for sex education and writing essays on my first\u00a0album.&quot; The train has been delayed, and as we pull into Amsterdam Drew talks about how a recent meeting with his father, after an 18-year separation, was a failure (&quot;He told lies, and I can&apos;t have lies in my life&quot;). He says he hopes to make a dubstep punk album followed by a reggae one, and hasn&apos;t given up hope of making the Strickland Banks film. He marvels at a year that has seen him sing with Elton John and ended with him booked to play the O2. Yet he seems dead on his feet as our cab speeds towards the Paradiso venue, moodily snapping at a phone call from his panicking tour manager: &quot;I don&apos;t care what suit I wear as long as it&apos;s fucking\u00a0Armani.&quot; The omens for the show are not good, but 30 minutes later Plan B is once again the immaculate Strickland Banks, crooning lush, heartbreaking songs of fear and despair in a gorgeous falsetto, demonstrating that he is the most gifted white British soul singer in a decade.

It was time to get professional, so they invested the \u00a31,000 they had made from a year of gigging in their own van, bought from a mobile dog-grooming business. &quot;We were so proud of that van,&quot; guitarist Sam Halliday says. &quot;It was so exciting at the time.&quot; &quot;It was a pile of shit,&quot; bassist Kevin Baird replies. &quot;We were on the dual carriageway, and one of the wheels came off,&quot; he sighs, shaking his head. &quot;It flew straight into the oncoming traffic.&quot; At the time, you wouldn&apos;t have put money on the County Down trio making it to the next town, but Two Door have become one of the unlikely success stories of 2010. Twelve months ago, they were supporting Delphic in 300-capacity venues. This year, they have played two sellout UK tours and filled the Shepherd&apos;s Bush Empire in London. Their gigs \u2013 with the fans chanting &quot;Two Door! Two Door!&quot; and singing along with every word \u2013 are some of the most euphoric on the circuit. Along the way, they have shifted 60,000 copies of their shimmering electropop debut, Tourist History. The oddest aspect of Two Door&apos;s rise is that it has taken place virtually under the radar. While crowds have flocked, there&apos;s been very little of the media exposure that usually accompanies an emerging group. Until recently, the radio virtually ignored their singles; they&apos;d toured the UK four times before they received any press coverage at all. &quot;We certainly haven&apos;t been shoved into anyone&apos;s faces,&quot; Baird says with considerable understatement. &quot;But people have been able to discover us for themselves.&quot; They have had some assistance. Last December, their name appeared towards the bottom of the BBC&apos;s influential Sound of 2010 poll, the first time many had heard of them at all. Then Kanye West mentioned them on his blog \u2013 which led the excited young band to phone their mums. Songs have featured as backing music on Sky Sports, and in PlayStation and Xbox games. But mostly, their success has been built on years of struggle and self-belief, playing anywhere they could. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of self-motivation in our music,&quot; says red-haired frontman Alex Trimble, a formerly shy 21-year-old now coming to terms with his role as a rock frontman. He&apos;s referring to songs like Something Good Can Work, with its infectious mantra: &quot;You&apos;ve got to step up your game to make it to the top.&quot; &quot;Because Northern Ireland is cut off from the rest of the UK and the country, it always felt harder for us than any other band,&quot; he says. &quot;But we told ourselves not to listen to kids at school and everyone else who said: &apos;You&apos;re from a small town in Ireland, you&apos;ll never make it.&apos; There wasn&apos;t any other option. It was all or nothing for us.&quot; At one point, the band even risked their futures \u2013 giving up university places so that they could work harder on the band, a leap of faith that alarmed their parents. &quot;I sold the idea to mine on the basis that it was a gap year,&quot; Trimble says. &quot;We&apos;re in the third year of it now.&quot; &quot;But we always planned to keep going until it worked out,&quot; adds Baird \u2013 also 21, but the worldliest of the trio \u2013 who recalls their early touring diet of tortilla chips and water from the venues, and tells how they slept on fans&apos; floors. And if things hadn&apos;t gone to plan? &quot;At least we&apos;d have known we&apos;d have given it a go. We didn&apos;t want to spend the rest of our lives wondering &apos;What if \u2026?&apos;&quot; Two Door grew up in Bangor, a small seaside town they compare to a run-down Blackpool. They started playing guitars in the music department of Bangor grammar school, and when everyone else went to the cinema at weekends, they stayed at home writing songs. &quot;I knew four girls,&quot; shrugs Trimble. &quot;We thought: &apos;We&apos;ll make songs. Then the girls will come.&apos;&quot; Their first band was an emo outfit who made what Baird calls &quot;bad music.&quot; &quot;It was emotional!&quot; corrects Trimble. &quot;&apos;I&apos;m a teenager and I&apos;m unhappy about it.&apos;&quot; When girls didn&apos;t arrive \u2013 and the drummer left \u2013 they decided on a rethink, adapting the name of the local Tudor cinema club and replacing the drummer with a laptop. However, their first gig with the new, more electronic sound \u2013 at a Christian festival in a huge warehouse, in front of a dozen people \u2013 was a shambles. &quot;We were used to plugging into my stepdad&apos;s hi-fi,&quot; sighs Trimble, &quot;but when we got there they had this massive sound system. We said: &apos;Er, can we plug into it?&apos; We didn&apos;t have a clue.&quot; Then people started shouting &apos;Give us a drum solo!&apos; at the laptop,&quot; Baird says. Barid suspects many bands would have packed it in there and then, but this band are clearly not easily fazed, which may stem from their upbringing in post-Troubles Bangor. Although the worst of the violence was long past by the time they were conscious of the world, they grew up thinking that an army presence, sectarian murals and bomb scares were normal. &quot;It&apos;s only when other people visit that you realise you were surrounded by things that people are quite shocked by,&quot; Baird says, matter-of-factly. &quot;You&apos;d just think, &apos;Oh, another bomb scare, I&apos;ll take another route.&apos;&quot; That was the mindset they took into music. As Trimble says: &quot;Doing loads of terrible gigs made us realise we had to be better, tighter. We&apos;d practise every day until we got it right.&quot; They also sweated over writing better songs, learning how to use the computer properly and editing hour-long jams into catchy, four-\u00a0 minute anthems. As Baird tells it, the problem with a lot of Northern Irish bands is that they can get very well-known in Belfast, but then don&apos;t know where else to go. &quot;We always wanted to break out of that Northern Irish cycle,&quot; he says. They first used MySpace to get gigs in the UK and then bombarded management contacts they had on Wikipedia until they secured a manager and then a label. Signing to hip French indie Kitsun\u00e9 may not have been an obvious move, but was typical of Two Door&apos;s logic. &quot;Because we felt cut off from the UK, it made as much sense to sign with a label based in France,&quot; Baird says. Usefully, the label was able to launch them around Europe. Two Door do sometimes wonder if being from an unfashionable town in Ireland made the media reluctant to cover them, but since Tourist History was released in March, their gigs \u2013 now including a human drummer \u2013 have created a groundswell it has become impossible to ignore. The tipping point came at this summer&apos;s Reading festival, where the audience started the &quot;Two Door!&quot; chant before they&apos;d even come on. &quot;After the second song, I had to stop everything because I couldn&apos;t hear myself think,&quot; Trimble says, grinning at the memory. &quot;I&apos;ve not watched the video because I know how stupid I must have looked. But that was the first moment I realised things were happening. It was the most amazing moment of my life.&quot; Within two frenetic weeks, they&apos;d landed an NME feature, got on the Radio 1 playlist and embarked on their biggest ever tour. The songs that have struck a particular chord with audiences express a quality that is otherwise dying out: the sheer, emotional excitement of being in a pop group. The band still make a special effort to talk to fans, just like they did when they played in Manchester to four people. Being around them, it&apos;s hard not to be touched by their excitement at traveling to different countries and getting free food and drink. They&apos;re even happy chatting to me for an hour and a half \u2013 far longer than you&apos;d expect of a band who&apos;ve been on the road for 14 months, with Amsterdam waiting to be explored. The royalties may be trickling in \u2013 and until then, they&apos;re still earning less than their own road crew \u2013 but they are living their own dream. &quot;We&apos;ve been so busy that it&apos;s only when you start to talk about it that you take it all in,&quot; Trimble says, gazing around yet another dressing room. &quot;I never expected anything from our first record. I just wanted people to hear it. When I think about everything that&apos;s happened to us this year, it&apos;s overwhelming. But it does feel like we&apos;ve earned it, and that feels really nice.&quot; Two Door Cinema Club&apos;s next single, What You Know, is released on Kitsun\u00e9 on 10 January.

Yet cruel temperatures inevitably recall the ice age of a fortnight ago, when I was not nearly so sensible. I flew to Amsterdam. As any traveller knows, heading elsewhere is one thing, getting back quite another. Sod&apos;s law: disasters occur on the return journey. God forbid we should be able to call it quits and just go home. But why do we never calculate the keen likelihood of what newspapers blandly tag &quot;travel chaos&quot; before making plans to go? My story is commonplace, and that&apos;s the point. I blithely accept a speaking engagement in the Netherlands. The trip will be a little nothing: two overnights, then back home by lunch. The flight out being deceitfully punctual should have tipped me off that I was being set up. Amsterdam is bitter, its pavements treacherous. The snow has hit the fan. Inside the hotel, I do all media interviews in a floor-length, black opera coat. For once, nobody thinks I&apos;m a nut. The morning of my &quot;departure&quot;, my flight is cancelled. Gatwick is closed. Having abruptly joined 250,000 stranded air passengers wandering the planet like the undead, I am shit-eatingly grateful to secure the last seat on an afternoon plane. At Schiphol airport two hours early, I pick up a pattern on the departures board: every flight cancelled or delayed \u2013 dozens \u2013 is to the UK. Predictably, then, my flight is delayed. Once I&apos;m through security, the gate is changed. More security. More delays. The gate changes again. Delay, delay. I read, badly. I peruse overpriced smoked fish. I swipe furtive samples of aged gouda at duty free. Finally BA issues snack vouchers for my flight, and here&apos;s one thing that goes right: in an Irish bar on D concourse, the coupon covers a large glass of white wine. Four hours late, but the flight is boarding! No one complains. We are no longer demanding consumers, expecting free magazines. We are beggars, supplicants; we&apos;d have gladly flown to Heathrow holding on to the wheels. Bad news, says the pilot after half an hour revving on the runway. It&apos;s snowing in London again. This flight is cancelled. &quot;Why do we go anywhere?&quot; I explode to the unsuspecting stranger seated next to me. &quot;It&apos;s not worth it! We should just \u2026 videoconference or something!&quot; Possibly afraid of me, she agrees. The taxi rank for a cab back to my hotel is three switchbacks deep. Now, look: this is travel chaos lite. I slept in a hotel, not chattering in a stationary train in Sussex overnight, or awaiting the arrival of mountain rescue teams while stuck for a second night in my ice-bound car on the A57. With a generous publisher, I didn&apos;t even wrangle with an airline for months over who picked up the tab for my impromptu holiday; and there are worse places to get stranded than funky Amsterdam. But considering how much worse off just about every other traveller was during the last &quot;big freeze&quot;, and remembering the astonishing variety of flavours catastrophe comes in (volcanic ash, roadworks, breakdowns on the tracks) \u2013 why do we never seem to anticipate the sky-high likelihood of getting caught up in a nightmare? A massive proportion of all this to-ing and fro-ing is elective. So how might we ensure being home on schedule? By never leaving in the first place! But no. We naively assume this time the trip will go according to plan, just as this time Lucy won&apos;t whisk the football from Charlie Brown. We ought reflexively to ask before hitting that fatal &quot;purchase ticket&quot; button: &quot;Do I fancy spending several nights on a cold linoleum floor?&quot; Or, when packing a bag, to check, &quot;the chances of my ever seeing this shirt again being so scant, why not just throw it away?&quot; Motorists and train passengers should routinely travel with UN refugee tents, space blankets, and six months&apos; worth of food. By now we restive, compulsively mobile folks have only ourselves to blame. So why, neck high in &quot;travel chaos&quot; for another fright-white weekend, are we still surprised? We suckers are so nostalgic for the days transport functioned reasonably well that we refuse to live in the world in which it doesn&apos;t. Delusions come at a price. That said, after Amsterdam I believe in miracles. A certain improbably gracious celebrity chef shares my Dutch publisher, and flew me back to a military airport near London in a private plane. With smoked salmon tea sandwiches and top-shelf gossip. Yet since the odds of such a fairy godmother ever again sweeping me to safety are far poorer than the bookies&apos; on a white Christmas this year, I fear I&apos;ve now used up my lifetime&apos;s single Get Out of Jail Free card. So, my fellow travellers: don&apos;t count on the celebrity chef gambit. Shake off your gormless optimism and get real. Unless you&apos;re prepared to spend days on end queueing for snack vouchers, playing video games on a train stuck in rural Kent before the iPad battery runs out altogether, or cracking icicles from your hair on the M25, don&apos;t take the trip.", "sentences": ["I flew to Amsterdam.", "Amsterdam is bitter, its pavements treacherous.", "With a generous publisher, I didn&apos;t even wrangle with an airline for months over who picked up the tab for my impromptu holiday; and there are worse places to get stranded than funky Amsterdam.", "That said, after Amsterdam I believe in miracles."], "title": "When the snow hits the fan, get real and stay home | Lionel Shriver", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/17/snow-stay-home-travel-chaos", "tags": ["Weather", "UK news", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-18T10:28:58Z", "article": " 4.54pm: We&apos;re closing the live blog now. Hope those of you travelling tonight or tomorrow don&apos;t suffer too much disruption to your journeys. (I am hoping that the south London rail and overground services aren&apos;t as dire as during the last cold snap.)  3.49pm: British Airways has cancelled all long-haul flights from Heathrow which were due to depart before 7pm tonight. All the airline&apos;s flights from Gatwick were cancelled, with the exception of BA2055 to Sharm el Sheikh. A spokesman said: &quot;We would strongly urge passengers not to travel to the airport if their flight is cancelled as all roads around Heathrow and Gatwick are extremely congested.&quot;  3.11pm: The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) says heavy snowfall has caused delays in reaching emergency patients. A spokesman said: &quot;We are getting to people but obviously because of the road conditions we are getting there slower. &quot;The ambulance service is for emergencies and life-threatening conditions. We are asking people to consider whether their condition requires an ambulance.&quot; The NWAS said areas of Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Merseyside and west Lancashire had been worst affected.  2.57pm: In West Sussex drivers are being advised to avoid the A23 due to worsening conditions. The warning came after five lorries became jack-knifed due to the snow between Patcham and Handcross.  Hampshire police say the weather has significantly improved this afternoon but warned motorists not to become complacent. Meanwhile, National Express says it is operating most of its coach network but has warned passengers they could face delays and diversions in the areas worst hit by the snow.  2.54pm: Kent Police have urged motorists not to travel unless necessary. Heavy snow is causing serious disruption across the county, particularly in northern and western parts. The M20 has been reduced to two lanes due to heavy snow between junctions 1 and 3 coastbound. There are also reports of thick fog between junctions 3 and 4. On the M25, only one lane could be used by drivers travelling between junctions 6 and 5 Kent-bound due to snowfall. Drivers have also been advised to avoid Maidstone town centre and surrounding main roads, which are gridlocked by traffic.  2.51pm: Gatwick Airport reopened at 2.45pm but a spokesman warned passengers should still expect further disruption, with flights limited and delays and cancellations inevitable.  Meanwhile, British Airways has cancelled all short-haul flights for the rest of today. A spokesman said: &quot;Due to airfield closures at Heathrow and customers experiencing difficulties accessing the airport, we have now cancelled all short-haul flights for the rest of the day. &quot;We are keeping the situation under review and will make a decision regarding long-haul flights as soon as possible.&quot; Where flights were cancelled, passengers were advised they could either rebook or claim a full refund.  1.41pm: Travel association ABTA has advised those due to fly today or tomorrow to check with their airline or tour operator before setting off. A spokesman said: &quot;If your flight is cancelled, airlines and tour operators will give you the option to rebook or to have a refund of your money. &quot;For those due to fly back to the UK from other countries, the airlines and tour companies will ensure they are looked after in terms of day-to-day expenses and will pay for them to stay in a hotel.&quot; Those hit by delays at British airports would also be given the option of hotel accommodation, he added, but most were more likely to choose to go home. Hundreds of thousands of Britons were due to fly this weekend, while four million were expected to go abroad during the festive period.  12.38pm: Up to 15cm of snow is expected to fall in London today and around 20cm could fall in parts of north Wales, the Midlands and south east England. Lindsay Dovey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: &quot;There has been a band of snow that is stretching from North Wales right across to the far south east of England, pivoting northwards over London. &quot;It is going to be around for a while, probably for most of the day, but will hopefully die out tonight when conditions are going to improve.&quot; She said temperatures could plunge to minus 20C in parts of Scotland - and had already dropped as low as minus 15.5C in Aviemore in the Cairngorms.  12.33pm: Runways at Heathrow Airport have been closed to allow snow clearing and to keep the airport safe, according to its operator BAA. Meanwhile, Birmingham Airport has suspended all of its flights until at least 1pm while it clears snow from the runway. A spokesman warned that flights expected to leave the airport this afternoon may be cancelled or delayed because of the adverse conditions.  12.06pm: Dozens of football fixtures have been cancelled due to the adverse weather conditions, including Wigan&apos;s clash against Aston Villa at the DW Stadium, Liverpool&apos;s match against Fulham at Anfield and Birmingham match at home to Newcastle.  Cardiff&apos;s home tie against Burnley and Portsmouth&apos;s game at Fratton Park with Scunthorpe have been called off in the Championship. In Scotland, Premier League games between Rangers and St Mirren, Aberdeen and Motherwell, St Johnstone and Dundee Utd, and Hamilton and Celtic have been cancelled. Over 20 more lower league matches have been cancelled in England, as well as around eight non-league clashes. About a dozen lower league games in Scotland have also been called off. Racing meets around the country have been abandoned, as well as many other sporting fixtures.  11.57am: As is now the standard procedure, disgruntled travellers have turned to Twitter to air their transport woes. Corine Wood, waiting at Gatwick Airport, wrote: &quot;Our flight is cancelled and the soonest they could rebook us for is Tuesday. Waaaaaaah.&quot; A passenger at Heathrow going by the name of Fridalust asked: &quot;How come British Airways flights have been cancelled but &apos;most other flights&apos; are ok!? What&apos;s the difference between them?&quot;  11.52am: To give you an idea of how bad the conditions on the roads are, the AA had attended around 4,000 breakdowns across the UK by 10.30am. The breakdown service said it is receiving up to 1,200 calls every hour - around twice the normal rate. It expects to have attended around 18,000 call-outs by the end of the day - around double the usual number for Saturday. A spokesman said southern England was the worst affected area, with drivers suffering most problems within the M25 and in the Home Counties. Call-outs were also high in Somerset and Newcastle. Darron Burness, head of AA special operations, said driving conditions were &quot;extremely difficult&quot; in some regions. &quot;One of the biggest problems is that large amounts of snow are falling very quickly on to frozen surfaces, making driving hazardous,&quot; he said. &quot;Around the western side of the M25, three to four inches of snow has fallen in two hours.&quot;Some may have no choice but to travel, although with road conditions unlikely to improve much over the weekend, drivers should exercise a lot of caution and be prepared for some long delays in places.&quot;  11.48am: The Met Office is predicting this could be the coldest December on record, with a current average temperature of minus 0.7C - five degrees below the long-term average. Forecaster Mark Seltzer said: &quot;A lot of snow has fallen across the north-west of England overnight but it should ease off during the day. &quot;A lot of snow also fell in the South West overnight and it will progressively move into the South East and parts of the Midlands and East Anglia throughout the day. There could be local accumulations of 20-25cm. &quot;Temperatures will struggle to get over freezing and although the snow should ease off tonight, it will return to eastern areas on Sunday.&quot;  Full details of current Met Office severe weather warnings can be found here.  11.33am: On the rail network, South West Trains is running an amended service.  Southern trains has also ammended its timetable, which can be found here. Trains will only run until 10pm tonight.  Southeastern trains has also issued an emergency timetable.  11.27am: The situation at Heathrow doesn&apos;t appear to be much better. A spokeswoman for British Airways, which has grounded all its flights out of Heathrow until at least 5pm, said: &quot;The weather at Heathrow now is quite appalling.&quot; She said the decision to cancel the flights was taken to prevent passengers from making unnecessary journeys to the airport. &quot;We knew that severe weather conditions were expected, so rather than asking passengers to travel down from Scotland, for example, just to have their flight cancelled, we think it&apos;s better to tell all our customers that flights are cancelled. We need to give our customers some certainty.&quot; She said the move was not taken lightly as it would cost the airline &quot;a huge amount of money&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s a backlog from yesterday and that has an impact on today&apos;s customers. The main thing is we don&apos;t want customers turning up today to get stranded and not be able to get out by car or by plane.&quot; She said the airline was providing passengers with food and drinks, and putting people up in rooms.  11.22am:More information on the situation at Gatwick airport where at least 138 flights - out of 600 scheduled for today - were cancelled by mid-morning.  The airport says it has deployed 47 snow ploughs, tractors and other vehicles to clear the snow from the runway. Heavy snowfall is expected to continue to fall at the airport for at least another hour - with up to 10cm expected today. Regulations require the airport to suspend flights if snow lies thicker than 3cm on the ground.  11.20am: Motorists also face disruption in southern England. In Surrey, police urged motorists to make essential journeys due to the hazardous driving conditions. A number of roads in the county have been closed as Surrey Police received reports of vehicles becoming stuck. Major problems were reported on the A3 southbound, the A31 and the A287, with surrounding roads also severely affected. Motorists who become stuck have been told to call their recovery company rather than the police and to be prepared for a long wait. Superintendent Sharon Bush said: &quot;We have already seen significant snowfall across the county and with more forecast we are urging people to only venture on to the roads if absolutely necessary. &quot;The conditions across the county are making any travel treacherous and we are advising people to take sensible precautions.&quot;  11.12am: Some more details of the problems affecting the roads. Hundreds of motorists were left stranded in the early hours of this morning on the M6 in Greater Manchester as the North West was hit with up to 25cm of snow.  Commuter Stephen Derbyshire said he was stuck for five hours on the motorway, which has now reopened. He was forced to complete the last two hours of his journey on foot. &quot;It is absolute mayhem,&quot; he told BBC Radio Five Live. Lancashire Constabulary said the main problems have occurred on the southbound carriageway, near Charnock Richard. The spokesman said: &quot;We still have problems on the M6 southbound in the Charnock Richard area. People are still stranded with their vehicles there.&quot; &quot;Police officers are providing food and water to those who need it,&quot; he added. There are also problems on the M61, M58 and M57. Drivers are stranded on the M58, at the Orrel Interchange, where the motorway joins the M6 and there are abandoned vehicles on the M61 southbound between Preston and Greater Manchester. The Highways Agency has reported that the M61 northbound is now closed between junctions J6 and J8, due to a serious incident. Police said that although there have been a number of collisions, none at this stage are believed to be serious.  10.30am: Some more details on the problems at UK airports. \u2022Gatwick&apos;s runway is closed until at least 3pm, with no departing or arriving flights; \u2022Southampton airport is closed until noon; \u2022Birmingham airport has cancelled flights to Frankfurt and lunchtime flights to Amsterdam; \u2022Belfast City Airport, which closed last night, is due to resume services from 11am; \u2022The runway at Exeter International airport has now reopened but delays and cancellations should still be expected; \u2022Flights to and from Aberdeen and Cardiff airports are also disrupted. Passengers are advised to checked with their airlines before travelling. A Gatwick airport spokesman said efforts were under way to clear the snow. He said: &quot;We&apos;ve had heavy snowfall solidly now for the past hour and it continues to fall. We&apos;re now out there ploughing, sweeping and brushing the snow away and will continue to do that until it&apos;s safe to resume operations.&quot;  A spokesman for Heathrow said the airport was open but would be &quot;challenged&quot; today. &quot;Heathrow is fully operational but we are expecting more snow and planning for the worst,&quot; he said. &quot;BA passengers must stay at home as all BA flights are cancelled. At this time there are no significant delays at other terminals. &quot;All passengers must check with airlines before setting off as the situation will worsen.&quot;  10.10am: Good morning, David Batty here with updates on the latest transport disruption caused by the latest spell of heavy snow and freezing temperatures.  Travellers across the UK are facing severe delays to their journeys on what is traditionally the busiest weekend before Christmas for the road and rail networks and airports. Here are the main problems: \u2022Up to 25cm of snow fell in the north-west overnight, and blizzards also blanketed parts of the south. Up to a foot (30cm) of snow could fall on parts the south-east and the Midlands today. \u2022British Airways has cancelled all flights out of Heathrow from 10am to 5pm and all short-haul flights from 10am to 4pm at Gatwick; \u2022Several other airports around the UK are also affected with passengers warned to expect delays and cancellations; \u2022Drivers are stranded on the M58 and there are abandoned vehicles on the M61 southbound between Preston and Greater Manchester. Hundreds of motorists spent much of last night stuck on the M6 in Greater Manchester; \u2022Rail operators Southern, Southeastern and South West Trains have cancelled some services.

British Airways cancelled all short-haul flights, shopping centres were forced to close and many motorways were blocked by heavy drifts of snow across much of the UK yesterday with freezing temperatures expected to remain for most of the week. At Heathrow, scuffles broke out as staff tried to deal with thousands of stranded passengers. &quot;People were scrambling to get on other carriers, people were panicking,&quot; one passenger told the Observer. &quot;This is the Christmas from hell.&quot; In many areas, night-time temperatures will plunge to \u201310C or below this week. The conditions are likely to make this the coldest December on record, with a current average temperature of \u20130.7C, five degrees below the long-term\u00a0average. The disruption that has ensued \u2013 the second serious episode of weather chaos to hit travel in Britain this month \u2013 led to calls from senior politicians yesterday for the government to make radical improvements in its ability to deal with cold weather. Louise Ellman, the Labour chairwoman of the Commons transport select committee, said it was no longer sufficient for ministers to brush away criticism by saying the severe conditions were exceptional. &quot;This is now the third bad winter in a row. We need to establish whether we think there may be a change of weather patterns and if so respond accordingly,&quot; she said. &quot;We should be able to respond to these events better.&quot; Ellman said her committee would study what had gone wrong. &quot;Clearly it is something we will have to look into.&quot; Amid chaos on the roads, a man was killed after the ambulance in which he was being treated skidded off the road near Eastbourne, East Sussex. The man, who was named by police last night as Daniel Martin, 31, had suffered life-threatening injuries in a crash between his car and a flatbed truck. The driver of the lorry \u2013 a 36-year-old man from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, who was working for a contractor operating on behalf of East Sussex county council \u2013 was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and held in custody overnight on Friday. In another incident, a 19-year-old man was stabbed in the neck in Sheffield after asking a group of teenagers to stop throwing snowballs. Snow caused havoc at airports. Heathrow and Gatwick were both closed while flights at Aberdeen, Belfast City, Cardiff, London City and Southampton airports were also disrupted. In Northern Ireland, freezing conditions continued to make travel hazardous following some of the heaviest snowfall for 25 years \u2013 with more forecast. The Northern Ireland Roads Service said slush from Friday had frozen overnight and Christmas shoppers should think carefully before setting out by car. Jon Caudwell, from the Highways Agency, said it was doing its best to keep major roads in England clear but needed help from motorists, who should seriously consider whether they needed to go out this weekend. Elsewhere a teenage girl died in a sledging accident, while a mother and her 10-year-old son were killed in a fatal road crash as icy conditions gripped Ireland. In the rest of Europe some 2,500 passengers were stranded overnight at Frankfurt airport after flights were cancelled. Florence airport, in northern Italy, was closed and hundreds of cars were stranded on highways in Tuscany. In France, snow has affected road and rail travel in the west and north, and Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle airport is reporting delays; in the Netherlands, many flights have been cancelled at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Coastguard helicopter rescue teams were called in to assist the NHS to ensure doctors, nurses and midwives reached hospitals. Volunteers helped with kidney patient transfers and with the delivery of essential drugs. Shoppers also suffered as snow forced many to abandon their trips. Brent Cross shopping centre in north London had to close because of the conditions. By contrast, shops in the West End remained open and reported reasonable business. &quot;Although footfall was slightly down on forecasts, many retailers have reported sales up on last year with jewellery selling fast and technology strong including 3D TVs and the Apple iPads,&quot; said a spokesman. In the Trafford Centre in Manchester, staff have used more than 20 tons of grit across the 150-acre site over 24 hours.

Hundreds of thousands of Britons had been due to fly this weekend, with 4 million expected to go abroad, according to travel association Abta. Singer Lily Allen was one of the travellers caught up in the chaos after boarding and then being forced to disembark from a plane at Heathrow yesterday. An American student, Zack Robinson, told BBC Radio 5 Live he sat on a plane for eight hours waiting to take off before being told it was cancelled. Elizabeth Herridge was told her KLM flight from Heathrow to Amsterdam was going ahead as expected this morning, but was turned away from Terminal 4 when she arrived. Herridge, a communications worker, who was hoping to get away for Christmas, said: &quot;I received a text alert from Heathrow at 5.30am this morning saying my 8.40am flight was running on time. I didn&apos;t ignore it and turned up first thing, but I was greeted by a member of staff at the terminal doors asking why I was here as there were no flights coming in or out and to go home. There seems to be a lot of confusion and I have only seen one Heathrow worker. All the airline desks are shut because it is a Sunday - it&apos;s absolutely ridiculous.&quot; A spokeswoman for Heathrow, which experienced temperatures of -5.2C (23F) overnight, said: &quot;Heathrow airport will not be accepting arrivals on Sunday, and will only manage a handful of departures as our airfield team continues to deal with the impacts of yesterday&apos;s bad weather and prepares the airport for a full reopening on Monday.&quot; She added: &quot;We are extremely sorry for the disruption this will cause to passengers and airlines and we stress that passengers must check with their airlines before travelling to the airport. We will provide regular updates.&quot; The airport said several hundred people were working to treat areas and keep passengers in the terminal as warm and comfortable as possible. Gatwick airport reopened after planes were grounded for large periods of yesterday, but widespread disruption was expected with officials advising passengers to check with their airline before travelling. Stansted, Luton, Exeter, London City, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, Southampton, Cardiff and Birmingham airports also said flights would be subject to delays and cancellations. Forecasters said the UK was hit by abnormally low temperatures overnight, with most parts of the country struggling to get over -5C. The mercury dropped to -19C in Pershore, Worcestershire, and -14C in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, while fresh snow fell in eastern England and Scotland. Snow was today expected in northern and eastern Scotland and north-east England, with the Met Office issuing severe weather warnings. Commuters were also warned of widespread icy roads in Wales, north-west England, the Midlands and the south. Weather experts said temperatures would struggle to rise above freezing, meaning large accumulations of snow, which left many people stuck in their homes yesterday, would fail to clear. Chaos was again expected on the roads and on rail networks today with the freeze showing little sign of relenting. Yesterday the icy conditions claimed at least another three lives - a girl in her early teens was killed in a sledging accident and a mother and her 10-year-old son died in a road crash. Meanwhile, Jeremy Clarkson and Jemima Khan were among those left stranded after plunging temperatures hit the transport network. Britain traditionally experiences mild winters, but last year&apos;s was the coldest for 30 years and the latest big snowfall is the second to paralyse the country in three weeks. The transport secretary, Philip Hammond, said he had asked the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser to assess whether the country was experiencing a &quot;step change&quot; in weather patterns due to climate change and whether it needed to spend more money on winter preparations. Louise Ellman, the Labour chair of the Commons transport select committee, said it was no longer sufficient for ministers to brush away criticism by saying the severe conditions were exceptional. &quot;This is now the third bad winter in a row. We need to establish whether we think there may be a change of weather patterns and if so respond accordingly,&quot; she said. &quot;We should be able to respond to these events better.&quot; Ellman said her committee would study what had gone wrong. &quot;Clearly it is something we will have to look into.&quot;", "sentences": ["Elizabeth Herridge was told her KLM flight from Heathrow to Amsterdam was going ahead as expected this morning, but was turned away from Terminal 4 when she arrived."], "title": "Snow leaves air travellers stranded", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/19/snow-heathrow-travellers-stranded", "tags": ["Weather", "UK news", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Heathrow", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2010-12-23T16:54:01Z", "article": "David Montgomery was criticised by an influential shareholder group yesterday over his conduct at a Dutch newspaper group controlled by Mecom, the media company he runs. Governance for Owners, an investment company backed by big institutional shareholders, used an extraordinary general meeting of Wegener, a Dutch subsidary of Mecom, to raise questions over the way Montgomery has run the company. Montgomery, a former chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, has been accused of taking key strategic decisions, including signing an outsourcing contract with an IT company and vetoing a deal to buy a social networking site, without consulting Wegener&apos;s former chief executive, Joop Munsterman. Wegener is a subsidiary of Mecom, which owns a chain of continental newspapers, and contributes 57% of its profits. Mecom has an 87% share in the Dutch group, which is quoted on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Governance for Owners owns the remaining 13%. The shareholder group called the EGM, which took place in the Netherlands. It believes Montgomery \u2013 who is due to step down as Mecom chief executive next month \u2013 has dramatically surpressed Wegener&apos;s share price by undermining Munsterman. The group is valued at around \u20ac250m but Governance for Owners believes it should be worth twice that. Robert Machell, a fund manager at Governance for Owners, said: &quot;Clearly what we want is for Wegener to be run for the benefit of all the shareholders.&quot; Montgomery, who also chairs the Wegener supervisory board, did not attend the EGM because of illness, but Governance for Owners pressed the company&apos;s board on his departure date. Montgomery said earlier this year that he would step down in January following pressure from Mecom investors, but a successor has not been appointed. One candidate to replace him, John Farrell, withdrew his application earlier this month. Machell said: &quot;We think it is unacceptable that only weeks before the announced date of the departure of David Montgomery as Mecom chief executive, seemingly no discussion or planning for his successor as chairman of the Wegener supervisory board have taken place.&quot; Munsterman left after a series of disagreements with Montgomery and was replaced temporarily by Truls Velgaard, a Mecom executive who does not speak Dutch. The top 40 managers at Wegener immediately announced they would not co-operate with him and employee representatives, who must rubberstamp the appointment of a chief executive, indicated they would withhold their approval. &quot;The departure of the previous CEO clearly lead to huge disruption,&quot; Machell said. At yesterday&apos;s meeting the Wegener works council approved the appointment of Velgaard. Governance for Owners raised questions about Montgomery&apos;s departure date, which were not answered. &quot;I think there are some questions about his decisions&quot;, Machell said. &quot;[Munsterman&apos;s] departure caused a lot of disruption. He was doing a good job and that was clearly coming through in the numbers [profits],&quot; Machell said. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The Private Cannabis Club, with its palmate green leaves stencilled on the walls and the club&apos;s name etched on to smoked windowpanes, is at the vanguard of a new movement of pro-cannabis campaigners in Spain. The members spotted a gap in Spain&apos;s drugs laws which, they say, makes the activities of private clubs like these entirely legal. The spacious Paracuellos de Jarama club, in a former restaurant in a town overlooking Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport, is equipped with a bar, kitchen, billiard tables and TV screens. It is the most sophisticated of up to 40 cannabis clubs that have sprung up in garages and back rooms around Spain since campaigners worked out that laws making it illegal to consume in public did not apply to private, member-only, clubs. &quot;We&apos;ve been open for two months and we already have 125 members,&quot; said the association&apos;s president, Pedro \u00c1lvaro Zamora. Those members pay \u20ac120 a year to belong and Zamora and his companions follow rules that seem similar to those of exclusive Mayfair clubs. A sign by the doorbell warns that only members are admitted and a committee vets new applicants, blackballing some. Alicia M\u00e9ndez, a club official, said: &quot;Potential members are interviewed and we do not accept everyone. Our members have to be responsible people, have the right profile.&quot; Zamora said: &quot;This is not Amsterdam, this is not a coffee shop. This is our association&apos;s club house and it is a private place. It is not open for everyone.&quot; Spain does not have a law banning consumption in private and members claim it is safer to use the club than go out to parks and smoke in public. Zamora said: &quot;The club recognises that cannabis is not good for everyone. We propose a responsible form of consumption. Not everyone should smoke. We know there are risks.&quot; Club members can bring their own cannabis or share in the club&apos;s own stock. They can even take some away as long as they sign for it and the cannabis is for personal consumption. Although the club house, which is registered with the local authorities, is left alone by police, members can get into trouble if caught carrying cannabis. &quot;It is illegal to buy, sell or transport, so you can be fined if caught with it on you.&quot; The club offers legal help to fined members. Supplying the club is another problem, as dealing in cannabis is illegal. &quot;We are fighting for the legal right to grow it,&quot; said Zamora. The club applied for a medical licence to cultivate cannabis but was turned down. Then police raided its secret plantation and destroyed the plants. Zamora said they would challenge in court the right to destroy a plantation devoted to supplying a private club: &quot;We are people who work and pay taxes. We are not delinquents.&quot; Some judges have ordered police to give confiscated cannabis back to clubs. &quot;They have told them to return it on the basis that there is no threat to public health.&quot; Zamora stressed that the club&apos;s suppliers did not belong to the drugs underworld: &quot;We don&apos;t go to the black market to buy. We know farmers who cultivate cannabis and can provide us.&quot; The club also campaigns on laws. &quot;Prohibition does not work. Cannabis has been consumed for centuries and will continue to be \u2026 for centuries. Prohibition creates an illegal market and all that brings with it. It&apos;s better to educate people than spend money on prohibition that fails.&quot; \u2022 this article was amended on 4 January 2011. The original referred to Paraceullos de Jarama.

The 61-year-old, who brought the Caribbean carnival tradition of his native Aruba to western pop, had complained of breathing problems before and after the show. His agent, John Seine, said that &quot;heart problems, shortage of breath and problems with his stomach&quot; had plagued the performer for 10 years, but had never dented his love of performing live. A natural showman, Farrell made slick dance routines and exotic costumes as much a part of Boney M appearances as the music. The most famous person to come out of Aruba \u2013 a tiny island nation which along with Curacao and Sint Maarten are part of the Netherlands \u2013 he towered over the women who took the other three places in the group. His signing in 1975 gave a new lease of life to an odd collective, which primarily performed to music pre-recorded by the German singer and composer Frank Farian. Farrell was seldom involved in studio recordings of the group&apos;s many hits such as Rivers of Babylon and Brown Girl in the Ring. His forte was live performance, when his sometimes ragged voice worked well and his movements were a whirl of bare midriff, tight bell-bottoms, huge afro hair-do and spidery reach and height. &quot;I like to look good on stage and to release all my energy in my shows,&quot; he said on his website recently. &quot;The energy in my music has no limit. I want people to feel entertained and to hear the love that I have for creating music, translated into my songs.&quot; Farrell was involved in a succession of dramatic splits and makeups with Farian, leaving the group more than once after allegations of unreliability. But his career continually reignited after initial stardom in the 1970s, and he barnstormed the international concert circuit in the 1990s and the first decade of this century. &quot;He was a fantastic person, quite bizarre,&quot; said Seine. &quot;He had a big heart but he was also explosive.&quot; Born Alfonso Farrell, he was brought up amid Aruba&apos;s rich musical combination of carnival songs and processions, mixed with religious ceremonies from the Dutch colonial era. He left school at 15 to work as a sailor, but jumped ship in Norway and set himself up as a DJ. Modest success took him to Germany where he was spotted by Farian, who had invented Boney M as a pseudonym, taken from an Australian TV series. Music was Farian&apos;s strength but he needed a sexy and attention-catching cast to present curiosities such as Baby Do You Wanna Bump, which he recorded entirely himself in 1974, singing both deep bass and falsetto parts. Farrell proved his worth with Daddy Cool, which was Britain&apos;s number one for five weeks in 1978, the same year as Rivers of Babylon made the top spot. His own Boney M team played to wild acclaim up to his death, with an Abba-like repertoire of past golden hits to sing. Following tours of the United States, Colombia, Turkey, Finland and Slovakia, he was due to release a new album and tour Italy this spring. He was found dead by staff at St Petersburg&apos;s Ambassador hotel after failing to respond to a wake-up call.

The phenomenally successful quartet was manufactured by the German record producer Frank Farian. Its male singer and dancer was Bobby Farrell, who has been found dead aged 61 in a hotel in St Petersburg the day after giving a performance of Boney M hits with his own group. Farrell was born in Aruba, in the Caribbean. As a teenager he became a sailor for two years before settling in northern Europe. After travelling in Norway and the Netherlands, he based himself in Germany, where he worked sporadically as a disc jockey and a dancer. In 1975, Farian concocted the song Baby Do You Wanna Bump? and decided to find a team of singers and dancers to perform it in clubs. Four young African-Caribbean performers resident in Germany \u2013 Farrell, Maizie Williams, Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett \u2013 became Boney M. The foursome had a constant stream of hits across Europe (including the Soviet bloc), Latin America and Asia between 1976 and 1982. Estimates of the group&apos;s record sales vary between 100m and 150m. In Britain alone, Boney M made the Top 10 singles chart 10 times, beginning in 1976 with Daddy Cool, followed by Sunny and Ma Baker (both 1977). The 1978 releases Rivers of Babylon/Brown Girl in the Ring and Mary&apos;s Boy Child/Oh My Lord each sold almost 2m copies. There were also three No 1 albums, Nightflight to Venus (1978), Oceans of Fantasy (1979) and a hits collection issued in 1980. Only the US remained impervious to the group&apos;s catchy sound, despite Boney M&apos;s evident affinity with the then-fashionable disco scene. The three women in the group wore exotic, glittery costumes that mixed kitsch and erotica, while Farrell sported a large Afro and frequently appeared bare-chested. Although all four members sang when Boney M appeared on stage or on live television broadcasts, only two were permitted by Farian to take part in the studio recordings. He decided that Williams&apos;s voice was unsuitable for disco, and Farrell was also barred from the studio after singing Bob Marley&apos;s No Woman, No Cry as an audition piece. Instead, using electronic effects, Farian provided the male vocals himself . By 1982 Farrell left the group and was replaced by Reggie Tsiboe. Farrell returned two years later but by the middle of the decade the appeal of Boney M had waned and Farian was immersed in the launch of his next creation, Milli Vanilli. The original Boney M disbanded in 1986 and Farrell embarked on a brief career as a solo performer. During the early 1990s, various remixes and re-releases brought Boney M to the fore again in Europe, and Farrell decided to capitalise on the revival of interest. He found three new female singers and dancers and began to tour internationally as Bobby Farrell and Boney M, also making new versions of the group&apos;s hits. At various times in the past two decades, his former colleagues have also led ensembles trading as Boney M. From his base in Amsterdam, Farrell continued to tour the world. In the past few months, his Boney M troupe had appeared in Lebanon, Turkey, the US, Colombia and Finland.
