The seized items include various drugs (Xanax, anabolic steroids, Ritalin, khat, ketamine, hashish), counterfeit jewellery, bags, hats, sportswear, shirts, DVDs and watches as well as several kinds of plants, seeds, grass, nuts and foodstuffs. Among the more exotic confiscated substances are deer antlers, deer blood, deer penis and deer tongue, as well as cow-dung toothpaste and cow urine. The book is an inventory of the illegal and the prohibited \u2013 but it&apos;s also a testament to ingenuity, both of those attempting to bring banned goods into America and of those who try and prevent the illegal traffic of goods across international borders. It tells us, too, that we are living in an age in which the market for counterfeit goods, particularly fake designer-label goods, is seemingly insatiable. &quot;The proliferation of the fake has been one result of the enormous shift of commodity production to the south and east in recent decades,&quot; writes Hans-Ulrich Obrist, the curator and art historian, in his introduction to the book, &quot;where there is in general far poorer protection of intellectual property, and hence \u2026 a greater opportunity to make knock-offs without fear of reproach.&quot; The experience of photographing the 1,075 objects was a disorienting one for Simon, who lived in the airport for five days, worked long hours, found it hard to sleep, and was able to take only one shower over the entire time. You would never know that, though, from the end result. Her photographs are detached and impersonal to the point of forensic: each item was placed on a grey-white background and shot as if it was a scientific specimen \u2013 which , in a way, of course, it was. Contraband, in both its style and content, recalls another inventory-style book made in another airport: Christien Meindertsma&apos;s Checked Baggage, a record of the 3,264 prohibited items seized at Schiphol, Amsterdam, in a single week. It was published in 2004, and made in the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York, when increased airport security meant that many ordinary items carried by passengers \u2013 nail scissors, tweezers, lighters, hairspray, toy guns \u2013 were suddenly viewed as potential weapons that could be used in a mid-flight terrorist attack. The confiscated items in Checked Baggage are the result of airport security searches on more than 600,000 travellers, and, whereas Simon has opted to arrange her objects under alphabetised categories (alcohol, animal corpses, apples, bananas, beef etc), Meindertsma opted for generic sub-categories (potato knives, potato peelers, cheese knives, kitchen knives, small daggers etc). Again, though, the visual inventory gives no clue of the labour and sustained bouts of intense concentration that underpinned the project. With books like these, one longs sometimes for an accompanying short documentary relating the trajectory of the undertaking, shedding light on the process that underpins the end result. (Playfully, the publishers of Checked Baggage included a confiscated item with every book in their limited edition print run. As a result, the book now changes hands for around \u00a31,000.) With her small, but influential, body of work, Simon, at 35, has already become one of the leading visual anthropologists of American culture. Her preoccupation is with the hidden or overlooked, as evinced by two of her previous books, The Innocents (2003) and the acclaimed An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar (2007). The former is a series of American portraits in a highly lit, almost unreal style that is formally redolent of the work of Gregory Crewsdon. Her subjects, though, are victims of miscarriages of justice, all of whom Simon photographed at places that had some link to their wrongful convictions. The latter is a series of 70 photographs made over five years, again in the wake of 9/11, of some of America&apos;s hidden objects and sites, including a nuclear storage facility, the interior of the CIA headquarters, an avian quarantine facility and a cryopreservation unit. On one level, the book is a collection of curiosities \u2013 it also includes an image of a Braille edition of Playboy, a hibernating bear and a serpent handler. It is also an elliptical portrait of America at a pivotal and anxious moment in its history. &quot;Over a five-year period following September 11, when the American media and government were seeking unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction,&quot; Simon said of the project, &quot;I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America&apos;s foundation, mythology, and daily functioning. I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real. And confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.&quot; (You can watch her talk about the series here). Whereas An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamilar is a wide-ranging book, almost epic in its scope, Contraband is narrowly focused, the result of an intense period of engagement with a single, but endlessly intriguing, subject. Both say much about contemporary America. In one way, as the American photographer and critic Aaron Schuman has pointed out, Simon&apos;s work is in a tradition best described by Robert Frank as &quot;the making of a broad, voluminous picture record of things American, past and present&quot;, but it also subverts that tradition by focusing not on the everyday America of Frank \u2013 or Walker Evans or even William Eggleston \u2013 but on an unfamiliar, often ominous and clandestine, America. Simon has intimated that her next project will be pursued out in the world, beyond the America she has photographed in such a singular and illuminating way. She is a major talent and I, for one, cannot wait to see the results. Now see this Christopher Thomas&apos;s images of New York in the dead of night are eerie and otherworldy. Using a custom-made, large format camera, Polaroid film and long exposures, Thomas captures the city in black and white, seemingly devoid of human life. Familiar landmarks \u2013 delis, skyscrapers, the Guggenheim cloaked in snow \u2013 seem oddly unreal and old-fashioned. Hailing from Germany, Thomas has an outsider&apos;s eye and his painterly landscapes hint at an older city \u2013 the New Amsterdam once inhabited by Dutch settlers.

He makes huge, dishevelled macho figures from gobbets of gloriously messy plaster, built around visible armatures of rusty metal rods. Squatting, crawling or standing proud with legs astride, their provocative postures and gooey materials suggest sex, violence and shit. They might be idols of a primal cult, recalling the sex workers depicted in Picasso&apos;s Les Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon with their primitive masks and distorted, angular bodies. At the same time Houseago&apos;s monumental work looks like a scuffed version of the snowy marble of classical statues or Henry Moore&apos;s massive, polished smoothly curving forms. Born in 1972, the Yorkshire-raised Houseago studied art at London&apos;s Central St Martins college in the early 1990s and then in Amsterdam, before moving to Los Angeles, where he is now based. Alongside artists like his sometime collaborator and LA neighbour Aaron Curry, he&apos;s part of a new generation looking back to modernism and older kinds of sculpture through a 21st-century lens.     Houseago's sculptures 'have a Frankenstein's monster quality'.  Photograph: Edmund Blok    Giants, round-eyed masks like the heads of robots and versions of triumphal arches (he calls them &quot;gates&quot;) recur throughout Houseago&apos;s work \u2013 not just in his sculptures, but with bronze, wood, hemp and pencil drawing. While their titles and forms gesture to mythic creatures such as the Minotaur and Cyclops, his works have more of a Frankenstein&apos;s monster quality. Their seams are left showing. The focal point of his current show is a crouching brute called Baby, which first made an appearance at last year&apos;s Whitney Biennial. Half its muscular form is rendered from messy rivulets of plaster, half from flattened surfaces that bear the imprint of heavy pencil-marks. It looks ready to spring into action, or at least learn how to take its first infant steps \u2013 except that it&apos;s almost three metres high. Figurative work on this scale is usually confined to war memorials or statues of dictators. For Houseago, however, it becomes a way of exploring sculpture for sculpture&apos;s sake: of making by hand, of volume, mass, physical presence and gravity, or as he once put it, something that looks like it might fall on top of you. Why we like him: For Untitled (Red Man) of 2008, a Paolozzi-esque towering russet bronze with wonky eyes and limbs. Feel the force: Houseago&apos;s first taste of modern art was filtered through pop culture. He cites Darth Vader and his mask as influenced by Jacob Epstein and African art. Where can I see him?

A six-hour mash-up of Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra, the Belgian director&apos;s inspired show used sharp-suited actors and live video to create something akin to Shakespeare crossed with 24-hour rolling news. The Guardian&apos;s Lyn Gardner said the production, performed at the Barbican, made it seem &quot;as if Shakespeare is not only our contemporary but only finished writing the plays this morning&quot;. Now Van Hove is back \u2013 with Antonioni Project, a work that does a similar trick with three 1960s films by the legendary Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni: L&apos;Avventura, La Notte and L&apos;Eclisse. &quot;Antonioni Project is not an adaptation of the movies,&quot; says Van Hove, sitting on an orange plastic chair in a bar in Antwerp. &quot;That wouldn&apos;t make sense. It&apos;s an adaptation of the scripts. You don&apos;t make an adaptation of the Hamlet you saw \u2013 you make an adaptation of the script.&quot; Theatrical versions of Hollywood crowd-pleasers are, of course, nothing new: the West End is awash with Flashdance and its ilk. But screen-to-stage adaptations of loose trilogies by art-house directors are few and far between (even if Van Hove has also adapted works by Ingmar Bergman, John Cassavetes and Luchino Visconti). What&apos;s more, although Van Hove watched and was &quot;totally mesmerised&quot; by La Notte and L&apos;Eclisse in his student days, he has never seen L&apos;Avventura, the elliptical masterpiece about middle-class malaise that was booed at its first screening in Cannes in 1960, but then went on to win the festival&apos;s jury prize. Beyond the UK, Van Hove has been a\u00a0big name for years. Based in the Netherlands, where he is artistic director of Toneelgroep Amsterdam, the country&apos;s foremost theatre company, he frequently whirls his productions through European cities. In New York, he&apos;s both celebrated and chastised for his takes on classic texts. What keeps Van Hove going back to the US, he says, is the fact that he&apos;s never sure how audiences and critics will react. Similarly, he felt &quot;totally alive&quot; when he brought The Roman Tragedies to Shakespeare&apos;s home country, &quot;because I really didn&apos;t know whether people would walk out&quot;. He certainly doesn&apos;t seem nervous about the possibility of falling flat on his face with his latest production. &quot;I am like a bungee jumper in theatre,&quot; he says with a chuckle. Van Hove got the stage rights to the Antonioni films before the director died in 2007. All three movies immerse us in the emotional quagmires of beautiful, well-to-do but jaded couples in boom-time Italy. If the films are extended games of he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not between glamorous stars (including Marcello Mastroianni, Jeanne Moreau and Alain Delon), they also all share a sense of ennui and drift. When Van Hove first read the screenplays, he thought: &quot;This is like a huge mid-life crisis. The scripts are full of the feeling that you&apos;ve lived your life already, and what else is there now? And of course I&apos;m almost 52, so it&apos;s the perfect time to direct them.&quot; Certainly, with his five o&apos;clock shadow, there is something of the fading matinee idol about Van Hove. I caught Antonioni Project in Antwerp. At first, Van Hove&apos;s treatment flits between the narratives of the central couples in each film. In the second half, though, the characters&apos; paths cross, as they mingle desultorily at an all-night bash that&apos;s reminiscent of the poolside party in La Notte. The film L&apos;Avventura, by contrast, largely takes place on an eerie, windswept and lava-encrusted island near Sicily. &quot;Antonioni&apos;s space,&quot; wrote the film critic Pauline Kael, &quot;is a vacuum in which people are aimlessly moving.&quot; Van Hove thinks the film &quot;positions people so they are very small \u2013 lost in\u00a0their environment. So I had to think\u00a0about how to show the alienation between women and men in an urban\u00a0setting.&quot; He does this by having multiple cameras on stage, which film his characters acting against a vast blue screen. Close-up footage of their faces is then superimposed on vistas that appear on a giant screen above the stage: the empty footbridges of the Minneapolis Skyway system, for example. So the audience gets to watch\u00a0two things simultaneously: actors performing a scene together (looking lonely and lost on a spacious\u00a0stage), while, up above, they&apos;re transported to somewhere else\u00a0entirely. The setup \u2013 both distant and in your\u00a0face \u2013 requires extremely economical performances. &quot;They cannot lie because the camera is ruthless,&quot; says Van Hove. &quot;Video and\u00a0microphones are the tools of today. Why not use them? In the times\u00a0of the\u00a0Greek tragedies, they used\u00a0masks \u2013 which were like huge close-ups of an\u00a0emotion. But I never use cinematic methods in a purely aesthetic way. I\u00a0try\u00a0to make it dramaturgically necessary.&quot; The chic look and rich, saturated colours of Van Hove&apos;s reimaginings seem more reminiscent of Pedro Almod\u00f3var&apos;s pictures than Antonioni&apos;s. And, although there are a few coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre (at one point the sky rains white balloons), audiences may be split\u00a0over whether Van Hove has found a potent enough theatrical equivalent to Antonioni&apos;s visual poetry. After all, the Italian film-maker was renowned for the quality of his composition; he said he had &quot;something to show rather than something to say&quot;. So why do it like this? To annoy purists? Far from it, says Van Hove. &quot;Life is too short to set out to provoke. It&apos;s not &apos;risk for kicks&apos;. On the contrary, I try to look deep into the play and see how it should be produced now.&quot; His dark eyes drill into me and, in a near-whisper, he says: &quot;I think, deep down, it is a hope to be loved by audiences all over the world.&quot; \u2022 Antonioni Project is at the Barbican, London EC2, 1-5 February.

The payments company said the beginning of the second week in January is traditionally a boom time for bookings, and this is likely to be the case again despite the ongoing tough economic climate. On Tuesday January 12 last year, for example, there were more than 83,000 holiday flight bookings made using Visa cards, while nearly 70,000 were made on Tuesday January 13 2009. Last year, the slowest day in the month for bookings was 1 January when 29,710 flights were booked. The most popular flight destinations last January were in Europe, and Visa Europe expects Britons to look to similar locations this year. The top flight destination was Malaga in southern Spain, followed by Amsterdam and the Alicante region of Spain. Tony Gibbons, head of debit at Visa Europe, said: &quot;We expect to see in excess of 87,000 flight bookings taking place today as people take advantage of outstanding deals being offered by many airlines and holiday companies. &quot;Historically, early January sees a huge surge in bookings as people&apos;s thoughts turn to a sunny weekend away to ease the back-to-work blues. Many consumers are looking to &apos;get away from it all&apos;, especially if they are able to do so at a bargain price.&quot; He added: &quot;We expect beach destinations such as Spain, as well as European city breaks, to feature strongly in the most popular destinations. Our data also shows that an increasing number of British tourists are venturing further afield, and we expect to see places such as the Middle East and Africa doing particularly well in 2011.&quot; Paul Bondsfield of flights specialist Round the World Experts said: &quot;We experienced our busiest ever day for round the world flight bookings this Saturday, and are expecting this to be our biggest week of the year. &quot;We have already seen web inquiries rise 23% in the last week and it seems that claims about the death of gap year travel are greatly exaggerated, with people of all ages booking their round the world adventures.&quot; Center Parcs also confirmed a surge in bookings, saying that on Sunday alone it took more than 2,500 bookings, and expected to take on average at least one booking a minute throughout the entire month. It said in a statement: &quot;This proves that after the merriment of Christmas, Britons like to start planning a family break to look forward to in the following year. Center Parcs normally take a third of [its annual] bookings in the January-February period.&quot; The website travelsupermarket.com said the third Monday in January has for the past few years been its biggest day for searches. Currently the most searched for departure dates for flights this year are Saturday 19 February and Saturday 28 May, both of which coincide with school holidays.

Debut EP Flow sets out their pitch: metronomic math-rock with effects-twisted vocals \u2013 in places, reminiscent of Sonic Youth or Battles, but elsewhere, stubbornly unclassifiable. &quot;After releasing their debut EP, DFG seem to be on a whole new mission, re-drafting their sound into something more synth-based and &apos;pop&apos;,&quot; says Dan Shapiro of CNNGo. &quot;They played a couple of brand-new tracks at the end of their release show and the crowd was in awe.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;The Tshetsha Boys are going on tour to New York, London and Amsterdam \u2013 so they may have quite a big year."], "title": "Meet the Belgian Jessie J and the Chinese Vaccines!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/15/world-sound-of-2011", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "World music", "Dance music", "Pop and rock", "Hip-hop", "Reggae"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-15T12:41:00Z", "article": "Each month, the Music Alliance Pact \u2013 a group of 35 music blogs from around the world, including this one \u2013 simultaneously post tracks chosen by each blog.

Her influences \u2013 from Morricone soundtracks to doomy goth and opera \u2013 suggest her music could be preposterously overblown, yet Calvi is clearly an expert when it comes to dynamics and restraint. Cavernous drums open proceedings on Suzanne And I, then ominous, twanging guitar lines ring out before Calvi steps up to the microphone. Each new addition ratchets up the tension a notch, drawing you in so that, by the time Calvi&apos;s wailing away on top of thundering riffs, crashing cymbals and a couple of spare kitchen sinks, you&apos;re too involved to notice. Her self-titled debut album is out on Domino on January 17.  ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieLes Mentettes Orchestra - Cosmic Sidewalks       Les Mentettes Orchestra is the augmented version of Les Mentettes, a psychedelic pop band from Buenos Aires that features more than 20 musicians live on stage. A couple of years ago we featured one of their early recordings, but now it&apos;s time to unveil a great song from their first and self-titled album. It was recorded live at ION, a legendary studio that still works with tape and analog equipment. The album is available on iTunes and there&apos;s also a video of Cosmic Sidewalks. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Spartak - Nightshift (Version)       Spartak were one of many great bands I discovered on the recently released compilation, The Sound of Young Canberra, which is full of exciting music from the oft-forgotten titular city. Spartak&apos;s tune stands out amongst a very strong set that makes a solid case for reevaluating Australia&apos;s capital as something of an emerging cultural hub. Nightshift (Version) reminds me of a Spoon demo, bringing together Spoon&apos;s knack for effortless songs draped in subtle studio trickery. I look forward to more from these guys. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoApanhador S\u00f3 - Maria Augusta       Contagious and catchy, Maria Augusta is an indie semi-hit from Apanhador S\u00f3, a band from the cold south of Brazil who released a good album last year that can be downloaded for free via their website. They&apos;re part of a new scene of bands who sing in Portuguese, of which they are considered one of the greatest revelations. Maria Augusta quietly shows a group that do not take the easy route - they explore alternative ways of making music, such as using a bicycle wheel as an instrument. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicHooded Fang - Laughing       Think of The Strokes. Now think of The Strokes if they slowed things down considerably, but still managed to retain all their cool and catchiness. Got a picture/sound in your head? Then, as Laughing shows, you&apos;ve got a good idea of what Hooded Fang sounds like. CHILE       Super 45Elefante Mec\u00e1nico - G\u00e9nesis       G\u00e9nesis heralds the comeback of Elefante Mec\u00e1nico after their celebrated Memorias De Un Elefante album, self-released in 2008. In this record, Bame, Jota and DJ Antioch pick up on old school hip-hop sounds, throwing inspired rhymes about cosmos, love and eternity. CHINA       WooozyPet Conspiracy  - Beyond       Beijing-based Pet Conspiracy plays funky, danceable electronic music that takes influences from punk-rock, new wave and disco. The band consists of two female singers, a guitar/synthesizer player and a drummer. Lead guitarist Hu Zi is already an established artist in the Beijing underground scene as an electronic musician. Pet Conspiracy is known for their high-energy live performances and the array of toys and costumes they bring on stage. They have just returned from a successful tour of Europe. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaThe Colombian Party Cartel - La Murga De Colombia       Two Colombians and one gringo make up The Colombian Party Cartel. The crew resides in the United States, where every weekend they mix the best Colombian music. Carey James is the lead vocalist and principal producer of CPC. La Murga De Colombia samples a Willie Col\u00f3n song and creates a new fusion of Colombian cumbia and urban style. DENMARK       All ScandinavianCODY - The Light       The vessel for frontman Kaspar Kaae&apos;s musical output, alternative country and americana seven-piece CODY hit it big in Denmark in 2009 with their excellent debut album Songs from which The Light is taken. Come March they&apos;ll play both Canadian Music Fest and SXSW, and if you&apos;re around Toronto March 9-13 and/or Austin March 16-20 (no specific dates or venues yet) be sure to check out CODY - they&apos;re really a great live band as well. ESTONIA       PopopGalvanic Elephants - Rum Rumble       Galvanic Elephants hail from Tartu. They came together in August 2010 and have released only one single so far, but that one song has earned them praise from critics and music bloggers and created anticipation for new material that should be released soon. With no concerts announced so far either, Rum Rumble is the only chance to enjoy the rough sound of Galvanic Elephants right now, but it definitely makes you want more. FINLAND       GlueOn Volcano - Acceleration Of Heartbeat       On Volcano is one of the best underground bands in the Finnish indie scene. They play obscure post-rock songs with long instrumental movements and intense dynamics and atmospherics. Their latest EP is available for free on their website. GERMANY       BlogparteiSizarr - Fake Foxes       Sizarr are lucky guys. Yet to finish school, they have already played big festivals in Germany such as the renowned Melt! without being signed to a label yet. These three guys from Landau have a very distinctive style, especially singer Fabian Altst\u00f6tter, whose voice is very dark and uses a memorable stretching technique. Together they create modern electonica landscapes inspired by many other genres. They plan to record their debut album this year. GREECE       Mouxlalouloudadrog_A_tek - In_No_Sense       The movie Homeland, directed by Syllas Tzoumerkas, is an explosive parable of Greece coming apart at the seams, shown through the spectrum of a dysfunctional family, which decides to give up one of its members for adoption to a richer relative. The original music score, a compelling concoction of styles that continually surprises, reflects precisely those feelings. drog_A_tek, a band that records moments in real-time and produces temporary audiovisual environments, uses objects, analogue and digital musical instruments, typewriters, frequencies, recording archives/waste and technology landscapes to depict the film&apos;s mood. As a result of this, no moment of Homeland is left unfilled with sparkling music ideas. Listen to In_No_Sense, where their ingenuity shines. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaMiri - G\u00f3\u00f0a Konan       Miri began at the LungA festival in the east fjords of Iceland in 2003. The debut EP, Fallegt \u00deorp, was recorded live one night during this festival in 2005, produced by Curver Thoroddsen. The band plays almost wordless, progressive noise mixed with beautiful guitar work. G\u00f3\u00f0a Konan is featured on their 2010 full album Okkar. INDIA       IndiecisionAdam And The Fish Eyed Poets - Little Monkeys       Adam And The Fish Eyed Poets is the solo project of Kishore Krishna from Chennai. His music finds a place between the lush industrial sound of Nine Inch Nails and rootsy American rockabilly. Little Monkeys comes from his debut album, Snakeism. Featuring several clinky electronica bells and whistles, it is a resounding tune that is over almost as quickly as it starts. It&apos;s a builder in a hurry; a chorus-heavy singalong that&apos;s emphatic and imminently memorable. INDONESIA       Deathrockstar((Auman)) - W.K.G.G.       Auman means &quot;animal&apos;s roar&quot;, and their music is wild, dirty and full of energy - like a tiger deep in the Sumatra jungle that is ready to eat its prey. ((Auman)) is the latest group worth hearing in the local headbanger scene. IRELAND       Nialler9Retarded Cop - Copvan       Formerly of Dublin punk rockers Moutpiece, Gaz Le Rock has expanded his repertoire into an amazing 30-minute radio show called The Loving Room Floor and is now releasing tunes at a blistering pace as Retarded Cop, a project which has the catchiest pop-punk tunes you&apos;ll hear all year. A debut LP is forthcoming. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelYerachmiel - Yom Shekulo       Yerachmiel &quot;Rocky&quot; Ziegler is an international musician who owns Little Apple Studios in the trendy Jerusalem artists&apos; enclave Nachlaot. He is an authentically indie artist, though his work is distributed worldwide and features on several albums. Yerachmiel&apos;s music spans several genres but this specific song, Yom Shekulo, is a trance-rock rendition of ancient Passover liturgy that speaks of Messianic times (and it really picks up quite nicely in the middle). ITALY       PolaroidYoung Wrists - I Want You To Disappear       Alberto and Letizia come from the coastal town of Pesaro and there is definitely a breezy, summery shade in their jangly, noisy pop. Behind their C86 abrasive guitars and shining melodies you can hear a bright ode to adolescence and nostalgia, in the vein of The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart or Dum Dum Girls. Well, you can decide not to trust me because I am too involved and helped them release their debut 7&apos;&apos; (on We Were Never Being Boring), but just listen to this bittersweet bonus track and fall in love right now. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaDisco Ruido! - Amorfos       Although Disco Ruido! has made its name in Mexico City&apos;s hipster nightlife as a non-stop party combo, their debut album delves into a neon-blurred nostalgia from lost childhood afternoons watching pop stars miming on TV. Mercedes sings like a doll high on ephedrine (no doubt this song&apos;s title is translated as &quot;amorphous&quot;), while the band explores the enormous legacy of harmonies that dwell in the Mexican collective memory. I wish Thal\u00eda and Paulina Rubio (the glamour-pusses from seminal 80s teenybopper group Timbiriche) could be doing this kind of sophisti-pop. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamLola Kite - Everything&apos;s Better       At times pop trio Lola Kite can&apos;t resist the playfulness of lo-fi, losing themselves to retro electro-pop tech and washes of hazy, melodic psychedelia - which undoubtedly reminds you of Animal Collective when combined. However, their debut album Lights, finally released this month following loads of gigging promise, shows they&apos;re more than a quirky and charming proposition, upping their game with upbeat and snappy dance-pop gems such as Everything&apos;s Better.  This Amsterdam indie quartet are fresh, frisky and dancefloor flammable. There are certainly retro guitar-pop elements at play here, such as their saucy bursts of swaggering guitar jangle. But any hints of classic garage rock are mixed with quirky synths and fun, big beat grooves. So much so that their Girl Singer EP is topped off with remixes by NON Records labelmates Palmbomen and Bear. The tracks lend themselves perfectly to dance-friendly interpretations - Soulwax come to mind in this sense - which is why we&apos;ve chosen the Bear remix of Pet Needs Friends as a party-starting introduction. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalGolden Axe - Telephone       There&apos;s nothing like the enthusiastic waveform tones of Golden Axe. Named after the Sega game, Chris Cudby and Daif Kent&apos;s keyboard-based band has been making party-friendly psychedelic music since late 2001. True to their fun and eccentric form, the July release party for their latest album, Fantasy Footwork, saw them play inside a giant paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 igloo that they made themselves. Download the Telephone EP and buy Fantasy Footwork from their Bandcamp. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceAristillus - Dying, Keep Dying       The members of Aristillus are aged 17 and 18 but, in spite of their youth, they sound much more mature than many other hardcore bands. With heavy drums, sharp guitars and lyrics as dark as their sound, I believe they&apos;ll soon get a lot more attention. Their influences are Norwegian hardcore bands such as Sn\u00f6ras, JR Ewing, Kollwitz and Rumble In Rhodos, and they&apos;re releasing their debut album, Devoured Trees &amp; Crystal Skies, on January 24 on the Norwegian indie label Fysisk Format. Aristillus is playing at by:Larm 2011 and I&apos;m quite sure that won&apos;t be the last you&apos;ll hear from them this year. PERU       SoTBVoz Propia - Lentes Amarillos       With a career spanning more than 20 years, Voz Propia is still current, their sound having been renewed to the demands of each time. El Manifesto is their eighth production and it could be the definitive work of this mature band. Post-punk is the essence in their sound again so hold on, Voz Propia is back. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Balla - Equil\u00edbrio?       Armando Teixeira, who has been playing in bands and as a solo artist for more than 25 years, is one of the most talented contemporary musicians and producers of modern Portuguese music. He is a creative multi-instrumentist and sought-after producer for labels and studios. Balla is one of his solo projects and we wish to thank Armando for letting MAP make Equil\u00edbrio? the first free, worldwide downloadable track from latest album Equil\u00edbrio. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseNebulosa - Trains       Nebulosa is the music space child of three people living on different continents: Noamme, Andrei and Vladimir. The sound is dreamy and sincere, using very simple chord structures and lyrics. Their debut EP, Chimes, can be downloaded from their website, a free ticket to the stars. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopAaron Wright &amp; The Aprils - Go On Yer Self       Aaron Wright &amp; The Aprils&apos; self-titled debut album, due out conveniently enough in April, features guest vocal contributions from Camera Obscura&apos;s Tracyanne Campbell and Teenage Fanclub&apos;s Norman Blake as well as instrumental ones from Belle &amp; Sebastian duo Stevie Jackson and Mick Cooke. Those influences certainly makes themselves heard on Go On Yer Self, which mixes a classic Scottish folk-rock sound with a strong helping of Beatles-esque melody-making. The 24-year-old shaggy-haired Edinburgh singer and his band will be heading out on tour in March as support to The Charlatans. The ingenious video for their new single, Trampoline, is also worth a look. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Kevin Lester - Rockstar 2.0 feat Vanessa Fernandez       Hip hop isn&apos;t something one associates with Singapore&apos;s music scene, but it exists, usually even more underground than rock, metal or hardcore. Ironically, it&apos;s in response to rampant commercial radio that the local music community, regardless of style, has become a close-knit family. In his debut, Kevin Lester brings out the collaborative and experimental strengths of hip hop, forging a sound with slashes of rock and soul, and working with some of the country&apos;s best singers to put out a record with incredible heart and talent. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Thieve - Champion       Thieve are a trio hailing from the hub of Cape Town, whose motto and reason for picking the band name comes from the fact that &quot;nothing is original - everybody steals&quot;. While you can hear that sentiment heavily influences their song, Champion, they maintain a unique feel with their melding of swirling pop rhythms, a soft rock sound and a nostalgic lovestruck feel to their lyrics. With the experience of all the members being involved in previous well-known bands, they&apos;ve turned Thieve into a tight-knit group that is set to take over the rock &apos;n&apos; roll scene.  SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKSwimmingdoll - Last Take       After a year in the making, experimental shoegaze band Swimmingdoll were finally ready to present their first album, 8wimmingdoll, in the last weeks of 2010. Last Take is a gorgeous layered production with a sound well suited for &quot;the infinite world of the spacewalk&quot; the band wish to portray. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerOblique - Without Making Noise       Oblique&apos;s music and aesthetic could remind us of 80s electro-industrial music (or even EBM) bands and, certainly, their biggest inspiration comes from dark synthpop acts such as The Human League or Ladytron. Without Making Noise, the second single taken from the eponymous album of this trio from Barcelona, features dark atmospherics and, of course, a catchy chorus. It&apos;s got what it takes to be a perfect futurepop track. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseKlifton Filente - It Takes A Thorn To Remove A Thorn       Klifton Filente is one of the underappreciated, unsigned and relatively unknown artists from Sweden that I am keeping my eye on. On the song It Takes A Thorn To Remove A Thorn, taken from their Common Ground album, you can hear echoes of Crosby, Stills and Nash as well as the lilting folk-pop of early Paul Simon. SWITZERLAND       78sAie \u00e7a Gicle - Whisper Jet       Sonic Youth is the keyword when it comes to Aie \u00e7a Gicle&apos;s musical universe. But the band&apos;s debut album S.Y.R.U.P. offers more than just a blueprint. Their influences range from post-punk to grunge to post-rock. They pile guitar layer upon guitar layer, interlace some catchy refrains and try to be as laid-back as possible. UNITED STATES     The flag of the United States of America     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingSmith Westerns - Weekend       Chicago&apos;s Smith Westerns break out of the relatively dull and dispassionate tunes of their first record and, in the upcoming Dye It Blonde LP, give us 2011&apos;s first truly great album. It&apos;s a wonderful construction upon the flashy glam rock that gave careers to David Bowie and T-Rex, endlessly listenable and replayable, particularly opening track Weekend. VENEZUELA     Flag of Venezuela     BarquisimetoGreasy Grapes - Candles In The Rain       Greasy Grapes are a straight-ahead rock &apos;n&apos; roll band formed in Caracas in early 2006. Their music is influenced by American traditional southern music, which also inspired legendary bands in the late 60s and 70s such as Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Faces, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the The Allman Brothers Band. Candles In The Rain is taken from Greasy Grapes&apos; 2009 debut album At The Back Of The Hill, which blends a vintage vibe with rock, soul, blues and country sounds.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamLola Kite - Everything&apos;s Better       At times pop trio Lola Kite can&apos;t resist the playfulness of lo-fi, losing themselves to retro electro-pop tech and washes of hazy, melodic psychedelia - which undoubtedly reminds you of Animal Collective when combined.", "This Amsterdam indie quartet are fresh, frisky and dancefloor flammable."], "title": "January's best new music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jan/15/january-new-music-map", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Electronic music", "Indie", "Music", "Blogging", "Media", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-16T00:01:00Z", "article": "Terms &amp; Conditions1.

Alfa-Access-Renova, a consortium of Russian billionaires who own the other 50% of TNK-BP, said that a clause in their joint venture requires that AAR and BP pursue all opportunities in Russia exclusively through TNK-BP. Officials of AAR said that it believed it therefore had the right to veto BP&apos;s deal with Rosneft. In Britain, BP&apos;s tie-up with Rosneft yesterday was criticised by Labour&apos;s leader, Ed Miliband, and environmental campaigners. Miliband said that the deal, which gives BP access to huge oilfields in Russia&apos;s Arctic waters, was &quot;worrying&quot;, since it came while the British company was still trying to recover from the explosion on its rig in the Gulf of Mexico which killed 11 people and caused the worst environmental disaster in US history. &quot;I&apos;d be pretty worried about this,&quot; Miliband told the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr Show. &quot;I think the lesson of the Deepwater Horizon, the Gulf oil spill, should be that \u2026 the task for all of us, private companies, government and so on, is not to just keep digging and digging deeper and deeper for oil. It is actually to find those alternative forms of energy that can help us move forward in a clean way.&quot; BP and Rosneft sealed a &quot;strategic global alliance&quot; on Friday in which the two companies would exchange expertise to explore Russia&apos;s Arctic region. The areas cover about 125,000 square kilometres near the South Kara sea. The two companies will also swap 5% of BP shares for 9.5% of Rosneft. Environmentalists are centring their attention on the Arctic region, which they fear could be damaged by large-scale oil exploration and the opening up of trade shipping routes through the region. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: &quot;BP has done little to address the issues raised by the Deepwater Horizon disaster, while last year the Greenland government refused to grant drilling concessions to the company because it wasn&apos;t convinced BP has rigorous enough safety. Now BP has bought its way into the Arctic by the back door. &quot;Oil is already being drilled in the Arctic, in Alaska \u2013 but this is now going into pristine wilderness areas,&quot; Sauven said. &quot;As a society, we either deal with the demand and the efficiency of our transportation system, or we will go to more extremes to get supplies, in places such as the Arctic.&quot; Drilling near the North Pole was also dangerous, as the area is inaccessible most of the year, making it practically impossible to reach the location of any potential oil spill, Sauven said. BP has faced a wave of criticism since announcing the deal to great fanfare and with British and Russian government backing. In the US, where BP is still facing multibillion-dollar fines for the Deepwater spill, politicians have said the deal could jeopardise national security because BP supplies the US military. One also called for the deal to be investigated by the US government&apos;s committee on foreign investment. Critics also questioned BP&apos;s tie with Rosneft, which profited from assets previously owned by Yukos, the Russian oil company dissolved after its boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was jailed for tax evasion. Rosneft bought Yukos&apos;s largest unit for $9.4bn (\u00a35.9bn) from the Russian state, which sold the division to settle part of a tax bill that ultimately surpassed $30bn. Yukos lawyers are still fighting their case, arguing they were expropriated. According to Bloomberg, former Yukos managers and shareholders have filed a $98bn suit in the European court of human rights and a $100bn case in the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague. The first case completed hearings in March 2010 and may issue a judgment this year. Bob Amsterdam, an international law expert, said: &quot;BP has absolutely zero idea what it&apos;s getting into. If it had a dispute with its new partner over what it is getting, the partner would win every time. They are so desperate. This is a bit like a rebound affair: to purge the memory of the last wife, they&apos;ll date anyone.&quot; Amsterdam, who represented Khodorkovsky in his dispute with the Kremlin, also said: &quot;BP will do anything for people not to talk about the Gulf, and Rosneft will do anything for people not to talk about how it got all its assets.&quot;", "sentences": ["Bob Amsterdam, an international law expert, said: &quot;BP has absolutely zero idea what it&apos;s getting into.", "This is a bit like a rebound affair: to purge the memory of the last wife, they&apos;ll date anyone.&quot; Amsterdam, who represented Khodorkovsky in his dispute with the Kremlin, also said: &quot;BP will do anything for people not to talk about the Gulf, and Rosneft will do anything for people not to talk about how it got all its assets.&quot;"], "title": "Miliband calls BP's Russian tie-up 'worrying'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/17/bp-rosneft-criticism-miliband-environmentalists", "tags": ["BP", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "Business", "Oil", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Russia", "World news", "Europe", "South and Central Asia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-17T22:31:00Z", "article": "Tottenham Hotspur have stepped up their interest in the Ajax striker Luis Su\u00e1rez. Harry Redknapp, the Spurs manager, is determined to improve his options up front in order to secure a finish in the Premier League&apos;s top four. The club have also checked on the availability of the Sevilla striker Lu\u00eds Fabiano, who has been a target for some time. Tottenham, who have agreed a fee of \u00a33m with Everton for the midfielder Steven Pienaar, face competition from Liverpool for Su\u00e1rez. The Merseyside club have scouted the Uruguayan since August \u2013 the caretaker manager, Kenny Dalglish, made some of the visits himself \u2013 and they contacted Ajax at the weekend to check on availability and possible prices. Su\u00e1rez, who played for Uruguay at last summer&apos;s World Cup, is known to be interested in playing alongside Fernando Torres. Tottenham have asked Ajax the same questions and sent scouts to scrutinise the player. Ajax are in debt and they would be tempted to cash in on Su\u00e1rez if they were to receive an offer in the region of \u20ac18m (\u00a315m). The player is keen to move on. &quot;Luis is open to a new challenge at a really big club,&quot; said the Ajax coach, Frank de Boer. Su\u00e1rez could expect to improve his current \u20ac2.1m (\u00a31.75m) salary significantly with a switch to the Premier League. Su\u00e1rez was unhappy with Ajax in November, when they did not contest a seven-match ban that was imposed by the Dutch Football Federation after he bit a PSV Eindhoven player, Otman Bakkal. The Uruguayan was also disappointed when Martin Jol resigned as Ajax manager last month. There is a feeling in Amsterdam that De\u00a0Boer, a typical Ajax coach, wedded to a 4-3-3 formation with genuine wingers, might not include Su\u00e1rez in his plans. Under Jol the Uruguayan&apos;s starting position was on the right but he had licence to roam inside. His favourite position is second striker, which he plays for Uruguay. Redknapp has a shortlist of attacking targets which includes Newcastle United&apos;s Andy Carroll \u2013 who is not for sale at any price, according to his club. Spurs also asked Real Madrid last month if they could take Karim Benzema on loan until the end of the season, with an option to buy the Frenchman in the summer. Real, though, have lost the Argentinian Gonzalo Higua\u00edn to a long-term back problem which has necessitated surgery \u2013 and their manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, is more likely to buy a striker than sell one. White Hart Lane has, nevertheless, been gripped by talk that the club have lined up a loan deal for a La\u00a0Liga star; it is known that Redknapp is an admirer of the Real Madrid midfielder Lassana Diarra, whom he employed at his previous club, Portsmouth. Redknapp has already tried to sign the Frenchman for Tottenham. Fabiano, the Brazil No9, has emerged as a viable option, despite complications over who owns him. Sevilla, his present club, are entitled to only a third of his transfer value and, were he to move to the Premier League, third\u2011party ownership issues would have to be settled. Sevilla might be open to the possibility of a loan to a club who could then make the deal permanent in the summer. Neither Suarez nor Fabiano would be eligible to play for Tottenham in the knockout stages of the Champions League, having appeared for their clubs in the competition this season. Redknapp&apos;s priority, however, is the Premier League, and finishing in a position which will bring qualification for next season&apos;s Champions League. Redknapp wants to sell one of the strikers already at the club but Robbie Keane has failed to agree personal terms at Birmingham City, after Tottenham had accepted their \u00a36m offer. Birmingham&apos;s acting chairman, Peter Pannu, said: &quot;The signing of Keane would not be in the best financial interests of the\u00a0club.&quot; Tottenham were happy enough to wait until the summer for Pienaar, when he would have become a free agent, having agreed a deal in principle for him worth \u00a370,000 a week. But Chelsea&apos;s bid of \u00a33m, which was accepted by Everton, forced them to change their plans. Chelsea fell some way short of satisfying Pienaar&apos;s wage demands.", "sentences": ["There is a feeling in Amsterdam that De\u00a0Boer, a typical Ajax coach, wedded to a 4-3-3 formation with genuine wingers, might not include Su\u00e1rez in his plans."], "title": "Tottenham join Liverpool in chase to sign Luis Su\u00e1rez from Ajax", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/17/tottenham-hotspur-luis-suarez", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Ajax", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport", "Luis Su\u00e1rez"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-18T14:10:26Z", "article": "The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today backed a report calling for a brand new hub airport in the south-east to ensure that London retains its position as &quot;the heartbeat of global business&quot;. The Conservative mayor released the report to coincide with a seminar of business leaders held today which is designed to kickstart the debate on the role aviation has to play in the country&apos;s economic future. Today&apos;s report, overseen by Transport for London&apos;s deputy chairman, Daniel Moylan, warns that the UK economy would suffer unless a new hub airport was created in south-east England. Campaigners point out the call is at odds with the current government&apos;s moratorium on airport expansion and with his own avowed concern regarding climate change. While the coalition government has ruled out new runways in south-east England, Johnson has long favoured a new airport in the Thames estuary. Today&apos;s report, which does not specify a particular site for a new airport, sparked calls for Johnson to &quot;come clean&quot; on whether he still has his heart set on this option or is moving away from the idea. The report points out that in terms of destinations served by worldwide international airports, Heathrow had fallen from second in 1990 to seventh in 2010, and the number of destinations that can be directly accessed from Heathrow was now 157 compared with 224 from Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle airport and 235 from Frankfurt. It said that this showed that London&apos;s only hub airport was losing out to other European airports, which if sustained could have long-term damaging effects for the economies of London and the UK. The report also claims that an additional 85 million passengers a year or 564,000 annual flights could be generated at London&apos;s airports within the environmental targets the government has adopted. It added that runway utilisation at Heathrow and Gatwick airports was operating at approximately 99%. This was causing delays and reliability problems. Heathrow is handling up to 75,000 more passengers a day than it was built for. Runway utilisation was typically 70-75% at other major European hub airports. &quot;For London to retain its position as the heartbeat of global business, we need aviation links that will allow us to compete with our rivals,&quot; said Johnson. He added: &quot;The capital&apos;s airports are full, our runways are rammed and we risk losing jobs to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid or other European cities should we fail to act. &quot;No other city even approaches the volume of passengers handled at London&apos;s airports but we need to start planning for a brand new airport that can help meet the ever-increasing demand for aviation and act as a hub, particularly to the rest of the UK.&quot; But Johnson reiterated this cannot be at any cost and reaffirmed his opposition to expansion of Heathrow. Moylan said: &quot;Extra capacity at a hub airport is crucial if we are to support the rebalancing of the UK economy, which this government seeks, while remaining consistent with the mayor&apos;s goals of improving the quality of life of all Londoners and reducing transport&apos;s contribution to climate change.&quot; The dossier does not specify a particular site for a new airport but another Johnson-commissioned report later this year will consider a range of locations for new airport capacity. This will include options for a new airport which could be in the Thames estuary, dubbed &quot;Boris Island&quot; \u2013 which has been Johnson&apos;s strong preference up until now \u2013 as well as consideration of existing sites with the exception of Heathrow. John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group HACAN ClearSkies, said: &quot;The mayor owes it to the people of London and the south-east to come clean on whether he still supports a Thames estuary airport wholeheartedly or if this is one of the many options that he&apos;s floating.&quot; London assembly Green party member Darren Johnson said: &quot;The mayor needs to give up his dead duck plans for a new airport. For a mayor who claims to be concerned about climate change, building a new airport is the last thing he should be considering. &quot;There has been significant opposition to this idea from local people, politicians and from environmental campaigners. The mayor would better represent Londoners&apos; interests by pushing for investment in alternatives to aviation, such as improved and more affordable rail services.&quot; Other detractors include Rodney Chambers, the Tory leader of Medway council in Kent, who described Johnson&apos;s hopes for a Thames estuary airport plan as &quot;pie in the sky&quot;. &quot;It has already been rejected by the government and the aviation industry \u2013 with nine out of 10 air carriers saying they oppose the scheme,&quot; said Chambers. &quot;Yet, despite this, the mayor seems intent on carrying on regardless, wasting public money to try and get support for his project.&quot; A Department for Transport spokesman said of today&apos;s report: &quot;We welcome the mayor&apos;s input and his suggestions will be considered alongside the many other contributions to the debate about our future aviation strategy. &quot;However, we have made clear that we do not support the construction of additional runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted. That is why we are working with interested parties to develop a new framework for aviation which is more sustainable but still supports economic growth.&quot;", "sentences": ["He added: &quot;The capital&apos;s airports are full, our runways are rammed and we risk losing jobs to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid or other European cities should we fail to act."], "title": "Calls for London mayor to 'come clean' on aviation expansion plans", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jan/18/london-mayor-aviation-expansion-report", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Heathrow third runway", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "Business", "London", "Politics", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-18T20:39:08Z", "article": "Steven Gerrard has told Liverpool&apos;s owners to look no further than Kenny Dalglish for the club&apos;s next permanent manager as they commenced their squad overhaul by agreeing to sell Ryan Babel to Hoffenheim. Babel, who has failed to fulfil his rich potential at Anfield since arriving from Ajax for \u00a311.5m in 2007, has travelled to Germany for a medical after Liverpool accepted an offer of around \u00a35.8m for the 24-year-old. The Holland attacker only reiterated a desire to return to Ajax as part of a potential deal for the Uruguay striker Luis Su\u00e1rez this morning but, with his former club unable to match Babel&apos;s Anfield salary and Liverpool preferring a permanent transfer, he will move to Germany providing personal terms can be agreed. In a statement released this evening Liverpool confirmed they &quot;had accepted a bid from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim for the transfer of Dutch international Ryan Babel. The Bundesliga Club have now been given permission to discuss personal terms with the player, who has travelled to Germany.&quot; Babel&apos;s exit would be the first major transfer for Fenway Sports Group as Liverpool owners and the fee from Hoffenheim may improve their prospects of matching Ajax&apos;s demands for Su\u00e1rez. Frank de Boer, the Ajax manager, has said it would take &quot;an absurd amount&quot; for the 23-year-old to leave the Amsterdam ArenA and his club are believed to want between \u20ac25m-\u20ac30m (\u00a321m-\u00a325m) for their former captain. Liverpool&apos;s valuation is closer to \u20ac20m but there has been no official bid as yet. John W Henry, Liverpool&apos;s principal owner, is on Merseyside to discuss transfer policy with Dalglish and Damien Comolli, the club&apos;s director of football strategy. They will also discuss the managerial situation, stadium issues and the search for a new chief executive. Henry is well aware that Dalglish wants to remain at the helm beyond this summer and is the popular choice to succeed Roy Hodgson permanently, thereby complicating the Fenway Sports Group&apos;s plans. Now Gerrard, who was consulted by the then managing director, Christian Purslow, regarding Hodgson&apos;s arrival last summer, has lent his influential voice to the Dalglish campaign. &quot;I want to do everything in my power to ensure that he stays here for a long time, beyond the initial six months,&quot; the Liverpool captain\u00a0said. &quot;I&apos;d love nothing better when the end of the season comes than for us to be on the back of a good run of results that ensures he gets the job full-time. That&apos;s my short-term plan, to give everything I&apos;ve got and all my energy to try to make that happen. I won&apos;t lie. When Kenny rang to say he was coming back it was a big lift. I love Kenny as a person and I&apos;ve certainly enjoyed the first few days we&apos;ve had working with him. I can see a positive future for Kenny at the club.&quot; Dalglish is without a win in his first three matches back at Liverpool but has vanquished the disharmony that surrounded Hodgson&apos;s reign and, certainly against Everton on Sunday, has overseen an improved performance level. The 59-year-old has also been without Gerrard since the 32nd minute of his comeback game, the FA Cup defeat at Manchester United, but the midfielder insists Dalglish has the backing of the entire squad. Gerrard added: &quot;I think Kenny is the perfect person to get everyone moving in the right direction again. He&apos;s the talisman at this club. His nickname, the King, says it all really. He&apos;s the perfect manager and also the person to bring it all together. It&apos;s time to regroup and for us all to be pulling in the right direction because this season certainly hasn&apos;t been good enough.&quot; Liverpool have denied claims by Mark van Bommel&apos;s agent that they want to sign the Bayern Munich captain this month. The 33-year-old Dutch international is out of contract at the end of this season and has several options available, including Milan, Wolfsburg and, according to Mino Raiola, Liverpool. &quot;I know about Liverpool&apos;s interest, but other offers are currently more interesting,&quot; Raiola said.

At a packed press event in Amsterdam, Nintendo is set to tell us when we can get our Euro-hands on the Nintendo 3DS console. But what will be the retail price? And can we expect an enhanced line-up of games? The console will launch in Japan on February 26 with a 25,000 yen price \u2013 that&apos;s about \u00a3190. But the smart money over here is on a UK figure of \u00a3229. All will start to become clear at 2PM, when the event begins. I&apos;ll be live-blogging throughout and if you&apos;re watching Nintendo&apos;s live stream, feel free to share your comments and observations on the Twitter hashtag #gdn3ds. Okay, Nintendo, we&apos;re ready when you are...  Slight technical hitch there. But now we&apos;re on. Jonathan Ross is on stage going through the key features of the Nintendo 3DS.  14:10 We&apos;re being introduced to Spot Pass a new way of receiving content from Wi-Fi networks on the go. It will allow gamers to receive game elements and DLC on the go. They&apos;re working with hotspot partners around Europe.  14:12 Eurosport has signed up to provide sport content for 3DS users. In the UK, Nintendo is also working with Sky 3D to provide shortform 3D content for 3DS users.  14:13 David Sproxton from Aardman is on stage. He&apos;s the creator of Morph. &quot;Aardman prides itself for being at the vanguard of new developments,&quot; he says.  14:16 Shaun the Sheep is coming to Nintendo 3DS in a series of one minute movies, starting at the end of the year.  14.19 We&apos;re now being introduced to Street Pass which allows oyu to have head-tohead battles with other passing gamers. A sort of on-the-go ad-hoc system for gamers, who will be able to match-up while on the move.  14.22 Okay, Nintendo Europe European chief Laurent Fischer has gone, to replaced by Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono. He&apos;s making everyone in the audience do a hadoken!  14.25 Okay what are we going to get? Ono has refered to Laurent as the boring version of George Clooney, brilliantly riffing off of Jonathan Ross&apos; early joke.  14:27 They&apos;re saying that when playing Super Street Fighter IV 3D edition, you receive virtual figurines, which you need to set into your Street Pass system, then you close the system, put it in your pocket and go out into the street. Your character then has mini-Street Fighter battles with the figurines of passing players without you even noticing. Hmm. Street Pass Fighter IV  14.31 Owners of other 3DS consoles will also be able to link-in to two player battles and watch their friends fight. A sort of 3D ad-hoc spectator mode.  14.33 There will be 35 characters in the Super Street Fighter IV 3DS game, some veterans and some complete newcomers.  14.35 Mr Shibita, president of Nintendo Europe is coming on stage. Jonathan has asked Ono who he plays as in Street Fighter. He&apos;s said Ken. He&apos;s asked Jonathan if he plays as Blanka. They&apos;re having fun.  14.36 Satoru Shibata says they&apos;re offering a range of 3DS software from hardcore games to casual titles. That seems like a really good idea.  14.38 Yves Guillemot the CEO of Ubisoft is on stage now. &quot;I am a big fan of the 3DS,&quot; he confesses.  14:39 &quot;Ono IS Ricky Gervais&quot; says GarethAxford on our Tweeter feed.  14.40 Guillemot is showing off Ubisoft&apos;s range of 3DS titles, including Rayman. More on that in a bit.  14:41 Mr Enomoto and Mr Hatsumi from Konami are on now. They&apos;re the producers of the Pro Evolution Soccer series. What are we about to discover?!  14.45 They&apos;re launching PES on the 3DS.  14:47 &quot;3D has enabled us to express depth and improve realism, so players can experience the game as though in the stadium&quot;. They&apos;re a new &apos;player&apos;s view&apos; camera which hovers right behind the player. It&apos;s like actually being on the pitch!  14.50 Mr Enomoto and Mr Hatsumi reckon this new 3D player view will change the whole experience.  14.52 Tecmo Koei&apos;s Team Ninja are next on stage. They developed the Dead or Alive series of gighting games. Yosuke Hayashi is coming on.  14.53 Yosuke Hayashi will no doubt be talking about Dead or Alive Dimensions, which was mentioned at the Japanese launch event.  14.55 Yosuke Hayashi says they&apos;ve always wanted to do a handheld console version of Dead or Alive, but the technology wasn&apos;t available to bring the game&apos;s ludicrously bouncy female characters to the small screen. I&apos;m paraphrasing here.  14.55 Yes, Dead or Alive Dimensions. Yosuke Hayashi says it contains all the highlights of the DOA series so far. Apparently, it&apos;s not just the elaborate stages and lovely characters who are returning. Due to the 3D visuals, it&apos;s coming back &quot;with attitude!&quot; Players will also be able to access combo moves via the touch screen, and the game uses the new 3DS communication features with internet play, local network play, co-op and StreetPass.  14.58 OKay, Jonathan is welcoming back Nintendo Europe&apos;s Laurent Fischer to talk about Nintendo&apos;s games. He&apos;s talking about Pilot Wings, and Nintendoogs + Cats, a new version of the classic pet game, with added cats. &quot;The fur looks absolutely pettable,&quot; says Fischer. Now there&apos;s a USP.  15:01 A quick mention of Kid Icarus and Legend of Zelda. &quot;When I was a kid, throwing stones at each other was a 3D shooting experience,&quot; quips Ross.  15.06 Satoru Shibata is back on stage after a short game preview video. He&apos;s talking about making Mii characters, the avatars that Wii owners use to represent themselves in games. They will apparently be more fun to create on 3DS - and they won&apos;t just appear in games, they&apos;ll also support StreetPass, the ad-hoc Wi-Fi feature. There will also be dedicated Mii-based games, and an updated online shop for downloadable game titles.  15.08 A video of software titles is playing, inlcuding Paper Mario, Driver, Nintendogs + Cats, Resident Evil Mercenaries, Splinter Cell, The Sims 3, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater, Animal Crossing, Pilot Wings Resort, Mario Kart and Kid Icarus. Nothing new...  15.10 Launch date is March 25 across Europe.  15.11 In launch window, between March and start of June, there will be 25 compatible games. The console is also compatible with DS and DSi titles of course.  15.12 Nintendo is embarking on a marketing tour throughout February, putting the 3DS into consumers&apos; hands throughout Europe. Shibata says, &quot;this is the start of a new entertainment era&quot;. There&apos;s no price announcement as Shibata says that retails are currently fixing their own prices.  15.15 Okay, so we got the launch date, Shaun the Sheep, some clarification on StreetPass, a behind-the-player view for PES, and lots of references to Nintendo Europe&apos;s marketing chief Laurent Fischer as &apos;the poor man&apos;s George Clooney&apos;.

The system will be available in two colours: cosmos black and aqua blue.  Most of Nintendo&apos;s Amsterdam press event confirmed details we already knew, both from the E3 unveiling and the recent Japanese press day. The 3DS comes with two screens, the top display providing glasses-free stereoscopic 3D, the bottom standard 2D images and touchscreen functionality. On the left of the bottom screen is an analogue controller, replacing the Nintendo DS d-pad enabling more precise sensitive direction controls. There are also built in motion and gyro sensors for tilt controls. The console also has two cameras on the front so users can take 3D photos. Taking advantage of this feature are a collection of apps, including a set of six AR cards which, when viewed through the camera, show various creatures popping up out of the card \u2013 a familiar augmented reality feature. There&apos;s also Face Raiders, a simple shooter game that lets you fire at silly photos of your own face. &quot;Nintendo 3DS is not just about being able to watch and play in 3D without glasses \u2013 it also offers unique social experiences,&quot; said Laurent Fischer, managing director of marketing at Nintendo Europe. &quot;In the way Wii brought families together, Nintendo 3DS will appeal to a broad range of people.&quot; He was referring to the two new wireless internet features. StreetPass allows different Nintendo 3DS systems to communicate with each other as their owners pass in the street. In this way, strangers will be able to swap game data and items, and even have their Street Fighter IV characters engaging in automatic fights. This concept has been explored before, notably in an old Japanese dating gadget, which would alert users if they passed by other owners who shared the same interests. Also revealed was SpotPass, which will allow 3DS owners to automatically download game updates and content as they pass by Wi-Fi hotspots.  And to continue the fitness focus that has proved so successful on Wii, the Nintendo 3DS can act as a pedometer when put into Sleep Mode. Users can then earn &quot;play coins&quot; for going for a walk, and these can then be traded in for additional content in compatible games and apps. By accessing the Activity Log, users are able to check how many steps they&apos;ve taken. Elsewhere, Nintendo revealed the Mii Maker app, which will allow users to create their own avatars based on photos of themselves. These can then be imported onto memory cards and used as profile images on social networking sites such as FaceBook. Nintendo&apos;s online store, or eShop, will also be updated to offer new versions of classic games as well as mini downloadable 3D titles.  There were also a couple of partner announcements. Eurosport will be supplying 3D sports content on the system, while Aardman Animations is to provide a series of new Shaun the Sheep short movies in 3D. Nintendo has also partnered with BSkyB to attain shortform content from Sky 3D. So, a wide array of functionality and some neat mainstream-friendly ideas. What was lacking from the announcements, was a selection of new games. Only Lego Star Wars III Clone Wars 3D and Crush 3D added to the list of games already mentioned at the Japanese event. Nintendo will also need to get out there and put the 3DS into the hands of skeptical consumers \u2013 at the unveiling of the handheld console at E3 last summer, nothing compared to actually seeing it working.

At an Amsterdam event today, hosted by Jonathan Ross, Nintendo announced that the 3DS will reach UK shops on 25 March, priced between \u00a3219 and \u00a3229. That may sound a hefty for a handheld console, but the 3DS has potential to be a game-changer. As well as running 3D takes on some of the best-loved games franchises, it will take photographs in 3D, run 3D video, let users engage in proximity-based social networking and could bring augmented reality (AR) to the mainstream. Some industry experts are describing it as a contender for must-have gadget of the year. Gamers will find its charms hard to resist, despite the high price \u2013 partly explained by a 3D screen that is essentially one screen on top of another, and the use of the most powerful graphics chip ever fitted to a Nintendo handheld console. Nintendo said that, between the launch and June, 25 3DS games will go on sale. These will include favourite franchises such as Pro Evolution Soccer, Nintendogs (this time including cats), Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Driver, Ridge Racer, Splinter Cell, The Legend of Zelda and Super Street Fighter. Yves Guillemot, the president of the games publisher Ubisoft, admitted that many 3DS games will be pricier than existing DS games (which typically cost \u00a329.99), but not all. &quot;It depends on how big your game is,&quot; he said. &quot;For the small ones, they will be the same as the DS. But if you go with lots of video, then the cartridges will need more storage so the games will become more expensive.&quot; Price issues notwithstanding, Guillemot added: &quot;We expect it will sell a lot faster than the DS, because the DS brought a number of new customers to the industry, like young girls who had not played before and older people via games like Dr Kawashima&apos;s Brain Training, and they will want the 3DS.&quot; Concerns have been raised that very young children playing on the console could develop eyesight issues due to their sight not being fully formed. David Yarnton, the managing director of Nintendo UK, said: &quot;We recommend that for under-six-year-olds, it&apos;s not advisable to play in 3D. &quot;With any product, when you&apos;re looking at a screen on a prolonged basis, you should have a break. And there&apos;s a parental lock, so parents can force it to play in 2D.&quot; The console will also come with a number of AR cards which, when photographed, will activate mini-games. Yarnton believes &quot;it will be our most successful launch ever&quot;.", "sentences": ["At an Amsterdam event today, hosted by Jonathan Ross, Nintendo announced that the 3DS will reach UK shops on 25 March, priced between \u00a3219 and \u00a3229."], "title": "Nintendo to launch 3D console in spring", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/19/nintendo-3d-console-launch", "tags": ["3DS", "Nintendo", "Games", "Technology", "World news", "DS", "3D", "Handheld", "Augmented reality", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-20T14:13:00Z", "article": "Nintendo possesses an endearingly old-school quality, which clearly manifested itself in the press conference kicking off its big 3DS unveiling in Amsterdam, whose general shambolicness was summed up when compere Jonathan Ross read a chunk of autocue text earmarked for delivery by Nintendo Europe general manager Satoru Shibata. Because of the need for widespread Japanese-English translation, many of the 3DS&apos;s most interesting aspects barely had their surfaces scratched and, shamefully, Shibata-san completely copped out of delivering the one piece of information that everyone wanted to know: the machine&apos;s price (saying, to audible groans, that we&apos;d have to ask the retailers). But none of that mattered a jot. The price issue was easily resolved once I&apos;d caught up with Nintendo UK&apos;s managing director, David Yarnton \u2013 a thoroughly engaging, plain-speaking Aussie who never has any truck with sophistry (for the record, it will be either \u00a3219.99 or \u00a3229.99 \u2013 essentially, the supermarkets will be the retailers lopping off an extra tenner). And more importantly, there were plenty of hands-on opportunities on offer after the press conference \u2013 more than sufficient to confirm that the 3DS is such an astonishingly seductive box of tricks that it may well be Nintendo&apos;s best piece of hardware ever. No Virtual Boy, this. Games galore The roster of games on offer during the 3DS&apos;s launch window is pretty impressive, and third-party developers and publishers have obviously embraced it with enthusiasm. If you were in the mood to carp, you might argue that it seems to be long on rehashes of familiar franchises. But that is to be expected in the early stages of a new console \u2013 development is much quicker when it makes use of existing assets and big franchises are more or less guaranteed to sell well. And even those rehashed, familiar classics were impressive to behold on the 3DS \u2013 not just because they popped out of the screen thanks to the stereoscopic 3D, but also because of the console&apos;s 3D graphics accelerator chip, which is way more powerful than anything Nintendo has previously put into a handheld and for the first time, naturally, can display proper 3D (as distinct from stereoscopic 3D) graphics. Graphically, it&apos;s at least on a par with the Wii. So all those franchises that, even on the DSi, had to make do with 2D graphics made to look three-dimensional, or top-down perspectives, now operate in their full glory. Super Street Fighter IV, Pro Evolution Soccer, The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, Driver, Super Monkey Ball and Resident Evil Mercenaries were all impressive to behold for a handheld, even if you turned off the stereoscopic 3D. You could see the first stirrings of how the stereoscopic 3D could be used to enhance gameplay: its added perspective really helps you aim over long distances (which would be handy, for instance, in games involving sniping). Some of the games on show experimented with unusual camera-angles in an attempt to capitalise on that. Super Street fighter IV lets you switch on an over-the-shoulder view (which we were a bit equivocal about, although that could be due to sheer familiarity with the original perspective), and Pro Evolution Soccer boasts a player&apos;s perspective view which worked well.     Super Monkey Ball 3D is one of the 3DS launch games    Resident Evil Mercenaries \u2013 a sort of compilation of the best bits of Resident Evil 4 and 5, although an original take on the franchise, Resident Evil Revelations, is in the pipeline \u2013 broke with tradition by dropping into a first-person view when you aimed your gun (aiming, as any Ressie fan knows, removes your ability to walk around). Super Monkey Ball really made sense on the 3DS, with the added perspective enabling you to manipulate your ball with extra precision (plus, it made use of the 3DS&apos;s orientation-sensing gyroscope). The stereoscopic 3D also added new atmosphere to familiar scenes \u2013 running through a 3D forest in Ocarina of Time, for example, felt twice as immersive as the original. Impressive new abilities At this stage of the 3DS&apos;s development, one thing that remains unclear is how developers will employ its unique abilities to bring about new forms of gameplay, although there were plenty of indicators towards an innovative future. The machine&apos;s twin cameras, which let it shoot video in 3D, generate some genuinely exciting possibilities as far as Augmented Reality (AR) games are concerned \u2013 AR has long been more of a buzz-phrase than anything tangible but the 3DS, you sense, has the power finally to redress that balance. Its best manifestation came in the form of a mini-game called Face Raiders, which will be pre-loaded on the 3DS. Although a mere mini-game, it&apos;s an act of genius, which clearly deserves to be expanded into a full game. You begin by carefully positioning yourself so it can scan your face, which it then morphs in a variety of grotesque manners, before inserting it in yellow balls which you have to shoot. Meanwhile, aiming is taken care of by the gyroscope so, with a sight in the middle of the screen, you physical move the 3DS left, right, up and down, before firing with the A button. All the while, the 3D cameras are operational, so the background to the proceedings (which is progressively shattered by your bullets) is provided by whatever is around you. And eventually, it transforms your face into a boss, who must be knocked out of invulnerability by timing your shots so that they knock purple balls into him. My first 3D TV The fact that the 3DS can display 3D TV, somewhat glossed over during the press conference, is hugely significant, given its up-to-the-minute Wi-Fi capabilities. Yarnton confirmed that Nintendo has already struck deals with Eurosport and Sky, which will deliver short-form, compilation-type programmes in stereoscopic 3D for download. We can safely assume this will include things such as Premier League goals and truncated sporting highlights programmes, and probably cartoons and episodes of short TV programmes. Ironically, Sony must be rubbing its hands in glee at this, hoping that it drives consumer enthusiasm for 3D TV. Although whether they will settle for viewing 3D TV via glasses is a moot point. If the 3DS is a massive hit, it will undoubtedly accelerate the process of driving down the cost of bigger glasses-free 3D screens via economies of scale. Given Sony&apos;s evangelistic approach to 3D TV, it will be interesting to see what sort of 3D screen the PSP2 has. The location-based Street Pass system, which lets 3DS owners exchange gaming information and the like when they walk past each other, is also intriguing, although we didn&apos;t manage to avail ourselves of any sort of demo.     The 3DS Street Pass lets 3DS owners exchange gaming information    Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot made an interesting point, though, asserting that it will support Facebook-style games in which you spend time at home building up the abilities of characters, and can then take them out into the wild to fight random people, or a group of similarly inclined friends at a specific location. Street pass seems to offer an opportunity for accessory manufacturers, since the only built-in way in which it alerts you of the proximity of another DS owner is by changing the colour of a flashing LED, and you wouldn&apos;t imagine 3DS owners would want to wander around everywhere clutching their precious machines. Overall impressions The 3DS may look like any other handheld console, but it has an unbelievable technological depth to it which throws up an almost bewildering welter of possibilities. Some, undoubtedly, will prove more seductive than others, but if you thought the original DS, with its touchscreen, was revolutionary, prepare to be absolutely blown away on 25 March. We certainly can&apos;t wait to get our hands on one.", "sentences": ["Nintendo possesses an endearingly old-school quality, which clearly manifested itself in the press conference kicking off its big 3DS unveiling in Amsterdam, whose general shambolicness was summed up when compere Jonathan Ross read a chunk of autocue text earmarked for delivery by Nintendo Europe general manager Satoru Shibata."], "title": "Nintendo 3DS hands-on: it's an astonishingly seductive box of tricks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/20/nintendo-3ds-hands-on-preview", "tags": ["3DS", "Nintendo", "Games", "Technology", "DS", "Handheld", "3D", "Television", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-20T15:09:01Z", "article": "It&apos;s being hailed as the device that will bring 3D entertainment to the masses, but it would appear there&apos;s a dimension to the forthcoming Nintendo 3DS console that parents should be aware of. Optometrists are warning that children under six should not use the glasses-free device, which employs a technology known as &quot;parallax barrier&quot; \u2013 essentially, two screens on top of each other \u2013 to create a 3D view. Speaking after Nintendo&apos;s announcement of the European launch date of the 3DS, Karen Sparrow, from the Association of Optometrists, said: &quot;Children need a clear, sharp image in each eye in order for their vision to develop properly. If anything upsets that balance (natural or artificial) it could affect the visual development resulting in &apos;amblyopia&apos; (lazy eye) or a squint. &quot;This can be a problem when viewing 3D if you have a weaker eye. If a child spends excessive time using a device such as the 3DS, it could effectively act as a negative exercise, as opposed to strengthening the eye, and it can leave it underdeveloped, causing a &apos;lazy eye&apos;.&quot; It is a problem that Nintendo itself has addressed. In December, the company posted a warning on its Japanese website suggesting that children of six or under should not play 3D games on the 3DS; 2D games are unaffected. Of course, these problems are not confined to the 3DS. Watching 3D movies or 3D TV may represent similar risks for immature eyes. However, Sparrow has suggested that the handheld nature of the 3DS may be an exacerbating factor. &quot;The close proximity of the device could place more stress on eyesight than looking at a television set, meaning that eyes have to focus harder, and it is more likely to be used by children for longer periods.&quot; As for those of us over the age of six, it&apos;s suggested that gamers take a five-minute rest every hour \u2013 though that might not be a cure-all. After the Japanese press event for the 3DS earlier this year, a magazine claimed that large numbers of attendees were suffering from discomforts such as dizziness and nausea after sampling the hardware. There seem to have been few such complaints from the Amsterdam event. It&apos;s not the first time Nintendo has faced the prospect of inadvertently sickening its gamers. In 1995, the company launched the Virtual Boy \u2013 a head-mounted games console, complete with a simple stereoscopic display, which could only display red graphics. The expensive contraption gave many users splitting headaches and it was eventually canned. At least this time, Nintendo has had the vision to provide a slider which switches off the 3D effect, and selection of parental controls which allow 3D to be blocked. Whether they&apos;ll need to protect themselves against stereoscopic nausea is another matter.", "sentences": ["There seem to have been few such complaints from the Amsterdam event."], "title": "Nintendo 3DS 'could harm children's sight', parents warned", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/20/nintendo-3ds-could-harm-child-eyes-claim", "tags": ["3DS", "Nintendo", "Technology", "DS", "Games", "Health", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-22T00:01:04Z", "article": "When I was about 13 I got a\u00a0job as a waitress at a tea shop called Philpott&apos;s in Waltham Abbey, Essex, where I grew up. It was owned by a wonderful chap called Harry Philpott. I think I was earning about \u00a31 an hour, it might even have been 80p! But I absolutely loved it. It was a quintessentially English tea shop in a very pretty market town and we got lots of American tourists in. I used to make cream teas and bake all the scones. Harry was the first gay man I knew. He really took me under his wing and he taught me all about classical music. For extra money I also used to clean his flat above the shop and he would play me classical music while I cleaned; he even gave me an LP of Mozart&apos;s greatest hits as a gift. We became very close. I learned a lot of life lessons there. Most of the other girls there were older than me and the conversations were a bit fruity sometimes. It sounds a little weird now, but one year Harry took them to Amsterdam as a Christmas treat \u2013 I wasn&apos;t allowed to go because I was so young. The following year, he took everyone to the Hippodrome and my mum let me go on the condition that I wasn&apos;t allowed to drink. We all thought they were fabulous treats. It was the early 1980s, when people were becoming much more aware of Aids; I remember his boyfriend was HIV positive and eventually died of that. I don&apos;t know if Harry had Aids as well, but he died relatively young too, in his late 50s. I left Philpott&apos;s at about 16 when my school studies got more time-consuming, plus I started doing a lot of travelling around then. But I have nothing but fond memories of that time.

The opening of a proposed Frankfurt-to-London route faces delays due to French objections over the train that will be used by the German state rail operator. It is understood that lobbying has taken place at the highest levels, with David Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, registering their concerns with the French government. The dispute is rooted in the decision by Eurostar, the French-controlled cross-Channel operator, to buy new trains manufactured by German engineering group Siemens, shunning a rival bid from French group Alstom. The French government has backed Alstom&apos;s argument that the Siemens trains breach safety guidelines because their motors are concealed under carriages and distributed along the train. Deutsche Bahn planned to operate the Frankfurt service with the same type of train but the organisation is now concerned that the row will stop the venture from launching as planned in December 2013. DB is believed to need clearance for its trains over the next few months to have a realistic chance of introducing services by 2013, with the launch date now in danger of slipping into 2014. The row has prompted a group of MPs and peers to write to the tunnel safety body, the Channel tunnel intergovernmental commission, amid fears among rail industry figures that the organisation, staffed by French and British appointees, is under political pressure. The letter from the all-party parliamentary rail group states that the group &quot;would be disappointed to see Britain deprived of these rail services due to administrative delays&quot;. Lord Berkeley, secretary of the group, said: &quot;It is very important for open access and competition reasons in the passenger market that the issue of getting safety approval for the trains through the tunnel is undertaken dispassionately and objectively.&quot; Despite some movement on tunnel safety rules last year when the intergovernmental commission asked the Channel tunnel owner to devise new rules to allow trains with distributed traction, it is understood the commission has yet to approve the overall safety case for the DB service. A senior member of the commission&apos;s French delegation was removed from her post last year after sending positive signals about the Eurostar Siemens deal. In another attempt to get the service approved, the body that oversees European rail safety, the European Railway Agency, is expected to examine the proposals for distributed traction. However, regardless of the outcome of the protracted discussions, sources close to the process fear further discussions of other aspects of the DB service at the intergovernmental commission will be gridlocked, further pushing back the Frankfurt launch. The planned Frankfurt-to-London route would represent a boost for the coalition government&apos;s transport policy, which backs high-speed rail as a replacement for airport expansion. DB plans to run 200mph trains from the capital to Frankfurt, Cologne, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, expanding the rail market between Britain and the continent by 10% by carrying 1 million passengers a year. Last year the rail minister, Theresa Villiers, said she expected the service to take &quot;a lot of share&quot; from airlines. DB expects the journey from London to Frankfurt to take just over five hours, with London to Cologne and London to Amsterdam taking four. According to rail and airline industry convention, a service needs to take no more than four hours if it is to compete with airlines. But the row over DB&apos;s planned use of state-of-the-art Intercity-Express (ICE) trains has overshadowed the proposals. In an attempt to prove the design is not a threat to safety, DB conducted tests in the last year involving 300 volunteers. A Department for Transport spokesman said: &quot;We are hoping to make progress on the service and we believe that the new safety regime is adequate. We are determined to allow the expansion of rail services between the UK and Europe.&quot;", "sentences": ["DB plans to run 200mph trains from the capital to Frankfurt, Cologne, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, expanding the rail market between Britain and the continent by 10% by carrying 1 million passengers a year.", "DB expects the journey from London to Frankfurt to take just over five hours, with London to Cologne and London to Amsterdam taking four."], "title": "Channel tunnel row threatens to derail high-speed London-Frankfurt link", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/23/channel-tunnel-row-threatens-london-frankfurt-link", "tags": ["Business", "Channel Tunnel", "Rail transport", "Rail transport", "Transport", "Travel", "Siemens"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-24T07:01:03Z", "article": "Kenny Dalglish appreciates much has changed since he last managed Liverpool, including, by his own admission, the length of his trousers and the quality of his eyesight. Yet the trademark way Dalglish celebrates goals \u2013 wide grin, both arms raised aloft with fingers outstretched \u2013 and his core beliefs about the club he loves have not altered in the slightest over the last 20 years. After overseeing his first Liverpool victory in his second spell in charge at Anfield, Dalglish spoke about how satisfying it was to be &quot;back in the Liverpool way&quot;. That phrase, to Dalglish, encompasses everything from winning matches, to the club conducting its business &quot;behind closed doors&quot; and the players &quot;standing beside each other&quot; on the pitch. &quot;I know it&apos;s a different era than it was before. But the principles are the same,&quot; he said. Dalglish may have further cheer this week with Damien Comolli, the club&apos;s director of football strategy, due in Amsterdam today to discuss the pursuit of Luis Su\u00e1rez with Ajax. This was a restorative afternoon for Liverpool in so many ways. As well as rejoicing at the sight of a rare Liverpool away win, the travelling supporters were treated to a Fernando Torres double away from home for the first time in 16 months and a wonder strike from Raul Meireles that embellished a fine performance from the Portugal international. Dalglish, however, took greatest pleasure from the collective response from a group of players whose confidence has been battered this season. &quot;I said when I came in, for the players to have the same belief in themselves that other people have. And it&apos;s difficult when you&apos;re repeatedly knocked down but it&apos;s great credit to them that they&apos;ve worked really hard since we came in. This game was great evidence that everybody is going to stick together and be supportive of each other and do what their respective responsibilities are to get the best results we can.&quot; It was also evidence of a much more attacking Liverpool approach away from home with Dalglish at the helm. Torres reaped the rewards as Liverpool broke in numbers to support the Spaniard and punish an abject Wolves side who are heading back to the Championship on this form. Meireles was particularly impressive as he set up Torres&apos;s first, after running on to Christian Poulsen&apos;s pass, before thumping a sumptuous volley over Wayne Hennessey for Liverpool&apos;s second. Although Meireles was Roy Hodgson&apos;s signing, it has taken the arrival of Dalglish to liberate the midfielder. After 17 Premier League games and 33 shots without scoring, he now has two goals in as many matches. The only conundrum for Dalglish is where he will play Meireles, who has looked much improved in a central attacking midfield role, when Steven Gerrard is back from suspension for Fulham&apos;s visit on Wednesday. The feelgood factor is returning at Liverpool with Dalglish in charge, and this was unquestionably a step in the right direction, yet the reality is that it will need much more than a victory over a listless Wolves side before any wider conclusions can be drawn. Wolves accelerated Hodgson&apos;s departure when they won 1-0 at Anfield last month but they never looked like repeating that result on Saturday as they struggled in every department. &quot;Things change when a new manager comes in and credit to Liverpool, they&apos;ve come down and been a lot better than when we won at Anfield,&quot; said Stephen Ward. &quot;The second goal came at a vital time and shows the quality that they have. You can&apos;t legislate for that sort of quality \u2013 sticking it in the top corner from 25 yards. We never wrote them off before the game and you can see why from how they played and the players that they have.&quot; It was alarming to see Wolves punt so many balls from back to front as they ran out of ideas as to how to penetrate a Liverpool defence who had failed to keep a clean sheet in their previous seven matches. The one silver lining was Adam Hammill&apos;s debut. Hammill, a former Liverpool academy graduate who was signed from Barnsley in the week, played with wit and imagination during his 17-minute cameo and could have pulled a goal back. The enduring image at Molineux, however, was the Liverpool manager celebrating with that iconic pose we have seen so many times before. &quot;I used to wear shorter trousers [in the past],&quot; said Dalglish, who laughed off suggestions nothing has changed by also pointing out he needs contact lenses now. &quot;If you can&apos;t enjoy somebody scoring a goal for you, then you shouldn&apos;t be standing there. It&apos;s not an act. It&apos;s just spontaneous.&quot;", "sentences": ["Dalglish may have further cheer this week with Damien Comolli, the club&apos;s director of football strategy, due in Amsterdam today to discuss the pursuit of Luis Su\u00e1rez with Ajax."], "title": "Times change for Kenny Dalglish but not the Liverpool way", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/24/wolverhampton-wanderers-liverpool-premier-league", "tags": ["Premier League", "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2010-11"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-24T10:55:36Z", "article": "Brian Turner served for seven years in the US Army.

Liverpool are reluctant to pay more than \u00a318m for the Ajax captain, who turned 24 today and is keen on a move to Merseyside, but know that will not make Su\u00e1rez the marquee signing that the manager, Kenny Dalglish, is seeking this month. The gap in valuation between the parties was outlined by an Ajax spokesman, who said: &quot;We&apos;ll have to wait for them to come back with something more respectful. We want to keep him \u2013 at least until the end of the season and preferably for the rest of his contract.

Adam yesterday handed in a transfer request but will be selected for Blackpool against Manchester United tonight. He is keen to fulfil a boyhood dream by joining Liverpool and his manager, Ian Holloway, says he does not want to stand in his way but is adamant the offer of \u00a34m on the table will have to be significantly improved for business to be done this month. &quot;I completely understand Charlie wanting to go but he completely understands out position too,&quot; Holloway said. &quot;He loves this club and putting in a transfer request doesn&apos;t change that. There&apos;s no chance of him throwing his toys out of the pram and there&apos;s no chance of me leaving him out of the United game. He&apos;d probably kill me if I did that.&quot; Holloway confirmed that Damien Comolli, Liverpool&apos;s director of football strategy, had spoken to Blackpool&apos;s chairman, Karl Oyston, about buying Adam but not about increasing the price. Liverpool are expected to make a fresh offer for the 25-year-old but it is less clear whether they will do likewise over Su\u00e1rez. Comolli held a brief meeting in Amsterdam yesterday with Ajax&apos;s general director, Rik van den Boog, where he was told the Dutch club would not consider an offer below \u20ac30m (\u00a325m) for Su\u00e1rez. Liverpool are reluctant to pay more than \u00a318m for the Ajax captain, who is keen on a move to Merseyside, and Ryan Babel will not be part of any exchange because the forward&apos;s proposed \u00a35.8m move to Hoffenheim was back on and close to completion last night following a change of heart, with the Dutchman due in Germany today to finalise the transfer. Comolli and Dalglish have alternative targets including Sevilla&apos;s Alvaro Negredo. Ajax said Liverpool were miles from their valuation. &quot;We&apos;ll have to wait for them to come back with something more respectful,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We want to keep him \u2013 at least until the end of the season and preferably for the rest of his contract.

He was one of the big guys for Uruguay in helping them come third in the World Cup in the summer and he still has a contract with us for two and a half years.&quot; Referring to Comolli&apos;s talks with Blackpool&apos;s chairman over Adam, Holloway said: &quot;He ummed and aahed and apparently did not make much sense. We need to be compensated correctly in this matter and at the moment Liverpool are simply not offering anything like enough. &quot;Charlie is our captain and best player \u2013 I have never had anyone as good as him, anywhere \u2013 and he has 18 months left on his contract. So if Liverpool want him now, instead of waiting until summer when it would be easier for us, they have to pay a fair price, a price that reflects the loss to us. That&apos;s the way my chairman sees it and if Liverpool don&apos;t do things correctly he will dig his heels in. &quot;If that happens a deal might not be reached because he&apos;s one of the most stubborn, pig-headed men in the game. He has only just agreed to shell out on new showers. The way I see it is that if Chris Smalling is worth \u00a310m \u2013 and he hardly ever plays for Manchester United \u2013 and Darren Bent is worth \u00a324m, an offer of \u00a34m for Charlie cannot be taken seriously. &quot;He ain&apos;t going for that price, he&apos;s got too long left on his contract and he&apos;s much too important to us. Liverpool needed to start talks at around four times that amount; now it&apos;s time for them to put up or shut up.&quot; Holloway is resigned to losing Adam to someone \u2013 he is far too realistic to expect him to turn down big clubs in favour of staying at Blackpool \u2013 and reckons the midfielder could be the new Xabi Alonso at Liverpool. Everyone at Bloomfield Road is aware how much a move to Liverpool would mean to the player \u2013 the Blackpool players serenaded their captain with You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone in the dressing room on Saturday \u2013 but Holloway does not see why he should part with him on the cheap. &quot;If that is really all Liverpool think he is worth then I don&apos;t think they have seen him enough,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they should watch him again against United. He can&apos;t walk out on us because he has signed a contract, and he would never do that anyway. Plus, you have to take our situation into account. At the beginning of the week we were 10th in the Premier League with the worst budget ever. All we&apos;ve had to spend is \u00a310m, and without Charlie we could still end up bottom. It&apos;s all very well saying we have 28 points already, but we still need four more wins, I reckon, and of the 16 games we have left we still have to play United twice, Spurs twice, and Arsenal and Chelsea. We only have one win in our last five games, so nothing is certain.&quot; Adam has also been the subject of offers from Aston Villa, whose manager, G\u00e9rard Houllier, has accused Holloway of double standards. Houllier is angry that Holloway distanced Dalglish from the bid made by the Anfield club, yet did exactly the opposite when talking about Villa&apos;s offers. &quot;I noticed this weekend that I was not treated the same way as my friend Kenny Dalglish,&quot; Houllier said. &quot;Ian said: &apos;It must not come from Kenny.&apos; When Kenny makes a bid, it comes from the club. He called me all sorts of things because our club, officially, did the right things, and went to them. He went back to the press having a go at me.&quot; Blackpool&apos;s game tonight is a rearranged fixture from last month, when the Bloomfield Road pitch was frozen. Holloway was initially glad he did not have to face United straight after their 7-1 result against Blackburn, but realised little had changed when he saw them win 5-0 against Birmningham on Saturday. &quot;And people are saying they are not playing well,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d hate to play against them when they are really confident and on top of their game. I am fearful about what they might do to us, we are quite open, but at the same time I&apos;m bursting with pride that Manchester United are coming to play my team. I think they are terrific, a credit to football, and if we can manage not to be a couple of goals down after 10 minutes I&apos;ll be delighted.&quot; Having made no secret of his admiration for Sir Alex Ferguson at numerous points in the season, Holloway is looking forward to offering the United manager the usual post-match hospitality. &quot;I&apos;m sure we can run to a glass of red wine,&quot; he said. &quot;I doubt it will be anything special though. Just the normal stuff from Tesco.&quot;", "sentences": ["Comolli held a brief meeting in Amsterdam yesterday with Ajax&apos;s general director, Rik van den Boog, where he was told the Dutch club would not consider an offer below \u20ac30m (\u00a325m) for Su\u00e1rez."], "title": "Ian Holloway says Adam can leave but only for the right price", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/25/liverpool-charlie-adam-blackpool", "tags": ["Blackpool", "Ian Holloway", "Liverpool", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-25T00:06:04Z", "article": "Here&apos;s the guts of the matter. Should more than half a billion pounds of public money be written off in order to make life financially sweeter for one or other of two football clubs owned, respectively, by an offshore currency speculator and a couple of multimillionaire pornographers? Which is what it would amount to if, in two weeks&apos; time, the 15 voting directors of the Olympic Park Legacy Company decided to invite either Tottenham Hotspur or West Ham United to take over the new stadium in Stratford after the 2012 Games. Desperation has led the legacy board to conclude that donating the stadium to a big football club is the only way out of their dilemma, even though such a decision risks betraying the promises made to the International Olympic Committee six years ago, when London&apos;s bid won the day on the basis of a solemn vow to regenerate one of London&apos;s more neglected boroughs for the specific benefit of future generations of its young people. That pledge included a very precise scheme for downsizing the main Olympic venue to a 25,000-seater suitable primarily but not exclusively for track and field events, thus making a lasting commitment to the disciplines that are, in most people&apos;s minds, at the heart of the Games. A host of Britain&apos;s Olympians were paraded to endorse a self-evidently appropriate plan. Intrinsically, neither offer from the world of football is worth serious consideration. Spurs, requiring a stadium that holds more than their present capacity of 36,000 if they are to consolidate their new place among the elite, have spent the past few years in complicated discussions with Haringey council over a proposed redevelopment of White Hart Lane. Adjacent land has been bought, planning approval was granted in September, and the scheme awaited only the government&apos;s blessing. A few weeks ago, however, the club saw a chance to save some money. Rather a lot of money, actually. The White Hart Lane scheme would cost \u00a3450m, around twice the outlay required to knock down the Olympic Stadium and build a 60,000-seat football arena, tearing up the club&apos;s own roots in the process. To soften the impact, Spurs tacked on a spin doctor&apos;s half-baked notion of redeveloping the Crystal Palace track. There is some merit to West Ham&apos;s claim that at least relocation would be taking place within their home borough. Many of their hardcore fans, however, are not taking kindly to the idea of being evicted from Upton Park, which would be sold for redevelopment for around \u00a340m. Why should they? The 35,000 capacity of their present ground \u2013 with agreement for an expansion to 40,000 \u2013 seems entirely congruent with the club&apos;s standing and prospects. If either club had joined in when the 2012 stadium was being planned, its design could have incorporated the sort of retractable seating used at the Stade de France. They did not. Instead they now claim the right to barge in at the last minute in the guise of saviours, bending everybody else&apos;s plans to fit their own desires. No one can seriously pretend that a football pitch with a running track around it is a good idea. The most unatmospheric match I ever attended, many years ago, was a Dutch first division fixture between DWS Amsterdam and MVV Maastricht in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympic Stadium. Football is not played there any more, but its architectural merit saved it from demolition. Today it is used as an athletics venue and contains a sports museum. There is no longer the remotest chance that the 2012 stadium will be the focal point, as originally envisaged, of an institute for sport incorporating a boarding school for young elite athletes. But why not use some imagination and create a year-round programme of athletics events for young people of all abilities? Perhaps it could even become the venue for Michael Gove&apos;s projected Schools Olympics. Now there&apos;s a way of calling the education secretary&apos;s bluff: to keep the place going as a downsized athletics stadium, it is said, would cost about \u00a35m a year, or half the annual budget proposed for Gove&apos;s Games. In the universe of which we are talking, these are not large sums. And they are worth spending, surely, to keep a promise made to the world. Hanie was ice cool but the Freezer froze him out  American football coaches are diligent in their research work on opponents, but the Green Bay Packers&apos; defensive co-ordinator confessed that he hadn&apos;t a clue what to expect when Caleb Hanie, the Chicago Bears&apos; third-string quarterback, came on towards the end of the third quarter in the NFC Championship game on Sunday night. With a Super Bowl place at stake, the Bears were 14-0 down and going nowhere in front of 61,000 of their own fans when Hanie replaced Todd Collins, who had earlier replaced Jay Cutler. At the start of the final quarter the new arrival mounted a stirring drive that led to a touchdown, bringing the score to 14-7 and giving Chicago precious momentum. With five minutes left, he threw a 35-yard pass for his side&apos;s second touchdown. In between, unfortunately, he had thrown a short pass straight to an opponent. B\u00a0J\u00a0Raji, Green Bay&apos;s nose tackle, needed only to trundle 18\u00a0yards to make the score that put the game beyond the Bears&apos; reach.

Richard Keys and Andy Gray were dropped from presenting Bolton Wanderers&apos; match against Chelsea as their employer was forced to condemn their comments about the female assistant referee Sian Massey, who was branded &quot;fucking hopeless&quot;, and the West Ham United vice\u2011chair, Karren Brady. The Sky Sports managing director, Barney Francis, said he had spoken to both men personally to tell them their comments were &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; and &quot;inexcusable from anyone at Sky regardless of their role or seniority&quot;. The pair will be absent from screens until at least next week and have been warned that any repeat is likely to be a sackable offence. The insults levelled at Massey came just days after a meeting of senior European football figures, convened by Uefa and the Football Association, concluded that football is &quot;institutionally sexist&quot; \u2013 run, across the continent, by a self-perpetuating &quot;old boys&apos; club&quot;. Further humiliating footage emerged of an exchange between Gray and a Sky touchline reporter in which they discussed Massey in disparaging terms before going on air. BSkyB has poured millions into partnerships with British Cycling and corporate sports-based social responsibility initiatives in a bid to soften its image and highlight its investment in grassroots sport. There will be concerns that huge investment could be undermined if it was perceived that the attitudes of Gray and Keys are widespread. Keys and Gray were recorded before the match at Molineux between Woverhampton Wanderers and Liverpool on Saturday making derogatory remarks, which were not broadcast, about Massey. She has been selected by the Premier League as one of three &quot;level two&quot; officials with the potential to officiate at a higher level. Gray said &quot;somebody&apos;s fucked up big&quot; by appointing Massey to run the line. Keys agreed, saying Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool manager, &quot;will go potty&quot;. Referring to the Premier League&apos;s first female assistant referee, Gray said: &quot;Wendy Toms, she was fucking hopeless as well.&quot; Francis added: &quot;We have dealt with this matter by taking immediate disciplinary action. As with any employee it would not be right to go into detail on those proceedings. However, they have been clearly warned about their behaviour and reminded of their responsibilities.&quot;A spokesman for the Professional Game Match Officials Board said last night that Keys had phoned Massey on Sunday night to offer a personal apology, which she accepted. The 25-year-old will run the line tonight at Crewe Alexandra&apos;s game against Bradford City. Through Twitter, Ferdinand praised Massey and added: &quot;I&apos;m all for women refereeing in football, discrimination should not happen in our game at all ... prehistoric views if u think otherwise.&quot; The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, has joined the chorus of criticism. The government is likely to put pressure on the FA to overhaul its governance structures to make it more representative and inclusive in the wake of a parliamentary select committee inquiry, submissions to which are due in this week. The Uefa meeting, held in Amsterdam last week to launch an effort to address &quot;institutional discrimination&quot;, considered new research which documented the &quot;under-representation&quot; of women in coaching or executive positions, and a finding that &quot;more than 99%&quot; of European football&apos;s senior administrators, at clubs and football associations, are middle-aged to elderly white men. Referring to the lack of women coaches, executives or club directors, the report, by Dr Steven Bradbury of Loughborough University, concluded there is a &quot;deeply masculine culture, and overt and casual sexism inherent within the men&apos;s game&quot;. The report by Bradbury and his research team, presented to the &quot;institutional discrimination&quot; seminar which included the presidents of five European football associations, three members of Uefa&apos;s executive committee and Sue Law, the FA&apos;s head of equality and child protection, stated that in football, knowledge and expertise are assumed to belong to &quot;the male expert&quot; and women&apos;s abilities are &quot;devalued and invalidated&quot;. &quot;These stereotypical perceptions which equate women with a lack of suitability and competence have contributed to &apos;filtering out&apos; women from accessing leadership positions at men&apos;s professional football clubs and at the regional, national and European level of football governance,&quot; the research concluded.

The seminar, chaired by William Gaillard, the advisor to the Uefa president, Michel Platini, and billed as the historic start of tackling the game&apos;s &quot;institutional discrimination,&quot; considered sobering research on the dominance of middle aged-to-elderly white men in running football. Led by Dr Steven Bradbury of Loughborough University, the research found an alarming contrast between the melting pots on the pitch, where 33% of professional players in European football countries are from overseas, and the &quot;under-representation&quot; of ethnic minority or women coaches, and the &quot;marked absence of minorities in leadership positions&quot;. Bradbury found that more than 99% of white collar staff at professional clubs and national football associations are white, and overwhelmingly men, apart from exceptions in Scandinavia. Appointments to senior positions were depicted as &quot;an old boys&apos; club,&quot; in which vacancies are rarely advertised, instead being filled on the nod by associates of the old boys already in charge. The culture is intensely discriminatory, the research found, with even great black players &quot;stereotyped&quot; as not being management material, and women regarded as knowing nothing about the game. There is, the report stated, &quot;overt and casual sexism;&quot; all knowledge in football is assumed to belong to &quot;the male expert&quot; and women&apos;s abilities are &quot;devalued and invalidated&quot;. Three days after the meeting, Keys and Gray proved those points rather spectacularly, insulting the Premier League assistant referee Sian Massey, in off-air comments caught on microphone, as &quot;fucking hopeless,&quot; because she is a woman. Bradbury found similarly prejudiced attitudes towards black people and ethnic minorities, despite the achievements over more than 30 years of players on the pitch. Owners of clubs still make &quot;racialised assessments&quot; based on &quot;physical and cultural stereotypes of black people&quot;, his report said, fearing that black coaches &quot;would not be accepted by the squad.&quot; It is, he found, &quot;commonplace&quot; at clubs and FAs to &quot;stereotype&quot; black and ethnic minority people as having &quot;physicality over intellect&quot; and not to consider them for senior executive roles. Bryan Roy, the former Holland and Nottingham Forest winger, now a forwards coach for Ajax youth teams, told the seminar that black footballers like him often lack the communication skills and confidence to establish careers after playing, and clubs, generally, do nothing to encourage them. Roy said he went into coaching because Michael van Praag, then Ajax chairman, now the Dutch FA&apos;s president, did. &quot;He spotted something in me I hadn&apos;t seen myself,&quot; said Roy. He argued that clubs have a duty to provide a broad education for the young players they take in. &quot;In coaching there is an old boys&apos; network, which is very difficult to change,&quot; Roy said. &quot;But football should help the next generation, to develop their skills and make the most of their abilities afterwards. When a player&apos;s time is up now, the club just gets rid of him.&quot; Van Praag, who attended the meeting, confessed at the start that: &quot;In 22 years of being involved in football, I have never thought about the fact that there are no women in senior positions.&quot; By the end, after four hours&apos; evidence and discussion of institutional discrimination, Van Praag said his eyes had been opened: &quot;I think everybody here is seeing this problem differently from where we started,&quot; he said. &quot;I have become aware that we are doing some things in a ridiculous way. I call on the presidents of Europe&apos;s football associations to stand up, and be aware that we can easily change this landscape.&quot; Senes Erzik, the Turkish Uefa vice-president, will present the seminar&apos;s findings to the European governing body&apos;s executive committee meeting in Nyon, Switzerland. Uefa is expected to officially recognise that the game is &quot;institutionally&quot; sexist and racist, and develop a strategy to change attitudes and widen the involvement of women and ethnic minorities. That will be a significant step, given that Uefa&apos;s executive committee is the very pinnacle itself of football&apos;s &quot;old boys&apos; club&quot;, made up of 16 middle-or pensioner-aged white men, and that Uefa has been serially accused of failing to take firm enough action against serious incidents of racism by fans at European matches. Erzik, 68, the chair of Uefa&apos;s fair play and social responsibility committee, stated at the meeting that Uefa must: &quot;Address a problem which has gone on for so long unnoticed. Our role is to bring people together to try to find some concrete solutions.&quot; Two other members of the executive committee were there, Van Praag and Allan Hansen, the Danish FA president, and the presidents of the Swiss, Hungarian and Norwegian FAs were also present. The initiative was begun by Lord Triesman, the former English FA chairman, who had been urged to break open the male white dominance of the game by former black players Garth Crooks and Paul Elliott, Lord Ouseley, the ex-chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, and Piara Powar, of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) anti-discrimination network, all of them active for years in the Kick It Out campaign against racism. However, with no successor to Triesman, since he was forced to resign last May, appointed until David Bernstein was approved by the FA Council (99 white men, one black man, Lord Ouseley, two women) today, the FA&apos;s momentum has stalled. The meeting was still billed as a joint initiative of Uefa and the English FA, but the FA was not represented by a board member, instead by Darren Bailey, the director of governance and regulation, and Sue Law, the head of equality and child protection. Law told the Guardian afterwards: &quot;Widening diversity is on our agenda&quot; through &quot;equality objectives&quot; and pointed to advisory groups on race and disability equality which report to the FA board, and one on tackling homophobia. &quot;We look forward to the follow up from the seminar, to Uefa&apos;s leadership and to continuing to work with our partners,&quot; she said. That, however, is not enough for Ouseley, who sharply criticised the FA&apos;s failure to send a board-level representative. He and Power are pushing the FA hard to introduce the two non-executive directors recommended almost six years ago by Lord Burns&apos; review, arguing it provides an opportunity to introduce a woman and an ethnic minority representative to the board. Support is growing within the FA for Elliott, who served on the 2018 World Cup bid board, although other candidates would also have to be considered. Elliott is understood already to have discussed the issue with Bernstein. &quot;I mean no criticism at all of Sue Law and Darren Bailey who I am sure are very competent,&quot; Ouseley said. &quot;However it is very disappointing that our FA did not send a board member and it suggests lip service is being paid. The comments of Gray and Keys show sexist attitudes lurking under the surface. Underlying racist prejudice, reinforced by ignorance, is still there. It is impressive that Uefa has taken the lead now, and our FA must give this issue, of widening diversity, the highest priority.&quot; Diversity in numbers 2  Black managers at English football&apos;s 92 professional clubs \u2013 Paul Ince, at Notts County and Chris Powell at Charlton Athletic 33% Of players in top level European professional football are immigrants to the country in which they are playing.

It also included construction of a legacy Centre for UK Athletics alongside the stadium, using the warm-up track with a permanent stand for spectators. The proposal was appropriate, sensible, sustainable and affordable, and it is outrageous that so much public money has been wasted by people who failed to implement this commonsense solution. The issue of maintaining the running track within the main stadium and therefore a primary use for athletics was, in my view, introduced as advice to ensure rowdy football supporters would never be let near the legacy stadium (Report, Sport, 24 January). Now the strategy has failed, let&apos;s abandon the ridiculous idea of keeping the running track and build a Centre for UK Athletics next door to the stadium.

Many of us said from day one that the legacy proposals for the stadium were deeply flawed and that, ultimately, taxpayers would be forced (we won&apos;t be asked) to give millions of pounds in assets and cash to West Ham. Coe and Co&apos;s &quot;moral obligation&quot; is to the British public. If they have any &quot;integrity&quot;, they should do one of two things: either they should admit that they got the economics completely wrong and transfer their support to the most economically viable option which will burden the taxpayer least \u2013 clearly Tottenham&apos;s proposal \u2013 or they should stick as closely as possible to the original plan, by campaigning for an alternative (and preferable) option, which would involve retaining the athletics stadium much as it is and allowing secondary football use by the local club, which is Leyton Orient, not West Ham. Of course, neither of these options will be chosen. The powers that be will seek to save face by paying over millions to the porn barons who own the Hammers. Therefore, after having got one prediction absolutely right, I&apos;ll make another. Once the British public is &quot;over a barrel&quot;, West Ham will renege on the (already pitiful) financial commitment that they have made and, in order to save face again, the taxpayer will have to pay out yet more.

A freedom of information request by the Guardian revealed that, since 2007, eight people have been issued with these orders and had their passports cancelled while out of the UK, the same number as currently are subject to control orders. Often they were visiting family members abroad in school holidays when the notices were served, followed within a day or two by a signed order and an exclusion order preventing them from returning to the UK. The use of deprivation of citizenship orders has increased: of the eight orders since 2007, five were served last year. Rights lawyers said that the recipients had suffered injustices, and that the orders were part of the &quot;post-9/11 industry&quot;: while allegations of terrorist links might be justified, recipients had difficulty defending themselves because they were banned from the UK without warning. The Immigration Law Practitioners&apos; Association has made a submission to the parliamentary joint committee on human rights, condemning the increased use of these orders. In at least one case, it said, an attempt to communicate with lawyers in the UK from where the individual was stranded put them at risk. Amanda Weston, a barrister dealing with some of the cases, said: &quot;You get to see very clearly the impact of injustice on the lives of those on the receiving end and their families. There is increasing use of secret evidence, and national security considerations are having an impact on procedural fairness. &quot;Control orders are issued to people the government can&apos;t remove from the UK.

With four days of the winter transfer window remaining the striker is aware that time is running out but he does not want to miss out on the opportunity to join Chelsea for a second time. He has urged the Fenway Sports Group to broker an agreement that is good for both player and club. There is not, however, a clause that will allow Torres to unilaterally break his contract in this transfer window. Chelsea made a bid for Torres during the summer but the striker was told that he would not be able to depart with the club undergoing a sales process. The price quoted for his transfer was so high as to be simply a symbolic &quot;not for sale&quot; sign. At the time, Torres sought assurances that he would be able to depart in the future, should an acceptable bid be made and he consider a move necessary. Those discussions were held with the then managing director Christian Purslow who has now left the club \u2013 and no written legal clause was signed. Torres also wanted assurances over the future of the club when Liverpool were taken over by the new owners. Torres&apos;s camp believes that promises have been broken. Liverpool are not the club that Torres joined and the striker is pessimistic over the future and his patience has worn thin with the absence of investment or activity since the takeover. Roy Hodgson&apos;s departure and the appointment of Kenny Dalglish was a step in the right direction but is not enough. Liverpool have only made one significant move in the transfer window, for the Uruguay striker Luis Su\u00e1rez. It is now a case of Liverpool convincing Torres not to go. The striker can see little real argument to continue at Anfield. Although there is no plan to force a move through and despite the recognition that Liverpool could block the move, Torres believes that an immediate departure is the best solution. Liverpool&apos;s decision to announce the bid could be interpreted as an attempt to flush Torres out and force him to push for an exit. If he were to join Chelsea, Torres would be eligible to play in the Champions League. He is hopeful of Liverpool recognising that his departure could be good for all concerned. Liverpool signed Torres for \u00a323m; they could make more than \u00a320m in profit if they were to sell now. Indeed, it is the money from a Torres deal that could unlock the funds necessary to make an improved bid to clinch Su\u00e1rez. Liverpool have reopened talks with Ajax over Su\u00e1rez this afternoon and, it is believed, made a breakthrough over a transfer fee for the Uruguay international. Ajax rejected a \u00a312.8m offer from Liverpool for their captain this week and had insisted on \u20ac30m (\u00a325.8m) for the deal to happen. Su\u00e1rez has told the coach, Frank De Boer, that he wishes to leave Amsterdam for Merseyside and, mindful that his value will drop if they fail to qualify for next season&apos;s Champions League, Ajax are now understood to be open to a compromise fee with Liverpool. Meanwhile, Chelsea&apos;s manager, Carlo Ancelotti, refused to be drawn on his club&apos;s bid for Fernando Torres but said he was happy that &quot;the club are trying to do everything they can to improve the squad&quot;. But Ancelotti added: &quot;I don&apos;t want to speak about this, you will have to ask the club. He is not my player and I have to have respect for Liverpool. I don&apos;t like to speak about this.&quot; Ancelotti had previously intimated that the club&apos;s protracted pursuit of the Benfica defender David Luiz would be their only major move of the January transfer window. Asked if the Torres bid had therefore caught him by surprise, he said: &quot;I&apos;m not surprised, because I know very well what the club is doing now. I am happy because the club is doing a fantastic job in this transfer market.

Looking for the future? You have until Saturday to see rising young company Curious Directive in the flawed but promising Return to the Silence at the Pleasance, and on Monday, Gary McNair will explain how you can be liberated from the tyranny of money forever in Crunch at the Arches in Glasgow. There&apos;s plenty of new writing around at the moment. Nina Raine&apos;s Tiger Country  at Hampstead should be on your list, and the Off-Broadway dating comedy, Becky Shaw, is pulling in audiences at the Almeida. I&apos;m particularly looking forward to Andrew Sheridan&apos;s Winterlong at the Royal Exchange, which comes with playwright Simon Stephens&apos;s stamp of approval. Bruce Norris&apos;s sharp-elbowed satire Clybourne Park is at Wyndhams from tonight after a sell-out run at the Royal Court. Greenland, opening in the National Theatre&apos;s Lyttelton on Tuesday, is a drama documentary about uncertainty written by Jack Thorne, Penelope Skinner, Moira Buffini and Matt Charman. Alan Pollock&apos;s Too Much Pressure at the Belgrade in Coventry is about the decline of the city&apos;s car industry and the changes at the end of the 70s. Exeter&apos;s Bike Shed Theatre is premiering a new thriller, Cul de Sac. Neil LaBute&apos;s 2001 play, The Shape of Things, focusing on art and identity, is being performed in the Soho art gallery. Lucinda Coxon&apos;s NT hit, Happy Now?, is revived by the excellent Matthew Lloyd at Hull Truck. There&apos;s some good classic work around too. John Dove&apos;s A View from the Bridge  is worth seeing at the Lyceum in Edinburgh, and Peter Arnott&apos;s play of 19th-century pestilence, The Breathing House, is revived at the Tron in Glasgow. Rattigan&apos;s Less Than Kind has been admired at the Jermyn Street theatre. You can see Romeo and Juliet directed by David Thacker at the Bolton Octagon, and Pilot&apos;s racy version arrives at the Unicorn. Simon Godwin did an amazing job with Caryl Churchill&apos;s Far Away at Bristol Old Vic and now he tackles Brian Friel&apos;s modern masterpiece, Faith Healer. Somerset Maugham&apos;s The Constant Wife is revived at Salisbury Playhouse  by Philip Wilson, a director with a knack for mining beneath the surface. Headlong&apos;s A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream, directed by Natalie Abrahami, begins its tour at the Nuffield in Southampton, while along the coast at Chichester there&apos;s a touring version of Goodnight Mister Tom.

A mix of live performance, animation and film from around the world, the linchpin of the festival is a week-long masterclass by Compagnie Philippe Genty. Other highlights include Jerk, which uses glove puppets to relate the crimes committed by US serial killer Dean Corll during the 1970s, and Scottish company Tortoise In A Nutshell, whose The Last Miner explores the inner life of a man who has stayed underground long after his workmates have been hoisted to the surface for the last time.

Gecko is not long back from China with its two-year-old piece, The Overcoat, but the show developed even while it was there. Now they&apos;re working on a new piece, Missing, which examines the absences in our lives through the stories of a missing child, a scientist investigating the human soul and a woman who thinks that her soul is decaying. This work-in-progress plays in tandem with another new piece, Once Upon A Something, from emerging company Trace Theatre. A mix of dance, theatre and storytelling, the show considers the nature of the ego in performance and how far those on stage will go for their moment in the limelight.

Dr Diane Cassell, played by Juliet Stevenson \u2013 who won an Olivier award for Death And The Maiden at the Court 20 years ago \u2013 is a leading academic in earth sciences who finds herself at odds with the prevailing thought about humanity&apos;s effect on the planet&apos;s weather, and is mocked for her beliefs.

Hamish Glen&apos;s early stint at the Belgrade tried to bring European classics to a city that became a symbol of postwar regeneration. But the strand of programming that has proven most successful with audiences is that which looks at the city of Coventry itself. Alan Pollock, who was raised in Coventry and wrote the successful One Night In November about the Coventry blitz, now turns his attention to 1979, the year of the winter of discontent. The Austin family live on the Canley Park estate and dad Cliff and his eldest son, Terry, are both track workers at the Standard Triumph factory. But the world is changing and younger son Gary is forming a band, just as tensions within the family and city reach boiling point. Local group the Ripps provide a live soundtrack.

He is president of the European Association of Social Psychology  and has published more than 100 scholarly articles on conflict resolution in organisations, group decision-making and creativity and innovation. More recently, he has been exploring the role of the &quot;love&quot; hormone oxytocin in group dynamics and inter-group competition. His latest experiments, the results of which have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicate a potentially more negative side. Tell me about oxytocin. It is a neurotransmitter and hormone produced in the hypothalamus known for its strong bonding function. It makes people more co-operative, benevolent, loyal, generous and trusting of others. It is involved in the parent-child bond \u2013 new mothers and fathers have raised levels of oxytocin. Production also increases when people hug and when they have sex and, recent research suggests, when they receive psychological warmth. It is easy to see an evolutionary role in keeping couples and families together, but what about in groups?  Darwin talked about this \u2013 primitive societies in which members were co-operative and had a high level of altruism towards one another were more likely to survive. So the idea is, at the biological level, systems that facilitate and sustain group co-operation, such as oxytocin, are more likely to survive. What sparked your interest in oxytocin? I was reviewing the literature on human co-operation and saw studies showing that oxytocin makes people more generous and trusting. I started to wonder what co-operation means in the context of inter-group competition. Would co-operation, stimulated by oxytocin, be limited to your &quot;in-group&quot;? What did you find? We took groups of three and they had to play an economic game, competing with another group. They had money that they could a) keep for their personal benefit; b) invest in their in-group to their mutual benefit; or c) use to hurt the out-group. People given oxytocin increased their contributions to the in-group but there was no difference to their treatment of the out-group. The effect of oxytocin was limited to benefiting the in-group members. Nepotism? Exactly. And your latest studies? We asked whether oxytocin works on a more basic level, in influencing our views on people in the in-group and out-group. In one test, we got men of Dutch origin to judge people with typical Dutch, Arab and German names; in the Netherlands, a lot of immigrants and Germans are perceived as out-groups. We know that people tend to judge people from their in-group more positively than people from out-groups. In all five experiments, when we gave people oxytocin compared to a placebo, we found that people became much more positive about their in-group. In four experiments, the oxytocin had no effect on their evaluation of the out-group. In one, the people who had taken oxytocin became more negative about the out\u2011group also. So this is the dark side of oxytocin?  When you give preferential treatment to your in-group as ethnocentrism, you implicitly indirectly discriminate against people who do not belong to your in-group. And they feel that, they feel resentment, they may protest, so indirectly, it could be that oxytocin contributes to inter-group tensions. Could your work could have a practical application in addressing discrimination? One of the longer-term practical implications is that we may be able to rethink where ethnocentrism comes from and what is causing it. Some scientists and societies think ethnocentrism is educative and [a result of] how the press writes about people. Our research shows that while that is partly true, there are these tendencies inherent within ourselves. How adaptable is our idea of our in-group?  It is definitely possible to shift the boundaries. What oxytocin does is that once you see people as [belonging to your] in-group, you come to like them even more. Oxytocin doesn&apos;t make you a racist; it makes you like and commit to your in-group. So you wouldn&apos;t see raised levels of oxytocin among racists? No. It may contribute to ethnocentric attitudes but that doesn&apos;t mean that people who display ethnocentrism are driven by oxytocin. In the total absence of oxytocin you can still be ethnocentric. What&apos;s next? There are open questions still. In our studies, we sometimes found \u2013 but more often didn&apos;t find \u2013 that oxytocin creates an increased dislike of out-groups. So one question we are still working on is: are there specific features of an out-group that drive the effect of oxytocin towards disliking them? In the first set of experiments, we found that when people perceived the out-group as a threat to the in-group they became more competitive under oxytocin. Or is it that these findings were the result of coincidence and there is no effect? It is fine-tuning, but it is important. We can see that it increases the love for your in-group but we are unclear whether it increases the hate for out-groups. If people are going to talk about the dark side of oxytocin, it is important as scientists that we can say: &quot;We have looked at these findings and we have conclusions.&quot;", "sentences": ["Carsten de Dreu, 44, a professor of psychology at the University of Amsterdam, describes himself as a social psychologist with an interest in evolutionary theory."], "title": "My Bright Idea: Does the 'love hormone' foster racism?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/30/bright-ideas-oxytocin-hormone-racism", "tags": ["Neuroscience", "Science", "Race issues"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-01-30T00:04:13Z", "article": "One thousand hateful online messages have been received by a man who made rude remarks on Come Dine With Me. The owners of the Christian guesthouse who were fined for turning away a gay couple are being tormented by a campaign of abusive anonymous phone calls. This is absolutely appalling and disgraceful. Why does nobody use the post any more? Facebook threats, abusive calls: I miss the old-fashioned hate mail of yesteryear. I haven&apos;t seen green ink for ages. I remember an article I wrote, years ago, when a Dutch beer company threatened to withdraw its sponsorship from a late-night Channel 4 series because there were too many black people in the studio audience. I pointed out that it was a bit odd to sponsor a young people&apos;s music show if they were keen to attract racist drinkers. Perhaps, I mused, they ought to look for a different sort of programme. A week or two later, a large envelope arrived containing a photograph of an African tribal couple: the gentleman in robes, the lady topless and beaded. My anonymous correspondent had cut out my byline photo and glued it over the woman&apos;s head, then written in large capitals: &quot;THIS IS YOU WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.&quot; I stuck that one on the fridge. Nothing touches the heart like a homemade gift. There are no such keepsakes in the internet age. You can&apos;t stick an online forum on the fridge. The tragedy is, modern poison-pen campaigns simply lack charm. Nevertheless, we must find a way to love them. Why? Because they&apos;re there. Finding the charm may begin by noting that the hostile couple from the &quot;Christian&quot; guesthouse and the mouthy chap from Come Dine With Me (who told one amateur chef that her dinner looked &quot;like a sick bag&quot;) made observers angry with their rudeness. So angry that they insisted on writing rude Facebook messages and making rude phone calls. You may say that the guesthouse owners were bigoted rather than rude, but I&apos;m not sure it counts as proper homophobia if it&apos;s a &quot;religious principle&quot;, however misguided. They are evidently contrary people. If you&apos;re picky about strangers coming into your home, you can always not run a guesthouse. Not running a guesthouse is definitely one of the career options at school. Most observers feel that it&apos;s just rude and mean to turn guests away, whatever you think of them. I once stayed the night at a gay men&apos;s hotel in Amsterdam (it&apos;s a long story) and, unwanted as I must surely have been, they were all terribly polite and kind. It was a great place. The bedroom was extremely comfortable, once I had unhooked the sling from the ceiling. And my God, the place was clean. You could eat your dinner off that kitchen floor. In fact, as I remember, a friendly submissive was doing so. Let&apos;s be glad that people are still horrified by rudeness, from hosts or guests. I worried that Come Dine With Me (its voiceover, never mind its contestants) would persuade the nation that it&apos;s acceptable to insult someone&apos;s cooking, appearance or intelligence when they&apos;re making an effort in their own home. Clearly, we remain unpersuaded. These people sending abusive, obscene, anonymous messages are simply demonstrating that they will not tolerate impoliteness in any form. Perhaps there is a new movement of fundamentalist courtesy: people so keen to place good manners back at the heart of society that it&apos;s driven them to the worst manners possible. Or perhaps they believe that rudeness is fine, as long as it&apos;s anonymous. &quot;This is how it works in Britain,&quot; they are saying. &quot;You don&apos;t insult a person to his face. You don&apos;t turn people away on your doorstep. You say, &apos;How very nice to meet you&apos;, then post a dog turd through their letter box in the night.&quot; That&apos;s what the anonymous phone call, the online forum abuse or the old-school poison pen letter is: a dog turd in the night. Unpleasant, cowardly and a bit mad \u2013 but they probably don&apos;t mean it. As I&apos;m sure the Christians from the guesthouse would appreciate, it&apos;s important to love the villain. Picture the writer there, frustrated and timid in his daily life. He daren&apos;t speak up. He fears confrontation. He&apos;s bullied at work. He swallows the nasty restaurant meal without a word. He lets the minicab driver take him the long way round and miserably pays the extra fare. His silent rage builds into deep resentment at the whole world. Late at night, safely hidden behind the green pen, the false screen name or the 141, he releases everything he daren&apos;t in daylight. Bless him, he feels better afterwards. For about an hour. I learned an important lesson once, after I went on Question Time and spoke in favour of immigration. I received a really vicious letter afterwards. It was foully racist, raving in favour of the BNP, shrieking at me, full of allegations about my personal bloodline and &quot;right to be here&quot;. Instead of getting angry and binning it, I decided to write politely back. The letter would be friendly and grateful, treating the man&apos;s opinions with respect. &quot;That&apos;ll fox him,&quot; I thought. And so I did. With love and care, I spent two hours writing a three-page letter explaining my own position, talking about my family, challenging the figures, questioning his ideas with the gentlest touch. &quot;Perhaps I will change one person&apos;s mind today,&quot; I thought proudly as I walked to the pillar box.

The Los Angeles Philharmonic, fiddling and blowing full out as they warmed up for the first of two London concerts, part of a European tour, communicated exuberance, optimism and a discernible but unshowy Hollywood sheen. This is a big orchestra with, after some thin years in the 1990s, a freshly restored, sumptuous New World sound. Already the mood was high. &quot;Let&apos;s get the measure of this hall,&quot; they seemed to imply. &quot;You&apos;re going to see a lot of us.&quot; So we will: the Los Angeles Philharmonic and music director cum magician-maestro, Gustavo Dudamel, have just signed to become one of the Barbican&apos;s international associates, a partnership with five world-class orchestras including Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw and Leipzig&apos;s Gewandhaus. On the scorching evidence of Thursday&apos;s concert of John Adams, Bernstein and Beethoven, this LA deal is an exciting prospect, with the bonus that Dudamel, whose work with El Sistema and the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Youth Orchestra is already the stuff of legend, will spend time coaching young players here too. The orchestra has performed this programme several times, in LA&apos;s Walt Disney concert hall, with live relays to 450 cinemas in the States and Canada, as well as in Lisbon. It&apos;s hardly surprising they delivered it with such aplomb and, in the best sense, swagger. Adams&apos;s high-energy, rhythmically intricate Slonimsky&apos;s Earbox (1995) owes much to Terry Riley&apos;s pivotal In C, as well as to Bernstein. The chance to hear his Symphony No 1 &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (1942) alongside Adams made for satisfying listening, with the mellow but occasionally frail-toned mezzo Kelley O&apos;Connor as soloist. In the work&apos;s compelling opening movement, &quot;Prophecy&quot;, the propulsive, lurching low brass and searing broad string theme pushed forward with the force of a digger churning up the world to expose its molten core. The second half contained Beethoven&apos;s seventh symphony, obligingly in the Oscars spotlight since the &quot;Allegretto&quot; features on the soundtrack to The King&apos;s Speech. Here Dudamel showed a new maturity \u2013 he did, after all, reach the grand age of 30 this week \u2013 and avoided any excessive conductorly intervention. Tempi were brisk, which proved a breathtaking challenge for the orchestra&apos;s large forces: they rose to it with unanimous adrenalin and finesse. Above all, musicians and Dudamel alike allowed Beethoven&apos;s genius to speak for itself, with ferocious vitality. It sounds easy, but that is the hardest task of all. This concert will be broadcast on Classic FM on 16 February. The Adams and Bernstein, recorded live in LA, are already available via iTunes. A small revolution shook the opera world this week, low-key and apparently local but likely to have a lasting impact. London&apos;s Little Opera House at the King&apos;s Head, Islington, north London, has announced the first ever fringe opera rep season, with performances by OperaUpClose of its celebrated La boh\u00e8me, together with Cinderella, Madam Butterfly, The Barber of Seville and a new staging of Leoncavallo&apos;s Pagliacci. Future plans include Monteverdi&apos;s Il ritorno d&apos;Ulisse, Mark Ravenhill&apos;s first foray into directing opera. Currently resident at the King&apos;s Head under the entrepreneurial artistic directorship of Adam Spreadbury-Maher, the company is a tiny nomadic outfit, camping between the Soho theatre, the Cock Tavern or wherever there&apos;s cheap, available space, with ambitions to venture south of the river, and even into the wilds beyond the M25. New programmes will be announced every two months. Performances are in English and treble-cast with professional singers. Madam Butterfly has been updated to Bangkok Butterfly to chilling effect. The rewritten libretto removes the story to a sleazy, high-rise penthouse where underage girls are on sale and the electrics are dodgy. Pinkerton (Randy Nichol) the yank pilot says &quot;awesome&quot; and Butterfly (Margaret Cooper) kills herself by putting a gun to her mouth. It fits the original without distortion. If not all the voices sound beautiful in such startlingly raw proximity \u2013 just a few metres away from anyone in the audience \u2013 they are none the less strong, full of promise and musically intelligent. Danyal Dhondy&apos;s chamber-scale rescoring, for clarinet, viola and piano, is inspired. OperaUpClose&apos;s mission is to appeal to novices or experts, and to &quot;bring opera to audiences who ordinarily might avoid it&quot;. Having read this week that the &quot;opera singer&quot; Gio Compario of the price-comparison website TV ads has signed a mega deal with Warner Music with his first CD out in March, all I can say is: Go Compare.

The reason we can now examine Bruegel&apos;s painting in such astonishing detail \u2013 every tiny scene, every brushstroke, every hairline crack can be seen \u2013 is because it has been captured using super-high resolution, or gigapixel photo-capturing technology. The project, unveiled at Tate Britain in London is an extension of Google Street View in which real views of streets from across the world are captured and displayed on screen. With the Google Art Project, anyone with access to a computer can take a virtual 360 degree tour of galleries in 17 major museums across the world, without queuing and without other people getting in the way \u2013 and look in superb detail at one work from each. The museums include the National Gallery and Tate Britain in London; the Met, MoMa and Frick in New York; the Uffizi in Florence, the Hermitage in St Petersburg, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and Reina Sofia in Madrid. They have all signed up to the unique project developed over the past 18 months, which allows unprecedented access to 385 rooms and about 1,000 artworks. Serota called the project &quot;another great step forward. It gives people an unrivalled opportunity to come really close to great works of art.&quot; The galleries are already digitising their collections and offering whizzy websites, but Google&apos;s project offers something new, Serota said. &quot;This is a second generation view of the way museums will use the internet. Ten years ago museums were obsessed with getting thousands of objects on the screen, now we&apos;re interested in getting depth of understanding of the works.&quot; Nelson Mattos, Google&apos;s vice-president for engineering, said the Google Art Project had started off as one of the company&apos;s &quot;20% projects&quot; which allows employees to take a fifth of their time away from their regular day job, to work on innovations. &quot;What has been accomplished is fantastic, really amazing. We hope it will provide a very different and new way to interact with and explore art,&quot; Serota added. Other tricks on the website, include the ability to save artworks such as Rembrandt&apos;s Night Watch or Van Gogh&apos;s The Starry Night, then create your own collection and email it to friends. Among the 17 paintings captured using technology that is 1,000 times more powerful than an average digital camera, are Manet&apos;s In the Conservatory, Bellini&apos;s St Francis in the Desert and Holbein&apos;s The Ambassadors, from the National Gallery. Tate Britain&apos;s choice \u2013 Chris Ofili&apos;s No Woman, No Cry \u2013 is the only one by a living artist. One reason for its inclusion is the large, hidden ultraviolet message the website reveals (RIP Stephen Lawrence), which can only be seen in the dark. Google and the museums believe the website will prove popular, as well as provide encouragement and inspiration for people to travel to the galleries and see the paintings up close in person. The plan is to keep expanding the project, paid for by Google, with new museums, galleries and paintings. At the launch at Tate Britain the absence of institutions such as the Louvre and the Prado were noted. But project leader Amit Sood, said Google wanted to get the scheme up and running, so included the 17 museums who signed up straight away. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 February 2011. The original stated that the throwing of sticks at a tied up goose was a Shrove Tuesday game. First, the painting is of a harvest scene in August or September, not February or March.

Although the Chinese new year is traditionally a time for families to gather at home, a burgeoning middle class has the money and inclination to travel. Increasingly, the wealthy are using the holiday to get away, and Chinese tourist numbers are set to double by 2014. In London, Chinese tourists make a beeline for the high-end shops. Wang Yanming, a Beijing publisher, is typical of the affluent visitors arriving in the UK. &quot;I have always wanted to go to the UK. It is a beautiful country with a long history,&quot; said the 32-year-old. &quot;I did a lot of shopping, because it was so much cheaper. In outlets and factory shops, the prices for brands like Burberry, Mulberry, Vivienne Westwood and Ben Sherman were incredibly low. For some of them the price was not even half of that in China.&quot; In all, she spent about 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,816) on bags, clothing, shoes, souvenirs and chocolates \u2013 and another 15,000 yuan on designer handbags that three colleagues asked her to buy for them. The pound has lost about a third of its value against the renminbi in the past three years, adding to Britain&apos;s attractiveness as a holiday destination. &quot;Stores such as Burberry and Selfridges now have Chinese speaking staff assistants to cater to the huge number of Chinese customers,&quot; said Jonathan De Mello, a retail analyst at the CB Richard Ellis consultancy. &quot;Chinese workers take their holidays at the same time. They come here on tour groups, everything is done for them. They are taken to shops in the West End where they feel obliged to buy something. It&apos;s very lucrative for both sides. They are the new Japanese.&quot; De Mello said shoppers from mainland China and Hong Kong account for about 30% of the luxury goods market in Britain, followed by Russians, Arabs and Japanese, with British shoppers making up only about 15% of the purchases. One reason why luxury goods in the UK are popular with Chinese shoppers is price. Prices of luxury goods can be up to 30% higher in China because of import high tariffs and taxes. Well-known brands and local products such as Burberry, Clarks shoes and Scottish whisky are favoured particularly as they are less likely to be fake here. According to figures from the New West End Company, which represents retailers in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street, the Chinese were the highest-spending nationality last year, parting with \u00a33m on fashion, cosmetics and confectionery. Britain is expecting a growing influx of Chinese tourists in the next few years. VisitBritain says trips to the UK are forecast to more than double by 2014, growing by 117% relative to 2008, with almost 130,000 additional visits (representing a 0.8% market share for the UK). This would make the UK the 14th most visited destination from China in 2014. It is easy to overstate the importance of tourists from China: in 2009 only 89,000 mainland visitors arrived in the UK, compared with 2.9 million US tourists. But Chinese numbers are climbing, while US arrivals are in decline. And the Chinese spent an average of \u00a31,310, while their US counterparts spent \u00a3753. Luxury brands have done particularly well. Harrods recently reported that half of the crowds at the first day of its Christmas sale were Chinese. Travel companies say the UK should be well-placed to benefit further from China&apos;s growing prosperity. &quot;Top attractions include its unique scenery and culture, shopping, football, visiting children who are studying in the UK \u2013 and Harry Potter,&quot; said a spokesperson for Titicaca, a Chinese travel company specialising in trips to the UK. Yet some Chinese are deterred from coming to Britain because a separate visa is required. Architect Yu Xiaoliang, 37 from Hangzhou is preparing to visit Amsterdam for work and will take the opportunity to visit other European countries. &quot;I didn&apos;t think about going to the UK because you need to apply for a separate visa, which is both expensive and troublesome,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["Architect Yu Xiaoliang, 37 from Hangzhou is preparing to visit Amsterdam for work and will take the opportunity to visit other European countries."], "title": "Chinese tourists to embark on luxury shopping spree to celebrate new year", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/03/chinese-new-year-luxury-shopping-london", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Shopping trips", "London", "Consumer affairs", "Asia Pacific", "Chinese new year"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-04T15:10:00Z", "article": "Friday     Miffy cot toy    Miffy cot toy, \u00a320.41, from heroesforkids.co.uk Buy of the Day has just returned from Amsterdam.

That oft-repeated commercial offered some instructive insights into the character of Liverpool&apos;s new \u00a322.8m attacking acquisition from Ajax. While primarily demonstrating Su\u00e1rez&apos;s capacity to laugh at himself \u2013 his hallmark pointy ears are a big reason why he was hired for the job \u2013 it also highlighted the striker&apos;s often vexed relationship with authority. The Uruguayan was filmed wandering into an Amsterdam branch of Beter Horen and seeking advice about purchasing an &quot;anti-whistle arranger&quot;. Su\u00e1rez then articulated the hope that a product designed to eliminate irritating background aural interference would block out the &quot;very annoying&quot; sounds of referees&apos; whistles ringing in his ears. Motioned to the side of the store and asked to &quot;sit on the bench&quot; while an alternative prescription for earplugs was dispatched, he reacted in mock horror, stating: &quot;Su\u00e1rez is never a substitute.&quot; As both a great goalscorer and a scorer of great goals he is, indeed, rarely benched but some well-documented differences with match officials do tend, periodically, to sideline him from the action. At the time Beter Horen made that advert he was well known as an exponent of dodgy penalty-area dives. Last summer Su\u00e1rez embellished his crime sheet with the most outrageous handball seen at a World Cup since Diego Maradona&apos;s Hand of God intervention against Bobby Robson&apos;s England. It denied Ghana a place in the semi-finals, when the penalty awarded as a result was not converted. In November his hitherto glorious Ajax career ground to an ignominious halt thanks to a seven-game suspension imposed for biting PSV Eindhoven&apos;s Otman Bakkal on the shoulder. The incident, in stoppage time at the end of a league game, was retaliation for Bakkal standing on his foot. Apparently mortified, the culprit filmed a seemingly heartfelt if arguably over-acted apology and, confirming he was very much a man of his time, uploaded it to his Facebook page. &quot;Normally I&apos;m calm,&quot; Su\u00e1rez said. &quot;But I was a little tired, I&apos;d done a lot of travelling.&quot; By last Wednesday night social networking outlets from Merseyside to Montevideo were buzzing with the news that, despite lacking time to train with his new Liverpool team-mates, El\u00a0Pistolero had scored a debut goal 10 minutes after being introduced as a substitute against Stoke City. Today Su\u00e1rez is likely to start at Stamford Bridge where he will be closely compared with the man he was initially supposed to partner rather than replace in Kenny Dalglish&apos;s side. With Fernando Torres expected to make his Chelsea bow, the afternoon promises to be painted as a shoot-out between El Ni\u00f1o and El Pistolero. A creator as much as a scorer, Su\u00e1rez is, in reality, a very different player from Torres. Dalglish has surely bought him not to lead Liverpool&apos;s attacking line but either to play off his fellow newcomer, the currently injured \u00a335m Andy Carroll, as an often deep-lying secondary striker or to serve as a wide forward in a 4-3-3 formation. When, in 1999, a deceptively angelic-looking Carroll began starring for Low Fell Under-11s in Gateshead, Su\u00e1rez \u2013 two years the English boy&apos;s senior \u2013 had already left home for Montevideo and a place in the &quot;nursery&quot; of the leading club Nacional. Born in Salto, a city close to the border with Argentina and famed for its thermal baths, Su\u00e1rez is the fourth of seven sons \u2013 (his elder brother Paulo is also a professional footballer, playing in El Salvador) \u2013 brought up by a single mother. When he was four, people started noticing that he ran fastest with a ball at his feet. By 11 Nacional&apos;s scouts had arranged for him to be transferred to the care of Montevideo\u2011based grandparents while joining their junior academy. If his talent always seemed likely to transport him one day to Europe, love accelerated the process. As a young teenager in Uruguay&apos;s capital Su\u00e1rez had fallen for a girl called Sofia. Their romance was destined to feature a wedding which dominated the glossy front page of Caras \u2013 (South America&apos;s answer to Hello!) \u2013 but temporarily seemed doomed when her family relocated to Barcelona. Desperate not to lose Sofia, the by now 19-year-old striker engineered himself an \u20ac800,000 move to Groningen. While Dutch football&apos;s purist soul undeniably appealed, the Netherlands&apos; situation, a short-haul hop from Spain, was even more attractive. &quot;I had the girl of my dreams back,&quot; says the 24-year-old. &quot;But in career terms I always had it clear in my mind that this was the big chance of my life. At the beginning it was not easy, I could not speak Dutch or English and communication was incredibly hard but I knew I could not give up.&quot; Ten goals in 29 appearances for Groningen were sufficient to prompt a \u20ac7.5m switch to Ajax, where he began a metamorphosis from capriciously gifted hothead to Dutch football&apos;s 2010 player of the year. Along the way he joined Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp in scoring more than 100 times for Ajax in all competitions. Although slightly stronger on his right side, Su\u00e1rez is essentially two\u2011footed. Allied to both an adhesive first touch and a vision and awareness that makes it hard to credit he is not wearing wing mirrors, such dexterity makes life immensely tough for defenders. Throw in superb mobility, rapid change of pace and Carlos Tevez-esque determination and it is easy to appreciate how Su\u00e1rez registered 35 goals in 33 Eredivisie appearances last season. &quot;Luis is going to bring Liverpool alive because he is a street fighter,&quot; says Rik van den Boog, Ajax&apos;s managing director, who was not surprised by Martin Jol&apos;s decision to make the Uruguayan captain. &quot;Luis was not a big player when he arrived here but he soon stood up in the dressing room and became a leader.&quot; Sometimes controversial, his captaincy style combined admirable personal discipline \u2013 Su\u00e1rez unfailingly returned to training the day after flying back from international duties performed half a world away \u2013 with a heart-on-the-sleeve passion sometimes unpalatable to referees and managers. Back in the days when Su\u00e1rez routinely attracted blizzards of yellow cards, Van Basten managed Ajax. Their relationship, often emotionally charged, frequently proved tense but the former Holland striker still cannot hide his admiration. &quot;Luis is unpredictable, he&apos;s hard to influence but that makes him special,&quot; Van Basten says. Happily the chemistry with the now similarly departed Jol was considerably healthier. &quot;Martin made me a better player,&quot; Su\u00e1rez says. &quot;He made me feel important.&quot; Aware that his star striker&apos;s still beloved Sofia struggled to settle in Amsterdam and returned to live in Barcelona before giving birth to a baby daughter, Delfina, last August, Jol was, importantly, always available to place a reassuring arm round his shoulder. Dalglish, realising that behind the swashbuckling facade the Uruguayan needs to be needed and nurtured, made sure his first words to Su\u00e1rez were &quot;Hola ... Bienvenido&quot; (hello and welcome). &quot;Those basics impressed me,&quot; he says. &quot;Now I do not want to disappoint Kenny Dalglish in any way.&quot; The eyes of a betrayed African nation bore into him in South Africa last summer.

Working with 17 of the world&apos;s leading galleries and museums \u2013 from MoMA in New York to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg to London&apos;s National Gallery and Tate \u2013 the project takes the corporation&apos;s street-view technology behind closed doors. It allows you not only to wander, at the touch of a mouse, the corridors and halls that contain many of the greatest masterpieces ever made, but also to view some of those paintings in finer detail than if you were standing in front of them. The sharp focus is made possible by 14bn pixel photography that brings the most delicate brush strokes into microscopic relief. So far, this headline-grabbing technology is restricted to one painting per gallery \u2013 Holbein&apos;s The Ambassadors is the National&apos;s mesmerising example, Van Gogh&apos;s Starry Night is MoMA&apos;s \u2013 but it seems inevitable that it will eventually illuminate far more of the collections. The almost magical potential resource raises many questions, not the least of which is whether viewing online will ever be a substitute for the real thing. (Along with the not-insignificant supplementaries: if it is, what effect will this have on gallery attendance and on our idea of art?) After spending a few hours on the site (yet another new way of digressing on a screen), the answer to the first part feels like a qualified no. Looking at a painting on screen, however vivid the detail, is wholly different in kind from standing in front of it. Though there is genuine wonder in the backlit clarity of the images \u2013 in Bellini&apos;s St Francis in the Desert from the Frick Collection in New York, for example, you can make out the artist&apos;s fingerprints in the surface of the paint \u2013 as with any reproduction, what is lost is a sense of the painting as a physical object, as a little framed force field. Mostly absent too, therefore, is that uncanny sense of communion that great paintings sometimes provide, the feeling that you are in the human presence of something that can talk to you directly across time and space; one element of that latter feeling undoubtedly derives from the sense of effort that brought you in front of the painting in the first place (the closest many of us get to pilgrimage). You look at the on-screen pictures, as a result, with a somewhat more academic than emotional eye. It&apos;s not a reductive experience (how could this extraordinary level of free access to some of the world&apos;s most enduring images ever be that?), but neither is it the same thing, quite. Despite this reservation, Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, was probably right when he claimed the Google project as &quot;the first global art collection&quot; and one which gives us the clearest sense yet of &quot;the digital future for museums&quot;. There was also, from Serota, inevitable talk of the website bringing &quot;communities of like-minded visitors together to connect in ways that aren&apos;t always possible in the gallery&quot;, which I suppose means that visitors to the site will be able to share responses to particular paintings in a way they might feel reluctant to do while standing next to a stranger in front of a Botticelli. The gallery directors involved in the project are of course confident that the online versions of their collections will extend curiosity rather than satisfying it; that the art project will act as an advertisement for those who can get to the galleries. One can only assume that the museums not involved \u2013 the Louvre in Paris and the Prado in Madrid, for example \u2013 are less sure of that equation.

So, unlike many thinkers of his time, he was unconstrained by allegiance to a church, university or royal court. He was free to be faithful to the pursuit of truth. This gives his philosophy a remarkable originality and intellectual purity \u2013 and it also led to controversy and charges of heresy. In the 19th century, and perhaps even more recently, &quot;Spinozist&quot; was still a term of abuse among intellectuals. In a sense, Spinoza was always an outsider \u2013 and this independence is precisely what enabled him to see through the confusions, prejudices and superstitions that prevailed in the 17th century, and to gain a fresh and radical perspective on various philosophical and religious issues. He was born, in 1632, to Jewish Portuguese parents who had fled to Amsterdam to escape persecution, so from the very beginning he was never quite a native, never completely at home. Although Spinoza was an excellent student in the Jewish schools he attended, he came to be regarded by the leaders of his community as a dangerous influence. At the age of 24 he was excluded from the Amsterdam synagogue for his &quot;intolerable&quot; views and practices. Spinoza&apos;s most famous and provocative idea is that God is not the creator of the world, but that the world is part of God. This is often identified as pantheism, the doctrine that God and the world are the same thing \u2013 which conflicts with both Jewish and Christian teachings. Pantheism can be traced back to ancient Greek thought: it was probably advocated by some pre-Socratic philosophers, as well as by the Stoics. But although Spinoza \u2013 who admired many aspects of Stoicism \u2013 is regarded as the chief source of modern pantheism, he does, in fact, want to maintain the distinction between God and the world. His originality lies in the nature of this distinction. God and the world are not two different entities, he argues, but two different aspects of a single reality. Over the next few weeks we will examine this view in more detail and consider its implications for human life. Since Spinoza presents a radical alternative to the Cartesian philosophy that has shaped our intellectual and cultural heritage, exploring his ideas may lead us to question some of our deepest assumptions. One of the most important and distinctive features of Spinoza&apos;s philosophy is that it is practical through and through. His ideas are never merely intellectual constructions, but lead directly to a certain way of life. This is evidenced by the fact that his greatest work, which combines metaphysics, theology, epistemology, and human psychology, is called Ethics. In this book, Spinoza argues that the way to &quot;blessedness&quot; or &quot;salvation&quot; for each person involves an expansion of the mind towards an intuitive understanding of God, of the whole of nature and its laws. In other words, philosophy for Spinoza is like a spiritual practice, whose goal is happiness and liberation. The ethical orientation of Spinoza&apos;s thought is also reflected in his own nature and conduct. Unlike most of the great philosophers, Spinoza has a reputation for living an exemplary, almost saintly life, characterised by modesty, gentleness, integrity, intellectual courage, disregard for wealth and a lack of worldly ambition. According to Bertrand Russell, Spinoza was &quot;the noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers&quot;. Although his ideas were despised by many of his contemporaries, he attracted a number of devoted followers who gathered regularly at his home in Amsterdam to discuss his philosophy. These friends made sure that Spinoza&apos;s Ethics was published soon after his death in 1677.", "sentences": ["He was born, in 1632, to Jewish Portuguese parents who had fled to Amsterdam to escape persecution, so from the very beginning he was never quite a native, never completely at home.", "At the age of 24 he was excluded from the Amsterdam synagogue for his &quot;intolerable&quot; views and practices.", "Although his ideas were despised by many of his contemporaries, he attracted a number of devoted followers who gathered regularly at his home in Amsterdam to discuss his philosophy."], "title": "Spinoza, part 1: Philosophy as a way of life | Clare Carlisle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/feb/07/spinoza-philosophy-god-world", "tags": ["Ethics", "Philosophy", "Philosophy", "Books", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-07T21:19:26Z", "article": "Most people&apos;s working lives start out easily enough, but not so for scientists. But things are more difficult than usual for biochemist Dr Claire Cyrus, as we learn in The Honest Look [Cold Spring Harbor Press; 2010; Amazon UK; Amazon US]. This well-written novel begins at one of the most critical times in any young scientist&apos;s life: that turbulent point when she leaves her academic home after earning the PhD to start her first postdoctoral research job.    Claire, a freshly-minted PhD, has just relocated from Liverpool to Amsterdam to develop cures for stroke and Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Clair&apos;s new employer, NeuroSys, is a biotech start-up company, investing all its resources into developing one compound, nicknamed &quot;the Zapper&quot;. Early test results suggest that the Zapper is a promising treatment for stroke and for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer&apos;s, which it was specifically designed to treat.  Bolstered by this good news, NeuroSys purchases an expensive piece of equipment, the Interactrex 3000. It is hoped that this monstrous instrument, which captures and analyses proteins located inside living cells, will enable NeuroSys to pursue additional lines of inquiry. Because the Interactrex 3000 was integral to Claire&apos;s doctoral research, she is the world&apos;s expert at working with it, so she accompanies the finicky and demanding machine to its new home.  After settling in to her new job, Claire makes a startling discovery, one that could destroy both company and careers. Haunted by her unsteady start at NeuroSys, Claire makes a seemingly small choice that reverberates throughout the remainder of the novel.  As deftly as the Interactrex 3000 captures and analyses protein interactions, the author captures and analyses human relationships. We see it all, from the never-ending parade of petty power struggles between a country&apos;s natives and its immigrants to the subtle multifaceted interactions between lovers, from the hidden dance of brain proteins to potentially career-ending battles between scientific colleagues.  Throughout the book, we are accompanied by Claire&apos;s stream-of-consciousness conversation with her long-dead father, Edward. We play the word games that Claire&apos;s father, an embittered poet, played with her when she was a child. We become aware of her lifelong passion for writing and we eventually solve the mystery of why Claire, a poet herself, abandoned writing for a career in science. Snippets of poetry are sprinkled around as a plot device; drawing the reader&apos;s attention to important details, acting as critical turning points in the story.  As the story unfolds, we become versed in the nuances of Claire&apos;s research as she explains them to her new friend, Rachel. We gain an appreciation for the dedication it takes to be a scientist: frustrating dead-ends alternating with marathon work sessions stretching late into the night for weeks on end, the complex collaborations with brilliant and ambitious but often socially challenged people.  As we follow Claire&apos;s struggle between her ethics and her actions, we come face-to-face of the ongoing dilemma that is corporate research: that uneasy relationship between the quest for truth and the pursuit of profit. Set in the high-stakes world of biomedical research, this fast-paced novel is populated by strong characters facing difficult choices, driven by twisty plotting and compelling writing. It provides an authentic peek into the backgrounds, histories and motivations of those who work in corporate science. After you&apos;ve finished, you&apos;ll snap the book closed in satisfaction, realizing that scientists are human, just like everyone else. Whether you are a scientist, a mystery buff or you simply enjoy immersing yourself into a tightly-written story, you will enjoy this thought-provoking thriller.  .

The plane heading to Kabul on 26 January 2004 had been chartered by a company that would go on to become part of the world&apos;s largest private security firm \u2013 G4S. Its cargo included refused asylum seekers in handcuffs. A number had their legs bound with tape and had been placed in the first-class cabin. But according to new evidence some of the guards on that flight, recruited to supervise the deportation, had not completed a full training course, and they included a number of inexperienced prison staff. Some had not even received Home Office accreditation. Shocking details about that flight and dozens more are contained in previously unseen evidence to parliament obtained by the Guardian. The documents reveal how G4S employees spent several years raising concerns about the potentially lethal methods being used on refused asylum seekers. The most disturbing technique involved bending deportees over in their seats and placing their head between their legs. The procedure became known within the company as &quot;carpet karaoke&quot; because it would force detainees, struggling for breath, to shout downwards toward the floor. Although an apparently successful method of keeping disruptive detainees quiet, it can lead to a form of suffocation known as positional asphyxia. Its alleged use is documented in written testimony by four G4S whistleblowers, submitted to the home affairs select committee in the aftermath of the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan who died on a British Airways flight from Heathrow in October last year. The cause of Mubenga&apos;s death remains unknown. Passengers on BA flight 77 reported seeing three guards heavily restraining the 46-year-old, who they said had been bent over and complained of breathing difficulties before his collapse. Police later arrested the guards in connection with the death and recently extended their bail until next month. Grievances All four whistleblowers have registered personal grievances against G4S, including some that have been settled out of court. Some are understood to have been themselves accused of inappropriate behaviour or later barred from conveying their concerns to the press. However, they now accuse G4S managers of presiding over a &quot;macho&quot; corporate culture that ostracised staff who showed compassion towards detainees or questioned the safety of their treatment. One of the whistleblowers, the company&apos;s serving charter operations manager, concedes that his detailed dossier to parliament is likely to result in his dismissal. The dossier records how he repeatedly wrote to his seniors expressing concerns, including one letter in which he stated that some G4S employees were playing &quot;Russian roulette with detainees&apos; lives&quot;. Private companies were first contracted to oversee removals of refused asylum seekers after the death in 1993 of Joy Gardner, an illegal immigrant who died during a struggle with police who had come to collect her at her home. It was more than a decade later, in 2004, that the security firm Securicor took on a small number of chartered flights to Afghanistan, Romania and Kosovo. From the outset, the training is said to have lacked sufficient first-aid instruction and emphasised &quot;pain compliance&quot; techniques. It was initially aided by a training video inherited from a rival company which lasted just over six minutes and showed guards bundling a detainee into an aircraft [see footnote]. The video, which was later phased out, is included in the dossier of evidence submitted to parliament by the G4S whistleblowers as an example of the inappropriate training they received. In 2004 Securicor merged with Group 4 Falck to form the company now known as G4S. It won a five-year contract to oversee the vast majority of all overseas removals for the Home Office, beginning in 2005. G4S said that following the merger there was a &quot;thorough&quot; review of material used to train staff. &quot;Since then all employees on the contract have received annual refresher training in the appropriate and approved techniques,&quot; it said. But it would take months, and in some cases years, for some G4S guards to receive official Home Office accreditation, according to the evidence submitted to MPs, which also points to severe delays in the reform of training. Lacking any official identification to show foreign customs officials, some guards are understood to have had badges made in a trophy shop. The whistleblower testimony reveals repeated complaints to the company about the standard of training for guards, some of whom are said to have been allowed to take part in removal flights without having undertaken full &quot;control and restraint&quot; training. The first documented complaint from a guard was made in July 2004, five months after the company&apos;s inaugural flight to Kabul. It stated guards had not been trained properly, lacked any formal certification and were using handcuffs in a potentially illegal manner. The evidence submitted to MPs suggests the complaint, along with several others made over a six-year period, was largely ignored by G4S managers who contrived to &quot;discredit, harass, bully and on occasions dismiss&quot; staff who spoke out. One whistleblower describes &quot;a deliberate culture of mismanagement and cover-up&quot; during the company&apos;s first four years of conducting overseas removals. By the summer of 2005, some guards were evidently becoming increasingly concerned about the ad-hoc techniques developed to restrain non-compliant detainees. &quot;I raised a huge concern about detainees&apos; heads being pushed down below the chest line,&quot; explained a G4S training instructor who left the firm in 2008. &quot;Unfortunately I witnessed on a number of occasions staff using this technique as soon as a detainee became disruptive.&quot; Around this time one guard felt compelled to write to his manager, warning training had to change &quot;before there was a serious positional asphyxiation incident resulting in a detainee&apos;s death&quot;. Meetings then appear to have been held with the senior staff, at which concerns were raised that recruits were learning &quot;unofficial methods&quot;, including &quot;striking a detainee regardless of circumstances&quot; and &quot;folding a detainee with a seat-belt tightened&quot;. Disruptive The following year, G4S received a circular from the Home Office, which had become aware of similar complaints. A Home Office official had boarded a G4S deportation flight and witnessed guards pushing a disruptive detainee&apos;s head on to the headrest in front. &quot;Advice is that holding detainees in this manner could restrict airways and potentially result in positional asphyxia,&quot; he wrote. The letter is believed to have been pinned up in the G4S staff canteen. Just three months later, and despite the Home Office warning, a guard again raised his concerns. He said he had repeatedly alerted seniors over a period of two years, but his warnings had failed to put an &quot;immediate stop to potentially lethal techniques&quot;. His fear, he said, was &quot;the inevitable death of a detainee&quot;. &quot;The overriding problem is that this technique is still being used by some team leaders to force their charges into quiet submission,&quot; he wrote in the June 2006 letter. &quot;I urge you meet this problem head on before the worst happens.&quot; Frustrated that their complaints were not being listened to, by the end of 2007 some G4S guards took to writing to police, a local MP and the Home Office. During a Home Office audit of training in 2007, officials received a letter from a G4S guard. She specifically warned of the dangers of positional asphyxia through the &quot;deliberate folding over of handcuffed and verbally unco-operative detainees&quot;, something she said she had witnessed &quot;several times&quot;. Several former G4S guards have independently told the Guardian the reason deportees were subjected to &quot;carpet karaoke&quot; was because in effect there was a financial inducement to keep them quiet. Refused asylum seekers often caused violent commotions when boarding aircraft, particularly on commercial flights, in the knowledge that a pilot would often refuse to fly with disruptive passengers. The guards were desperate to avoid an aborted flight because their pay would be cut. According to the whistleblowers, G4S introduced a payment structure for guards that meant they were paid far less if long-haul flights were aborted. They argue the result was a built-in incentive for guards to forcefully silence deportees to ensure aircraft took off. As one whistleblower put it, an aborted flight would have &quot;a serious financial impact, not only for the company but also to individual officers \u2026 this can be a very potent incentive to cut corners if you are so minded.&quot; Complaints  Amid mounting complaints from deportees as well as its own staff, G4S is understood to have conducted a contract-wide audit of its training in early 2008. Improved courses were introduced for new recruits that summer. But the company&apos;s own training staff do not appear to have been satisfied with the new regime. Parliament has received evidence from one whistleblower who says that until recently they co-ordinated training for 1,200 G4S staff. Officials in charge of training had repeatedly expressed the need to re-create the confined space of an aircraft when training guards to control disruptive deportees, she said. &quot;Consideration was given to hiring Virgin Atlantic&apos;s flight simulator, however this was disregarded on price,&quot; she added. Another proposal \u2013 involving decommissioned aircraft seats \u2013 was also not realised. She told the Guardian training was still taking place on ordinary office chairs assembled in an office when she left G4S four months ago. The week after she left the company, senior G4S executives were summoned before the home affairs select committee to explain their procedures in the wake of Mubenga&apos;s death. David Banks, group managing director for G4S, denied there was a remuneration structure that incentivised removals. He was asked by the committee chair, Keith Vaz, if his staff had ever complained about &quot;any aspects of the removal process&quot;. He replied: &quot;I&apos;m certainly not aware of any, no.&quot; G4S said in a statement that it was aware allegations have been made to the home affairs select committee. &quot;We have requested details, but we haven&apos;t yet received any information and so we&apos;re not in a position to respond further at this time. &quot;We would obviously be keen to investigate these allegations but will not be able to conduct a review or take any action without seeing the evidence.&quot; It said allegations of mistreatment are taken &quot;extremely seriously&quot;. &quot;We investigate any allegations presented to us and where the conduct of staff has been inappropriate, we take the appropriate disciplinary action.&quot; A guard&apos;s diary In her evidence to parliament, one G4S guard, a 51-year-old ex-police officer, disclosed entries from her diary. 3 May 2004 Virgin Flight 601, Heathrow to Johannesburg. Removal of mother and her four-year-old daughter &quot;\u2026 without warning [team leader] dragged detainee [who had been calmly sat down] to her feet and pulled us through some swing doors into a small foyer area out of sight of aircrew, ground crew and passengers. In here he pulled detainee and me to the ground and proceeded to tie her legs together with two pairs of restraints, of a kind I only ever saw him use. In doing so he rested his whole weight across detainee&apos;s upper body, which as I later learned carries with it a risk of causing positional asphyxia \u2026 the flight passed off without incident, but on approach to Johannesburg detainee kept trying to unfasten seatbelt, and told child to do the same. Child was sitting in row in front with [another guard], who prevented her from doing so by first pulling the belt tight and then actually sitting on the little girl.&quot; 23 June 2004 KLM Flight KL 1000, Heathrow to Amsterdam.

I told the team leader to let her up and after a while he did so, pushing her down again after a few seconds. I again remonstrated and team leader let detainee up again for a few seconds before forcing her head forward again. On this occasion I heard detainee say that she could not breathe and I again told the team leader to let her up.&quot; 7 December 2004 Transfer of Kosovan family of nine to Tinsley House detention centre, pending extradition to Germany &quot;One of the remaining children, a 15-year-old girl, had been handcuffed by police during the course of the detention \u2026 an 18-year-old was processed first.

Its market value is $10.86bn, compared with $9.18bn for NYSE Euronext. The news came after the London Stock Exchange confirmed that it was to join forces with the operator of the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges to create another global bourse. The all-share deal between the LSE and Canada&apos;s TMX group, which formed a strategic partnership in 2009, is being billed as a merger of equals, but LSE shareholders will own 55% of the combined group. Shares in the LSE jumped more than 10% in early trading, valuing the combined company at about \u00a35bn. It will be headquartered in London and Toronto and run by the LSE&apos;s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, from London. The new chairman is TMX&apos;s Wayne Fox, while the LSE&apos;s chairman, Chris Gibson-Smith, and his deputy, Paolo Scaroni, will serve as deputy chairmen of the combined group. Thomas Kloet, chief executive of TMX, becomes president, based in Toronto. Rolet said: &quot;This is an incredibly exciting merger with considerable growth opportunities. We are creating the world&apos;s largest listings venue for the commodities, energy and natural resources sectors, as well as the premium market for small, mid-size and growth companies.&quot; The new transatlantic group will be the largest bourse for trading in mining, energy and clean technology shares. Most of the world&apos;s mining firms are listed on the 150-year-old Toronto Stock Exchange, although the largest miners are listed on the LSE. The merged group will also be the world&apos;s largest exchange by the number of companies traded. However, by market value it will rank seventh, behind rivals such as NYSE Euronext, Deutsche B\u00f6rse and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group. The deal comes after years of speculation over the future of the LSE, which has fought off advances from various predators, including Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Sweden&apos;s OM Exchange, Euronext, Nasdaq of the US and Australia&apos;s Macquarie Bank.", "sentences": ["As well as the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext owns stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon as well as the NYSE Liffe derivatives market in London."], "title": "NYSE Euronext in merger talks with Deutsche B\u00f6rse", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/09/lse-tmx-merger-canada-stock-exchange", "tags": ["London Stock Exchange", "Business", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Mining", "Canada", "World news", "UK news", "US news", "Americas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-11T16:29:18Z", "article": "Co-operative behaviour, particularly one-off acts of kindness by strangers (known as non-reciprocal altruism) confuses scientists. Why does this apparently self-defeating behaviour persist? The importance of co-operation has long been acknowledged. In the 17th century, philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote that life without co-operative social contracts would be, &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short&quot;. In 1871, Darwin noted that, &quot;Communities which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish best, and rear the greatest number of offspring.&quot; But the paradox remains: if natural selection favours self-serving behaviour and those who help others diminish their own reproductive success, why bother being nice? As so-called prosocial behaviour is a pet interest of mine, I took a stroll across Regents Park on Tuesday and treated myself to a free lecture at the Zoological Society London (ZSL) entitled &quot;Why be nice? Understanding co-operative behaviour in humans and other animals&quot;. Pre-lecture refreshments were complementary and the 200-seat Huxley Hall quickly filled with old and young, expert and layman, curious to know if science has finally cracked the altruism conundrum. First up was Nigel Franks from the University of Bristol, who researches &quot;colony-level cognition&quot; in ants. This en masse form of co-operation seems to be facilitated by &quot;quorum sensing&quot;, where individual ants change their behaviour once they sense that a threshold has been met for a particular stimulus \u2013 for example if enough ants have already adopted the new strategy. In this regard ant society can be understood as a &quot;super organism&quot;. With some 10,000 species, a biomass equalling that of humanity and ant ancestry dating back over 100m years, the evolutionary success of the co-operative ant is clear. Maybe next time you discover ants encamped on top of your golden syrup tin, before reaching for the ant powder you should reflect on the fact that these small critters could teach David Cameron what a Big Society really is. Next up was Andrew Young from the University of Exeter, whose research on long-tailed tits supports &quot;kin selection theory&quot;: the birds always favour co-operating with relatives over non-kin, said Young. Among mammals, the naked mole rat is the most co-operative breeder of all mammals. But there&apos;s no evidence among non-primate mammals that self-serving cheaters are ever punished. Among primates, however, there are examples of cheating being punished. In the 1980s, Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth observed that if a wild vervet monkey discovered a fruiting tree but did not make the &quot;food call&quot; to alert the rest of the troop, and was later caught eating the spoils alone, the self-serving monkey received a beating. Research at Frans de Waal&apos;s laboratory at Emory University last year revealed that dogs and monkeys favour co-operation and refuse to participate in unfair social exchanges. The third entertaining lecture, given by Redouan Bshary of Neuchatel University in Switzerland, examined the fascinating social contracts between cleaner fish (wrasse) and their clients (grouper fish). Cleaner fish co-operate by removing parasites from much larger predator fish. But as wrasse are partial to the protective mucus on the skin of clients, they would rather bite them than feed on parasites. What inhibits them from doing this? Bshary observed that when client fish have a choice of cleaner fish, cleaners are less likely to bite their customers, and where client fish are visible to other cleaner fish they are less likely to eat cleaner fish. It would seem social reputation is a significant factor in maintaining social contracts between species of fish, as it is between humans. But co-operation within species works differently. Wrasse are born female and change sex if they grow large enough. Males have a harem, and they control the female when she tends to clients. If the client doesn&apos;t find the service agreeable and swims away the frustrated male wrasse will attack the smaller female. This keeps female wrasse highly co-operative and less likely to bite the client and more likely to give an excellent grooming service. This behaviour by the larger male deprives the female wrasse of food, keeping her a small, controlled breeding partner. But if the female stops co-operating and self-serves by biting clients, she can grow, change sex and fight off her ex-partner and take control of his harem. The final speaker, Simon G\u00e4chter from the University of Nottingham, researches human group co-operation versus individual interest. In trials staged in 16 different countries, with no chance to punish selfish behaviour, co-operation quickly failed. (Incidentally, Danish participants were the most co-operative and Australians the least co-operative.) G\u00e4chter said the conclusion he drew from this was that punishment of cheaters is necessary for co-operation to thrive. He added that social contracts are influenced by culture and so the extent and nature of co-operation depends partly on where you live. I would add here that personality type and gender also have an effect on levels of pro-social behaviour. Research by Mark van Vugt at the University of Amsterdam suggests that female behaviour is less hierarchical and more co-operative than that of males. In his book Naturally Selected, van Vugt claims that the inclusion of just one woman on a board of directors makes the company 20% less likely to go bankrupt. During the Q&amp;A I would like to have questioned Young and G\u00e4chter, but a non-co-operative male hogged the microphone. Never fear, there are drinks after ZSL Communicating Science lectures at the Prince Albert bar, where the thirst of questioners can be quenched. And for those with an appetite for more there&apos;s a fancy \u00a334 three-course meal served in the zoo&apos;s rather grand Prince Albert suite. Here expert and lay scientist can sit cheek by jowl, chewing the cud of their shared interests. The Zoological Society London began public engagement in 1826 and today everyone is still welcome at its free events.

University of Leicester ecology and conservation biologist, Dr David Harper, warned. Harper has spent over 30 years researching wetland conservation at Kenya&apos;s Lake Naivasha and said the growth of the flowers is draining the valuable water supply. Seventy per cent of roses sold in European supermarkets come from Kenya, most from Naivasha. Harper called on UK supermarkets to show more concern about the health of the environment that the flowers come from. He said: &quot;A notable few of the farmers sending roses to Europe are showing concern and an eagerness to pioneer a sustainable way forward: the best flower farms have achieved Fairtrade status, which brings money back into the workforce for social welfare improvements. Two farms have even seconded senior managers to help Kenya&apos;s water management agency at Naivasha.&quot; But he warns that the massive scale of UK supermarket promotions of flowers over Valentine&apos;s Day \u2014 and subsequently on Mother&apos;s Day \u2013 without concern for where or how environmentally sustainable roses can be grown, will just increase the export of water \u2013 the scarcest natural resource in Kenya. He went on: &quot;There are just a few good farms but many more that don&apos;t care how much damage they do to the lake. Seventy per cent of the roses sold in European supermarkets come from Kenya and the majority of those are from Naivasha, many thus coming without any ecological certification. This has to change for the future of the industry as well as the lake and the country.&quot; The provenance of such roses is not always clear, he said. Cheap roses are often grown by companies which cut corners to avoid legislation, selling them by auction in Amsterdam so buyers think they come from Holland. The supermarket chain Asda sources its roses fro Columbia, Holland and Kenya, including a bouquet of premium roses for \u00a318. In a statement it said: &quot;We have very high ethical standards in all the products we source, including roses, and we work closely with all our producers to maintain these high standards of excellence.&quot; Marks &amp; Spencer is selling a dozen Fairtrade Roses for \u00a310, claiming that the Kenyan red roses &quot;are not only stunning but the Fairtrade premium Kenyan flower growers receive, allows them to invest in their community \u2013 ideal if a loved one is passionate about ethical trading.&quot; As part of its year-round &apos;Fairtrade for free&apos; line Sainsbury&apos;s is selling a dozen roses for \u00a34.99, absorbing the associated price premium itself.", "sentences": ["Cheap roses are often grown by companies which cut corners to avoid legislation, selling them by auction in Amsterdam so buyers think they come from Holland."], "title": "Growing Valentine's Day roses harming Kenya's ecological site", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/14/valentines-day-roses-kenya", "tags": ["Environment", "Valentine's Day", "Kenya", "World news", "Life and style", "UK news", "Supermarkets", "Fair trade", "Conservation"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-14T18:23:03Z", "article": "The mezzo-soprano Maureen Lehane, who has died aged 78, graced the stages of Europe and America for little more than two decades, though she was a firm favourite with both critics and audiences during that period, especially in Handelian opera. After her early retirement in the late 1970s, she put her formidable talents and energies to use in the field of music education via the Jackdaws Music Education Trust, which in turn evolved out of the Great Elm music festival, near Frome, Somerset, founded by Lehane in memory of her husband, Peter Wishart, in 1986. The vocal awards established by the festival have been won by singers of the calibre of Kate Royal, Christopher Maltman and Amanda Echalaz, while outreach projects have enriched the lives of countless youngsters in the locality. Born in London, Lehane attended Queen Elizabeth&apos;s grammar school for girls in Barnet, where the music teacher, of the opinion that she had not got much of a voice, ejected Lehane from the choir. Not discouraged, she went on to study at the Guildhall School of Music, London, and in Berlin, emerging as a singer of note in the mid-1950s, though it was not until 1967 that she made her Glyndebourne debut as Melide in Cavalli&apos;s L&apos;Ormindo. She also sang repertoire by Vivaldi, JC Bach, Purcell (Dido and Aeneas) and Rossini (La Cenerentola), but it was for her performances of Handel, often in castrato roles, that she was best known. She participated to acclaim in a series of presentations by the Handel Opera Society at Sadler&apos;s Wells and was widely admired on international tours to North America, Australia and the far east, singing at different times under Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent, Pierre Boulez, John Pritchard, Neville Marriner and John Eliot Gardiner. Possessed of a superb technique that allowed her to negotiate the coloratura of castrato roles with assurance, she was also able to endow the more expressive arias with a refulgent tone, at once regal and rapturous. It could be argued that she never quite received the recognition her talents deserved. Certainly she was incensed when she discovered that her agent was offering promoters Janet Baker when they had asked for Lehane. But it was also the case that she never really enjoyed the whole business of stage performance: both the travelling and the ego-strutting were anathema to her, and she claimed to feel physically ill whenever she entered an opera house. In 1974 she took the title role in Handel&apos;s Ariodante at Sadler&apos;s Wells, delivering it with intelligent musicianship. But her stage appearances thereafter were few and far between: a Marcellina in Fidelio (Cologne, 1975), a Dido in Purcell&apos;s opera (Amsterdam, 1976) and Ottone in Vivaldi&apos;s Griselda for the English Bach festival in London (1978). She continued to undertake mostly local engagements of concert repertoire and also to espouse contemporary music, singing the role of Klymene in Alan Ridout&apos;s Phaeton for BBC Radio 3 and appearing in the last two of her husband&apos;s operas: Clytemnestra and The Lady of the Inn. Her recordings include a moving account of the role of Irene in Johannes Somary&apos;s interpretation of Handel&apos;s Theodora and an equally notable one of the role of Cyrus in Nikolaus Harnoncourt&apos;s account of Belshazzar. It was to provide a summer-holiday forum for Wishart&apos;s music students (he taught at Reading University), that the couple opened up their house and garden at Great Elm. The natural setting \u2013 they were surrounded by river, tall trees and the cliffs of the gorge beyond \u2013 was idyllic, and when Wishart died unexpectedly in 1984, Lehane, who was by then known as Maureen Lehane Wishart, decided to expand the venture, forming the Great Elm music festival, which ran from 1986 to 1998. At its height, the festival consisted of 21 fully professional events, spread over three weekends and held in small local venues ranging from Lehane&apos;s own kitchen to neighbouring houses, churches and gardens. Having been offered \u00a310,000 by a local philanthropist, she decided to invest the sum to use as prize money for a vocal awards event based at Great Elm. The compulsory elements, an aria by Handel and a song by Wishart, encapsulated the twin loves of her life. Lehane herself always acted as one of the adjudicators, and for many years the competition was a highlight in the local calendar, until more recently the finals moved to the Wigmore Hall in London. The other major venture for which Lehane was responsible was the Jackdaws Music Education Trust, founded in 1993. This is a thriving institution with several components. First, there are the workshops and short courses run for amateurs, advanced students and young professionals. Next are the occasional concerts promoted both at Great Elm and in Frome. And finally, community events enable local children to take part in music-making. These have ranged from a Magic Flute for children with learning difficulties to a Soldier&apos;s Tale project involving three Frome schools and a pocket version of Wagner&apos;s Ring performed by children who were encouraged to develop their own musical interludes based on Wagner&apos;s leitmotifs. Other projects include Songbird, an educational scheme based on the Kod\u00e1ly Method, and Flights of Fancy, combining tuition for special needs groups by musicians, poets, artists and potters. Lehane had no children of her own, but an almost missionary zeal to offer musical activity as a component of a rounded education. Until her final illness, a Parkinson&apos;s-related condition known as multiple system atrophy, she was at the very centre of these projects, which remain a fitting memorial to a remarkable woman. \u2022 Maureen Lehane Wishart, mezzo-soprano and educationist, born 18 September 1932; died 27 December 2010", "sentences": ["But her stage appearances thereafter were few and far between: a Marcellina in Fidelio (Cologne, 1975), a Dido in Purcell&apos;s opera (Amsterdam, 1976) and Ottone in Vivaldi&apos;s Griselda for the English Bach festival in London (1978)."], "title": "Maureen Lehane obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/14/maureen-lehane-obituary", "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Music", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-15T11:40:00Z", "article": "Each month, the Music Alliance Pact \u2013 a group of 35 music blogs from around the world, including this one \u2013 simultaneously post tracks chosen by each blog.

Not for nothing has he been compared to the late, great J Dilla in terms of his ability to create amazing fresh sounds from ancient vinyl, while in terms of obsessive crate-digging for sonic gold he's like a one-man Avalanches. \"He takes a fragment, a pop particle, and uses its DNA to construct a brilliant new piece of music,\" wrote our New Band Of The Day columnist recently, commenting that Williams' ethereal, crackly take on sexed-up R&B made him a sort of cerebral R Kelly for bedroom lo-fi nerds.   ARGENTINA ARGENTINA: Zonaindie Iguana Lovers - Bloqueada The history of Iguana Lovers goes as far back as 1991 when they released Universo, their first album, which had a limited run in cassette format. Along with big acts such as Babas\u00f3nicos and El Otro Yo, they managed to create a whole new movement within Argentine rock music, with a post-punk sound influenced by British bands like Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses and New Order. Bloqueada is from their new EP, International Mistery Man, which can be downloaded from their website.  AUSTRALIA  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They? aBillion - Soldiers It may not be summer where you are right now, but it's definitely summer in Australia - and despite the natural disasters there's still enough sun and surf to make a song like Soldiers really hit the spot. Sydney's aBillion has burst onto the blog scene riding the proverbial chillwave, engaging many of the micro-genre's tropes but managing to make them their own. Although, there's a lot of music like this floating around at the moment, Soldiers has enough of a hook and groove to it to make you tune in.    BRAZIL BRAZIL: Meio Desligado Cabru\u00eara - Visagem Cabru\u00eara is a band from the north-east of the country who merge typical regional rhythms with contemporary music such as electronic and rock. They're famous for their insane shows, always full of stage dives and crowd-surfing from the band's frontman, Arthur Pessoa. Visagem is an instrumental theme that shares its name with their most recent album, which was released last year and is available for free download thanks to Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company that is the biggest sponsor of culture in the country.    CANADA CANADA: I(Heart)Music Fire And Neon - Everybody's Going Disco never died. It just went into hiding somewhere on the outskirts of Canada's capital, where it was then discovered by Fire And Neon. They, in turn, nursed it back to health and made a debut EP full of irresistibly dancey anthems.    CHILE CHILE: Super 45 Namm - Stellar Pablo Flores is one of the most iconic Chilean musicians. Aside from founding the experimental music netlabel Jacobino Discos, he takes part in several projects. In Namm, Flores joins Loreto Molina, Pablo Fuentes and Anita Gallardo in exploring synth-pop from an experimental perspective, but elegant nonetheless. Stellar is taken from his latest EP, Saba, offered under a Creative Commons license.    CHINA CHINA: Wooozy Re-TROS - Up Next: Bela Lugosi's Back Also known as Rebuilding The Rights Of Statues, this post-punk outfit formed in Beijing in 2003. Inspired by the likes of Bauhaus, Gang Of Four, Magazine and Joy Division, Re-TROS have become a mainstay in the Chinese underground scene. Hua Dong has one of the most piercing vocals and his distorted guitar lines add 'darkness' to the Re-TROS sound. The band have released two albums to date and have been very well received by fans and critics alike. They have been invited to support Gang Of Four for a one-week Australian tour at the end of February.    COLUMBIA COLOMBIA: Colombia Urbana Cris Supra - Este Verano Under the influence of R&B, Cris Supra gives us Este Verano, his new single for 2011. Supra is a representative exponent of the electro hip-hop scene in Colombia, with the principal base of his music coming from influences such as LMFAO, Pitbull, Lil Jon, David Guetta and Kid Cudi.    DENMARK DENMARK: All Scandinavian Stupid White Men - Walk And Slaughter Banjos, dobros, pathos-filled lyrics, dark emotions and a dusty Southern rock feeling. Sounds like a good combo to you? Then you'll dig quartet Stupid White Men and their excellent debut album It's A Fine Day To Kill Someone Nice, which was released last month.    FINLAND FINLAND: Glue Moses Hazy - Something You Ate From the far north of the Finnish Lapland, Moses Hazy deliver the first single from their third album. This is a pretty straightforward rock song with an in-your-face chorus and a bunch of acid notes to add some psychedelia to the mix. Danceable and fun.    GERMANY GERMANY: Blogpartei Touchy Mob - Atlantic Back Folk-techno, as Ludwig Plath calls his music produced under the name Touchy Mob, seems to be the natural connection of two currently popular genres that tend to be honest and plain. But as you listen to his songs and remixes you are drawn into hypnotic structures, great arrangements and Plath's soft, gentle voice. Atlantic Back is just one facet of his talent - check out more songs from this promising Berlin-based artist on Bandcamp and Soundcloud.    GREECE GREECE: Mouxlaloulouda Exposed By Observers - Doubt Is Dead Exposed By Observers frantically blend cheap samples, drum machine sounds, distinctive beats, clicks, bleeps and tightly-coiled guitars riffs with manic electro buzz and raw, squawking vocals. Yet they are less faithfully wed to punk and more interested in dance-derived rhythms. Doubt Is Dead is taken from their digital single, Fake Stories, the first in a series of monthly releases (there will be at least five parts). Visit Soundcloud to check out Fake Stories Never Get Old and their debut EP, Secondhand Youth.    ICELAND ICELAND: Icelandic Music Maffia R\u00f6kkurr\u00f3 - S\u00f3lin Mun Sk\u00edna R\u00f6kkurr\u00f3's music is built around Hildur Krist\u00edn Stef\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir's voice and swooping strings. Their debut album \u00dea\u00f0 K\u00f3lnar \u00cd Kv\u00f6ld\u2026 (\"It's Getting Colder Tonight\u2026\") was released in 2007. S\u00f3lin Mun Sk\u00edna is taken from their more mature second album, \u00cd Annan Heim (\"In Another World\"), released last year by Icelandic label 12 T\u00f3nar and produced by Alex Somers, partner and music collaborator of J\u00f3nsi of Sigur R\u00f3s.    INDIA INDIA: Indiecision IAFWAY - Unsaturated New Delhi hardcore act IAFWAY (short for \"I Am Fake Who Are You\") are unlikely contenders for Indian metal glory. Still in school, the sextet can't even legally buy drinks at the clubs where they hope to take their brand of screamo. Yet their videogame-inspired tunes bely a maturity well past their years. On Unsaturated, a track from their free debut EP, they bring together melodramatic hardcore trappings with an almost graphic novel-ish wielding of screamo \u00e0 la Bring Me The Horizon.    INDONESIA INDONESIA: Deathrockstar Pee Wee Gaskins - Jakarta Is A Mistake Pee Wee Gaskins divide opinion - lots of people hate them but even more love the five-piece South Jakarta pop-punk boys. Since their music has grown in maturity and their lyrics have become deeper, we should agree about the progress they have made. Put aside the band promotion, public relations and social media consciousness, it's the music itself that continues to redefine the sound of PWG.    IRELAND IRELAND: Nialler9 MOTHS - Slow/Down The definition of 'one to watch' is an artist who is clearly adept at making music and impressing but maybe hasn't gone as far as the album-making cycle. MOTHS aka Jack Colleran has a good excuse. He's only 17 and still in school in County Kildare but he has already made a couple of standout electronic jams. Definitely keep an eye out for more of this goodness.    ISRAEL ISRAEL: Metal Israel Blank Divinity - In Another Life Blank Divinity is a metal band from Ashkelon, a seaside city no stranger to rocket attacks. They rightfully boast transcendence over all metal genres into their own sometimes brutal, sometimes melodic and most of the time completely shredding brand just waiting to be picked up by the right record company. Their talent is undeniable (though their occasional female vocalist is not to my taste) and I can definitely see these guys playing the major European festivals one day. Check them out.    ITALY ITALY: Polaroid Green Like July - Flying Scud Green Like July's second album, Four-Legged Fortune, was recorded at the ARC Studios in Nebraska and produced by A.J. Mogis (Saddle Creek). In fact, it definitely has a Bright Eyes vibe but this song in particular, with its Dylan-esque mood (that organ, that bridge), is a pure folk-rock jewel, intense and fragile at the same time. I love the way it burns out when it reaches the last words, you can totally see the trembling light of the stars, and the night fades away.    MEXICO MEXICO: Red Bull PanameriKa Marlento - As The World Turns Marlento is one of those bands with the outstanding ability to stir vivid scenes on their listeners' minds. This five-piece from Guadalajara sports a deviant mixture of influences within their songs, from Americana to New Wave, ebbing and flowing from furious post-punk to melancholic Mexican folk. As The World Turns is the quite catchy and tight first single from their sophomore album, Ludo, to be released this month.    NETHERLANDS NETHERLANDS: Unfold Amsterdam Nikoo - Shameless There's a real urgency to every sound this noise-pop outfit creates. Tribal drums clatter ferociously, while guitar fuzz emanates through the entire frequency spectrum, at times the mid-range riffs starting punch-ups with harmonic-fried highs. But drawing members from some of the Netherlands' most underrated alt-pop bands (Foam, The Sugarettes, amongst others), raw and enduring harmonies are rarely far from the surface of the noise. Imagine all the fun and chaos of Baltimore's Ponytail but with much less banshee.   NEW ZEALAND NEW ZEALAND: Einstein Music Journal Popstrangers - Avenue Noisy shoegaze collides with angry post-punk in Popstrangers' songs. They released their second EP, Happy Accidents, in November on Shoot The Freak, and its five distorted pop songs instantly stand out. There's a real menacing quality to the slacker vocals, drilling rhythm section and rusty guitars. Avenue sounds like a classic Flying Nun track in some regards, all pent-up aggression and hooky choruses dropping off to a sweetly serene bridge.   NORWAY NORWAY: Birds Sometimes Dance Jonas Alaska - In The Backseat Jonas Alaska is a 22-year-old up-and-coming singer-songwriter from \u00c5mli. He's currently living and studying in Liverpool and playing shows solo or with the band Homestead. He's no doubt walking in the footsteps of Bob Dylan, but don't be mistaken - he's not a pale copy, rather a brilliant musician in the same vein. He spent the fall of 2010 recording his debut album and we can all look forward to its release this summer.    PERU PERU: SoTB Kanaku & El Tigre - Bicicleta Kanaku & El Tigre are a cool group who will revitalize our ears this summer. Bruno Bellat\u00edn and Nico Saba's compositions take in folk melodies and experimental sounds made by any unusual instrument. Their stories talk about vices and selfishness, but also about sweetness and a weird hope. Bicicleta is from their first LP, Caracoles, a real hidden treasure.    PORTUGAL PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco? Hipn\u00f3tica + Unixx - Perfect Betrayer T(h)ree is the name of a collaborative compilation featuring 33 bands from Portugal, Macau and Hong Kong. Hipn\u00f3tica, who recorded and produced this track with Hong Kong group Unixx, is one of the most interesting Portuguese alternative bands and have been releasing music since 1997. Twelve-Wired Bird Of Paradise is their critically-acclaimed latest album and came out last year.    ROMANIA ROMANIA: Babylon Noise White Walls - The Lost Art Of Chapeaugraphy Part II This month we're presenting you something a bit different. Progressive metal that blends furious riffs with moments of calm, harsh vocals with melodic ones, alternating explosions with restraints. I'm talking about White Walls, from Constanta, four guys becoming ever more appreciated thanks to their live performances and debut album, Mad Man Circus, available for download via their label, Asiluum.    SCOTLAND SCOTLAND: The Pop Cop Reverie - Get To Know Me Reverie is the stage name of Louise Connell, a striking 21-year-old singer with a tempting voice and pop songs with hints of Martha Wainwright. Get To Know Me is such a flawless acoustic strum, it surely can't be long before daytime radio is all over this. The track is taken from her surprisingly diverse debut album Melodies which you can download for less than the price of a glass of wine at Bandcamp.    SINGAPORE SINGAPORE: I'm Waking Up To... Elektone - Falling Into You Memories fade in and out of reality when it comes to Elektone's dreamy brand of electro-pop. Started by Zulfadly Amin, a graduate of our National Arts Council's Noise Singapore initiative, he and his merry band capture love and light waves as pangs of desire wash over Singapore's bullet-speed society. Taking a moment to enjoy Elektone's music is almost like allowing yourself to fall asleep in a mass rapid transit, dreaming of tomorrow as yesterday happens all around you.    SOUTH KOREA SOUTH KOREA: Indieful ROK Auhm - Hide In The Fog So far, Youn Sang Hoon is best known as the guitarist in the beyond lovely indie-pop act Donawhale, but with the band on hiatus that may well be about to change. In addition to occasionally supporting former MAP artist Apollo 18 on stage, he's been making some music under the moniker Auhm. Hide In The Fog is a glorious post-rock track that is far from as shy as the title implies. Hopefully an EP will be out before the summer, but for now we'll have to be satisfied with Auhm's wondrous demo recordings.    SPAIN SPAIN: Musikorner AtletA - Evasi\u00f3n y Victoria 12twelve were one of Spanish post-rock's top bands. Out of its cinders and spirit, many creative adventures rose, AtletA being one of them. Composed of two former members of the aforementioned Barcelona band, Jaume L. Pantale\u00f3n and Jos\u00e9 Rossell\u00f3 redefine their sound with a bigger experimental expression. Krautrock, synth loops and free-jazz structures dissolve and pass the baton that Pantale\u00f3n already held in Ruizpantale\u00f3n, shading the compositions with hypnotic brightness, as Evasi\u00f3n y Victoria shows.    SWEDEN SWEDEN: Swedesplease Stay Hungry - Against The Wall I guess I should have asked for a couple of more songs from the straight edge hardcore band Stay Hungry since this one clocks in at only 1:27. Still, it's a perfect use of a minute and 27 seconds - nothing is wasted in this band's minimalistic aggro punk. I'm not a hardcore expert and am far removed from the scene, but to me these guys have it. Whatever 'it' is.    SWITZERLAND SWITZERLAND: 78s Death Of A Cheerleader - Flesh & Blood Death Of A Cheerleader is a four-piece from Winterthur. They recently released Flesh & Blood, a forerunner to their debut album, recorded and produced by Magnus Lindberg in Sweden. The track is gloomy and haunting, six-and-a-half minutes full of No Wave in its best manner. If their full-length lives up to the promise, Flesh & Blood shows it's going to get a cheerful release party.    UNITED STATES UNITED STATES: I Guess I'm Floating New Animal - Last Winter Atlanta duo New Animal command a wide variety of genres and sounds on their self-titled debut LP (available free here), from electro-pop to avant indie-rock. The anthemic and meditative Last Winter is a great example of their songwriting chops, just one of 15 reasons to love this emerging band.    VENEZUELA VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1s Rawayana - Bahia Together since 2007, Rawayana fuse acoustic sounds with genres such as funk and folk to create something unique.

For most of us, the violent onset of gastric affliction would require a couple of days in bed, within reach of the necessary amenities. Not so Sir Simon. The 56-year-old started to feel unwell during the first half of a concert with his orchestra, the world-beating Berlin Philharmonic, at their stunning Philharmonie concert hall. The problem was that, having just conducted a Haydn symphony and a new horn concerto by Japanese composer Toshio Hosokawa, he had to get back out there in the grip of an upset stomach and lead a performance of Schubert&apos;s hour-long Ninth Symphony, a piece of so-called &quot;heavenly length&quot; whose every minute must have been a battle of intestinal will. He made it through that evening and, even more astonishingly, repeated the same concert the night after. And flu or no flu, Rattle and his orchestra gave the single most vital, inspiring and revelatory performance of a Haydn symphony I&apos;ve ever heard. The Schubert also went to expressive limits in the conductor&apos;s quest for musical adventure, finding \u2013 with Rattle restored by periodic sips of water \u2013 violence and wildness through lurches of speed and volume where most conductors find only placidity and consolation. It was probably unrelated to his condition, but Rattle lost the grip of his baton shortly before the end of the symphony, throwing it dexterously into the first row of the audience \u2013 without, thankfully, impaling a hapless Berliner. Rattle will soon play this programme again in London. It&apos;s just one of four concerts he and the Berlin Philharmonic bring to the Southbank Centre and the Barbican for an unprecedented shared residency between London&apos;s busiest and most competitive classical music venues. Rattle is on record saying that the Royal Festival Hall&apos;s acoustics are so bad they make performers who play in it &quot;lose the will to live&quot;. That was before the Southbank&apos;s refurbishment in 2007, and he&apos;s changed his mind now \u2013 sort of. &quot;Look, neither the Festival Hall nor the Barbican give you the kind of acoustical treat you get when you go to the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam,&quot; he says. &quot;But there you are. They&apos;re perfectly good halls, and frankly they&apos;ve both really worked to make their places as good as they can be.&quot; Mahler&apos;s Third Symphony is the climax of the stint at the Southbank, which also hosts a concert of ensemble music by Schubert and Arnold Schoenberg, while the Barbican gets Mahler&apos;s Fourth Symphony and that invigorating Haydn and Schubert programme. Mahler is on the conductor&apos;s mind as he relaxes at his home, a miniature art-deco castle in the south-west of Berlin. It&apos;s an eccentric architectural fantasy that Rattle and his wife, Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1, have made their own with a cornucopia of Czech carpentry. &quot;It was astonishing for us to be playing Mahler&apos;s Third in Berlin at the time the revolution in Egypt was going on,&quot; Rattle says. &quot;This is a very politically aware orchestra \u2013 they really know what&apos;s going on, [are] discussing these things all the time. Mahler&apos;s own idea of the gigantic first movement in the symphony connects with all this. He talks about the music being about the rabble, the mass, fighting against the thing that will not be moved. In the big central section of the movement, you have a huge march. For Mahler, this is the march of the seasons, but it&apos;s also about the mass against this immovable object,&quot; \u2013 Rattle sings a few bars of this monumental counter-theme \u2013 &quot;which the rabble finally does manage to move.&quot; The parallel could hardly be more apposite with the revolution in Cairo against the implacable but finally vanquished reign of Hosni Mubarak. Rattle tells me about a young Egyptian who used to lead the Berlin Philharmonic&apos;s basses and who, by chance, returned to Berlin last week. &quot;He is not even 30 and so had never known anything but Mubarak. He told me: &apos;This time, we won.&apos;&quot; And Rattle sees an even deeper resonance with events in Egypt for his orchestra. &quot;One of the most moving things I read this week was a blogger writing that the Egyptians have &apos;seized their own narrative&apos;. I think for musicians in an orchestra that&apos;s terribly important \u2013 that you seize the same narrative together, wherever it happens to go. You have the feeling that the Egyptian people are really riding in some common direction, whatever difficulties lie in their way. For musicians, that&apos;s not a bad thing to remember.&quot; Rattle says that right now, more than at any other time in the nine years he&apos;s been in the job, he and the Philharmonie&apos;s musicians are &quot;finding a way to move together&quot;. I ask him whether that means he&apos;s found a way of controlling the orchestra, famously the most virtuosic and impassioned but wilful and individualistic in the world. &quot;Controlling them? No. In the very best sense of the word, they are not controllable. It&apos;s not about foisting something upon them, but rather guiding, encouraging, shaping what they do. What you have to do is find a way in which everybody has their input in a shared vision.&quot; With typical modesty, Rattle says he&apos;s learned more from the players than they have from him since 2002. &quot;Now, there&apos;s that sense of really knowing each other well, so a lot of things can be left unsaid, in Mahler especially.&quot; In other words, Rattle feels he&apos;s getting towards the holy grail for all conductors, where there&apos;s a direct line between what his hands do and the sound the orchestra makes, without any verbal explanation required. British audiences won&apos;t only see Rattle with the Berlin Philharmonic in the next few months. He&apos;ll conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in March, then the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in June. The CBSO is where Rattle made his name in the 80s and 90s, and he still\u00a0says that it&apos;s &quot;my orchestra, just like\u00a0the Berlin Philharmonic is still Karajan&apos;s orchestra&quot;. He describes the difference as a comparison between &quot;my fantastic sauvignon blanc&quot; in the Birmingham orchestra and the &quot;fantastic red wine&quot; in Berlin. Now, as wonderful as sauvignon blanc is, I prefer red wine. And at this point, I indulge in some musical fantasy roleplay. If I were in Rattle&apos;s position, the prospect of working with another orchestra \u2013 any other orchestra \u2013 would almost inevitably lead to disappointment. The unique power and passion of the Berlin Philharmonic is an orchestral narcotic (which is why, if you haven&apos;t heard them perform live yet, you should do all you can to get a ticket for these concerts). Surely Rattle must be addicted to the Berlin Philharmonic sound? &quot;You can&apos;t not be. You just cannot not be! And sometimes it just takes me by surprise. Yesterday morning we did Stravinsky&apos;s Apollo [part of the London programmes], and the sound, the sound . . . &quot; Rattle&apos;s voice trails off in a sigh, a reverie of remembrance of the Berlin Philharmonic strings. He hauls himself back into the room. &quot;Look, this is something very special. But one of the advantages for me, when I go to other orchestras, is that they know I conduct the Berlin Philharmonic every day \u2013 and they are damn well sure that they are going to make a bloody wonderful sound to show how good they are.&quot; Incomprehensible in German Rattle has made his debuts with two orchestras over the last few months, in the shape of the Bavarian Radio Symphony and the Metropolitan Opera in New York \u2013 both great ensembles from whom he says he learned &quot;all kinds of wonderful things&quot;. Will the same be true when he comes back to the London Symphony Orchestra? &quot;For me, it will be a journey of discovery. Of course, I&apos;ve heard them a few times in the last years. For me, it&apos;s just a big pleasure and it&apos;s about time I did it again.&quot; Audiences around the world need to\u00a0take advantage of Rattle&apos;s guest appearances, fast. &quot;Next year our eldest son, Jonas, goes to school, so I&apos;ll be able to do much less that&apos;s not in Berlin. Either Magdalena or I will have to be at home \u2013 it&apos;s as simple as that.&quot; And Berlin really is home for Rattle. &quot;You know, if you leave Britain, it&apos;s amazing how fast you lose touch if you&apos;re not there, in the rough and tumble of life in the UK.&quot; He is as rooted personally as he is musically in\u00a0Berlin. &quot;The orchestra is irreplaceable. In so many ways, it&apos;s my\u00a0ideal.&quot; Linguistically, though, Rattle still has a way to go. &quot;Jonas said to me with this devastating honesty the other day: &apos;Dad, you know what&apos;s funny when you speak in German? You know exactly what you&apos;re saying, but no one else does!&apos;&apos;&apos; Just as well it&apos;s non-verbal communication that&apos;s Rattle&apos;s real forte. \u2022 Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic play four concerts at the Southbank Centre and Barbican Centre, London, from Saturday to 23 February.

That might seem an odd question, since we&apos;re living through something of a golden age in this country. In London, the London Symphony are at the top of their game, the Philharmonia and the London Philharmonic are thriving; while the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester sound as good as anyone on their day. But there&apos;s something missing in our orchestral culture, at least according to many musicians based in Europe: a vital spark of intensity and engagement. British orchestras have an unimpeach-able reputation for speed and accuracy. Talking to Simon Rattle ahead of his London residency with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, he told me that one of the principal players in Berlin had a stint as a section leader at one of London&apos;s orchestras. He was amazed at the brilliance of the British musicians in the first rehearsal of a complex piece by Bart\u00f3k. The technical standard was much better than it would have been at the Berlin Phil at a first rehearsal. The problem was, the final concert wasn&apos;t any more exciting than that first run-through. That&apos;s the exact opposite of what happens in Berlin, or Vienna with their Philharmonic, or Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw. With those great European orchestras, there&apos;s a journey. You would be shocked if you heard these bands when they rehearse a piece for the first time: they are much less together than their British counterparts. The payoff is, though, that the concerts of the Vienna Phil or\u00a0the Concertgebouw often have an expressive intensity that British orchestras rarely manage. It&apos;s a different way of thinking about what performance is. The goal in Berlin or Munich is to get to a place where the music is in the bones of the players; in Britain, the problem is getting further into the music than playing all of the notes in the right order. As the Association of British Orchestras convenes for their annual conference this week, the challenge for our orchestras is to turn that unrivalled reputation for technique and speed into the x-factor of the thrill of performance. Get that right, and there&apos;s no reason why our concerts shouldn&apos;t be as seat-of-the-pants exciting as the Berlin Philharmonic.", "sentences": ["That&apos;s the exact opposite of what happens in Berlin, or Vienna with their Philharmonic, or Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw."], "title": "Tom Service on the difference between British and European orchestras", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/16/critics-notebook-tom-service", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-19T00:04:03Z", "article": "Amsterdam is the perfect weekend break right now, with\u00a0a major Picasso\u00a0exhibition starting at\u00a0the Van\u00a0Gogh Museum this\u00a0weekend (vangoghmuseum.nl), and the new Canal Museum (herengracht386.com) opening 1 April.

After turning 21, the airline stopped sponsoring my tickets, but I did not stop travelling at every chance I got. Luckily, I infected my girlfriend Sanne with the travel bug\u00a0too. In 2008, Sanne (by then my wife) and I decided to quit our jobs to embark on a new mission in life: convincing people it is so much more fulfilling to experience destinations like a local, instead of going from one tourist highlight to another. We started travel blog network Spotted by Locals. One of the things we were certain of from the start: we wanted to meet all our bloggers in their own city, in their all-time favourite local spot. Of course we wanted to make sure they are really locals who are passionate about their city, but maybe an even more important reason was that it would be our perfect life to travel all around Europe, meet locals and experience real local tips all the time. My favourite travel experience started a few months after we launched our website. In April 2008, we packed up our old but trustworthy Opel Astra, and hit the road for a six-month trip across Europe. We travelled for 12,000 miles to meet hundreds of locals in 23 cities during what seemed to us like the longest and sunniest summer we had ever experienced. Our first meeting in our first stop, Antwerp, was a nightmare: we met a smelly, drunk guy who did not really remember why he signed up to become a Spotter in the first place. We now knew we had made a wise decision to meet all potential Spotters in person, but did not really know how\u00a0in the world we would find people in all these cities in Europe we were going to visit.     Bart and Sanne in Amsterdam.    Luckily, after we launched our first blog (Amsterdam), we were overwhelmed by applications via email. We were fortunate enough to be able to make a selection of people we wanted to meet in their favourite spots. We experienced more local culture in those six months then we had on all our city trips combined. In Ljubljana, locals recommended we should buy a bottle of wine and some snacks at the market, and have a picnic at &quot;The Beach&quot; \u2013 nothing more than a few steps down to the river. Many of the people having their picnics there were surprised to see tourists join them. An hour later, we heard some jazz tunes. A local band had started to play music on a floating stage a few hundred metres down river. It was a magic night. In Zagreb, our Spotter-to-be, Krunoslav, suggested we should go to his favourite place to eat meat. He wrote down a few of the best dishes on a piece of paper. After walking around in circles for half an hour, we decided to walk into what looked to us like a local football club canteen, to ask for directions to Bistro MZ. The canteen turned out to be Bistro MZ. When we showed the waiter the note Krunoslav had written, he went to his colleague and started laughing out loud. They had never seen a tourist here, and certainly not tourists who ordered things that were not even on the menu! We ate the most wonderful and unhealthy dishes (sausages with cheese, steaks with lard \u2026), and had a lot of fun with the waiters and customers. Two years later, when we were in Zagreb again, we drove straight to Bistro MZ!

The tricky match is against the Netherlands on Tuesday, the straightforward one against India in a week&apos;s time. This may seem like more nonsense, but there is some logic here. To ensure qualification to the quarter\u2011finals, England really need to beat the Netherlands because defeating the lowly teams is all that is required to progress in this tournament; it does not matter too much what happens against India \u2013 who beat Bangladesh in the opening game. This strange state of affairs is one of the less desirable consequences of the ICC&apos;s chosen\u00a0format. England arrived in Nagpur with confidence enhanced by a resounding victory over Pakistan in their final &quot;friendly&quot; in Dhaka, on Friday. There have been a few late swerves, but they now have a very firm idea of their best 12. There has been a fair amount of agonising over the opening combination: since the last World Cup, England have used 21 pairs. Two wicket-keeping openers have been ditched in the past six weeks. After their two practice matches in Bangladesh, there is still some concern about the opening batsmen, but this dwells more on the form of Andrew Strauss than the presence of Kevin Pietersen alongside him. The decision to promote Pietersen is a good one. He appeared to be stagnating in the middle order and, in the sub-continent especially, it is vital to have the most destructive batsman in the team at or near the top of the order. Here the new ball rarely darts around deviously. Often it is easier to hit the new hard ball than the old soft one. Pietersen may well respond to the fresh challenge \u2013 as he once did for England\u00a0A in Bengalooru in 2004, when he hit 131 as an opener. It is a good gamble. Pietersen may collect the odd first-baller, which will test the resolve of the others down the order, but he may also fire off a couple of match-winning innings. That could be enough. World Cups are rarely won by being cagey. There is one other dilemma to resolve. We expect Luke Wright and James Tredwell to have quiet tournaments unless there is a flurry of injuries. Ajmal Shahzad stands by as cover for the pacemen. But the think-tank must choose between two very contrasting cricketers, Michael Yardy and Ravi Bopara, when selecting the best 11. Yardy squeezes every last drop from his limited pool of talent. This is what makes him such an admirable cricketer. Bopara oozes class, which he sometimes seems to squander. With Graeme Swann returning, should England prefer Yardy as a support spinner who can bat or Bopara as a gifted middle-order batsman who can bowl? The prevailing conditions will affect their decision, but, on most surfaces, Bopara, who was thrust into the squad after Eoin Morgan&apos;s withdrawal, may have more to offer. It is not difficult to underestimate Yardy&apos;s bowling, which has been fashioned by the advent of Twenty20. In the shortest form of the game he has been remarkably successful, concocting a system that results in his low-slung spinners yielding about six or seven runs per over on a good day. That is brilliant in a 20-over match, but not in a 50-over contest. Sub-continental batsmen will not be too worried by Yardy. Certainly Strauss will be delighted to welcome back Swann to bring some potential bite to those middle overs. It may be that England will pick Yardy against the non-sub-continentals, in which case he might get a game against the Netherlands, whose players come from most parts of the globe (OK, Amsterdam, so does the England side). Most of the England team will not need reminding they lost to the Netherlands the last time these sides met, in the opening match of the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup at Lord&apos;s. But the longer the game, the less likely there is to be an upset. There are some familiar names among the Dutch team. Ryan ten Doeschate has excelled for Essex in limited-over cricket; Alexei Kervezee enjoyed a fine season for Worcestershire last summer; Tom Cooper has just played for South Australia in the Big Bash final and has represented Australia Under-19s. He once carted West Indies for 160 not out for the Australian Prime Minister&apos;s XI, so we can expect a bit of magic from him along the way. Pietersen may be pleased there is no longer Dirk Nannes tearing in with the new ball. But England should prevail in Nagpur, just as we expect the other minnows, Kenya, Canada, Ireland and\u00a0\u2013 despite their recent renaissance\u00a0\u2013 Zimbabwe to be beaten by the big boys. It would be more fun if that was not the\u00a0case.", "sentences": ["It may be that England will pick Yardy against the non-sub-continentals, in which case he might get a game against the Netherlands, whose players come from most parts of the globe (OK, Amsterdam, so does the England side)."], "title": "Kevin Pietersen gamble worth taking as England seek flying start | Vic Marks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/19/england-cricket-world-cup-kevin-pietersen", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Cricket World Cup 2011", "Kevin Pietersen", "Andrew Strauss", "Graeme Swann", "Cricket", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-02-20T00:04:00Z", "article": "My first thought, on meeting Niall Ferguson, is that he looks too smart to be an academic. It&apos;s a Wednesday afternoon, and the Philippe Roman chair in history and international affairs is sitting in his shoebox-shaped office in the Ideas centre at the London School of Economics. Though the setting is hardly glamorous, Ferguson is dressed in the informal-but-smart get-up of a movie executive or hedge-fund manager: suave blue suit, pressed white shirt, gleaming Chelsea boots. His skin is ruddy and his hair is coiffed. Somehow it seems improbable that he has spent the day supervising seminars or reading dissertations. He begins by asking me to wait a few moments. &quot;I&apos;m afraid I have to write a cheque,&quot; he says, reaching for his fountain pen. &quot;One of life&apos;s more tedious burdens.&quot; I stifle an urge to lean over his shoulder and try to catch a glimpse of the number he is etching. Ferguson, one suspects, is used to writing big cheques. To describe Ferguson as an academic is, of course, to fail to do justice to his lofty position within the intellectual firmament. For he really is, as the LSE website puts it, &quot;one of the world&apos;s most eminent scholars&quot;. Though perhaps less instantly recognisable than his two main TV historian rivals, David Starkey and Simon Schama, he eclipses both when it comes to scholarly heft and sheer productivity. At 46, he is the author of an astounding number of highly acclaimed, and mostly very fat, books, works such as The World&apos;s Banker, The War of the World and The Ascent of Money. (He can&apos;t be accused of choosing low-key titles.) His last book, High Financier, was a biography of the banker Siegmund Warburg. Apart from his current one-year posting at the LSE, he is the Laurence A Tisch professor of history at Harvard, the William Ziegler professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, and a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford. He has presented numerous television series, served as an adviser to John McCain and written reams of journalism (currently he is a columnist for Newsweek). He gets up at six every morning and says that he doesn&apos;t have hobbies: he just works. Whatever you make of the man and his views it is hard not to be impressed by his\u00a0dedication. Ferguson&apos;s latest book, published next month, is called Civilization: The West and the Rest (the accompanying six-part Channel 4 series starts on 6 March). Coming just eight months after the Warburg biography, it&apos;s a book that belongs at the more populist end of the Ferguson oeuvre. In fact, he says, he wrote it largely with his children in mind. (He has three, two sons and a daughter, ranging from 11 to 17.) &quot;The book is partly designed so a 17-year-old boy or girl will get a lot of history in a very digestible way, and be able to relate to it,&quot; says Ferguson, who, along with the many other irons he has in the fire, is advising his friend Michael Gove, Britain&apos;s education secretary, on how to redraft the history curriculum. &quot;I have a sense that my son and daughter&apos;s generation is not well served by the way they are taught history. They don&apos;t have the big picture. They get given these chunks, usually about Adolf Hitler, so I wanted to write a book that would be really accessible to them.&quot; Civilization sets out to answer a question that Ferguson identifies as the &quot;most interesting&quot; facing historians of the modern era: &quot;Why, beginning around 1500, did a few small polities on the western end of the Eurasian landmass come to dominate the rest of the world?&quot; In other words, the book attempts to explain the roots of something \u2013 western power \u2013 that has long fascinated its author. Although Ferguson&apos;s background is as a financial historian \u2013 his research at Oxford and then Cambridge in the late 80s and early 90s was into German hyperinflation and the history of bond markets \u2013 he has, over the past decade or so, drifted increasingly into writing about empire. In two consecutive books, Empire and Colossus \u2013 published, not by accident, around the time of the Iraq invasion \u2013 he charted the respective imperial histories of Britain and America, concluding not only that Britain should be prouder of its colonial past, but that the world would be a better place if America imitated Victorian Britain and became a fully fledged liberal empire. Though both books were bestsellers and won Ferguson scores of new admirers, especially in the US, they also, not surprisingly, drew heavy criticism from the left. Civilization, too, starts from the premise that western dominance has been a good thing. In order to explain how it came about, Ferguson deploys an unexpectedly cutting-edge metaphor. The west&apos;s ascendancy, he argues, is based on six attributes that he labels its &quot;killer apps&quot;: competition, science, democracy, medicine, consumerism and the work ethic. Each chapter of the book (and each episode of the TV series) sets out to explore how it was that western nations possessed one of these &quot;apps&quot;, while other nations failed to acquire it. So, in the chapter on competition, he shows how the political structure of western Europe in the early modern era encouraged rivalry both between and within states, while the monolithic rule of the Ming dynasty led China to rest on its laurels. Likewise, in the medicine chapter, he argues that the civilising goals of western European empires produced pioneering medical advances that ultimately benefited the whole world. Ferguson is clearly more than a little in love with his &quot;killer apps&quot; conceit, as well as his &quot;west versus the rest&quot; dichotomy, which he slips into conversation at every available opportunity. (In the TV series, he even starts talking at one point about &quot;westerners&quot; and &quot;resterners&quot;.) Doesn&apos;t he worry that this kind of thing detracts from his standing as a serious historian? &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;Apart from anything else, this terminology is absolutely ubiquitous. And I think it captures something quite important. We actually had a good argument when I first came up with the killer apps concept. Not everyone at Channel 4 liked it. But I just thought it was an absolutely great idea. You explain this book to any group of people and what usually happens is there&apos;s a competition to see if I&apos;ve missed something out. People love it. It&apos;s like a game: play Civilization Killer App! It&apos;s designed to be slightly annoying, so that you talk about it.&quot; Ferguson is not, it seems, a man given to self-doubt. When I suggest that his views have changed somewhat in the past decade \u2013 one moment he was calling on America to establish an empire, now he talks in terms of the west&apos;s &quot;civilisational software&quot; being &quot;downloaded&quot; by other countries \u2013 he replies: &quot;I&apos;m not sure my position has changed so much as the circumstances.&quot; In what comes across as a well-rehearsed spiel, he proceeds to explain why his thought has developed logically across his last six books, and why, on every occasion, his arguments have been prescient. (In the case of the financial crisis, this self-congratulatory impulse is fair enough: he noted that America was seriously over-extended as early as 2004.) Ferguson&apos;s self-confidence \u2013 which, if it wasn&apos;t accompanied by considerable charm, might be downright insufferable \u2013 is no doubt partly a matter of temperament. But it also has something to do with the kind of historian he is. His approach to the past is overwhelmingly materialistic. Questions of right and wrong, or indeed of personality and psychology, don&apos;t appear to preoccupy him greatly. What gets him going is hard data, facts and figures \u2013 the stuff, in other words, that is most measurable (and, by extension, provable). No doubt this outlook has a lot to do with his grounding in economic history. Yet his materialism goes beyond this, almost to the point, oddly, of seeming Marxian. &quot;Something that&apos;s seldom appreciated about me,&quot; he declares, &quot;is that I am in sympathy with a great deal of what Marx wrote, except that I&apos;m on the side of the\u00a0bourgeoisie.&quot; When it comes to thinking about empire, Ferguson&apos;s preoccupation with material forces allows him to undertake what amounts to a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the good that imperial regimes have done against the bad without being unduly bothered by the kind of moral questions that traditionally concern the left. (Does one country have a right to invade another? Does colonialism leave a psychological scar that makes it hard for previously occupied countries to progress?) He is able to remain relatively sanguine about the less than glorious aspects of, say, Britain&apos;s occupation of India, or French rule in west Africa, because he always seeks to ask what the alternatives might have been. (As a rule, he thinks they would have been far worse.) &quot;The moral simplification urge is an extraordinarily powerful one, especially in this country, where imperial guilt can lead to self-flagellation,&quot; he explains. &quot;And it leads to very simplistic judgments. The rulers of western Africa prior to the European empires were not running some kind of scout camp. They were engaged in the slave trade. They showed zero sign of developing the country&apos;s economic resources. Did Senegal ultimately benefit from French rule? Yes, it&apos;s clear. And the counterfactual idea that somehow the indigenous rulers would have been more successful in economic development doesn&apos;t have any credibility at all.&quot; As many of his critics have noted, Ferguson&apos;s emergence as an advocate of empire coincided with the rise of neoconservatism in the US and the drive to displace Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. (In the run-up to the war, Ferguson was a vocal supporter of invasion.) Although he became critical of US policy once the occupation took place, and now distances himself from the neocons, he remains unrepentant about his pro-war stance, arguing that the real problem was that the invasion was &quot;botched&quot; because of the Bush administration&apos;s failure to commit sufficient manpower and resources to it. (&quot;The problem I constantly wrote about then was that if you invade and overthrow the bad guy, hold elections and then piss off, it doesn&apos;t work.&quot;) Nor does he rule out supporting similar campaigns in future. &quot;It&apos;s all very well for us to sit here in the west with our high incomes and cushy lives, and say it&apos;s immoral to violate the sovereignty of another state. But if the effect of that is to bring people in that country economic and political freedom, to raise their standard of living, to increase their life expectancy, then don&apos;t rule it out.&quot; Ferguson, who describes himself as a &quot;classic Scottish enlightenment liberal&quot;, clearly enjoys provoking the left, which he does with a relish that at times borders on callousness. At one point he remarks: &quot;I think it&apos;s hard to make the case, which implicitly the left makes, that somehow the world would have been better off if the Europeans had stayed home. It certainly doesn&apos;t work for north America, that&apos;s for sure. I mean, I&apos;m sure the Apache and the Navajo had all sorts of admirable traits. In the absence of literacy we don&apos;t know what they were because they didn&apos;t write them down. We do know they killed a hell of a lot of bison. But had they been left to their own devices, I don&apos;t think we&apos;d have anything remotely resembling the civilisation we&apos;ve had in north America.&quot; Yet when our conversation moves to more personal matters, all traces of lofty detachment disappear. In the past couple of years, Ferguson&apos;s professional interest in civilisations and the relations between them has intersected intriguingly with his private life, thanks to his relationship with the dedicatee of Civilization, who is identified in the book only as &quot;Ayaan&quot;. In his preface, Ferguson writes that she &quot;understands better than anyone I know what Western civilisation really means \u2013 and what it still has to offer the world&quot;. &quot;Ayaan&quot; is Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Somali-born writer, activist and former Dutch MP who has emerged as one of the west&apos;s most strident critics of Islam, especially its treatment of women. Ferguson met her in May 2009, at Time magazine&apos;s annual &quot;100 most influential people in the world&quot; party. (Both Ferguson and Hirsi Ali have previously appeared on this list, in 2004 and 2005 respectively.) They embarked on their relationship a few months later, shortly after his separation from his wife of 16 years, Sue Douglas, a former editor of the Sunday Express. Their affair soon prompted a storm of gossip and the publication of several muck-raking articles. Ferguson&apos;s relationship with Hirsi Ali is further complicated by the fact that she lives under constant police protection. In 2004, she wrote the script for the short film Submission, which attacked Islam&apos;s subjugation of women and contained shots of a woman&apos;s naked body inscribed with verses from the Qur&apos;an. The film&apos;s director, Theo van Gogh, was assassinated by an Islamic extremist in Amsterdam soon after its release; pinned to his body was a letter calling for a jihad against Hirsi Ali. Being forced into hiding certainly hasn&apos;t made her any less outspoken. In 2006, she told a German magazine that Islam is &quot;not compatible with the liberal society that has resulted from the\u00a0Enlightenment.&quot; As soon as he starts talking about Hirsi Ali, Ferguson&apos;s demeanour changes. His voice becomes softer, infused with feeling. Suddenly, he is no longer the super-confident scholar; he seems almost humble. &quot;Ayaan comes from a completely different civilisation,&quot; he says, explaining what he meant by saying she knows what western civilisation &quot;really means&quot;. &quot;She grew up in the Muslim world, was born in Somalia, spent time in Saudi Arabia, was a fundamentalist as a teenager. Her journey from the world of her childhood and family to where she is today is an odyssey that&apos;s extremely hard for you or I to imagine. To see and hear how she understands western philosophy, how she understands the great thinkers of the Enlightenment, of the 19th-century liberal era, is a great privilege, because she sees it with a clarity and freshness of perspective that&apos;s really hard for us to match. So much of liberalism in its classical sense is taken for granted in the west today and even disrespected. We take freedom for granted, and because of this we don&apos;t understand how incredibly vulnerable it is.&quot; In talking of liberalism in its &quot;classic&quot; sense, Ferguson is perhaps pointedly drawing a distinction between the liberalism espoused by Hirsi Ali (and himself) and that of certain left-leaning liberals \u2013 notably Timothy Garton Ash and Ian Buruma \u2013 who have been critical of her anti-Islamic stance. The French philosopher Pascal Bruckner depicted their attitude as the &quot;racism of the anti-racists&quot;. Does Ferguson agree? &quot;I think Ayaan&apos;s critics \u2013 Ian Buruma in particular \u2013 were more guilty of sexism than racism,&quot; he says. &quot;But certainly they underestimate her intellectual rigour at their peril. She&apos;s just smarter than they are, as well as having a great deal more courage. I mean, there aren&apos;t many people who really put their life on the line for human freedom. And I think when you come across someone like that you&apos;ve got to be a little bit respectful. It just sticks in my throat a bit to have middle-aged men who&apos;ve had cushy lives turning up their noses at someone who has gone through what she&apos;s gone through. There&apos;s a particular role you&apos;re supposed to play as an oppressed woman... you&apos;re supposed to smile and look pretty and not say too much.&quot; I ask whether Ferguson has been surprised by the reaction their relationship provoked, the gossipy articles and so forth. His tone changes again and he suddenly sounds angry. &quot;I was nauseated. Just nauseated. It makes me quite ashamed to be part of a culture that regards the private life of a professor as something that should be in the paper. It&apos;s just so tawdry. The British press has an insatiable appetite for making public things that should be private. It&apos;s a prurience that I&apos;ve never understood. I don&apos;t give a monkey&apos;s about the so-called celebrities that they write about. But the idea that my private life should be the subject of articles I find deeply, deeply infuriating. Because there&apos;s absolutely no way to control or resist that process unless you&apos;re very rich, which I&apos;m not. They of course claim I am by massively magnifying my income.&quot; (Various articles put Ferguson&apos;s annual earnings at $5m, a figure he labels &quot;ridiculous&quot;.) Ferguson has long been somewhat ambivalent about Britain \u2013 he quit his Oxford professorship in 2002 to teach in America. He seems invigorated by the prospect of returning there, which he plans to do as soon as the current academic year ends. Near the end of our conversation, he talks of how, growing up in Glasgow, where there &quot;wasn&apos;t a lot to do except football and drinking&quot;, he immersed himself in American culture. &quot;I read Steinbeck, Fitzgerald, Kerouac. And I listened to American music. I remember once after school going to see Woody Allen&apos;s Manhattan and thinking: I want to be there. And as soon as I arrived in New York, I just felt at home.&quot; In Britain, by contrast, he says that &quot;the abuse of the freedom of the press has now reached the point... where it&apos;s no longer tolerable&quot;. He decreasingly feels at home here and says he &quot;really only took this job so I could see more of my kids&quot;. It&apos;s a damning verdict from a man who clearly has a huge love of British history, and who acknowledges that he owes much to the country, not least his education. But there&apos;s a final twist to the tale. One thing he &quot;hasn&apos;t missed at all about England&quot;, he says, is the experience of being &quot;condescended to&quot; by public school boys. &quot;I have a very negative relationship to the aristocracy. And having them out my life is on balance a benefit.&quot; So it&apos;s something of an oddity (and yet typical of a man who clearly enjoys being contradictory) that the one thing Ferguson says gives him hope for Britain&apos;s future is David Cameron&apos;s government \u2013 made up overwhelmingly of public school boys. Killer &apos;apps&apos;: the ideas that propelled the west to world domination 1.Competition: In the 15th century, China was the most advanced civilisation in the world, while Europe was a backwater. But then things changed and by the late 18th century Adam Smith could observe that China had been &quot;long stationary&quot;. What happened? Ferguson argues that Europe&apos;s fragmented political structure led to competition and encouraged Europeans to seek opportunities in distant lands. The increasingly insular China, by contrast,\u00a0stagnated. 2. Science: The 16th and 17th centuries were the age of science, with an extraordinary number of breakthroughs occurring. This revolution was, Ferguson writes, &quot;by any scientific measure, wholly European&quot;. In the Muslim world, clericism curtailed the spread of knowledge, while in Europe, aided by the printing press, the scope of scholarship dramatically widened. Ultimately, breakthroughs in science led to improvements in weaponry, further cementing the west&apos;s advantage. 3. Property: Why did the empire established by the English in north America in the 17th century ultimately prove so much more successful than that established by the Spanish in south America a century earlier? It was, Ferguson contends, because the English settlers brought with them a particular conception of widely distributed property rights and democracy, inherited from John Locke. This proved a far better recipe for success than the Spanish model of concentrated wealth and authoritarianism. 4. Modern science: According to Ferguson, modern medicine was the west&apos;s &quot;most remarkable killer application&quot;. Western medical advances in the 19th and 20th centuries increased life expectancies across the world, including in the colonies. The French in particular, largely thanks to a lofty conception of their imperial mission, brought significant improvements to public health in western Africa, developing effective vaccinations for diseases such as smallpox and yellow fever. 5. Consumption: The west&apos;s dominance of the rest of the world was not only achieved by force; it was also, as Ferguson shows, achieved through the market. The industrial revolution in 18th and 19th century Britain created a model of consumerist society that has proved irresistible, as shown, for example, by the way that the western style of dressing has swept the globe. Yet there&apos;s a paradox: how was it that an economic system designed to offer infinite choice has ended up homogenising humanity? 6. Work ethic: As Max Weber noted a century ago, Protestantism was a form of Christianity that encouraged hard work (and just as importantly, Ferguson adds, reading and saving). It isn&apos;t a coincidence, he says, that the decline of religion in Europe has led to Europeans becoming the &quot;idlers of the world&quot; (while the more religious US has remained hard-working). Interestingly, Ferguson also argues that China&apos;s embrace of hard work is partly because of the spread there of Protestantism.

Taxes. England making fools of themselves at the World Cup. These have been life&apos;s certainties over the last 15 years. And England really have gone the extra mile in the name of sporting comedy. We&apos;ve had 1960s tactics in 1996 and 1980s tactics in 2007. We&apos;ve had crimes against net run-rate in 1999; and fun and games with Duckworth/Lewis in 2003*. We&apos;ve had the buffoon and the pedalo. We&apos;ve had the panic and even the vomit.\u00a0We thought it was going to be different this time, that Andy Flower had created the first three-dimensional England cricket team, capable of competing in all forms of the game. Then old habits started to resurface: end-of-tour fatigue, witless batting against mediocre spin, a 6-1 defeat, an ostensibly mishandled injury to a star player (Eoin, where art thou?) and a panicky 11th-hour team change. Kevin Pietersen will today open the batting for the first time, in his 111th ODI.\u00a0Normally, as a result of all that, you&apos;d think: we&apos;re doomed, it&apos;s over, England are going out in the group stages and Adrian Chiles is going to take over the entire known universe. But one of life&apos;s near-as-dammit certainties is the excellence, possibly genius, of Andy Flower, so we&apos;ll not be writing England off just yet**.\u00a0* In truth, 2003 doesn&apos;t deserve to be bracketed with 1996, 1999 and 2007; although England went out in the group stages, they played some decent cricket in very difficult circumstances.\u00a0** theguardian.com/sport reserves the right to  rewrite this preamble, it&apos;s not like anyone will ever be able to prove it  alter that view should England flirt with humiliation today before stumbling to a scruffy victory, as they frequently do against the minnows at the World Cup  Peter Borren has won the toss and the Netherlands will bat first. His accent isn&apos;t quite in Austin Powers territory; he&apos;s from Christchurch. In fact, only 11 of the 22 players in action today were born in England or the Netherlands. Eight were born in South Africa.  Team news Graeme Swann is fit and plays, with Michael Yardy dropping out. That means England will have to fiddle 10 overs from Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara and Jonathan Trott. Most folk seem to think England should have picked a fifth bowler, but then they said that before the Ashes as well. In Flower We Trust (Until England Stumble To A Four-Wicket Win, At Least). England Strauss (c), Pietersen, Trott, Bell, Collingwood, Bopara, Prior (wk), Bresnan, Swann, Broad, Anderson Netherlands Kervezee, Barresi (wk), Cooper, ten Doeschate, Zuiderent, de Grooth, Borren (c), Bukhari, Seelaar, Loots, Westdijk.  What do you think of Kevin Pietersen opening? It seems obvious to me that Ian Bell should open and KP should bat at No4 to milk and mangle the spinners, but what do I know? Exactly.  Bumble and Booth breathe life into match departmentthe_topspin Lawrence Booth  Just shook hands with @Bumblecricket on a 100 rupee wager: he reckons the Dutch won&apos;t make 150. I reckon they will...  I never thought I&apos;d type this, but I&apos;m with Booth.  1st over: Netherlands 7-0 (Kervezee 1, Barresi 6) Jimmy Anderson bowls the first ball to the talented Alexei Kervezee, who may well be playing for England in future World Cups. He flicks a single off the pads and then Walter Barresi flicks a poor delivery to fine leg for four with the aid of a misfield on the boundary from Tim Bresnan. &quot;Surely Ravi is the right pick (from the options they have in the 15),&quot; says Tim Woollias. &quot;The way we lose this is a weak batting performance. Clearly, Ravi doesn&apos;t guarantee no collapse, but you would rather have him coming in than Yardy at 60 for five.&quot; I agree. Collingwood was a revelation with the ball in Australia, and I think that, on these pitches, it&apos;s a legitimate gamble to have him as the fifth bowler.  2nd over: Netherlands 12-0 (Kervezee 6, Barresi 6) Stuart Broad, sporting a very manly buzzcut, has been promoted to open the bowling in an ODI for the first time in 11 months. He was superb in the warm-ups, taking back-to-back five-fors I think, but his fifth delivery is on the pads and Kervezee flicks it extravagantly to fine leg for four. &quot;I stopped watching the Australia ODIs,&quot; says Lori McConnachie. &quot;Has Collingwood found his form?&quot; Goodness knows. I was OBOing them, but that doesn&apos;t mean I was watching them. He bowled well, I remember that.  3rd over: Netherlands 17-0 (Kervezee 11, Barresi 6) I missed much of that over as I was sorting out some technical things, but Kervezee clunked the penultimate delivery from Anderson over mid-on for four. The slips have gone already, and early impressions are that Bumble is going to lose some rupees today.  4th over: Netherlands 17-0 (Kervezee 11, Barresi 6) Kervezee ducks under consecutive bouncers from Broad, part of a superb maiden. Broad should be the pick of England&apos;s seamers in this tournament; he takes a lot of wickets in ODI cricket and has the variety needed in these conditions. &quot;Is the cameraman on a mission to show a close-up of every member of the &apos;crowd&apos; today?&quot; says Phil Russell. &quot;Looks a bit sparse in there. Probably not helped by the fact that the Barmy Army will be broke by now after 3 months in Australia. I don&apos;t know whether there is an Orange Army equivalent for the Dutch. Maybe they are waiting for the knockout phase?&quot;  5th over: Netherlands 21-0 (Kervezee 13, Barresi 8) Jimmy Anderson is replaced by Tim Bresnan. He has a half shout for LBW against Kervezee second ball, but that was surely going down. A few singles continue the Netherlands&apos; decent start. &quot;Nothing wrong with trying Pietersen as an opener,&quot; says Chris Wright. &quot;What IS wrong is not having bothered to try it out until the opening match of a World Cup. If only we&apos;d had seven recent ODIs against decent opposition to try a few things, eh?&quot;  6th over: Netherlands 34-0 (Kervezee 14, Barresi 20) Barresi, backing away, slices a big shot at Broad just over Prior and away for four. It was pretty close to Prior but it raced off the edge. Broad&apos;s got the battle fever on, particularly when Barresi uppercuts the next ball for four more. He then makes it three boundaries from five balls, carting a square drive to the fence. Broad&apos;s on one now. Here&apos;s Andy Bull, who has managed to drag himself away from Twitter to send an email. &quot;Only just touched down in Delhi and I already have the a slight twinge of fear on England&apos;s behalf. It&apos;s just a natural state of mind when it comes to the cricket World Cup, isn&apos;t it? Fortunately for me, the hotel TV is showing highlights of Eng v India from the 1992 world cup on the other station, so I can always flick over and watch the Judge smearing Kapil Dev to all parts. As you say, anyone hungry for more of this kind of nonsense in the next few weeks can follow me on twitter. PS: look out for the Aussie ringer batting at No3 for the Dutch.&quot; Talking of the Judge, this is a wonderful video.  WICKET! Netherlands 36-1 (Kervezee c Prior b Bresnan 16) That&apos;s the first wicket of England&apos;s  World Cup-winning  campaign. Kervezee makes room, Bresnan follows him, and the ball loops gently off the glove towards Matt Prior as Kervezee tries to pull.  7th over: Netherlands 41-1 (Barresi 20, Cooper 1) The new batsman is Tom Cooper, who has an ODI average of 65 \u2013 albeit almost exclusively from games against the Associate countries. He touches his first ball to fine leg for four and is then rammed in the shoulder by a beautiful, straight bouncer from Bresnan. &quot;Overall I like the look of this side much better than one with Yardy in it,&quot; says Chris Wright. &quot;Is Yardy that much better a bowler than Collingwood in ODIs?&quot; I&apos;m not sure anybody really knows. But I do think England need a proper batsman at No7, so I like the balance of this side too.  8th over: Netherlands 46-1 (Barresi 24, Cooper 6) Broad follows a couple of slower balls with a brutal bouncer that Cooper fends desperately to leg. He has bowled really well to Kervezee and Cooper, but Barresi is slapping him everywhere and edges four more to third man. Broad has bowled six balls to Barresi, and four of them have gone for four. &quot;Have you seen this?&quot; says Andy Bradshaw. Oh my word, that looks like a very special video. For a second, as I looked out of the corner of the eye, I thought it was Victor Kiam teaching cricket.  9th over: Netherlands 47-1 (Barresi 24, Cooper 7) A decent over from Bresnan costs just a single. &quot;Re: the Walsh/Bishop assault on the Judge,&quot; says Sam Blackledge. &quot;They don&apos;t make &apos;em like that anymore.&quot; In 1993, he described that spell as the favourite passage of his career. I think they broke his jaw and his finger. What a man. Tony Soprano would have liked Robin Smith.  10th over: Netherlands 47-1 (Barresi 24, Cooper 7) Broad continues. England are now using their best batsman and their best bowler in the first 10 overs of each innings \u2013 but both Pietersen and Broad have been ripped from their natural position. They may be guilty of compromising a strength to cover a potential weakness. Broad bowls another excellent maiden to Cooper. So he&apos;s gone for 16 from 6 balls against Barresi and 7 from 24 against the rest. Insert your own Ilford 2nd XI joke here. &quot;Zimbabwe, Canada and Kenya have all been polished off easily so far,&quot; says Daniel Seppings. &quot;England come along and make the Netherlands look like they&apos;re playing a unique brand of Total Cricket. I&apos;m already gripped by the fear.&quot; England usually make hard work of the minnows. They even did it against Ireland at the World Twenty20 before thrashing all the big boys. I like to think of it as an affectation rather than an indication of incompetence. I like to think a lot of things.  11th over: Netherlands 57-1 (Barresi 29, Cooper 12) Barresi, driving, edges Bresnan to third man for four. A helluva lot of runs have gone to third man and fine leg; that&apos;s the Netherlands&apos; V at the moment, and Cooper gets four more in that area with a whirling pull round the corner when Bresnan drops short. It looks like dinner will be on Booth tonight. &quot;I think your footnote might be the first time in years I&apos;ve read some sympathy for the 2003 side,&quot; says Lee Rodwell. &quot;Even at the time I remember them being largely derided as failures when, if it wasn&apos;t for the forfeited Zimbabwe match, they surely would have made the semi-finals (Kenya of all nations effectively took their place). That&apos;s without taking into account the pressure on Nasser Hussain in particular who was being forced into making a political decision that the ECB and UK government were sprinting away from. Sure, they choked against the Australians when they had qualification in their grasp, but they weren&apos;t the first, last or best team of that era to do that.&quot; And they were the only team who got in a position to choke against Australia in that tournament. I wouldn&apos;t really call it a choke anyway. They were Bevaned; no shame in that.  WICKET! Netherlands 58-2 (Barresi st Prior b Swann 29) Eleven years after his ODI debut, Graeme Swann strikes with his fourth ball in a World Cup. It was a beautiful arm ball that drew Barresi forward defensively, and when his back foot slid out of the crease Matt Prior had the bails off in a flash. It was pretty tight but just out: Barresi&apos;s foot was on rather than behind the line when the bails were dislodged. &quot;Lazy batting&quot; says Nasser Hussain in the commentary box, but it was also a lovely piece of bowling.  12th over: Netherlands 58-2 (Cooper 13, ten Doeschate 0) That&apos;s the 977th time Swann has taken a wicket in his first over. He had a muted Ashes series \u2013 he took one for the team, really \u2013 but he should be a joy to watch in this World Cup. The new batsman is Ryan ten Doeschate, whose ODI average is 68. Somebody, as Bull pointed out the other day, is going to get ten Doeschated in this World Cup; there&apos;s no reason why it can&apos;t be England today. &quot;Given extensive experience on iPhone Stick Cricket,&quot; begins James Morgan, &quot;I can confirm that Yardy is the worst bowler in the world.&quot; And Prosper Utseya is the best, or at least he was in 2005.  13th over: Netherlands 59-2 (Cooper 14, ten Doeschate 0) Paul Collingwood replaces Tim Bresnan. He actually has a terrible ODI record with the ball in Asia \u2013 12 wickets at 61, economy rate of 5.33 \u2013 but you would expect him to bowl well on these sluggish pitches and his first over costs just one. &quot;Has anyone noticed that Andy Flower doesn&apos;t exactly have a good record against the Dutch?&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;When England lost to them in 2009, he singularly failed to utter the words &apos;Do I not like that?&apos; and forgot to complain to the third umpire that &apos;Your mate just cost me my job&apos;. Has the man no understanding of English sporting traditions?&quot; And the England fans didn&apos;t punch everything that moved either. What sort of patriotism is this?  14th over: Netherlands 60-2 (Cooper 16, ten Doeschate 0) Swann continues to flight the ball challengingly, almost goading the batsmen, jabbing them in the chest and saying, &apos;Come on then, hit this down the ground&apos;. For now they decline, with just a single from the over. &quot;I have noted that four players from each side today were born in South Africa,&quot; says Rocket. &quot;Is this a record for a match not involving South Africa?&quot; Not sure, just let me run through every single cricket match ever. But yep, we mentioned this earlier: eight of today&apos;s players were born in SA, seven in England, four in Holland and three, er, somewhere else.  15th over: Netherlands 65-2 (Cooper 16, ten Doeschate 4) ten Doeschate gets off the mark from his 12th ball, walking across and tickling Collingwood right off middle stump for four. Had he missed that he would have been stone dead. &quot;No disrespect to the &apos;minnows&apos;,&quot; begins Phil Withall, and you know where this email is going, &quot;but surely having the likes of Holland, Kenya and Zimbabwe in this thing is like putting a Scottish team in the Champions League. Entertaining but pointless. Still worth staying up on a humid Brisbane night for, just about.&quot; I don&apos;t think their presence is pointless; far from it. I just think the schedule is wrong.  16th over: Netherlands 70-2 (Cooper 19, ten Doeschate 6) That&apos;s better from the Netherlands, with Cooper and ten Doeschate milking Swann for five singles. &quot;With the boring middle overs having started very early, here is a World Cup memory. IVA Richards&apos; other 180-plus score in an ODI. The straight sixes he hits in this are extraordinary. IVA should have got the first ever double hundred in an ODI in this game. Sri Lanka may still have been a minnow in 87 but still an incredible innings.&quot; Ah, Viv. Just look at this walk to the wicket. Guns n Roses never sounded so good.  17th over: Netherlands 79-2 (Cooper 22, ten Doeschate 12) That&apos;s a delightful shot from ten Doeschate, a back-foot drive for four off Collingwood that pierces the cover ring. Nine from the over. Emails please!  18th over: Netherlands 82-2 (Cooper 25, ten Doeschate 12) We&apos;re into the Boring Middle Overs. If you have to get any work done today, now&apos;s probably the time. Two singles from Swann&apos;s over; he has typically splendid figures of 4-0-10-1. &quot;God I sounded like a stuck up prick,&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;So sorry about that. It is the farce of a schedule NOT the teams I was trying to draw attention to. I shall hide away until Norwich play Doncaster in the morning. Sorry ... &quot; No apologies necessary.  19th over: Netherlands 88-2 (Cooper 27, ten Doeschate 16) Jimmy Anderson is back on, presumably to see if the scuffed-up ball will reverse (England have been throwing the ball into the ground at every opportunity). The camera cuts to a member of the Barmy Army, who immediately stands up and starts clapping upon realising he&apos;s on TV. Why do folk do that? I would cover my face, or at least point into the distance and shout OVER THERE in the hope the camera would go away. Bell thuds a return into the dirt and it bounces over Prior&apos;s head for an overthrow. Six from the over, all in ones and twos. I am going to type that last sentence a lot over these next six weeks. These games are more formulaic than a married couple&apos;s sex life. &quot;What formation are the Netherlands playing?&quot; asks Alex Netherton. Total cricket.  20th over: Netherlands 90-2 (Cooper 28, ten Doeschate 17) Two singles from the over. I&apos;ll be typing that last sentence, etc, etc. The Viv Richards link in the 16th over should be fixed now.  21st over: Netherlands 94-2 (Cooper 30, ten Doeschate 19) Four singles from Anderson&apos;s over. What else is there to say? &quot;Is it too late to big up Wes Barresi&apos;s DJing?&quot; says Mark Reeves. &quot;He D.J.&apos;s under the name Richard Stylex, his music podcasts are definitely worth a Google. He has quite eclectic musical tastes as befits an Italian who was raised in Cape Town and lives in Amsterdam.&quot; The Joy of Six: cricketer/DJs. Michael Carberry once said he DJs for Kanye West. I still don&apos;t know whether this was a wind-up or not. Great story, that.  22nd over: Netherlands 96-2 (Cooper 31, ten Doeschate 20) This is masterful stuff from Swann, who is bowling as much with wickets in mind as economy. Figures of 6-0-14-1 represent the best of both worlds. &quot;So both teams have a lot of Saffers in their sides,&quot; says Ken Danbury. &quot;They can&apos;t both choke though, can they?&quot; Two runs needed for victory off the final ball, and the last man is stumped off a wide?  23rd over: Netherlands 101-2 (Cooper 34, ten Doeschate 22) These two are milking Anderson with very little risk. He has, as Sean Ingle points out, a shocking record in ODIs in India; mind you, six months ago he had a shocking record in Tests in Australia. He looks just a touch flat today, though. In other news, this is such a disgraceful joke from Andrew Thomas that I can&apos;t not publish it. &quot;Did you hear about the Dutch vet who was called out by an idiot to fix his television? He was asked to &apos;tend &apos;er SCART, uh?&apos;&quot; Out. Get out. I&apos;ll open the door for you.  24th over: Netherlands 109-2 (Cooper 41, ten Doeschate 23) This is an interesting move: Kevin Pietersen is coming on to bowl. The second ball is short and cut for four by Cooper. I don&apos;t mind leaving Yardy out, but England are in dangerous territory if they want to rely on Pietersen, as he is far too expensive. Maybe Yardy could come in for Anderson in some games? But then you have Collingwood or Swann first change.  25th over: Netherlands 119-2 (Cooper 42, ten Doeschate 32) Collingwood replaces Anderson, and ten Doeschate lifts his first ball high over midwicket for a one-bouncer four. This guy is a dangerous customer, and there is a lot more to him than brute force, as he shows by steering the fourth ball gracefully wide of Bell at short third man and away for four. That was a delightful stroke. &quot;Am I the only person with a irrepressible urge to shout RYAN TEN DOESCHATE to the tune of Firestarter by The Prodigy?&quot; says Tom Hooper, possibly knowing the answer deep down. &quot;Seeing as they&apos;re from Braintree and he plays for Essex it makes perfect sense when you think abo-MAKE ME STOP PLEASE!&quot;  26th over: Netherlands 130-2 (Cooper 44, ten Doeschate 41) ten Doeschate smashes a disgusting full toss from Pietersen over midwicket for the first six of the match, and then slices a cut past short third man for three. Pietersen doesn&apos;t bowl a lot in ODIs, and you can see why, as the risk is just too great. He calls Yuvraj Singh a pie-chucker but these aren&apos;t even pies. They&apos;re not even cupcakes. I don&apos;t know what they are, but I wouldn&apos;t put them in my mouth. &quot;I think the theory of KP opening (rather than Bell) may be that KP might rise to the challenge of taking on Lee or Steyn, but when faced with Yuvraj he tends to lose concentration?&quot; says Indy Neogy. &quot;Not sure it matters though, so far England aren&apos;t bowling well compared with other games against minnows...&quot; Yeah, there&apos;s something in that. After all, he marmalised Steyn at the World T20. But then 20-over cricket allows you to bat with a liberty that 50-over cricket does not. And you&apos;d have to fear England getting bogged down in the middle overs if he is not still at the crease.  27th over: Netherlands 132-2 (Cooper 45, ten Doeschate 42) This partnership \u2013 between two men who have ODI averages in the 60s, lest we forget \u2013 has moved into the 70s, but that was a decent over from Collingwood. Just two from it. &quot;I like to think my English is pretty good and I get puns, but I totally do not get the one about the Dutch vet in the 23rd over,&quot; says Henk van Maanen. &quot;I&apos;ve read it all ways possible; nothing. Can you explain?&quot; Crikey. ow long have you got? Do you know what a scart lead is?  28th over: Netherlands 136-2 (Cooper 47, ten Doeschate 43) Tim Bresnan replaces Kevin Pietersen, presumably with one eye on reverse swing. There&apos;s no sign of that, but he does have Cooper dropped by Pietersen. He swatted Bresnan to fine leg, where Pietersen just failed to hang on to a diving one-handed chance almost at ground level as the ball died on him It would have been a stunning catch, not dissimilar to that James Kirtley effort to dismiss Sourav Ganguly at Lord&apos;s in 2002, so no real blame is attached to Pietersen. Plenty of blame should be attached to Tom Hooper (28th over), however, for inadvertently starting the saddest riff ever. Normally when folk detail their inadequacies on the OBO, I smile knowingly and think &apos;No way am I sharing my own version of that particular form of tragic behaviour&apos;. But this time I can safely say I have never stooped so low. &quot;I don&apos;t know about the Ryan ten Doeschate song,&quot; says Mike McCarthy, &quot;but whenever I click on the blue line on the bottom of the screen I want to sing &apos;Sharif don&apos;t like it\u2026LOCK THE TASKBAR. LOCK THE TASKBAR&apos;.&quot; Ladies, form an orderly one.  WICKET! Netherlands 136-3 (Cooper c Anderson b Collingwood 47) Oh that&apos;s lame. Cooper chips an off-cutter from Collingwood straight to midwicket, a disappointing end to a decent innings of 47 from 73 balls.  29th over: Netherlands 137-3 (ten Doeschate 43, Zuiderent 1) The new batsman is Bas Zuiderent, who played against England at the World Cup in 1996. Look at some of the names on that teamsheet. &quot;Someone I know once met Anderson, and asked if he preferred being called Jimmy or James,&quot; says Daniel Harris. &quot;After about ten minutes of trying to get a word out, he said he wasn&apos;t sure \u2013 he actually doesn&apos;t even know what his own name is.&quot; Shyness is nice/and shyness can stop you/from knowing your own name.  30th over: Netherlands 142-3 (ten Doeschate 45, Zuiderent 1) Bresnan continues. A Sky graphic shows that not a single delivery of his so far would have hit the stumps. That approach never did Glenn McGrath much harm. And indeed McGrath got many LBWs despite that \u2013 remember Nasser Hussain at Edgbaston in 2001 \u2013 and Bresnan has a big LBW appeal against ten Doeschate from the last ball. It reverse swung nicely and hit the pad a fraction before the bat, but ten Doeschate was outside the line. And Hawkeye shows it was missing off stump. &quot;Whenever I see the drink Disaronno,&quot; begins William Hardy, &quot;I sing it to the tune of &apos;Shoot the Runner&apos; by Kasabian. It even annoys me so goodness knows how everyone else feels about it.&quot; We&apos;re elated.  31st over: Netherlands 147-3 (ten Doeschate 50, Zuiderent 1) Oh what a farce. ten Doeschate slogs the returning Swann miles in the air, back over the bowler&apos;s head, and Anderson and Pietersen \u2013 running round from mid off and mid on \u2013 both leave it to each other. The ball plops gently into the ground, and Swann gives them both a seriously evil look. There&apos;s no bromance with Jimmy right now! That was a shocking cock up, very unlike this England side. Two balls later, ten Doeschate gets to an excellent 50, from 59 balls. He is a dangerous man to reprieve. &quot;Remember Andre van Troost?&quot; says Sam Blackledge. &quot;Was that his name? What a dude.&quot; Fantastic. Bobby Beamer, sending them down at 90mph-plus. The maverick&apos;s maverick.  32nd over: Netherlands 148-3 (ten Doeschate 51, Zuiderent 1) Bresnan cuts Zuiderent in half with a lovely delivery and goes up for a catch down the leg side. It&apos;s turned down, so England go for the review. There was certainly a noise, but replays show it hit only the pad so Zuiderent survives. Still, a fine over from Bresnan \u2013 just one from it. think Mike McCarthy must have been a regular listener to Adam and Joe&apos;s radio show, as that featured prominently in their feature about changing lyrics in songs to fit what you are doing,&quot; says Tom Stobbs. &quot;My other favourite from that is singing Holloway Road to the tune of Holiday Road by Lindsey Buckingham from the first two National Lampoon&apos;s films. And &apos;Halal, is it meat you&apos;re looking for?&apos; to the tune of Hello by Lionel Richie.&quot;  WICKET! Netherlands 149-4 (Zuiderent c Collingwood b Swann 1) Zuiderent v Swann is a complete mismatch. After failing to get a few off the square, Zuiderent jumps across his crease and lobs feebly to some bloke with a beard at short midwicket.  33rd over: Netherlands 149-4 (ten Doeschate 52, de Grooth 0) Swann had been majestic today. He has 8-0-20-2, and really it should be 8-0-18-3. &quot;I can&apos;t believe Collingwood&apos;s beard has gone unnoticed,&quot; says Shankar Kalyanaraman. &quot;He reminds me of Alec Guinness in one of his many incarnations from Kind Hearts and Coronets.&quot; Poor old Colly, forever doing his work in the shadows. He could go out there in hot pants and a string vest and people would still barely notice him.  34th over: Netherlands 152-4 (ten Doeschate 55, de Grooth 0) Another tight over from Bresnan, who has been good today, costs three. &quot;Really like the list of articles on van Troost&apos;s Cricinfo page,&quot; says Matt Emerson.    * van Troost quits as Netherlands CEO (Feb 26, 2009) * van Troost outlines vision for Dutch cricket (Dec 23, 2008)   I&apos;ve not bothered reading them, but I guess his &apos;vision&apos; wasn&apos;t quite what Dutch cricket was looking for...&quot; You&apos;ve not bothered reading them? That&apos;s lazy citizen journalism.  35th over: Netherlands 162-4 (ten Doeschate 62, de Grooth 3) Another delicious slider from Swann beats ten Doeschate on the outside, bringing an unsuccessful stumping appeal. As Mike Atherton always says, the joy of Swann is that he can beat the edge on both sides. He is a master, a pleasure to watch when he is bowling like this. de Grooth premeditates a lap sweep for three to get off the mark, and then ten Doeschate plays a wonderful stroke, dancing down the wicket to lift Swann over midwicket for six. What a beautiful shot! &quot;I would like to congratulate England on taking such a principled stand on keeping the Associates in the World Cup\u2026\u2026..&quot; says Andrew Gladwin before his finger jammed on the dot button.  36th over: Netherlands 166-4 (ten Doeschate 63, de Grooth 6) Here comes England&apos;s enforcer, Stuart Broad. He drives de Grooth onto the back foot with some straight short stuff, and there are four from the over. Netherlands should get around 250, but that won&apos;t worry England. Yet. &quot;Re the Booth-Bumble wager, I&apos;ve just looked up how much 100 rupees is worth,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;I&apos;ll bet Booth 50p he&apos;s too insecure about his opinions to bet a decent amount of money to back them up.&quot; Millings, I bet you \u00a37,500,000,000,000,000 you will embarrass yourself socially today.  37th over: Netherlands 171-4 (ten Doeschate 64, de Grooth 10) Clever stuff from de Grooth, who reverse laps Swann for four. Swann ends with figures of 10-0-35-2. He was superb. Meanwhile, here&apos;s an appeal from Emma John, occasionally of this parish. &quot;Do you know any good confessional blogs by guys?&quot; she writes, carefully using the word &apos;good&apos; and thus ruling out the OBO. &quot;Could be a sex blog, could be about addiction, could be about anything personal \u2013 could be just something where someone shares the everyday story of their life, but it needs to be male, it needs to be current and needs to be British...&quot; If you know of any, send the link in and I&apos;ll forward them on.  38th over: Netherlands 179-4 (ten Doeschate 65, de Grooth 17) de Grooth gloves an attempted hook short of Prior. Broad is England&apos;s short, short man in ODI cricket, especially in the later overs, and de Grooth pulls first two and then lap-pulls a boundary. When does a pull become a hook? It&apos;s one of life&apos;s big questions. Shoulder height? Nose height? &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a huge problem that Pietersen is opening for the first time in an ODI today,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;The group stage of a World Cup should be a relatively safe place to get his eye in; plus, if they&apos;d had him open in Australia, and he&apos;d failed on entirely different pitches than he&apos;ll be seeing here, the pressure would have been on (perhaps from KP himself) to drop him back down the order, and what would have been achieved then? Without Eoin, England have to do something to give themselves an edge. And if they fail to win the thing? Business as usual. Hold on, I&apos;ve tried to make a reasoned point about the cricket. I don&apos;t feel so good.&quot;  39th over: Netherlands 186-4 (ten Doeschate 65, de Grooth 23) Paul Collingwood (6-0-28-1) is back. He needs to bowl at least two more overs to complete the fifth-bowler quota. de Grooth, meanwhile, is playing a busy, mischievous and flexiwristed cameo, and he premeditates a Dilscoop over short fine leg for four. He has 23 from 20 balls. &quot;For ten Doeschate songs, I&apos;ve now moved from the Firestarter option to the first line of Blur&apos;s Tender (they&apos;re from Essex too so that makes it OK),&quot; says Louise Wright. &quot;Not sure it&apos;s an improvement, but it&apos;s a change at least and I might be able to turn it into a whole song rather than just muttering &apos;ten Doeschate&apos; a lot. Which might please my officemates.&quot;  40th over: Netherlands 188-4 (ten Doeschate 67, de Grooth 24) Jimmy Anderson, whose last ODI wicket in India came five years ago. He thought the drought had ended when Prior, standing up to the stumps, appealed for a catch down the leg side to dismiss ten Doeschate, but replays showed it flicked only the pad. He then has an LBW appeal turned down. It was just shaving leg, so had England reviewed it the original decision would have stood. Two from the over. &quot;I think Emma may have misjudged the make-up of the OBO readership,&quot; begins Tom Adam, &quot;if she thinks anyone on here is authoring a hot confessional sex blog.&quot; Arf. Thanks for all/both the links by the way. Keep sending them over and I&apos;ll forward on between innings and then after the match.  41st over: Netherlands 199-4 (ten Doeschate 77, de Grooth 25) England are being ten Doeschated. He drags Collingwood&apos;s second ball mightily over midwicket for his third six, a wonderful stroke. A few ones and twos \u2013 including a mix up between Bell and Broad that reflects an unusually sloppy performance \u2013 make it 11 from the over. Here&apos;s Alex Coe. &quot;Technically, a pull becomes a hook when (a) you try the line about &apos;Come Dine With Me Down Under&apos; and she belts you or (b) she tells you her rates. Apparently.&quot;  42nd over: Netherlands 209-4 (ten Doeschate 84, de Grooth 28) I&apos;m still a bit confuddled at the sight of Prior standing up to Anderson. Has this happened before? Anyway, ten Doeschate thumps a blistering pull stroke for four. This has been such a classy innings: perfectly paced (84 from 91) and with a lovely mix of the deft and the brutal. &quot;One of life&apos;s complex questions it may be Rob, but also one with a straightforward answer,&quot; says Nagarjun K. &quot;A pull becomes a hook if, at the point of impact with the bat, the ball is above the batsman&apos;s eyeline.&quot; What if he can do that freaky little trick with the eyes and life one above the other? Oh never mind.  WICKET! Netherlands 213-5 (de Grooth b Broad 28) The Netherlands have taken the batting Powerplay; England counter by bringing their Powerplay expert, Stuart Broad, back into the attack. There&apos;s a long delay while the sightscreen is adjusted. It was stuck on an advert for Wethers Original or some such. When play finally resumes \u2013 if you&apos;ve just woken up, we&apos;re now in March 2013 and Adrian Chiles is the prime minister \u2013 Broad strikes with the first ball, an immaculate yorker that bangs into middle stump as de Grooth makes room. Brilliant bowling.  43rd over: Netherlands 214-5 (ten Doeschate 87, Borren 1) That was a very accomplished over from Broad, full of changes of pace and length and line and scowl. The boy who went for six sixes has matured into an extremely good death bowler. &quot;Is it just me,&quot; says Brough Cooper, &quot;or can I hear the crowd singing Madonna&apos;s &apos;Get into De Grooth&apos;?&quot;  44th over: Netherlands 225-5 (ten Doeschate 96, Borren 3) This is just stunning batting from ten Doeschate. He pulls Bresnan&apos;s slower bouncer round the corner for four to move into the nineties and then screams the next ball through mid-off for four more. Eleven from the over, and ten Doeschate has 96 from 96 balls. &quot;Your comment about Bresnan made me think,&quot; says Tom Baird. &quot;Hawkeye has done most bowlers a favour by making LBW decisions more likely. In the light of that is it necessarily a good thing for young bowlers to try to emulate Glenn McGrath&apos;s style? Broad and Finn spring to mind - they are often exhorted to bowl like him by commentators. I&apos;m not suggesting McGrath was anything but great, just that the style he used might not worked so well now.&quot; That&apos;s interesting. We talk a lot about Hawkeye giving spinners more LBWs, but nobody has really mentioned how it has helped seamers, if it has at all. If anything, I&apos;d say Hawkeye often shows that fast bowlers&apos; deliveries are bouncing over when it looked a good LBW shout live. But that&apos;s just a first thought, and we know all about the value of those.  45th over: Netherlands 239-5 (ten Doeschate 108, Borren 4) Ryan ten Doeschate reaches his century with a five! He was on 98 when he turned Broad to short fine leg, and the throw ricocheted off the stumps before flying to the boundary. He has faced 98 balls, hitting seven fours and three sixes; it&apos;s been an awesome innings, worthy of any batsman in the world. A punishing over continues when he smashes a pull for four. &quot;Man he&apos;s powerful!&quot; says Mike Atherton on commentary. Fourteen from the over. It&apos;s not squeaky-bum time yet, but England are \u2013 as they usually do against the minnows in the World Cup \u2013 at least flirting with humiliation.  46th over: Netherlands 253-5 (ten Doeschate 117, Borren 8) An expensive and eventful over starts when Anderson is no-balled for a high full-toss to ten Doeschate. England have been sloppy today. He then has an LBW shout when a yorker hits Borren on the toe before going onto the bat. England go for the review. It looked outside the line. In fact, it came flush off the bat. Oh dear. &quot;Terrible waste of a review,&quot; says Beefy. A shocking over continues when Anderson spears another high full toss down the leg side for four no-balls. As it&apos;s his second of the over he should be taken out of the attack, unless the rules have changed. Nobody is sure in the commentary box.  47th over: Netherlands 259-5 (ten Doeschate 119, Borren 12) Borren is dropped by Trott at short fine leg. He played a premeditated sweep at Bresnan and Trott, diving goalkeeper-style to his left, couldn&apos;t hang on. It was a very difficult chance. More importantly for England, that was a boundaryless over from Bresnan - just six from it. &quot;Here&apos;s my typically-gloomy-England-fan prediction: ten Doeschate will take this game away from us,&quot; says Ravi Nair. &quot;He will subsequently be out in single figures in all the remaining games so we won&apos;t even be able to say that the Dutch team was actually really really good. We will get knocked out in the group stage. I&apos;m sorry but this bowling performance, perhaps Swann apart, just seems to be dire.&quot; Ssssh. Stiff upper lip man!  48th over: Netherlands 274-5 (ten Doeschate 119, Borren 25) ten Doeschate is struggling with either cramp or a calf injury, but the runs continue to flow as Borren hits Anderson for three consecutive boundaries: a steer wide of short third man, a slap over short third man and a disdainful swipe back over the bowler&apos;s head. Fifteen from the over, and 60 from the last five overs. Madon. &quot;Flirting with humiliation?&quot; sniffs Philip Lamb. &quot;They&apos;ve moved in with us and bought a dog.&quot; A little chow?  WICKET! Netherlands 274-6 (ten Doeschate c Bopara b Broad 119) Ryan ten Doeschate&apos;s marvellous innings comes to an end when he cuffs a slower ball from Broad high to deep square leg. That was a glorious performance, 119 from 110 balls with nine fours and three sixes. Let&apos;s hope he&apos;s suffering from cramp rather than a calf injury  49th over: Netherlands 286-6 (Borren 32, Bukhari 3) You may not have thought this possible, but England&apos;s performance just got even more shambolic. Broad cleaned Borren up with an excellent yorker; Borren walked off but then, having reached the boundary edge, was told to turn back when one of the umpires pointed out that they were only three fielders inside the circle. Broad hoofed the turf in disgust. &quot;Schoolboy mistakes&quot; fumes Beefy in the Sky box. It was Collingwood of all people, who didn&apos;t run into the circle on time. That&apos;s diabolical. England are having a shocker.  50th over: Netherlands 292-6 (Borren 35, Bukhari 6) This is now one of the great World Cup fiascos. Borren top-edges a swipe to third man, where Swann spills the most routine of chances. He barely got hands on it! Anderson runs in for the next ball, but then has to stop because \u2013 again \u2013 there aren&apos;t four men in the circle. They haven&apos;t got a clue what&apos;s going on. I&apos;d be surprised if half of them even know their own names right now. The Netherlands end with 292 for six, an outstanding effort, and England need 293 to win. See you in half an hour. &quot;Forget arguing if we should have picked four bowlers or five,&quot; says Simon L. &quot;One would have been nice.&quot;  INNINGS BREAK You&apos;ve got to laugh.  The good news is that the Netherlands didn&apos;t reach 300. The bad news is that next up England face India, who may reach 3000.  England have only chased this many to win an ODI on three occasions. One was last summer, another in their last World Cup match in 2007.  Things to plug between innings 1. Twitter&apos;s Andy Bull.2. Twitter&apos;s Rob Smyth.3. Amazon&apos;s OBO.4. A night with Marcus Trescothick.  1st over: England 12-0 (target 293; Strauss 12, Pietersen 0) Mudhassar Bukhari, who looks a little like Rob Key actually, will open the bowling. It&apos;s a lively opening over. The first and fourth deliveries beat Strauss, while the second, third and sixth go to the boundary: two tucked off the pads, the other inside-edged wide of the keeper. &quot;There is no way that England win 80% of the time here,&quot; says Andrew, and he&apos;s right: they win 90 per cent of the time. But it&apos;s the 10 per cent that I&apos;m really interested in. Come on the Oranje!  2nd over: England 17-0 (target 293; Strauss 12, Pietersen 5) The debutant Berend Westdijk starts with a swinging half-volley that Pietersen creams through extra cover for four. He misses a preposterous waft at the third delivery and then scrunches a Red Bull single to mid off from the final delivery. &quot;Holland&apos;s best bowler Mark Jonkman is currently banned for a suspect action, I spoke to Pete Borren a couple of days ago and he said that it&apos;s unlikely he would be able to bowl today due to a side strain, and Ryan ten Doeschate appears to have done his calf,&quot; says Mark Reeves. &quot;So that&apos;s Oranje&apos;s three best bowlers out of commission; despite everything England should still won comfortably.&quot; And Dirk Nannes is Australian again.  3rd over: England 22-0 (target 293; Strauss 13, Pietersen 9) The pitch is still a belter, so provided England don&apos;t suffer another attack of being England at a World Cup, they should win comfortably. Should. They have started assertively against some errant bowling, and Pietersen flicks Bukhari off the pads for two in an over that brings five. &quot;Such is the generous nature of the format in this tournament,&quot; begins Ian Copestake, &quot;that two defeats are almost a guarantee that you are through to the next round, and essentially won the tournament three weeks ago.&quot;  4th over: England 32-0 (target 293; Strauss 13, Pietersen 19) I wonder if they are showing this game in De Hems, the Dutch bar in Soho. For the football World Cup final the place was already full a few hours before kick off, and this is a slightly bigger game than that. As on that July night, the Dutch are facing defeat: Pietersen whips Westdijk contemptuously through midwicket for four and then clatters another boundary more through the covers. He&apos;s playing very nicely. &quot;According to Cricinfo, Alexei Kervezee is aspiring to play for England,&quot; notes Scott Collier. &quot;After today&apos;s performance, I wonder whether it is time that promising young English batsmen started aspiring to play for the Netherlands.&quot;  5th over: England 34-0 (target 293; Strauss 14, Pietersen 20) &quot;Thank you to the OBO faithful,&quot; says Emma John. &quot;I especially like the suggestion that I google &apos;Rentboy Diaries&apos;; I can only hope that in this liberal workplace my computer will not immediately alert security and have me disciplined.&quot;  6th over: England 38-0 (target 293; Strauss 14, Pietersen 24) Westdijk digs in a pitiful short ball and Pietersen mauls it over midwicket for four off the front foot. He is playing with lordly disdain; it&apos;s thrilling to watch. &quot;I love a massive over-reaction to a bit of dross as much as the next man, but perhaps we&apos;re getting a bit carried away with England bowling like a Cornwall Third side,&quot; says Mike McCarthy. &quot;They&apos;ll probably make this run chase. As has been pointed out, they played awfully against Ireland in the World T20 last year and won it. Spain lost against Switzerland. If anything, you should start out playing rubbish. Sucks everyone into a false sense of security.&quot;  7th over: England 44-0 (target 293; Strauss 19, Pietersen 25) Bukhari ruins an otherwise decent over with a lamentable last delivery, short and pulled for four by Strauss. England are cruising. &quot;I&apos;m struggling to be interested in the World Cup,&quot; says Stephen Hathaway. &quot;The ODIs in Oz have drained my interest in the format. The prospect of being interested for six weeks just isn&apos;t appealing... How would you change this laborious behemoth into a nubile sprite of a tournament?&quot; I&apos;d shoot it dead, with a gun, and just have twice-yearly T20 World Cups.  8th over: England 48-0 (target 293; Strauss 19, Pietersen 29) Poor Berend Westdijk. Being fed to Kevin Pietersen is bad enough at the best of times, never mind on debut. Pietersen scorches a straight drive for four more, and Westdijk walks sadly back to his mark, his face betraying embarrassment and impotence. He recovers well, however, with four consecutive dot balls. &quot;What Emma needs to do is notify your Internet Security people beforehand that she&apos;s going to use some dubious websites for work purposes,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;She might have to have a few access restrictions removed for a pre-defined time, but as long as it&apos;s all known, there should be no problem. This is standard practice in well-run organisations.&quot; And there we have our problem.  9th over: England 52-0 (target 293; Strauss 22, Pietersen 30) The medium-pacer Bernard Loots replaces Mudassar Bhukari. A quiet over costs just a couple. &quot;My only issue with Mike McCarthy&apos;s point about false senses of security is that England have been luring the opposition into them pretty much since the first ball in 1975,&quot; says Ant Pease. &quot;At what point does it become an actual sense of security?&quot;  10th over: England 53-0 (target 293; Strauss 22, Pietersen 31) Excellent stuff from Westdijk, who makes it eight consecutive dot balls to Pietersen before conceding a single off the last delivery. So Pietersen continues to monopolise the strike: he has 31 from 43 balls, Strauss 22 from 17. &quot;There&apos;s been much debate on the moving of KP up to opening, but I think a situation like this is custom-made for him,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;He&apos;s playing against an attack that&apos;s of a lesser standard than (even) ours, he&apos;s under pressure to dominate, as we have a big total to chase, and he&apos;ll be wanting to put his marker down to show everyone he&apos;s still the big man of 2005, though hopefully without the same taste in haircuts. I fancy him to get a big score. So, that should see him out trying a reverse switch-hit in the next over.&quot; Of course this situation is made for him. Sadly, this situation bears absolutely no resemblance to those that will decide how far England progress in this tournament. So, whether he makes 174 not out or slogs the next ball up in the air, we should reserve judgement.  11th over: England 63-0 (target 293; Strauss 29, Pietersen 33) Strauss survives a run-out referral after almost running into Pietersen in the process of taking two to deep backward square. He knew he was home. The next ball from Loots is short, wide and cut through the covers for an emphatic boundary. Strauss looks in great touch and has 29 from 21 balls. &quot;KP 31 not out and looking good?&quot; says Jonathan Martin. &quot;He should open for the Test team. that other chap hasn&apos;t done anything for weeks\u2026&quot;  12th over: England 72-0 (target 293; Strauss 37, Pietersen 34) Strauss works consecutive deliveries from Westdijk off the pads for four.  13th over: England 83-0 (target 293; Strauss 42, Pietersen 35) Loots&apos; third over is a pitiful affair that costs 11. The first ball swings down the leg side for five wides; the fifth legitimate delivery is a leg-stump half-volley that Strauss pings to fine leg for four. He now has 42 from 26 balls; Pietersen has 35 from 52.  14th over: England 85-0 (target 293; Strauss 43, Pietersen 36) This should liven the game up one way or another: the Netherlands are bringing on their left-armer spinner Pieter Seelaar. Pietersen walks down the track to the first delivery he faces and misses a whip to leg, with the ball deflecting off the pad. &quot;Being a frivolous outsider,&quot; begins Rene Kita promisingly, &quot;I pick players at semi-random to follow. So far, Ravi Bopara has proved a marvellous target for excess paranoia disposal. Just look at his List A bowling stats for 2010: 36 wickets at 19.38, but he gets just 8 overs in 6 games for Essex (2 for 31) and 10 overs in 4 ODIs (4 for 38). I know this is just my ignorance at play, but why doesn&apos;t he get to chuck more of his pies? They seem to work well enough.&quot; He&apos;s quite a handy bowler, but no more than that. I suppose his would be the next pies off the plate after Collingwood&apos;s, fractionally ahead of Trott&apos;s.  15th over: England 92-0 (target 293; Strauss 49, Pietersen 37) Ryan ten Doeschate has come on to bowl. He&apos;s still struggling with his leg, which is a big risk because he could put himself out of the tournament. A decent over is tarnished when Strauss plays a storming pull stroke for four off the last delivery. &quot;The point about achieving an actual sense of security,&quot; says Ian Copestake, &quot;is that it confirms that you have become an Australian.&quot; Tell that to Des Clarke.  16th over: England 99-0 (target 293; Strauss 51, Pietersen 39) Strauss works Seelaar to leg to bring up a brilliant half-century, from 34 balls and with nine fours. That&apos;s an admirable rate of scoring against any opposition. Seelaar has a huge shout for LBW against Pietersen, who was hit almost on the half volley, but he was miles down the pitch so there was no way Asad Rauf could give that with a clear conscience. Hawkeye showed it was just clipping leg so, even if Holland had reviewed it, the original decision would have stood. &quot;What are the odds on England not doing the sensible thing,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan, &quot;and taking the batting powerplay whilst these two are well set?&quot; See Ian Copestake&apos;s emails.  17th over: England 100-0 (target 293; Strauss 52, Pietersen 39) ten Doeschate winces through a tight over to Strauss, the last ball of which brings up a cool century partnership from 102 balls. &quot;I would have thought Ravi&apos;s pies would be sooner in line than KP&apos;s, which even Greggs rejected,&quot; says Eamonn Maloney. &quot;But he got a roll today....ROLL! Ha!&quot; Unsubscribe.  WICKET! England 105-1 (Pietersen c Borren b Seelaar 39) Pieter Seelaar joins the list of left-arm spinners who have dismissed Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen checked a pushed drive to short extra cover, where the captain Peter Borren took a nice catch.  18th over: England 105-1 (target 293; Strauss 57, Trott 0) Sean Ingle is going to take over for a little while; you can email him on sean.ingle@theguardian.com  19th over: England 105-1 (target 293; Strauss 59, Trott 1) So after a start as comfortable as Homer Simpson&apos;s favourite easy chair, England have to build again. Meanwhile Lawrence Aggleton writes: &quot;For all the (alleged) pointlessness of the Dutch (Irish/Bangladeshis/Kiwis/English/delete as appropriate) in this competition, it&apos;s still more relevant than some of the teams that play in the Rugby World Cup. In the last one, New Zealand beat Portugal 108-13, Australia beat Japan 91-3 and France beat Namibia 87-10. The mismatches are all the worse there because of the genuine danger involved in contact between professional rugby players and amateurs. While the structure of the Cricket World Cup might need fixing, certainly the &apos;minnows&apos; have relevance being there.&quot; Anyone else?  20th over: England 112-1 (target 293; Strauss 61, Trott 3) Another decent over by Netherland&apos;s slow left armer Pieter Seelaar, who has touch of the Lionel Messi&apos;s about him looks-wise - although he isn&apos;t yet doing outrageous tricks with the ball. Four off the over and England are slightly behind the run-rate - although the bookies have them as 1-10 favourites...  21th over: England 117-1 (target 293; Strauss 66, Trott 3) Strauss continues to steadily accumulate, with five coming from Ten Doeschate&apos;s fourth over (4-0-16-1). &quot;The &apos;minnows&apos; absolutely have every right to be there,&quot; says Sam Blackledge. &quot;Sri Lanka were minnows once. How are they going to learn if you don&apos;t let them play? Ps I am currently on deadline trying to write a newspaper. Luckily I don&apos;t think my editor is an OBO fan.&quot;  22nd over: England 121-1 (target 293; Strauss 68, Trott 5) Like the Guardian&apos;s Soulmates, just singles from that over. Netherlands were 96-2 at this stage, so England currently have a little bit in hand. &quot;Given England&apos;s one-day form, not least in the current game, we&apos;re surely on shaky ground complaining about minnows being allowed to take part in the World Cup?&quot; asks James Brown, not unreasonably.  23rd over: England 126-1 (target 293; Strauss 70, Trott 9) &quot;Ah, the tell-tale signs that Sean Ingle&apos;s on the OBO desk,&quot; sighs Timothy Muller. &quot;A slightly tortuous metaphor, a reference to Leo Messi and a mention of the current odds. What next? A veterinary anecdote from Barry Glendenning?&quot; Fair point, Timothy. But with a spinner on so there&apos;s little time for precision or insight; I&apos;m just trying to find my feet. And all the while I&apos;ve got Joseph O&apos;Neill&apos;s Netherland&apos;s in my head; a book I enjoyed greatly but many of my cricket-loving friends found disappointing. Anyway, I digress: four off the over and England continue to inch towards their target.  24th over: England 131-1 (target 293; Strauss 74, Trott 9) A change in the bowling as - just like that - Tommy Cooper comes on. From the evidence of his first over, he&apos;s tidy but without much of X-factor. &quot;If it&apos;s just crowds and money cricket is after, then there&apos;s a good case for skipping matches against the minnows,&quot; says Emiel de Bont. &quot;If, on the other hand, you want the sport to grow and widen its appeal beyond the ten Test nations, then you should allow the associates to compete at this level every few years. And as Ryan van Doeschate has just demonstrated, they are making serious progress. Alas, not in the bowling today, however, it seems.&quot;  25th over: England 136-1 (target 293; Strauss 76, Trott 11) Ten Doeschate continues, and so do the GCSE Leisure Studies easy ones and twos. England need 157 to win from 25 overs at 6.28. &quot;I&apos;m with you regarding Netherland (book), says James Morgan. &quot;Great read. However my pseudo-intellectual book club didn&apos;t agree.&quot; Is there any other kind of book club?  26th over: England 141-1 (target 293; Strauss 80, Trott 12) As Nasser Hussain and Ravi Shastri are pointing out on commentary, Netherlands aren&apos;t doing enough to stop the cheap singles: Strauss and Trott aren&apos;t risking the flamboyant because there&apos;s no need to. As I write that Trott tries a slog-sweep, but no damage done. &quot; This is a perfect opportunity for Trott to continue showing the form he&apos;s built up recently,&quot; says Sam Hedges. &quot;Play the solid understudy to the flamboyant Strauss. And score lots of runs. I&apos;ve got him as an each-way bet to perform this tournament. Pleeeeease cricket gods, let me beat the bookies for once.&quot; There&apos;s a small chance Sam, but Sehwag has made some start. Anyway, that&apos;s it from me - Rob Smyth will be taking over again. Thanks for your emails.  27th over: England 147-1 (target 293; Strauss 82, Trott 16) Hello.  28th over: England 160-1 (target 293; Strauss 83, Trott 27) Trott plays consecutive reverse-sweeps off the off-spin of Cooper. The first goes for two, the second for four \u2013 the first boundary in 13 overs. Later in the over he cover drives another boundary to make it 13 from the over. &quot;If/When Strauss gets to 89, he will become the highest scorer by an England captain in a World Cup,&quot; statsgurus Paul Frame.  29th over: England 165-1 (target 293; Strauss 88, Trott 28) Tom Cooper has been replaced by Ryan ten Doeschate. Four from the over, and England are cruising. &quot;If Tommy Cooper bags a wicket here, who&apos;s going to disgrace themselves by saying it?&quot; says Ant Pease. &quot;We&apos;ll all be thinking it, but who&apos;ll say it?&quot;  WICKET! England 166-2 (Strauss c Cooper b Bhukari 88) Having lived by the pull, now Andrew Strauss dies by it. He top-edged it towards deep square leg, and Tom Cooper ran in to take a well judged catch as he slid forward. Strauss played a gem of an innings, 88 from 83 balls, although, by getting out on 88, he has jiggered Paul Frame&apos;s chat-up line for tonight.  30th over: England 168-2 (target 293; Trott 30, Bell 1) So, England need 125 from 120 balls. It will be a doddle. Should.  31st over: England 172-2 (target 293; Trott 32, Bell 3) Loots returns to bowl his dobbers, and England settle for four no-risk singles. &quot;You and Paul Frame should hang your heads in shame,&quot; says Tom Adam. &quot;&apos;England are cruising ... If/when Strauss gets to 89 ...&apos; YOU PAIR OF ABSOLUTE PLONKERS.&quot; Simmer down.  32nd over: England 175-2 (target 293; Trott 34, Bell 4) A quiet over from Bukhari. The required rate has sneaked past 6.50 per over, but there&apos;s no real reason for England to worry at this stage.  33rd over: England 180-2 (target 293; Trott 36, Bell 7) This is such boring cricket. Once upon a time 50-over cricket was &apos;hit, giggle and scheme&apos;, but so much of it these days is nurdle, weep and go through the motions. Five from the over, and that means England require 113 from 17 overs.  34th over: England 185-2 (target 293; Trott 37, Bell 11) The left-arm spinner Pieter Seelaar returns to the attack. Apparently his figures are 5-14-22-1, the 14 referring to dot balls. What a load of nonsense. His first over back costs five, again all in ones and twos.  35th over: England 189-2 (target 293; Trott 39, Bell 13) Thirty-four overs have gone, so that means the mandatory bowling change. This is where India often take their batting Powerplay, but they are a proactive side and England are England, so on we go with the low-risk accumulation. That&apos;s fair enough in this particular situation, because England have the match under control, but it would nice to see a bit of flexibility, particularly when they are batting first. Four from the over. &quot;Is &apos;Nurdle, weep and go through the motions,&apos; not also the answer to the question &apos;please could you describe the outcome of an OBOer&apos;s nocturnal dalliances&apos;?&quot; says world-famous competent lover Ant Pease.  36th over: England 197-2 (target 293; Trott 46, Bell 14) Trott makes room to slap a cut stroke for four off Bukhari, and nip any concerns about the required rate in the bud. What a remarkable and fascinating character Trott is. He might be the only person in the history of cricket who has never, not for one second, been bored while batting. &quot;I know the boring middle overs are a problem, but I want to find a way to keep the ODI,&quot; says Tim Woollias. &quot;For the paying punter I find twenty20 too short, and while I have done at least one day at a Test every year for the last twenty, there is sometimes a sense of anti climax, particularly if you go on Day 1, and it finishes 247-3 (as it did at Headingly in 1981). There are times when you want a full day&apos;s cricket and a conclusion.&quot; Let it go, it&apos;s over.  37th over: England 200-2 (target 293; Trott 48, Bell 15) Bell can be a touch becalmed in the middle order at times \u2013 that&apos;s why I&apos;d have him opening \u2013 and a few dot balls in that Loots over mean tht the required rate sneaks above seven an over. England need 93 from 13 overs. &quot;Rob, did you just hear the Aussie commentator on 5Live completely crib your line about death and taxes?&quot; says Rory Dickenson. &quot;Sorry if I&apos;ve missed something....&quot; You mean someone reads this garbage? I had no idea.  38th over: England 207-2 (target 293; Trott 52, Bell 17) Trott survives a muted shout for LBW from a very full Seelaar delivery that was surely sliding down the leg side. Two balls later he reaches yet another half-century, from 58 deliveries and with three fours. The fella is a machine. He averages nearly 60 in his fledgling ODI career \u2013 and that includes a terrible spell of 15 runs in four innings. He is a freak, and I use that word with more man-love than you could ever imagine.  39th over: England 215-2 (target 293; Trott 58, Bell 19) The debutant Berend Westdijk is on for Loots (7-0-41-0). He responded gamely to a bit of bullying from Kevin Pietersen earlier in the day, but his third ball back is too short and Trott drags a well-placed pull to the boundary. &quot;How about a rule saying the batting Powerplay has to be taken by over 35?&quot; says Tim Woollias. &quot;Too many teams take it as late as possible, but the last five overs are rarely boring, it&apos;s the middle overs that need some artificial assistance.&quot; If something needs such a degree of artificial assistance, shouldn&apos;t it just be put down? Apart from Cher, obviously.  40th over: England 222-2 (target 293; Trott 62, Bell 22) Seven low-risk runs in that Seelaar over, so England need 71 from the last 10 overs. &quot;Worrying about the predictable middle overs misses the point,&quot; says Rob Cocking. &quot;Precisely one hour after this match is over all that any of us will remember is Collingwood getting out for 5 off 16, leaving Anderson and Yardy to give up still needing 9 runs off two overs. That was the case before England tried to put a spanner in the works by naming their team, and it remains the case now.&quot;  WICKET! England 224-3 (Trott st Barresi b ten Doeschate 62) England take the batting Powerplay and, just for a change, lose a wicket instantly. Trott was stumped off a wide as he overbalanced, trying to flick ten Doeschate to fine leg. It was a whip-smart stumping from Walter Barresi, so quick that it was not even referred to the third umpire.  41st over: England 229-3 (target 293; Bell 26, Collingwood 2) So, 64 needed from 54 balls. They couldn&apos;t balls this up. Could they? &quot;Surely the future of one-day cricket should be Twenty20 Test matches,&quot; says Marc Weaver. &quot;Two matches played back to back in the same day using the same format as Test match cricket.&quot; I like the idea, but surely it&apos;s too much to ask of the players, mentally as much as physically. I know they do it on Twenty20 Finals Day but you wouldn&apos;t want to make it the norm.  42nd over: England 237-3 (need 56 from 48 balls; Bell 31, Collingwood 4) Bell hits his first boundary from his 35th boundary, timing a lovely cut off the returning Bukhari. Eight from the over in total. &quot;You&apos;re not telling me you could get through for long without Artificial Happiness Facilitator are you?&quot; says Louise Wright. &quot;If you&apos;re judging by that kind of standard I reckon most of us are for the chop. With the possible exception of Cher, obviously.&quot;  WICKET! England 241-4 (Bell b ten Doeschate 33) Bell&apos;s nothing innings comes to an end as Ryan ten Doeschate strikes with his last delivery of the match. Bell made room to hit over the off side, and the ball flew off the inside edge and onto middle stump.  43rd over: England 241-4 (need 52 from 42 balls; Collingwood 6, Bopara 0) ten Doeschate ends with figures of 10-0-47-2. Whatever happens, he should be the Man of the Match. &quot;I hadn&apos;t time to read the whole OBO,&quot; says Niall Harden, &quot;so I just searched for the word &apos;farce&apos; and caught up nicely. As usual.&quot;  44th over: England 249-4 (need 44 from 36 balls; Collingwood 13, Bopara 1) Some leg-stump garbage from Bukhari is whipped fine for four by Collingwood, and a few ones and twos make it eight from the over. &quot;Is Cher in now?&quot; asks Kerry Davies. She would probably time it better than Collingwood; he&apos;s all over the place. But with Collingwood, that&apos;s so familiar as to be almost comforting. He&apos;ll find a way to make runs in this tournament.  45th over: England 256-4 (need 37 from 30 balls; Collingwood 18, Bopara 3) Collingwood picks Loots&apos; slower ball and drives it handsomely over mid off for four, his first runs on the off side in this innings. One boundary per over, in addition to the inevitable ones and twos, should be enough for England. &quot;Why should Twenty20 Tests, as Marc Weaver suggests, be any more effort than one-day games?&quot; asks Tom Baird. &quot;There were be less overs in total than one-day games at present. I like the idea.&quot; The cricket is just much more intense. It&apos;d be inhumane to make 80-over days of Twenty20 cricket the norm.  46th over: England 260-4 (need 33 from 24 balls; Collingwood 19, Bopara 5) This is getting pretty hairy. There&apos;s a moment of fortune for Collingwood, who charges Seelaar, is done in the flight and inside-edges the ball just wide of leg stump and past the keeper for a single. That&apos;s one of only four runs from a fine over from the left-arm spinner Seelaar, and suddenly England need more than eight an over. &quot;The World Cup has barely begun and already the format is being written off,&quot; says Emiel de Bont. &quot;What&apos;s wrong with you people? I admit, I much prefer Test cricket, but this Twenty20 nonsense is really just a bad excuse for slogging the ball about, which in my view has little to do with proper cricket. It&apos;s a format, remember, where the Dutch beat England at Lord&apos;s. And could do so again. I like the Jonathan Trotts of this world, who judge every ball on its merits and who have the mental discipline to stay focussed. Take it from a Dutchman: one-day cricket isn&apos;t going anywhere. Least of all away.&quot;  47th over: England 270-4 (need 23 from 18 balls; Collingwood 26, Bopara 9) That&apos;s a very good over for England, with Loots going for 10. Collingwood applies some balm by premeditating a lap over short fine leg for four from the first delivery; Bopara then chips a slower one just short of long on from the fourth ball, and England are able to score off every ball.  48th over: England 280-4 (need 13 from 12 balls; Collingwood 30, Bopara 14) Seelaar&apos;s last over goes for 10, none of them in boundaries. Collingwood reverse sweeps the second ball for three, a beautifully timed stroke from outside leg stump. Barresi then misses a very difficult stumping chance, when Bopara walks down the track to a ball angled deliberately wide of leg stump. That&apos;s 20 from the last two overs, and England should be home and dry now.  48.4 overs: England 292-4 (Collingwood 30, Bopara 30). ENGLAND WIN BY SIX WICKETS Bopara finishes the match in a hurry, smacking Loots for 6244 to give England victory with eight balls to spare. Collingwood and Bopara played coolly in the face of potential humiliation, each making 30 not out from 23 and 20 balls respectively. England were a rabble in the field but they paced an awkward chase fairly well. Now they move to Bangalore for the small matter of India on Sunday. Eek.

With Domino&apos;s pizzas and MacBooks at the ready, the makeup of the far-from-glam third-floor boardroom at 1Xtra&apos;s London HQ isn&apos;t necessarily what you&apos;d expect from the UK&apos;s most influential urban playlist meeting taking place. &quot;Anyone for a cup of tea?&quot; asks MistaJam, a DJ who also has a slot over at Radio 1. With the milk and two sugars sorted, it&apos;s down to business, even if it feels like the relaxed kind of business you&apos;d engage in at the student union. With a weekly listenership of 816,000 and urban music frequently making up for near-on 50% of the UK singles chart, 1Xtra is the first port of call for anything R&amp;B, hip-hop, grime, reggae or dubstep related. If you&apos;re a plugger with an urban offering looking to the holy grail (otherwise known as the Radio 1 playlist), the approval of sister station 1Xtra is crucial to you. More often than not, it&apos;s their hits of today that become Radio 1&apos;s hits of tomorrow. Jessie J, Wiz Khalifa, Tinchy Stryder, and Chipmunk are all trump cards that demonstrate 1Xtra&apos;s unwavering reputation for giving both major label and unsigned acts the platform they need. Playlist meetings are usually shrouded in mystery because they are the place where new tracks can be made or broken before they&apos;ve even hit the airwaves. Once the panel has sat down to decide the list for that week, no plugger, manager, record label exec or payola (I kid, I kid) is going to make a difference. But that&apos;s the power 1Xtra \u2013 and their playlist meeting \u2013 now has. MistaJam, Ronnie Herel, Cameo The station began broadcasting in August 2002 and is home to world-class DJs and genre leaders including Tim Westwood, Trevor Nelson, MistaJam and Semtex, many of whom have grown hand in hand with the UK&apos;s urban industries. &quot;Gyptian&apos;s Hold Yuh would be a great example of that,&quot; explains Ryan Newman, 1Xtra&apos;s music systems assistant, otherwise known as the &quot;information wizard&quot; of the team who comes armed with stats. &quot;One of our specialist DJs had been playing it for a few weeks then raised it up the list when he saw its potential as a hit \u2026 seven months later it charted at No 16 and it was on the 1Xtra playlist for a record 30 weeks.&quot; That&apos;s not to say they don&apos;t make mistakes though. &quot;You can&apos;t get it right every time,&quot; Austin Daboh, 1Xtra&apos;s music manager (and a rising star of the radio industry in his own right) says, laughing. &quot;I&apos;d like to add,&quot; chips in MistaJam, &quot;that I bought Kid Cudi&apos;s Day &amp; Nite and the Skream remix of La Roux to the table but they didn&apos;t make the list at first.&quot; Taking charge of the weekly Tuesday meeting, it&apos;s Daboh and his small team (Newman and Anna Nathanson, music producer) who make the ultimate decisions. &quot;We have a pre-meeting with our longlist and filter out music that might be too new or we know just isn&apos;t right, then at midday it becomes like a steering committee. After that we re-group and decide.&quot; What makes the 1Xtra playlist meetings unique is the inclusion of DJs; other stations opt solely for production staff. While you will find the odd producer present, it&apos;s currently the turn of MistaJam, Twin B, Sarah Jane Crawford, Seani B, Cameo and Ronnie Herel to settle the scores. &quot;We switch up the DJs every six months or so,&quot; says Daboh. &quot;We like to keep it fresh and we let them put forward a track each week that may have come to their attention \u2013 they&apos;re specialists after all.&quot; And it turns out the process itself isn&apos;t all that different to hanging out in the student union either, albeit far more democratic. Loading up the first track, Mavado&apos;s Star Boy, the group is quick to conclude that it&apos;s too early for the playlist. Next in line it&apos;s Jodie Connor feat Tinchy Stryder and the track Bring It. Despite vying for interest with pizza, Brit awards gossip and Twitter, Jodie Connor looks a likely addition to this week&apos;s playlist. Flo Rida isn&apos;t so lucky. Despite the stats proving past success, no one&apos;s sold on the need to playlist the track. Allow five minutes for Flo Rida jokes. With Wretch 32&apos;s Unorthodox up for discussion, it&apos;s time for Twin B to leave the room. As a stakeholder in Levels Entertainment, Wretch&apos;s record label home, the BBC rules come into play. But even with Twin B at a safe distance it&apos;s clear this is going to be another hit for the latest MC to break the charts. As a homegrown artist, Wretch isn&apos;t in the minority he used to be either \u2013 currently over 45% of all music played on 1Xtra is from the UK. As the two-hour session draws to a close, equally promising is the revelation that the word &quot;bollocks&quot; was only deemed necessary on one occasion: &quot;You have to be honest though,&quot; concludes MistaJam, &quot;and sometimes only that word really fits.&quot; The debate behind the records that made the 1Xtra playlist What they REALLY said \u2013 the 1Xtra DJs on some of the tracks fighting for the playlist this week: Jodie Connor feat Tinchy Stryder \u2013 Bring It &quot;She&apos;s got a strong fan base and they&apos;re going to want to hear it.&quot; &quot;Jodie&apos;s had a 1Xtra journey so we&apos;d be stupid not to support it.&quot; Mavado \u2013 Star Boy &quot;I went to see him at Amsterdam last weekend and he didn&apos;t perform it so I think we can afford to wait.&quot; Giggs feat Example \u2013 Look Over Your Shoulder &quot;With a clever edit it&apos;s a go \u2026 we need stuff like this alongside Jodie Connor.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re the only station who can reflect mixtape culture on daytime radio so definitely.&quot; Flo Rida \u2013 Who Dat Girl &quot;That&apos;s a milder brand of cheese than some cheese on the playlist.

HSBC Asia Holdings has an Amsterdam address. The contract, signed this month, also shows that he expects to pay income taxes in Hong Kong and Britain \u2013 with the bank paying for him to receive advice on filing tax returns in both places. Gulliver&apos;s contract gives his address as the main HSBC Hong Kong office in Queen&apos;s Road Central, and confirms he is on a \u00a31.25m salary. He is also entitled to an additional 50% as a contribution to his pension. About \u00a3375,000 is paid into a Jersey-based defined contribution scheme called Trailblazer while the remaining \u00a3250,000 is paid in cash.

A bloke peers up Marilyn&apos;s billowing skirt. Teenagers jostle a wobbly Russell Brand. A Kuwait scarf is draped around Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai. &quot;Where is Tony Blair?&quot; asks a tourist from Afghanistan. Who does he want a photograph with? &quot;All of these bastards,&quot; he says, making a beeline for George W Bush. There&apos;s a commotion outside No 10 Downing Street: the top of Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s right ear has been chewed off. Is Mike Tyson marauding through the building? The diminutive French president is unceremoniously wheeled away for some TLC with molten wax. In an era of virtual reality, interactive Wiis and 3D TVs, it is difficult to imagine a more anachronistic attraction than a crowded dark room peopled with static wax models. But Madame Tussauds is more popular than ever. After the venerable London attraction&apos;s busiest ever year, next month sees the opening of a new Madame Tussauds in Blackpool. Another, the 12th Madame Tussauds in the world, will be added in Vienna. Almost every month, a new celebrity is added to the waxen lineup. Gok Wan is set for Blackpool, while the much-requested Justin Bieber will arrive in London, New York and Amsterdam next month. Tussauds&apos; owners, Merlin Entertainments, is the world&apos;s second largest leisure group after Disney, with a portfolio of fun that includes Alton Towers, the London Eye and Legoland. Last year it reported visitor numbers up by 10% across its attractions with a 16% jump in profits to \u00a3239m. Madame Tussauds may be its most unlikely success story. Born in Strasbourg in 1761, Marie Tussaud studied model-making under Dr Philippe Curtius, a doctor who became highly skilled at making anatomical models from wax. They moved to Paris and she created figures for a waxwork exhibition, narrowly escaped the guillotine in the French Revolution, and ended up making death masks of guillotine victims. Tussaud inherited Curtius&apos;s models and her travelling exhibition of waxworks became the touring newspaper of the day, providing vivid impressions of contemporary events, particularly the revolution, in a time before photographs. When she settled in Britain and opened a museum in Baker Street in 1835, her most popular exhibit was the &quot;chamber of horrors&quot; featuring murderers and criminals. This tradition of what academics call &quot;dark tourism&quot; endures today: there is something morbid about peering at Amy Winehouse&apos;s skinny but healthily waxy arms. In Tussauds&apos; alternative reality, there are two Winehouses so one body can be regularly removed to repaint her tattoos, which get worn away by all the fluttering fingers of fans, touching her with a delicate concern. &quot;Madame Tussaud believed she provided entertainment, artistic enlightenment, historical education and a place of pilgrimage,&quot; writes Pamela Pilbeam, author of Madame Tussaud and the History of Waxworks. This presentation of news as entertainment continued under Tussaud&apos;s sons and grandsons, who placed famous figures in dramatic historical dioramas. But Tussauds (which has now dropped the apostrophe) never quite enjoyed the credibility of a museum and tended to be sneered at by historians. Since the 1960s, theorists of high culture have been more forgiving. &quot;There is something irresistibly timeless about Tussaud&apos;s, as though the clock had obstinately stopped at the high noon of Victorian history painting,&quot; wrote Roy Strong, former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. More recently, Pilbeam has argued that Tussauds presents an &quot;intimately corporeal biographical history&quot;. Academics may mock, but &quot;for most people history is biography and the story of famous people, and Tussaud&apos;s always excelled in portraying them&quot;. Tussauds, in short, has always enabled us to touch the hem \u2013 or bum \u2013 of royals, celebrities and criminals. Half-term in its rabbit warren of rooms on London&apos;s Marylebone Road is noisy, hot and busy. This carnival of camera phones, caressing and even groping (the waxen men do have &quot;moulds&quot; where their private parts would be so that their trousers hang properly, but no, nothing too realistic down there) is the celebrity world were we in control. In this fantasy land, there are no ropes, red tape, spin doctors or security minders to come between us and our idols. &quot;I squeezed somebody&apos;s bum. Who&apos;s bum did I squeeze? Was it Robbie Williams?&quot; Vicki Kennett asks her daughters, Miranda, 12, and Emma, 10. &quot;And you kissed Lewis Hamilton,&quot; says Miranda severely. &quot;Here you have an illusion of rubbing shoulders with the stars,&quot; continues Vicki, insisting she didn&apos;t really kiss Hamilton. &quot;Some of them are really charismatic. It&apos;s the way they&apos;ve done their eyes. It looks like they are staring at you.&quot; But she is a little wistful about when Tussauds seemed less in thrall to celebrity culture. &quot;I remember coming down here when I was little and there was a massive reconstruction of the Battle of Trafalgar,&quot; she says. &quot;It was more about storytelling than celebrity.&quot; Perhaps there is only so much CGI and 3D TV you can take, because the youth of today seem weirdly bewitched by these figures, which still really are fashioned from wax. Each model is painstakingly crafted using modelling techniques pioneered by Marie Tussaud and featuring chicken wire, newspapers and clay. The figures take four months to make and typically cost \u00a3150,000. The hair, for instance, is not a wig: each strand of real hair is individually inserted into the artificial scalp. Unusually, in these days of tightly controlled image rights, Madame Tussauds claims there are no contracts and no celebrity is paid to be reproduced in wax. Most stars seem to enjoy the indulgence of being measured and photographed in a two-hour sitting. Even David Cameron found time to pose for the waxworkers at No 10. &quot;They give up their time for nothing but the privilege and honour of having their figure done,&quot; says Liz Edwards, spokeswoman for Madame Tussauds. A few stars succeed in controlling their doppelgangers with a rule or two: Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson, for instance, do not allow their wax selves to be photographed by the press or used in promotional photography. But most even donate their own clothes. Boris Johnson took off his suit and handed it over immediately after his sitting; his trouser legs still sport a small tear where he caught the hem in his bicycle chain. Teen heartthrobs are the most pawed over. Twilight star Robert Pattinson is currently the most touched model. His face is wiped clean of lipstick marks several times a day. Cheryl Cole, Miley Cyrus and Zac Efron are mobbed by pre-teens. But some favourites are not the obvious ones. Jo O&apos;Hare, 23, thinks that her boyfriend, Matt Holland, 24, was most taken with Cheryl Cole. Oh no. &quot;It&apos;s all about Stephen Hawking,&quot; he says. &quot;He was brilliant; I had a photo taken with him.&quot; &quot;Audrey Hepburn was so beautiful in real life that her waxwork didn&apos;t do her justice, whereas Charles and Camilla were very good,&quot; reckons Moira Carrasco from Surrey, who is visiting with her daughter and granddaughter. The theory that ugly folk make better waxworks may be disproved by the unconvincing Wayne Rooney. Older folk, however, and lived-in faces, work better: Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman are certainly more convincing than Daniel Radcliffe. Modern trends may be working in Madame Tussauds&apos; favour: as celebrities turn ever more plasticky with their botox and botched surgery, so the waxworks look ever more real. The ubiquity of Madame Tussauds, found everywhere from Bangkok to Berlin, may reflect the globalisation of Hollywood but each city gets the waxworks it deserves. Washington DC is the only Tussauds to feature a gallery of all 44 US presidents, which opened last week, while Tussauds in Las Vegas features the only topless figure (former porn star Jenna Jameson) and the unforgettable opportunity to bounce on a bed with a stiff Hugh Hefner. Madame Tussauds in London is the nearest thing to a British Walk of Fame. Unlike Hollywood&apos;s, however, here a star can disappear. The comings and goings of celebrity waxworks deliciously mirror the fickle wax and wane of fame. When his solo career imploded a decade ago, and Gary Barlow was reportedly &quot;melted down&quot; to make Britney Spears, the star concluded he had hit rock bottom. But this melting down is a &quot;complete myth&quot; according to Edwards. Now there are 12 Tussauds around the world, many models are sent on tour: a pop star may be down the dumper in Britain but still big in Berlin. According to Edwards, every unwanted waxwork is archived in a warehouse in Acton, west London \u2013 a fabulously creepy place that is off limits to the media. Former Australian PM John Howard was recently dumped there but the exhibition&apos;s prophetic creative director and others involved in the selection process chose to keep Muammar Gaddafi on display and this suddenly newsworthy figure stands between Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat, just along from Saddam Hussein, Robert Mugabe and Adolf Hitler. Happily for Barlow, when Take That reformed, he was dusted down and reunited with the replica Robbie Williams. Tussauds confers more than immortality on leading celebrities: its biggest stars undertake a Doctor Who-like regeneration. Waxworkers may add a tattoo or amend a hairstyle, but often build an entirely new model to keep abreast of the ravages of ageing, image changes and plastic surgeons. Kylie has gone through four reincarnations; Michael Jackson, for obvious reasons, 13. For all the kids&apos; adulation for Cyrus and Efron, it is surprising how many young pilgrims are paying homage to the king of pop. Children have a surprising capacity for nostalgia, and reverence. The most visited figure remains the Queen. While Brad Pitt may get knickers left in his pocket, there is more decorum around the royals. Princess Diana is treated with great respect: the Versace gown she donated rarely needs dry-cleaning, unlike the oldest waxwork in the exhibition, Sleeping Beauty, aka Louis XV&apos;s mistress Madame du Barry. She recently had to be removed for a clean after someone sought to wake her with spilled coffee. The success of Madame Tussauds across three centuries is part of a long tradition of the tourism of replicas, simulations and spectacle. Its more recent blossoming may reflect a society increasingly obsessed with celebrity but it is also because, as its visitors soon realise, the division between static wax and interactive virtual reality is a false one. The exhibition has moved with the times, introducing Bollywood stars, who are a big draw, and interactive exhibits. Most crucially, it has ripped away the ropes and the &quot;do not touch&quot; strictures. Tussauds has always been 3D and its waxworks are now thoroughly, irreverently interactive. Ann Wootton from Walsall admits her grandchildren wondered what she was on about when she suggested a visit to the waxworks. Now they are enthralled. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely amazed how you can have photos and touch the models, which you couldn&apos;t do in previous years,&quot; says Wootton. &quot;It&apos;s lovely.&quot; In the 1880s, when Madame Tussauds moved to its current location, Chambers&apos;s Journal wrote that people did not flock there to admire statues and nor were they wowed by simple likeness in what was a new era of photography. Its appeal, the journalist concluded, lay in the liberation of the observer from the normal rules of politeness. At a time when voting was extended to more working men, its newly enfranchised visitors could rant at a disliked politician or stare impertinently into the eyes of royalty. And so it is today. Madame Tussauds has all the appeal of a fantasy dinner party in which heroes and villains from across the ages are gathered together in one room. But it does not merely make these celebrities our house guests. It turns them into our playthings, always-accessible automatons onto whom we can project all our fantasies. These are celebrities who cannot jump into a limo with blackened out windows and cannot answer \u2013 or tweet \u2013 back.

His career was characterised by a highly principled devotion to the values of classic modernism, and a disdain for fashion that won him devoted admirers among both artists and collectors. His eloquently economical paintings epitomised Mies van der Rohe&apos;s dictum that less is more. Born in Luton, the son of a master carpenter, Alan was brought up there, and in Danbury, Essex and in Peterborough. He studied at the Leicester College of Art and the Central School in London, exhibiting at the Young Contemporaries from 1960 to 1964, and at the Grabowski Gallery in 1965. As the 60s progressed, he was drawn to a kind of non-figurative art that reflected the influence of Piet Mondrian and, less obviously, Alberto Giacometti, as well as American artists including Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt. In 1968, he made his first visit to New York and moved there permanently the following year, renting a loft in SoHo, then a nameless industrial neighbourhood, and establishing himself as a fixture among the painters, conceptualists and performance artists who congregated at bars such as Fanelli&apos;s, Max&apos;s Kansas City, and St Adrian&apos;s. He supported himself by printmaking for more established artists such as Jim Dine, and painting and decorating. He absorbed everything the New York art world had to offer, while working slowly and patiently on his own paintings, which became increasingly refined, tending at first towards the monochromatic or the chromatically neutral. In 1974, the curator Klaus Kertess included him in a group show at the influential Bykert Gallery. By the time of his first solo exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery, in 1978, Uglow&apos;s art had been pared down to the interplay of subtly modulated whites deployed within the framework of a highly reductive geometry. By the early 1980s, Uglow was beginning to find himself out of step with a Manhattan gallery scene increasingly in thrall to commerce. Continuing to paint, he found an alternative outlet for his creative energy playing bass guitar, performing in New York and Europe with his second wife, the dancer and poet Elena Alexander, and becoming a founding member of the band Hard Labor. He began to exhibit at the Lorence-Monk Gallery in New York from the mid-1980s, and later at Stark Gallery. Defying the tide of postmodernism, Uglow remained an unrepentant if undogmatic modernist, and increasingly his reputation came to depend on recognition in northern Europe, especially Scandinavia, Germany and the Netherlands. In 1986 and 1992, he and Alexander spent year-long sojourns in Europe, and in 1995 he exhibited in London at Gimpel Fils. European trips were relished for the opportunity to visit Stamford Bridge to support his beloved Chelsea FC. Painting in series that evolved slowly over decades, he remained faithful to his central vision while pushing boundaries in ways sometimes apparent only when the work was installed in a gallery. Beginning in 2000, there was a radical shift in Uglow&apos;s use of colour, which became bolder and more varied, often being employed to articulate space in surprising and illusionistic ways. Some paintings displayed the graphic simplicity of a playing field or ice-hockey rink seen from above, without ever becoming merely diagrammatic. Occasionally a piece would be freestanding, breaking with conventional notions of painting altogether. In 1998, he had a full-sized &quot;Coach&apos;s Bench&quot; fabricated out of wood, with a corrugated fibreglass roof and a concealed sound system that broadcast crowd noises recorded at football stadiums, as well as readings from texts by Vladimir Nabakov, Albert Camus and Harold Pinter. With his punk black T-shirts, drainpipe jeans and his ravaged but striking features, Uglow remained a familiar figure in the bars of downtown Manhattan until a series of illnesses, culminating in a diagnosis of cancer, confined him largely to his studio. Long before, Uglow had become a cult hero to many younger artists, and the exhibition of a new work at the contemporary art space MoMA PS1, or a one-off at the Paula Cooper Gallery, came to be seen as an event. His obstinate dedication to the values of high modernism gained growing respect in mainstream circles, and the last year of his life saw the publication of a handsome monograph devoted to his work (Alan Uglow, edited by Martin Hentschel), and major exhibitions in Germany at Museum Haus Esters in Krefeld and Museum Wiesbaden, and at Galerie Onrust in Amsterdam, the headquarters of his Dutch art dealers.

The exhibition on the Canadian collective General Idea (until 30 April) is a good example of this paradox. The art world, which rates the members of the collective as key figures of the 1970-80s, has not forgotten their biting irony and caustic performances. But this retrospective features dozens of pieces that are either completely unknown or have never been seen since they were first produced. The art collective was set up in Toronto in 1969 by Felix Partz, Jorge Zontal and AA Bronson, and many people will remember the self-portraits of the trio, disguised as poodles with black eyes, baby seals or kids in bed together. For a long time their zany creations disguised the complexity of their creative efforts. They were among the first artists to seize on Aids as an aesthetic theme, though in 1994 it claimed the lives of Partz and Zontal. The Paris show, entitled Haute Culture, does justice to these revolutionaries by deciphering their language. The show starts with one of their most emblematic productions, a series of garish coats of arms. It sums up their entire formal vocabulary: the poodle as a symbol of the artist, the horn of plenty representing inspiration, the ziggurat for power, and the television test card for their relationship with mass media. These symbols reoccur in the exhibition, abused, amalgamated and mocked. In the opening piece they serve as decoration for a non-existent pavilion dedicated to Miss General Idea. Their imaginary muse haunts the show, which includes film of real beauty contests, giving substance to her presence. Reality and fiction merge here to create an alternative world. General Idea felt that everyday reality was not enough, nor did they have any sense of belonging to it. So they created their own world, an imperfect pretence of a perfect world. The high point of the show is a delightfully comical room. In 1977 they had the idea that Miss General Idea&apos;s (fictitious) pavilion had burned down. They started an archaeological exploration of its ruins, exhibiting their finds: a pseudo-Cretan wall painting and scraps of pottery with three poodles in compromising positions, and wood panels marked with the ziggurat motif. The exhibition also shows how the collective turned infiltration into art. &quot;Long before working on the theme of Aids, General Idea seized on the idea of virus and contagion,&quot; says the exhibition&apos;s curator, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonnet. In a spoof on Life magazine, they launched File. Foreseeing the conversion of museums into shopping malls, they opened a shop to sell their works in a dollar-shaped showcase. Mocking the power of mass media, they found their way on to all the main channels. Their work on Aids admirably illustrates this ability to penetrate the halls of power. The show is divided into four parts, but part of each room addresses this additional thread. At the foot of Raoul Dufy&apos;s Electricity Fairy, three huge AZT capsules set the tone. There follows a painting in their Aids series, which mocks the four letters of Robert Indiana&apos;s LOVE image. The design was posted on New York streets, on trams in Amsterdam and on wallpaper.

Is Europe about to run out of PS3s? LG made a bold move that definitely ups the pressure on Sony. But it&apos;s important to understand that patent enforcement in Europe is still a country-by-country affair \u2013 even though there is a European Patent Office \u2013 and Sony can work around the Dutch decision by going through entry points outside of the Netherlands. That&apos;s a logistical nightmare, but it is a possibility. Sony is most likely already exploring such alternative routes. (And in case you&apos;d forgotten what the dispute is actually about: LG claims that Sony&apos;s Blu-ray playback infringes LG patents. Sony, meanwhile, filed suit in December against LG over smartphone technologies, and trying to stop their import into the US. LG, in response, is trying to get PS3 imports into the US banned. Now read on.)  In order to cause greater disruption to European PlayStation sales, LG would have to obtain injunctions in more EU member states than just the Netherlands, a country that accounts for only 3% of Europe&apos;s total population size. While LG hasn&apos;t confirmed anything, and Sony&apos;s official statement doesn&apos;t say much, there&apos;s every indication that LG requested customs action against goods suspected of patent infringement in accordance with EU Council Regulation No 1383/2003 and additionally obtained a prejudgment seizure decision from a court in The Hague, Netherlands. The combination of those two measures means Sony has a serious problem in the Dutch market, but it&apos;s not the end of the world for the PlayStation in the whole of Europe. As The Guardian reports, &quot;Rotterdam [a Dutch seaport] and Schiphol [Amsterdam airport] are the main import points for PS3s for both the UK and continental Europe&quot;. But Sony could change that. Other high-tech companies will be watching this with interest, and with concern. For example, Apple and Nokia are also battling each other in Europe, and other litigants can never know when their adversaries are going to seek European customs action as a way to increase the pressure on them.  Customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1383/2003) In 1994 the European Community (nowadays known as the European Union, or &quot;EU&quot;) passed a law for the seizure of counterfeit and pirated goods, amended it in 1999, and replaced it in 2003 with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1383/2003 concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights. Over time, the regulation had evolved from an anti-counterfeiting measure into a broader protection of right holders. In particular, patents were not within the scope of the regulation at the outset: while many counterfeit goods infringe patents, most patent infringers aren&apos;t pirates. Customs authorities are usually not equipped to make the technically and legally complicated determination of infringement that usually requires multi-year lawsuits. The regulation provides the possibility that customs offices may act at their own initiative (ex officio) if they suspect infringement, but its Section 2 sets out the practically more relevant scenario of a right holder applying for customs action in writing. In that case, a right holder doesn&apos;t bear the burden of proof that there is an actual infringement. It is merely sufficient that &quot;goods are suspected of infringing an intellectual property right&quot;, such as a patent under the law of the EU member state in which the application is filed. Yes, being &quot;suspected&quot; of infringement is all it takes. Looks lopsided, doesn&apos;t it? But rights holders seeking to harm competitors must be careful. A rights holder whose infringement allegations aren&apos;t confirmed by a court of law may be liable for the damage inflicted under the law of the EU member state in which the application was made. In other words, if Sony prevails, it could sue LG for damages. Also, seized goods will be released after 10 days if the relevant customs office hasn&apos;t been notified of judicial proceedings under national law. Even if a lawsuit has been filed, there is still a potential way out: &quot;the declarant, owner, importer, holder or consignee of the goods shall be able to obtain the release of the goods or an end to their detention on provision of a security&quot;, pursuant to Article 14. What sort of &apos;security&apos;? &quot;The security [...] must be sufficient to protect the interests of the right-holder&quot;, which means that Sony would have to deposit the amount of damages LG might be awarded if it prevailed in court. But in the Netherlands this doesn&apos;t seem to be an option for Sony, because LG appears to have obtained a preliminary injunction by a court in The Hague, ordering prejudgment seizure. As a result, the PlayStations detained there won&apos;t be released without LG&apos;s consent until the end of the lawsuit. Courts hand down such injunctions only based on a summary judgment standard: it&apos;s a quick procedure, but the party requesting the injunction must show that it has a reasonable chance to prevail. By contrast, the application for customs action under the said EU regulation merely has to meet formal requirements without proving the infringement allegations by any standard at all.  European patent fragmentation? Handy for Sony While the European Patent Office (EPO) performs the centralized examination of European patent applications, EPO patents are just bundles of national patents, each of which is assigned a national patent number and can be enforced only in the one country in which it is valid. This is going to change: the EU is in the process of creating a single EU patent and patent judiciary, but this will take years to come to fruition. The aforementioned European regulation requires a patent holder to claim an infringement only of a national patent. LG holds some Dutch patents that it apparently claims are infringed by the PS3, and didn&apos;t have to allege the infringement of patents in any other EU member state. But the prejudgment seizure order issued by the court in The Hague is valid only in the Netherlands. Therefore, if Sony ships PlayStations directly into other EU member states, the local customs authorities there will not take that seizure order into account. They may pay attention to LG&apos;s application for customs action, but in that case Sony could bail out the detained goods on security after a maximum of 10 days. Any further detention would require an injunction in the relevant country. Prejudgment seizure appears to be a particularly Dutch phenomenon. It is also mentioned in a very interesting Managing Intellectual Property article on how customs can help patent owners. While other European countries may not provide prejudgment seizure, it would be possible to seek preliminary injunctions against the sale of allegedly infringing goods. This is an option in many European countries. In Germany, the largest EU member state (and home to the major seaports of Hamburg and Bremen as well as Frankfurt Airport, one of the world&apos;s 10 largest cargo hubs), it is possible to obtain preliminary injunctions in a relatively rapid procedure, but alleged infringers are usually given an opportunity to defend themselves prior to a preliminary injunction. Also, if a preliminary injunction is granted but fails to be upheld in a subsequent main proceeding, there is a considerable liability risk involved. In order not to give LG any clues, Sony will likely not announce which alternative routes into Europe it is exploring for the PS3. This is a major logistical challenge \u2013\u00a0Sony needs to import an estimated 100,000 per week to keep up with sales demand \u2013 but it will probably go to extreme lengths to avoid the loss of market share in Europe. In that case, LG will have to chase the PS3 down across the EU, or at least in the largest markets. It will take much more than the surprise effect of the Dutch decision \u2013 however impressive it may be per se \u2013 to bring Sony to its knees. That said, it seems that the patent wars between major industry players are ever more bitterly contested, and Europe increasingly becomes a battlefield.

Instead he chose to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps and do an apprenticeship in cabinet making. &quot;By the time I was 16, I was desperate to get into the workplace. I just wanted to learn a trade,&quot; he says. Ten years on, he is a workshop manager with a team of 25 staff. His job, which involves making furniture for yachts, provides plenty of opportunities to travel, most recently in Germany and Amsterdam. Tuddenham, who won the cabinet making gold medal in the 2007 WorldSkills competition in Japan, says he is &quot;years ahead&quot; of friends who took the university route, both financially and in terms of career progression. Having a trade also means he is not tied to any particular location. &quot;It offers that flexibility to move around, both in the UK or abroad, which can&apos;t be said for all jobs,&quot; he says.  As Tuddenham has found, getting into employment early, earning on the job and not running up student debt can offer a &quot;head start&quot; in the career stakes. Figures from the Department for Education show that those with a level 2 apprenticeship (equivalent to GCSE level) can earn over \u00a370,000 more in a lifetime than those with other level 2 qualifications or below. And with university tuition fees set to rise to up to \u00a39,000 a year, more bright young people are exploring the option of vocational education and training. Sarah Clover, sales and marketing director of the careers advice website notgoingtouni.co.uk, says she has seen a significant increase in the number of students interested in vocational careers. She cites research carried out by the independent education foundation, Edge, which found that 68% of employers believe there are too few candidates with vocational qualifications and skills. &quot;It shows we need to move away from our recent obsession with degrees and equip people properly for the workplace,&quot; she says. But the tide is definitely turning. According to research commissioned by Edge there has been an 11% increase in the number of vocational qualifications awarded. Growth has been particularly strong in apprenticeships where, despite an uncertain economic climate, the total number of people starting an apprenticeship rose by almost 7% to a record 239,900 last year. The skills minister, John Hayes, has talked often of his mission to restore the prestige and status enjoyed by skilled craftspeople, and the government has pledged to create 75,000 more adult apprenticeships over the next four years. Last year, BT reported record numbers of applications for its apprenticeship scheme, with 24,000 applications for 221 places. And this trend is not confined to the private sector; earlier this year Liverpool council said it received 1,183 applications for its 133 apprenticeships. As well as exploring vocational qualifications, young people are increasingly interested in combining work and study, at a fraction of the cost, through employer-funded study or through part-time or distance learning, says Clover. High-profile accountancy firms Deloitte and KPMG are leading the way; both have recently announced that they are planning to recruit more school leavers and fund them through their studies.  Peter Mitchell, interim CEO of Edge, believes the upcoming WorldSkills competition has a crucial role to play in highlighting the benefits of vocational skills and training. &quot;In the current economic climate, it is more vital than ever that we have the resources and training to inspire all young people to succeed in life, whatever path they choose. WorldSkills London 2011 is an opportunity to remind ourselves that there are many paths to success, bringing together evidence of the vast scope of vocational training for today and future generations.&quot;", "sentences": ["His job, which involves making furniture for yachts, provides plenty of opportunities to travel, most recently in Germany and Amsterdam."], "title": "Building interest in vocational careers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/worldskills/skills-for-life", "tags": ["World Skills"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-04T22:00:00Z", "article": "Beginnings, as Kenny Dalglish knows, are everything. He marked his first game at Anfield with a goal and so, within 16 minutes of coming on against Stoke City, did Luis Su\u00e1rez. Others are not so fortunate. As Newcastle United&apos;s manager, Dalglish brought Jon Dahl Tomasson to St James&apos; Park, where he blew a one-on-one against Sheffield Wednesday. His game on Tyneside never recovered. On Sunday, against Manchester United, it is likely to be Andy Carroll&apos;s turn. Whether he starts, the partnership with Su\u00e1rez, upon which Liverpool have lavished \u00a359m, cannot be long delayed. It is the classic big man, little man combination seen most effectively at Anfield when John Toshack and Kevin Keegan spearheaded Bill Shankly&apos;s attack. Having shaken off a thigh injury, Carroll has been training with Su\u00e1rez for a number of days now and the Uruguayan has already wondered how defenders will cope. &quot;He hasn&apos;t played a competitive game for two months but it is up to us as a group to ease him back in after all that time away,&quot; Su\u00e1rez said, nursing a cup of mate at Liverpool&apos;s training ground at Melwood. &quot;My impressions so far are that he is very tall, good in the air and has great feet. You have to remember that defenders here are very tall; that&apos;s why the duels between them are very good to watch but I still don&apos;t know how they are going to cope with him.&quot; Because of injury and suspension, the central defenders Sir Alex Ferguson will be able to deploy are the unconvincing combination of Chris Smalling and Wes Brown. &quot;It is important for us that neither Vidic nor Ferdinand will be there,&quot; Su\u00e1rez said. &quot;But you have to say that any player who is at Manchester United must be there for a reason.&quot; For much of his time at Old Trafford, many wondered what Diego Forl\u00e1n, Uruguay&apos;s last contribution to the Premier League, was doing until in December 2002 he scored twice in three minutes at Anfield. After the second, Gary Neville ran up and told him: &quot;They will never forget you after that.&quot; As Su\u00e1rez sips his mate through the traditional silver straw, the song United fans sang for Forl\u00e1n is translated for him: &quot;He comes from Uruguay, he made the scousers cry \u2026&quot; &quot;Diego told me that this will be the most important game of the year for them \u2013 as it will be for us,&quot; Su\u00e1rez said. &quot;To score in a game like this is something you dream of. That United fans still sing that for Diego shows the power of the fixture. We know how important it is that Manchester United do not win the title. It would be a big prize to stop them winning the league. &quot;I&apos;ve played a lot of big derbies in Holland and Uruguay and for the national team, against Argentina and Brazil, so I am calm. The only derby I was ever nervous before was the one between Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol when I was 18.

At Ajax [for whom he scored almost a goal a game] and Groningen I was in the right place at the right time.&quot; He would hope that these qualities might erase the perception of him as the man whose handball in Johannesburg against Ghana helped steal the World Cup from Africa and whose career in Dutch football ended with a suspension for biting an opponent. &quot;Sofia [his wife who left Uruguay at 16 to join him in the modest Dutch town of Groningen] said that if I behaved off the field like I do on the field she would not be with me,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be great if people in this country had a positive image of me.

She goes on, however, to suggest that cutting numbers would lead to higher quality. This is like suggesting that a substantial cut in the amount of football played in England would improve the national team. Germany has upwards of 130 symphony orchestras. Some of these are in opera houses, but they also give public concerts. In the UK (not counting radio orchestras, with which Germany is also well endowed) we have 12, four of them in the opera pit. Is she seriously suggesting that reducing these numbers still further is going to drive up standards? The National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, universally admired, demonstrates the amount of musical talent in this country. But only a small proportion of its players enter the profession. Employment is so very scarce, and the life so insecure, that those who have gifts other than music choose other careers, and enjoy their music at leisure. The Berlin Philharmonic represents the tip of a pyramid, and that pyramid has a very broad base. We won&apos;t build its equal on the top of a wobbly tower. Colin Bradbury London \u2022 Charlotte Higgins almost gives the impression that British orchestras aren&apos;t worth hearing. In the past month I have heard all four of London&apos;s orchestras and been astonished by their performances. It is quite wrong to worship foreign orchestras at the expense of British. They&apos;re no better. British orchestras often display a knack of producing results remarkably in sympathy with a very wide-ranging repertoire: French, German, Russian, American, and of course British, as the occasion demands. Have you heard a German orchestra ploughing through Elgar or Holst? Nobody would argue with the fact that on the continent there is generally more rehearsal time allowed, and that British musicians are often overworked and underpaid. It would be marvellous if finances permitted better working conditions, but meanwhile it is a tribute to their incredible dedication and professionalism that they consistently produce outstanding performances. Go and hear them! They deserve our support. Christopher Gunning Croxley Green, Hertfordshire \u2022 Charlotte Higgins&apos; suggestion that the Arts Council might in future fund only one or two London orchestras, instead of three, could no doubt produce an orchestra for London to rival that in Berlin. However, the rest of the country would suffer. For example, at present the Philharmonia has &quot;residencies&quot; in Bedford, Leicester and Basingstoke, thus enabling thousands of music lovers to attend live world-class concerts in their home towns. Mary McKeown Biddenham, Bedfordshire \u2022 I&apos;d like to remind Charlotte Higgins that London is blessed with four symphony orchestras. Nowhere does she mention the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra \u2013 a serious group of very fine players who, despite receiving the smallest grant from the Arts Council, and working the kind of punishing schedule she so graphically describes, has for 65 years been at the forefront of musical life in this country. Raymond Ovens Former RPO principal second violin \u2022 On 22 February our local paper ran a front-page story about the Linwood College Orchestra being invited to play at Westminster Abbey on Anzac Day as part of their tour of Europe. We were over the moon. Two years of hard-slog fundraising was almost over and our kids were going to have a brilliant opportunity. And then the big earthquake demolished our city\u2026 We were looking to raise $50,000 this month, but that was before the quake struck. Now most of the students have lost their part-time jobs, many of the families have lost houses, the school is closed. The college is setting up a trust to hold any donations (see http://bit.ly/h6yFJ8). Can anyone help? Vicki Hyde Christchurch, New Zealand\u2022 Of course the Berlin PO is a great orchestra with generous funding. And, yes, British orchestras work under punishing conditions. But the artistic results do not always flow in one direction. The Berliner&apos;s performance of Mahler&apos;s 4th did not have the emotional impact of the London Philharmonic&apos;s rendering of Mahler 9, under Christoph Eschenbach, a few days later. And the Royal Opera House orchestra, taking a night off from the pit, made far more sense of Mahler&apos;s piano quartet movement on Sunday than the Berlin players had done a week earlier. Actually, we get in the UK the best of all worlds, with frequent performances of orchestral masterpieces by the home orchestras, infused by friendly rivalry from visiting ensembles. Grenville Williams London \u2022 Charlotte Higgins asks what it would take to make a British orchestra as fine as the Berlin Philharmonic. I have news for her: we already do. The London orchestras have rarely been in better form. Outside London, there are few orchestras anywhere in the world that can play Shostakovich as well as the RLPO are currently doing under Petrenko, and on Sunday I was privileged to go to the Bridgewater Hall to hear the Hall\u00e9 and Mark Elder play Elgar \u2013 a performance given five stars by this paper with the reviewer of the opinion that the performance could hardly have been bettered.

I was in Swansea, not Hollywood, but still it held true. The film of my novel Submarine (released on 18 March) was being shot in a local comprehensive near to where I grew up. It was half-term and the film unit had set themselves up in the classrooms, changing rooms and canteen. This was the rival school when I was young \u2013 we always worried they were going to come over at lunchtime and beat us up. The truth, I discovered, is that it&apos;s a school renowned for its drama department \u2013 most of the extras that day were students. Stepping in to the playground, it looked like a normal break-time: 50 or so kids playing football and running around and, in the middle of it, a girl being taunted. It was a scene from my book. I felt as if I&apos;d been shrunk down and allowed to walk around in my own imagination. As I explored, I got to grips with the sheer number of people involved in making a film. The focus-puller. The runner. The guy who just shouts for everyone to hurry up. In the sports hall, a costume designer was sewing 50 school badges (the fictional school in my novel had been given its own Latin motto) on to 50 sweaters. That afternoon, I had a cameo as a double-denim-wearing drama teacher. All I had to do was look sombre while, behind me, teenage girls in leotards and leggings sobbed. Acting&apos;s not my strong suit but, on the day, I felt pretty sure I conveyed huge emotional depth. A few weeks later, I returned for my second day on set: a house on a hill in Blaengwynfi in the Welsh valleys. It was October \u2013 cold and windy, and the rain didn&apos;t fall so much as hover. The set designers had transformed the house into a pitch-perfect vision of late 80s middle-class suburbia. The walls of the 15-year-old protagonist&apos;s bedroom were plastered with photos, maps, paintings, obscure film posters. There was a typewriter, reference books, a tape player. The director, Richard Ayoade, told me it was how his teenage self would have liked his bedroom to look, if he&apos;d had the right materials. But you can only admire a house for so long. Pretty soon, the reality of the situation started to sink in. The crew had been up since before dawn and would keep going until long after dark. A shot as seemingly simple as a character picking up a note and reading it was taking hours to set up and complete. I bounced around, trying to distract people from doing their job. When the shoot went outside in the rain, I decided to stay indoors and drink tea. A few hours later, with a newfound admiration for the film industry, I went home. They were still outside, working. Like lots of writers, I had always hoped to have my stories turned into film. In fact, when I first started writing, at 15, this was one of the reasons my stories failed \u2013 I had one eye on the film rights. My stories were set in exotic places I&apos;d never visited \u2013 the Cathedral Santo Domingo de la Calzada, snow-covered Amsterdam, Osaka Bay \u2013 and they were populated with the types of people I&apos;d never met \u2013 hackers, models, gangsters. I see now that my fiction was ripping off my favourite films. I created facsimiles of characters from Pulp Fiction, Lost Highway, Strange Days, Trainspotting (I read the book later) and I forced them to make unconvincing cameos in my stories. Years later, when I started work on Submarine, I was conscious it needed to play to the unique strengths of the page. The story is told by an unreliable narrator, Oliver Tate. Most of the drama and comedy occur in the gap between what the character tells the reader and what the reader suspects to be true. This ambiguity is hard to sustain in film, where the reality we see on screen always dominates. So while I still daydreamed about a film adaptation, I had an excuse for why it could never happen. I imagined the email: &quot;Dear Joe, Harvey Weinstein loved the book, but he says it&apos;s just too complex a work, too multilayered and sophisticated, to ever be made in to movie.&quot; What a let-off. So it was a surprise that, after the book was published, it got optioned by a production company. I was assured by everyone that I would hear no more about it. These projects get buried. Nothing ever gets made. Abandon hope. Pretty quickly, they attached a writer/director, Ayoade, who started work on the script. How, I wondered, would he adapt all the pages of devious literary plotlessness? By cutting them. And how would he get round my dastardly internal monologue? With voiceover. For research, we watched lots of films that use voiceover. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Badlands, Manhattan \u2013 all great. Then there&apos;s the famously excruciating original cut of Blade Runner, with Harrison Ford sounding sedated. I had accepted, pretty early on, that the film would need to be unfaithful to the book for it to work. I thought of it as my book&apos;s evil twin \u2013 they share many characteristics but, while the book has time to carry the reader along through amiable digressions into language and character, the film must go for the jugular. It was fascinating to read each new draft of the script. As consultant, I did little more than try to ensure that the characters sounded like themselves. It made sense for the story to be condensed, especially since film funders are fond of asking: &quot;What&apos;s the real story here?&quot; Writers of literary fiction never have to lower themselves to answer that. Pretty soon, actors were being auditioned. I had avoided physically describing the main character because I wanted readers to create their own versions of him. This made the casting process interesting, because there was no guidance on how he should look. All we knew was that he had to be able to communicate a lot without saying much. Craig Roberts, the young Welsh actor who got the role, made us laugh just by moving his eyes. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in front of 600 people. I spent the whole time gripping the armrests. It was only when the credits rolled that I finally relaxed and realised how proud I was \u2013 and that my own cameo was on the cutting-room floor.", "sentences": ["My stories were set in exotic places I&apos;d never visited \u2013 the Cathedral Santo Domingo de la Calzada, snow-covered Amsterdam, Osaka Bay \u2013 and they were populated with the types of people I&apos;d never met \u2013 hackers, models, gangsters."], "title": "Author, author: Joe Dunthorne", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/05/author-author-joe-dunthorne", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Film", "Comedy", "Joe Dunthorne", "Comedy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-06T00:07:47Z", "article": "There&apos;s that word again: biodegradable. It was most recently applied to the Royal Mail&apos;s rubber bands and offered up as an ameliorating factor after &quot;\u00a35m red rubber-band bill&quot; headlines and allegations of littering. It is applied to all manner of consumer goods, from wool cardigans to sandwich wrappers and bin bags. And I appreciate the sentiment, I really do. In an effort to relieve some of the pressure of this cluttered, litter-strewn planet, biologically based polymers have been designed to break down so that a single-use sandwich box or throwaway cup just falls to earth. Because biopolymers are made from plant-derived ingredients, they also displace the use of oil. Alternatively, &quot;natural&quot; products, such as wool, are billed as biodegradable because the polymers break down naturally and fall to soil. Some products are extravagantly biodegradable: Amsterdam Fashion Week featured a &quot;fully biodegradable&quot; sneaker from Dutch footwear company OAT with a\u00a0seed-embedded cork sole that you bury in the garden; Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s has experimented with a\u00a0flower-sprouting ice-cream tub, and UK researchers developed a mobile phone that begat sunflowers. Most biodegradable consumables rarely fare so well. Sandwich wrappers and old cardigans, for example, are unlikely to end up in the right place to biodegrade (high-heat composters) \u2013 they are likely to go to landfill via the bin. Landfill, without oxygen, doesn&apos;t offer the right conditions for waste to biodegrade. Red rubber bands might biodegrade after a period, but in the interim could be washed into watercourses or ingested by wildlife. Sadly, rubbish doesn&apos;t melt away.

All short and long-term measures were discussed and discarded as either impractical or undesirable. The best they could come up with was &quot;keep calm and carry on&quot;. On Monday, it was announced that the Dutchman would be allowed to stay in the job until the end of the season. It was a remarkable turnaround in the space of less than 48 hours and a curious decision in more ways than one. Internally, Van Gaal&apos;s dismissal if they were to lose at Hannover on Saturday had been seen as a given, especially since Hoeness had explicitly threatened that very move over a month ago. &quot;If qualification for the Champions League is in danger, I get nervous,&quot; Hoeness had said, &quot;that was the case with J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, too&quot;. The manager-impersonator from Huntington Beach, California, was fired when Bayern slipped to third in the spring of 2009. The champions&apos; 3-1 defeat at Hannover, the third in a row after a 3-1 reverse to Dortmund and crashing out of the German Cup (2-0 v Schalke), saw them slide to fifth. No Bayern manager could have been expected to be forgiven for such a run, least of all Van Gaal, whose stubbornness has long cost him the support of Hoeness. &quot;We have to act, not talk,&quot; was all the president would say on his way out of the stadium on Saturday evening. The fact that &quot;Mr Bayern&quot; did not get his way the next day points to a power shift. Rummenigge, nick named &quot;Killer-Kalle&quot; for his ruthless, heartless demeanour, seems to have grown into a much more rational, conciliatory figure and has managed to push through an unlikely compromise. Bayern must have dismissed fears of a lame duck scenario in light of challenges that are surely big enough (Champions League second leg against Internazionale and the fight for third place) to keep the players motivated. There is, however, an interesting question about the relationship between Van Gaal and his players. Captain Philipp Lahm reportedly told Nerlinger that the team were still behind the manager, broadly speaking, but Bayern&apos;s chaotic performances have raised doubts within the dressing room. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper summed up the charge sheet perfectly: &quot;Van Gaal is dogmatic without a plan B \u2026 Now that explanations for the weakness of Bayern&apos;s season [World Cup tiredness, Arjen Robben&apos;s injury] are no longer valid, he&apos;s at the centre of criticism. Why did he refuse to invest in defensive players [in the summer]? Why the constant positional changes? Why is he not interested in practising defensive dead-ball situations?&quot; Even his staunchest defenders will have noticed that a certain arrogance has crept into his decisions. In the last few weeks, Van Gaal was moving players across the pitch like pawns on a chessboard. Gustavo was not the only one to play in three different positions in one game. The football professor was convinced his 4-2-3-1 system was so perfect that the personnel did not matter. Sadly, the opposite is true: Bayern&apos;s style has become so entrenched and predictable that more and more teams are able to take the appropriate measures. To make matters worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 the high priest of possession football from Amsterdam has not shown any inclination to develop a defensive methodology worthy of the name. Can he adapt, can he change his ways in time to ward off total collapse \u2013 a defeat to Inter and a Bundesliga finish outside the top three? Bayern clearly feel that sticking with him is the lesser risk. &quot;He has certainly made mistakes,&quot; the Bayern icon Franz Beckenbauer said. &quot;But he&apos;s also shown that he&apos;s a great coach. I prefer him to any emergency solutions.&quot; Maybe but his continued employment can also be seen in a different way: it&apos;s a testament to the sheer size of the crisis. Talking Points \u2022 Dortmund remain firmly on course for the title but they are not exactly champions of efficiency. Robert Lewandowski&apos;s goal was scant reward for 90 minutes of dominance against Cologne. The home side had more scoring opportunities than some teams create in a season. Michael Rensing was inspired in the visitors&apos; goal while J\u00fcrgen Klopp&apos;s men need only five more wins to claim the &quot;salad bowl&quot;. \u2022 Felix Magath&apos;s love for unusual glasses is well documented but this week he took it to a new level. On Friday, the Schalke manager borrowed sport shades from the team&apos;s bus driver (model: Adidas Evil Eye) to hide an infection and he followed that up for the match at Stuttgart on Saturday with a black number that was equal parts Dr Octopus and Belarussian village pimp. The referee Dr Felix Brych was not intimidated. He sent off Benedikt H\u00f6wedes for handball in the box and awarded a penalty that Zdravko Kuzmanovic converted. Brych had not spotted Pavel Pogrebniak&apos;s push on H\u00f6wedes beforehand. Magath called the referee &quot;irresponsible&quot; and even the Stuttgart manager, Bruno Labbadia, felt the red card for the defender had been unnecessary. The decision might strengthen the German FA&apos;s case for a rule change but it will not help Magath deflect too much attention from Schalke&apos;s slide and the increasing discontent with his work within the club. &quot;Magath out!&quot; shouts in the stands led to reports that the board are planning to get rid of him at the end of the season, success in the German Cup and the Champions League notwithstanding. \u2022 Eintracht Frankfurt&apos;s unspeakably bad form since the winter break \u2013 not a single goal in eight games \u2013 has coach Michael Skibbe looking over his shoulder, too. The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper felt that the goalless draw with Kaiserslautern was &quot;the worst performance of the season and in many years&quot;. The game was so poor that even the TV highlights package was unwatchable. &quot;I&apos;m sorry for looking clueless \u2013 I am not,&quot; Skibbe said. This week&apos;s trip to Schalke might be his last game in charge. \u2022 Bayer Leverkusen, easy 3-0 winners over the increasingly dishevelled Wolfsburg, experienced managerial trouble of a different sort. Jupp Heynckes&apos;s continued refusal to sign a new contract \u2013 his deal expires in June \u2013 is now seen in a worrying light. The 65-year-old did not only crop up on the shortlist of possible Van Gaal successors but might also force Bayer into making an uncomfortable choice between his services and those of Michael Ballack. The 34-year-old was hoping to get a chance to impress Germany manager Jogi L\u00f6w on Saturday but withdrew from the squad when Henyckes told him he would not start. According to the manager, Ballack argued he would be better off training instead. The move did not go down well with his team-mates \u2013 Bayer had only four substitutes available \u2013 and the dispute threatens to overshadow Bayer&apos;s excellent run in the league, where they are on course for a Champions League place. &quot;Heynckes, a man who values harmony, is unsure what to make of Ballack,&quot; writes Kicker. &quot;He has a problem with Ballack&apos;s self-image and sees a danger to the peace and quiet he needs to work with his team.&quot; Bild thinks the two parties are heading for a divorce. \u2022 &quot;Babak Rafati,&quot; the Sky Germany reporter revealed, &quot;was voted worst official by the players last season.&quot; It was interesting to hear about the existence of this &quot;wooden whistle&quot; award but no one will have been taken aback by the identity of its recipient. The 40-year-old Rafati&apos;s continued appointments are one of the great mysteries of German football, along with L\u00f6w&apos;s always inch-perfect, never changing, pitch black barnet and &quot;sporting director&quot; Horst Heldt&apos;s exact duties at Schalke. On Sunday, Rafati managed to award a goal when a shot by Hamburg&apos;s Marcell Jansen&apos;s hit the crossbar and bounced down well in front of the line. Hamburg went on to crash to a 4-2 home defeat against Mainz, a result that hampers their European ambitions. Later that evening, the club&apos;s board decided not to renew the contract of chief executive Bernd Hoffmann. The 47-year-old will leave at the end of the year. \u2022 Nuremberg&apos;s 5-0 win over St Pauli has them dreaming of the Europa League and 45,000 fans stayed behind to celebrate the victory with the squad. The stand-in striker Christian Eigler was the man of the match with four goals but the whole team have excelled. &quot;We need five more points to get to our second half of the season target,&quot; said manager Dieter Hecking, &quot;then we can deal with other topics.&quot; In a season where the natural distinction between big and small clubs is rapidly vanishing, Nuremberg are about to spring the biggest surprise of all.

Today, I want to write to educate. I want to do my bit to prevent a tragedy in what I still believe to be the UK&apos;s greatest, most beautiful city. I lived in Edinburgh for my university years and, having got the II:i left for the exotic but equally damp shores of Normandy to pursue a new life in la belle France. But Edinburgh, specifically Leith, drew me back after just two years of smelly cheese and a fantastic lifestyle. I&apos;d only ever visited Leith once before, but The Shore area caught my imagination. It felt like a mini Amsterdam, different from the Edinburgh Old Town in which I&apos;d spent my uni years, but still very much Edinburgh. Its look and feel as the cosmopolitan, fashionable, family-friendly, beautiful industrial zone-turned-home-to-thousands is now under threat from a proposal to construct a biomass power generation plant that will tower above the entire community, and block the skyline for miles. Heart of the Waterfront Filling the view from the Port of Leith pub in Constitution Street, the Michelin Star restaurants of the Shore area, the vista from my own home over in Newhaven harbour and facing off the plush stores of Ocean Terminal, as well as overwhelming the sea view one gets from Arthur&apos;s Seat, I have come across no-one from the thousands of people to whom I&apos;m connected online, or the hundreds I know living in the area, who think its construction in the heart of Edinburgh&apos;s Waterfront is a good idea.  Waterfronts are, in every other city in the world, the place the city can go to breathe, to catch some sea air, go for a walk with the dog, or head out for a night on the shore with friends. If the proposed biomass plant goes ahead, we (those on nights out, but, most important to me, my two young daughters) will be catching unknown pollutants, having our walks dominated (for at least half of the trip) by the double chimney stacks and angular &apos;box&apos; in which electricity is generated. What biomass should do  But what makes this all the more stupendous, is that the biomass plant doesn&apos;t even do what it should do. The Scottish Government have been quite clear on what biomass plants should do:  1. They should generate electricity and heat energy.2. They should be small to maximise efficiency and enable heat use locally.3. They should be off-grid, thus displacing coal and oil use.  The Leith biomass proposal would:   1. Generate only electricity, wasting all the heat it generates2. Be large, and therefore inefficient, potentially cancelling out any eco benefit derived from using biomass instead of traditional energy creation measures.3. Not be off-grid, so making no difference to the effects of local energy consumption.  The Leith biomass plant isn&apos;t going to do what it should do, and what the Government wants it to do. Above all, it&apos;s going to destroy billions of pounds worth of development, of property value, and an incalculable sum in the future of our children&apos;s health. We need more green energy, a lot more, but some energy is greener than others. I&apos;ve joined the campaign to stop it going ahead, and you&apos;ve got a chance to use the template letter to do the same before Friday. Will you?

Margaret Ford, the OPLC chair, said that following last week&apos;s decision by the government and the London mayor, Boris Johnson, to rubberstamp the decision to award the stadium to West Ham and Newham council after the Games it was &quot;pressing on with that as fast as we can&quot;. She added: &quot;There&apos;s nothing that will stop us moving as quickly as we can to get to a financial close there. I&apos;m not expecting anything from the Newham or West Ham side that doesn&apos;t allow us to press right on.&quot; The OPLC and Johnson have invited submissions for a &quot;master developer&quot; to build the first neighbourhood of 800 homes in the north-east end of the park near the velodrome. Ford said it was the first of up to a dozen phases of 8,000 new family homes that will be built on the park alongside new schools, health centres and commercial businesses. The development will be a mixture of flats, mews houses and town houses, with 35% reserved for affordable housing. The first homes will start being built in 2013 in the northern area of the park, which will be marketed as a green, leafy area criss-crossed with canals. The south end of the park, near the Olympic Stadium and the ArcelorMittal Orbit tower, will have a more urban feel with plazas that will host concerts and events. The development will be put out to market in the next couple of weeks, with planning consent due to be granted before the Games and building scheduled to begin straight afterwards. Developers of both the family housing neighbourhoods and the 2,800 apartments that will be converted from the athletes&apos; accommodation, currently being put out to market by the Olympic Delivery Authority, are likely to begin marketing them to the public during the Games. &quot;It is the only area in London where this quantum of family housing has been developed for a really long time. I&apos;m completely determined that this will be housing that will stand the test of time,&quot; said Ford. &quot;We don&apos;t want this to look like Amsterdam or Hong Kong. We want terraces, squares, all the things people love about London.&quot; Ford, who is in Cannes with Johnson at an international property fair to market the homes, said there had been a &quot;phenomenal response&quot; from developers. &quot;This is a huge milestone.

As a well-known supporter of the World Society of Friends of Suspenders (an &quot;organisation of gentlemen pledged to the preservation of traditional ladies&apos; hosiery&quot;) we might have expected the powdered Swiss to insist on fishnets only, with match officials directed to check the seams run straight down the back of the player&apos;s legs. Alas, his cousins in the Fifa family managed to talk him into a tights-coordinated-with-shorts compromise and so we shall never know whether Sepp finds a ladder at the thigh an unbearable infringement of style etiquette, or a bit of a turn-on, though only if the resultantly exposed flesh is unhealthily white and covered in goose bumps. Sport, we are constantly assured, is big business. However, as Sepp has splendidly demonstrated down the decades, the people who run it are small. And so while Fifa delegates took the long walk to the buffet in a courageous battle against snoods, the London 2012 committee was busily formulating its strategy for dealing with the terrifying threat of illegal marketing. Already our capital city is on alert code red with police and volunteers constantly vigilant for groups of apparently innocent-looking young women who could at any minute form up in front of the Olympic velodrome and reveal lettered T-shirts spelling out &quot;John Collier, John Collier, The Window To Watch&quot; or some even more au courant slogan dreamed up by the advertising droids of Soho. It pays to be vigilant, and those so tasked will no doubt take as their watchword &quot;Stuttgart&quot;. For it was in that city during the 2006 World Cup that several hundred Dutch fans were compelled to watch Holland&apos;s victory over Ivory Coast in their underpants. This was not some expression of free-and-easy Amsterdam values, but because security men at the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion had confiscated their lederhosen. As heavy-handedness goes this ranked right up there alongside something that happened to a mate of mine back in the late 1980s when the government crackdown on hooliganism was in full swing. My friend was a Chelsea fan. One November he travelled to watch the Blues play at Ipswich. It was freezing cold but that didn&apos;t stop police at the away end at Portman Road from impounding all the visiting fans&apos; Dr Martens boots for the duration of the game. Mindful of the fact that the supporters couldn&apos;t be expected to stand on the terrace in their stocking feet the constabulary kindly provided each shoeless fan with a cardboard box to stand in. (But you try telling that to the young folk today and they won&apos;t believe you, they won&apos;t.) Since this was Holland the offending lederhosen were, of course, orange. When it comes to following the national team the Dutch go oranje bonkers. En masse it must be said that the Dutch orange is a little strident, but that wasn&apos;t the reason the security men busied themselves with removing the offending lederhosen. No, that was done because the faux-leather shorts carried an advert for a Dutch brewery. Fearful of giving offence to the official Fifa &quot;partner&quot; who had bought the exclusive rights to provide all the gassy I-Can&apos;t-Believe-It&apos;s-Not-Piss excuse for beer in World Cup venues the authorities pounced. Fifa&apos;s Markus Siegler later talked of having thwarted an &quot;ambush marketing campaign&quot;, though clearly he had missed the fact that the lederhosen-less Dutchmen were all wearing garishly patterned Bjorn Borg trunks. The petty lunacy of Fifa&apos;s actions in confiscating the offending shorts should not surprise anyone. Sports governing bodies are obsessed with controlling and manipulating what the world sees via the television cameras. I witnessed this myself at the 1998 World Cup, when I was in Lyon for the Iran v USA match. An hour before kick-off the noise in the stands was already deafening, a shrill chanting from the Iran supporters that David Lacey memorably likened to &quot;a woman&apos;s hockey international at Wembley multiplied by a hundred&quot;. About 15 minutes before kick-off huge banners appeared among the Iran fans. They were protests against the Khatami regime in Tehran from a coalition of dissident groups who championed the opposition leader Maryam Rajavi. More banners appeared and three minutes before kick-off, a large helium-filled balloon with a picture of Rajavi dangling from it drifted across the pitch and over the heads of the players. I looked down at the TV monitor at my workstation, but the balloon did not feature; instead the image being beamed to the world was of some pretty blonde girls with the stars and stripes painted on their comely cheeks. Fifa allows no political protest in its venues. Should any take place the cameras look the other way. And so the world watched a totally different football match from the one those of us in the ground saw. The television viewers didn&apos;t see the protest banners, or the fighting that erupted whenever French police went in to the stands to confiscate them. They had no idea that at the end of the game the riot squad moved in to clear the stands of the dissidents. And as the CRS popped their tear gas and beat their truncheons on their Perspex shields, suddenly, over and above the squeals and yells, came the jolly voice of the PA announcer thanking us all for coming and making this such a joyful and happy occasion on what, he reminded us, was Fifa Fair Play Day. When the announcement was finished my colleague Paul Hayward summarised: &quot;It&apos;s like Hunter S Thompson said: &apos;Who needs drugs when reality&apos;s this weird.&apos;&quot; The confiscation of T-shirts, hats and lederhosen may not be as serious, but it is part and parcel of the whole.", "sentences": ["This was not some expression of free-and-easy Amsterdam values, but because security men at the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion had confiscated their lederhosen."], "title": "Sepp Blatter plays game of follow the lederhosen | Harry Pearson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/mar/11/sepp-blatter-fifa-harry-pearson", "tags": ["Fifa", "Sepp Blatter", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-13T00:02:03Z", "article": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali has produced two genres of writing. First, there is the sharp but programmatic style of her first book, The Caged Virgin, which assaulted the theological foundations of Islam and promoted the rights of Muslim women. While earning her death threats from within the Islamic world, her message has also attracted condemnation from a wide circle of liberal and feminist commentators. For them, her arguments are too stark, too totalising, too lacking in nuance. Then there is her autobiographical writing. Her first memoir, Infidel, tells of her emergence on to the European political stage from a Somali desert culture. Hers is a story of exile from her clan through war, famine, arranged marriage, religious apostasy and the shocking murder on the streets of Amsterdam of her collaborator, Theo van Gogh. Told with lyricism, wit, huge sorrow and a great heart, this is one of the most amazing adventure narratives of the age of mass migration. With Nomad, Hirsi Ali combines her two genres, narrative and polemic. She tells stories that were glanced over in Infidel \u2013 of her father, mother, sisters, brother and cousins \u2013 describing a clan system shattering on the shores of modernity. But the longest shadow is cast by the remarkable figure of her grandmother, who gave birth to daughters alone in the desert and cut her own umbilical cord, raged at herself for producing too many girls, rebelled against her husband, arranged for the circumcision of her granddaughters and instilled in them an unforgiving, woman-hating religion. Hirsi Ali observes that her own nomadic journey has been taken across borders that have been mental as much as geographical. In Nomad she calls her ancestral voices into direct confrontation with her demands for reform of Islamic theology. The result is electrifying. This is not the same as saying she is always right; but when she calls on western feminists to stand with her, to celebrate the better values of the west, and to confront the worst of the abuses perpetrated on Muslim women, it is not clear what more useful thing those feminists might be doing.", "sentences": ["Hers is a story of exile from her clan through war, famine, arranged marriage, religious apostasy and the shocking murder on the streets of Amsterdam of her collaborator, Theo van Gogh."], "title": "Nomad: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations by Ayaan Hirsi Ali \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/hirsi-ali-nomad-personal-journey", "tags": ["Ayaan Hirsi Ali", "Biography", "Islam", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-14T11:24:00Z", "article": " To download all 36 songs in one file click here  ARGENTINA   : Zonaindie Utopians - Pepe Le Pew Utopians is a garage rock band led by singer Barbi Recanati. They usually sound like a wild rampage of 70s-like guitar riffs and distortions, especially on their new album Freak. This song is the exception - an intimate acoustic ballad with Spanish lyrics inspired by a cartoon character.   AUSTRALIA  : Who The Bloody Hell Are They? Seekae - Gnor Seekae's new album +Dome is out on March 25 and I\u2019m super excited since their previous album, The Sound Of Trees Falling On People, is one of my favourite Australian albums of all time. When I say \"I'm super excited\", I am talking on your behalf \u2013 I already have a copy of the album and can confirm that it is fantastic. Gnor, the first 'official' single from the album (presumably because 2010 single Blood Bank features an updated and better mix here), is one of the closest songs to the sound of their debut, making it a good jumping-off point for people looking to get enveloped by their 'ghetto ambiance' all over again.  BRAZIL  : Meio Desligado Nuda - Maruimstad Preparing to release their first album in the coming months, Nuda is a promising band that mixes regional Brazilian rhythms with alternative rock and experimentation. Maruimstad expresses the most exciting facet of the band and shows their ability to innovate while pleasing from the first listen.  CANADA : I(Heart)Music Meligrove Band - Heart Attack Looking for power-pop perfection? Then look no further than Meligrove Band's Shimmering Lights. It's one of those albums from which you could pick a song at random - be it Heart Attack, Bones Attack!!! or any of the other eight tracks without the word \"Attack\" in the title - and you'd be guaranteed to come away listening to one of catchiest tunes you're ever likely to hear.  CHILE : Super 45 Prehist\u00f6ricos - Como Las Piedras Prehist\u00f6ricos formed during the summer of 2010, when actors Tom\u00e4s Preuss and Jessica Romo merged their musical ideas to create a collection of acoustic songs about teenage love. Their debut album La Orquesta Oc\u00falta (\"The Hidden Orchestra\") - released last October and available for free download here - received great reviews, focused mainly on the bright and naive nature of their repertoire. Mentioned in many Latin American media 'best of the year' lists, this duo are one of the highlights from a growing list of Chilean pop bands.  CHINA : Wooozy Omnipotent Youth Society - The Less Than Omnipotent Comedy Formed in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, in the late 90s, Omnipotent Youth Society take their influences from the Blind Melon sort of alternative American bands in the 90s, as well as jazz, blues and psychedelic noise. They released their debut album last year, which has been highly praised by critics and fans.  COLOMBIA  : Colombia Urbana Two Flow - Como Te Llamas Two Flow is a duo consisting of Charly and Fabio, singers from Barranquilla. Como Te Llamas is a collaboration with Punto G, a tropical band from the same city, and was named the No.1 song of the Barranquilla carnival. This combination of tropical and urban flavors have made Como Te Llamas a hit on the radio and in discoth\u00e8ques.  DENMARK : All Scandinavian Powersolo - I Love You But I Hate You It's 10 years since the release of \"donkey-punk\" duo Powersolo's debut album, Lemon Half Moon. To mark the occasion, Kim Kix and The Atomic Child (aka the Railthin Brothers aka Kim and Bo Jeppesen) have released their fifth album, Buzz Human. It's a generally great and always entertaining mash of psychobilly, 60s garage rock, punk, psychedelia, utter madness and catchy hooks.  ENGLAND : The Guardian Music Blog AlunaGeorge - Disobey  Aluna Francis is the one with the impossibly high, breathy-girly vocals and George Reid is the one responsible for the electronic production that seems to be as steeped in pop mores as it is aware of dubstep and R&B techniques. Imagine a 21st century Dollar if they\u2019d formed in the shadows of FWD>>, if you can picture such an exciting proposition. Disobey is a final mix exclusive, so now you can make your own minds up about the duo described variously in our New Band Of The Day column as \"fabulous\" and \"itchily glitchy\".  ESTONIA : Popop Kosmofon - Kvasar Kosmofon is a spaceship built in 2008 and commanded by Martin Laksberg, Rasmus Lill and Marten Kuningas. They listen in their secret laboratory to Sirius and examine neutron stars to open a new dimension to the music of outermost depths of space. Kosmofon's works are the memoirs of heroic astronauts and announcements of thousands and millions of light years formatted into progressive electronic music.  FINLAND : Glue Blackbird - Did I Say That I Loved You? Captain Cougar's Jussi Pet\u00e4j\u00e4 discovered Jenna-Miia Kaivosoja one night while watching TV singing competition Idols. Impressed by her performance of Dolly Parton's Jolene, they started collaborating and making real music. Now with the addition of keyboardist Matias Tyni, they have formed Blackbird to create a surprising combination of folk and bubblegum pop. If this first song is a good indication, their debut album due out in the summer will be catchy, cheesy and fun.  FRANCE : Yet You're Fired Young Michelin - Les Copains Young Michelin is a four-piece band led by Romain Guerret, an accomplished solo artist who made two albums under the name Dondolo. Signed to American label Holiday Records, they are trying to merge their 90s English indie-pop influences with the use of French language. Inspired by The Wake, The Field Mice and labels such as Sarah Records, they aim to make music that is simple and honest, and succeed brilliantly, as this instrumental shows.  GERMANY : Blogpartei Silent Portraits - Mama Music recorded in one take always has the charm of authenticity. And music recorded with lo-fi equipment in a bedroom can have wonderful results. As you listen to Silent Portraits, you feel the raw energy behind these sketches. Imperfect, powerful and benign, Maxi's voice and reverbed guitar create a warm and somewhat melancholic soundscape reminiscent of PJ Harvey or Becky Lee. You can download the other songs of this unsigned Berlin-based artist via MySpace or Bandcamp.  GREECE : Mouxlaloulouda Zebra Tracks - Isabelle Creeps Zebra Tracks collect their darkest impulses and put them on stark display. The single Bicycles / Isabelle Creeps brims with their vehement energy and constitutes an intriguing step in the evolution of their simple, yet oddly affecting, and certainly promising sound. A start-to-finish rush of invigorating riffs and pointed narratives that heightens with repeated exposure. A thrilling, incontrovertible evidence of their bright future.  ICELAND : Icelandic Music Maffia Ikea Satan  - The Wait The trio Ikea Satan plays satanic blues-metal. Unnar Kolka drums, P\u00e9tur \u00dalfur plays guitar and sings, and Hannes \u00de\u00f3r plays bass. The Wait is taken from their three-song Sound Of The Planet EP, released last year on Icelandic label Ching Ching Bling Bling.  INDIA : Indiecision Bombay Bassment - Hip-Hop [Never Be The Same] Mumbai electro rockers Bombay Bassment have lofty ambitions. Their brand of hip-hop meets drum 'n bass meets funk takes on established conventions of those genres - a careful mix of curated samples, some pro MC chops and an affinity to bass-driven melodies. Hip-Hop [Never Be The Same] puts those ambitions front and center. This is a band that's sure-footed and ready to, as cliched as it may sound, \"make it to the top\". We're certain they have the chops to do just that.  INDONESIA : Deathrockstar Amazing In Bed - Circle Amazing In Bed never stop growing as they keep making music with new approaches and refuse to take notice of critics. And now, even if we are able to trace the roots of their garage-punk songs, we still understand and recognize them as Amazing In Bed.  IRELAND : Nialler9 We Are Losers - Cheerleader The brainchild of Gavin Elsted, who has been joined by members of Super Extra Bonus Party and Grand Pocket Orchestra, We Are Losers have been directing shafts of sunshine lo-fi indie-rock into ear canals for the past six months. Cheerleader is a fine example of what the band do best. Catchy choruses, a hint of 50s pop, handclaps and happy melodies.  ISRAEL : Metal Israel Sonne Adam - We Who Worship The Black Jens Prueter, head of A&R at Century Media Europe, puts it best: \"We are proud to sign a young band from Tel Aviv, Israel that knows the meaning of death unfortunately better than most of us. Sonne Adam mix the old doom/death of early Paradise Lost and technical insanity of early Morbid Angel with a fresh passion and raw energy that reminds me of the hunger and dedication I heard 20 years ago, without sounding retro.\" Black Sabbath dirges mix with rabid speed to create an aural monstrosity. Check them out.  ITALY : Polaroid Casa Del Mirto - Faces Let's put aside the obvious comparisons to Washed Out and Neon Indian. Yes, you can call Casa Del Mirto 'chillwave' or 'glo-fi', but I feel the songs have a different mood, something more intimate, melancholic and familiar. Not to mention those gorgeously brilliant sounds. Casa Del Mirto is the project of Marco Ricci, from Trento. His new album, 1979, is out now on Mashhh! Records.  MEXICO : Red Bull PanameriKa To\u00f1o Tranquilino - Candyflip Hipekinetik is the solo album of To\u00f1o Tranquilino (drummer of stoner rock band Yokozuna), in which he explores many other forms of making music. Its sound tastefully blends 60s Brazilian psychedelia and heartfelt folk songs, led by a jazz-influenced piano. Candyflip stands out on the introspective 12-piece set, as a cathartic moment in his captivating relief which eventually becomes a self-discovery quest.  NETHERLANDS : Unfold Amsterdam Blues Brother Castro - Walk In The Park Few Amsterdam rock 'n' roll bands play with the same swagger and passion as Blues Brother Castro. Be it onstage or on record, their sound is typically raunchy guitars, waves of energy and savage calls. From beneath their well-worn 90s indie overcoat emerges elements reminiscent of Rob Tyner's howl, Ron Asheton's growl and even James Brown's scowl. It's been almost five years since they\u2019ve had new songs to showcase, but their third album, Out On The Beach, will be released via Excelsior Recordings on April 4.  NEW ZEALAND : Einstein Music Journal Orchestra Of Spheres - Boltzmann Brain Otherworldly psych and alien trance unite in Orchestra Of Spheres' hypnotic jams. The group has been entrancing audiences in their native Wellington and further afield for years, and never fail to leave jaws hanging at their free-spirited but tightly-wound motorik dance. Live, they're a spectacle of concept costumes, handmade instruments including a cake tin guitar and rack of keyboard foot pedals played by hand, and look as though an alien troupe descended the stage. Boltzmann Brain will induce in you their contagious mystic madness.  NORWAY : Birds Sometimes Dance Sandra Kolstad - The Devil Sandra Kolstad is a young woman who will release her debut album, Crux, in the spring. There's already quite a buzz around her here in Norway and this summer she'll play one of our biggest festivals, \u00d8ya. Her music is characteristic, peculiar electro-pop with a finesse that many other artists lack. Maybe it's her education in classical piano, maybe it's her gift at writing. I don't know, but I can hear hints of another great artist who masters both classical and indie, Owen Pallett, as well as traces of Fever Ray, Jenny Hval/Rockettothesky and maybe Dirty Projectors.  PERU : SoTB Futuro Incierto - Fue Ayer Futuro Incierto is one of the most symbolic Peruvian hardcore bands. Fronted by Pedro Allemant, their 20 years of melodic punk are proof of the musical experience they have gained. For their most recent record, Ego, some problems arose that forced them to re-record the content, yet it resulted in the best album of their career. In this work, the songs delve deep into personal themes, mature feelings and the conflicts caused by ego.  PORTUGAL : Posso Ouvir Um Disco? Mazgani - Beggar's Hands Shahryar Mazgani was born in Iran but moved to Portugal when he was just five. In 2005, Mazgani was considered one of the 20 best new European acts by French magazine Les Inrockuptibles. He has three albums and 2010's Song Of Distance, where this month's track is taken from, was acclaimed by the Portuguese media as one of the best rock records of the year.  ROMANIA : Babylon Noise Robin And The Backstabbers - Soare Cu Dinti Robin And The Backstabbers made their debut almost a year ago in Bucharest. The guys mix indie with what they call 'melodramatic pop' and the result is an upbeat nostalgic sound that gets to you in the best ways. They have released two singles, both very well received by the public and underground radio stations. This is their third one and, by the sound of it, I'm sure it's going to be another success.  SCOTLAND : The Pop Cop Little Eskimos - Start It Up You'd never guess that Little Eskimos' anthemic debut album Are You Still With Us? (available on Bandcamp) is the work of just one man - chief songwriter Kevin Harper played all the instruments and recorded it himself before getting a band together. Little Eskimos clearly owe a huge debt to the West Coast slacker rock sound, and the infectious Start It Up will leave you counting the days until their second album comes out in the summer. Keep up with them on Facebook in the meantime.  SINGAPORE : I'm Waking Up To... Caracal - Bears Brazen smatterings of post-hardcore and hard rock are the name of Caracal's game, something they do exceptionally well. There are shades of Underoath, Fugazi and mewithoutYou all over their straight-shooting, swashbuckler of an album, Bear. Shark. Wolf. Even if the music's genre isn't your cup of tea, one thing you can never fault this young band on is how proudly they wear their hearts on the sleeves, beating loudly for all the world to sit up and take notice.  SOUTH AFRICA : Musical Mover & Shaker! aKING - The Runaround When aKING embarked on their new album in 2010, they were ready to explore and venture into new territory. The Runaround, the first single from the band's third studio album The Red Blooded Years, shows off their formula of acoustic rock, distinctive vocals and riffs. There are also new sounds and influences that have crept in, with a distinct 80s feel shining through on many of the new tracks. The change has taken aKING to new heights.  SOUTH KOREA : Indieful ROK J Rabbit - aMorejo Super-lovely duo J Rabbit has been gathering a bit of attention since November last year when they first started posting music on YouTube via friendz.net. In March, the two girls released their first album, It's Spring, and they are now hoping it can provide their audience with delight and fresh energy. Supported by an acoustic guitar, aMorejo is a sweet song with lyrics that'll stick even if you can't understand the words.  SPAIN  : Musikorner Oso Leone - Rebellion Formed in Majorca, Oso Leone started to make their name at Levi's Unfamous Music Awards contest, in which they were finalists. They didn't win, but they were chosen as the supporting band for These New Puritans' Spanish tour and later signed to Foehn Records, home of Spanish indie acts such as Emilio Jos\u00e9 and Marina Gallardo. Using structures similar to Vic Chesnutt's, echoes of Americana and contemporary folk go hand in hand on their music and show that the boys are just a breath away from success.  SWEDEN : Swedesplease Impo & The Tents - Bubblegum Machine Punk-inspired garage rock from Stockholm's Impo & The Tents. Not much else to say about something so simple and forceful.  SWITZERLAND : 78s Cryptonites - Hey Kidz The two blokes behind Cryptonites surely do not intend to diminish the power of any superheroes. On the contrary, their objective is to strengthen young kids with their electrifying sound. With their new EP Hey Kidz in stock, these two sound manipulators might just accomplish their mission because the four-track material is a bona fide crowd pleaser. The centerpiece Hey Kidz is the heart and soul of the release on Freakz Me Out.  UNITED STATES : I Guess I'm Floating Cloud Nothings - Understand At All Cloud Nothings has it all: DIY bedroom charm, memorable melodies and jangly guitar work lost somewhere in an era of grunge and punk rock. This solo project from the outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio, packs a punch live too \u2013 something I plan on seeing for myself this month.  VENEZUELA  : M\u00fasica y M\u00e1s Planeador - El Regreso Planeador is a rock band with influences of folk, country and blues formed in Anzo\u00e1tegui in 2006. After playing at major festivals around the country, they finally released their first album in April 2010, which launched the single El Regreso. It has remained on the playlist of several radio stations with the video rotated on MTV Latin America. They are currently working on their second studio album.

Nicknamed De Lange (Big Man), he was a distinctive figure: &quot;A long, slim, elegant man with a silver scarab hanging from a thong round his neck and small, blue scars, like a miner&apos;s, on his forehead,&quot; as the Observer&apos;s Geoffrey Nicholson described him in his heyday. Post was born in Amsterdam. His father was a butcher. He turned professional in 1956 and, as a road cyclist, is best known for his victory in the cobbled one-day Classic Paris-Roubaix race, which he took in 1964 at an average speed of 45.131kph for the 265km, then a record speed for any single-day race, and still that race&apos;s fastest average. Post won the Tours of Holland, Germany and Belgium, but his true forte was track cycling. He won 14 European titles and dominated the winter six-day races, marathon events run on indoor tracks. He won 65 of the 155 events he started, earning himself the nickname &quot;Emperor of the Sixes&quot;. After his retirement from racing in 1972, he was offered the team manager&apos;s job at Raleigh. Post&apos;s teams went on to win virtually every major one-day race in the world and a total of 55 stage wins in the Tour de France. He was ranked the second most successful team boss in cycling history. The man ahead of him, Lomme Driessens, had an advantage: he managed the brilliant Eddy Merckx. Raleigh had been trying for two years to break into European professional cycling, but with little success. Post was to change that by creating a whole new philosophy, &quot;total cycling&quot;. Since the rebirth of professional cycling after the second world war, the most successful teams had been structured around a single leader of outstanding talent with the rest of the riders allotted the role of worker, putting personal ambition aside to assist the leader. The downside was that this structure was dependent on one man, who could have a bad day, or a puncture at a key moment. Under the system Post evolved at Raleigh in the mid-70s there was no number one: every rider had the opportunity to win races. The team worked together to ensure victory for the best man on the day. That called for all-rounders capable of taking the initiative, such as Hennie Kuiper, Jan Raas, Gerrie Knetemann and Eric Vanderaerden.Post&apos;s Raleigh team won the 1980 Tour de France with Joop Zoetemelk, and that year&apos;s stage-victory count \u2013 11 out of a possible 25 \u2013 reflected their collective strength. Post&apos;s teams were almost unbeatable in the Tour de France&apos;s team time trial stages from 1976 to 1982. After Raleigh ceased sponsorship in 1983, Post found a new backer, Panasonic. His squad retained a Dutch core but included Britain&apos;s best Tour rider to date, Robert Millar. &quot;Post ran the team like an army; he was like a schoolteacher,&quot; said Millar. Most professional teams today are modelled on the hydra-headed structure perfected by Post, and the success of Raleigh and Panasonic led to a boom in Dutch cycling. His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Marion. \u2022 Peter Post, cyclist and team manager, born 12 November 1933; died 14 January 2011", "sentences": ["Post was born in Amsterdam."], "title": "Peter Post obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/14/peter-post-obituary", "tags": ["Cycling", "Netherlands", "Tour de France"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-17T09:48:58Z", "article": "&quot;Anyone else here prepared to admit that they&apos;re \u2013 not the best?&quot;, Zoe Lyons inquires. At almost 40 and with little to show for it \u2013 at least according to her introductory spiel \u2013 Lyons is an underachiever. That&apos;s easy to believe in the early stages of her set, which find her twittering pleasantly but unambitiously about daytime TV and the cosiness of her leopardskin snuggie. But if these 75 minutes of observational, anecdotal standup don&apos;t add up to an adventurous show, they&apos;re marked by highly accomplished technique and ever funnier jokes. The minor obstacle to overcome is a certain facile quality to Lyons&apos; shtick, whereby \u2013 despite the air of self-revelation \u2013 she seems to be saying things because they&apos;re reliably funny, not because they&apos;re true. I don&apos;t claim that a Perrier award nomination or a recent appearance on Michael McIntyre&apos;s Roadshow means you can&apos;t also be an underachiever, but that pedigree inclines one to take her claims with added salt. Then there&apos;s her too-obviously-confected rage about old people, and her routine about drunkenly packing cannabis on a return trip from Amsterdam, which would be more effective if she didn&apos;t claim to have packed the trouser press too. But Lyons has personality and real skill, which defy you to dismiss her show as standup-by-numbers. Yes, the subject matter can be hoary \u2013 a trip to a nudist beach is familiar comic territory. But Lyons maxes it up, first with a lurid word-picture of a septuagenarian bending to gather shells (&quot;fish are jumping out of the sea, trying to kill themselves&quot;), then by recounting her encounter, while reluctantly butt-naked, with her fully clothed girlfriend&apos;s fully clothed friends. It&apos;s all brought to life with incandescent dismay at life&apos;s cruel and absurd turns \u2013 but also with a consummate control of tone, as when Lyons drops her voice and quivers with fake emotion to describe a souvenir thimble she found at Ayers Rock. And there are some rock-solid gags too, including a fine one about Van Gogh and his lopped-off lug. I&apos;m happy to agree that, in her own words, Lyons isn&apos;t the best \u2013 but on this evidence, she comes a close second.", "sentences": ["Then there&apos;s her too-obviously-confected rage about old people, and her routine about drunkenly packing cannabis on a return trip from Amsterdam, which would be more effective if she didn&apos;t claim to have packed the trouser press too."], "title": "Zoe Lyons \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/17/zoe-lyons-comedy-review", "tags": ["Comedy", "Stage", "Culture", "Comedy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-17T22:44:00Z", "article": "There&apos;s always been an aura of mystery to Alban Berg&apos;s Lyric Suite. We didn&apos;t learn the strange details of its story until long after Berg died, but in fact they were right there all along, written out but hidden in impossible musical codes. Alban Berg wrote the suite in 1926, just as he was developing a secret, obsessive passion for a woman called Hanna Fuchs-Robettin \u2013 the work&apos;s real dedicatee, despite its public dedication to composer Alexander von Zemlinsky. We know now, thanks to letters and an annotated score made public in the 1970s, the lifelong extent of Berg&apos;s obsession. Fuchs-Robettin was married to one of Berg&apos;s friends, and he would often write to them both in separate letters. There&apos;s something distinctly Austrian about this\u00a0kind of triangulation: the Viennese loved dissembling, loved the romance of\u00a0deceit and covert goings-ons. Berg was fascinated with social morality (or lack thereof). I&apos;m sure he found a fair degree of excitement in the illicit, artistic act of writing those letters. Bizarrely, the role of postillon d&apos;amour \u2013 delivering all of Berg&apos;s letters to Fuchs-Robettin by hand \u2013 fell to Theodore Adorno. Why the famously dry philosopher played go-between remains a mystery; Adorno never wrote about it himself. Perhaps the involvement had something to do with Berg&apos;s wife, Helene, who was a dark and domineering presence in the composer&apos;s life. I visited Berg&apos;s apartment in the 1980s and found Helene had kept it unchanged since his death, as if a testament to her lasting control. Adorno was a close friend to Berg; maybe he helped because he knew\u00a0they gave relief from such a heavy-duty home life. Berg&apos;s lust was never consummated, though it&apos;s clear in the letters that he wanted it to be. In fact, there&apos;s no sign Fuchs-Robettin ever even replied. Regardless, he continued writing to her until he died in 1935. Over the years, the letters become more bitter and resentful, but the Lyric Suite dates from the wide-eyed beginnings of his infatuation: the music is a gift to Fuchs-Robettin. In\u00a0many respects Berg&apos;s annotated score \u2013 discovered by George Perle in 1976 \u2013 is a gift to us, albeit an unintended one. Hardly ever are we given such explicit and intimate firsthand description of a composer&apos;s hidden meanings. The markings show it all: themes depicting her, themes depicting him, themes depicting the tragic love of Wagner&apos;s Tristan and Isolde. In this light, the piece is extremely theatrical. It is the theatre of Berg&apos;s mind. So when I came to direct a staged production of Lyric Suite, I wanted to create an event that would draw the audience beyond the music&apos;s surface moods and into this shocking, murky theatre. I&apos;ve worked with the dramaturgist Janine Brogt to create a text from Berg&apos;s letters to Fuchs-Robettin, to her husband and to others. It is spoken by a single actor \u2013 Jeroen Willems, an incredibly charismatic figure on stage \u2013 who represents Berg\u00a0himself. His passages are woven between the suite&apos;s movements; we never interfere with the score. But as there&apos;s no conductor on stage (the Amsterdam Sinfonietta will be led by its\u00a0first violinist), Willems plays the spiritual role of conductor, too. It\u00a0seems\u00a0appropriate that the narrative in essence directs the music. Is there a problem in imposing Berg&apos;s private drama so overtly on to the performance? I don&apos;t think so. As soon as you know the story, you start imposing it on to the music \u2013 but at an ordinary concert performance the drama would be in your head as you listened rather than on stage. What we&apos;ve done is an adaptation of the Lyric Suite, an interpretation. Sometimes it&apos;s worth trying something a bit different,. Pierre Audi was talking to Kate Molleson.

Over 20 dimly-lit, subtitled hours, The Killing&apos;s plot\u00a0simmers, startles and slowly unravels, as cops Sarah Lund and Jan Meyer pace Copenhagen&apos;s streets. They interview, re-interview, then thrice harangue witnesses, each time gleaning fresh &quot;truths&quot;. We observe Nanna&apos;s mourners make mental headway with shock, anger, bargaining, depression. Lund&apos;s obsession with catching this grim, meticulous murderer, giving closure\u00a0to Nanna&apos;s parents, becomes\u00a0our obsession, too. I love Lund; she&apos;s the sort of better woman I dream to be, shunting her love life, parenting-guilt and planned move to Sweden into the &quot;Emotional crap to deal with&quot; pile as\u00a0she bids to\u00a0change Denmark for the greater good. I love her grooming regime: hot water, nicotine replacement gum and an elastic band. I love her nifty skill in zoning out criticism, warnings and mind games, especially from her own nagging mum. Lund challenges the scary, gruff patriarchs of Copenhagen&apos;s politics and top-rank police, headbutting the truth until old alibis dissolve, fierce loyalties are disrupted and the most innocent faces give way to guilt. While British cop shows are festooned with screaming and snottering, Lund and\u00a0Meyer deal aloofly with each triumph. Emotions run high, but rarely show on anybody&apos;s face. Each time the credits close, one is left with fewer hard facts and more befuddling questions. In a television age where tweet-along programming is king, The Killing requires good, old-fashioned &quot;phone switched off&quot; and &quot;staring straight ahead&quot; concentration. Oh, the irony. A TV show that no one can tweet about \u2013 or chat about for fear of &quot;spoilers&quot; \u2013 is so far one of 2011&apos;s biggest hits. Grace Dent The Killing, season one, is out on DVD\u00a0on 4 April. The must-see films For a tiny country, Denmark often punches above its weight and that&apos;s certainly true for film. Not since Lars von Trier slapped audiences around the face with Breaking The Waves and his subsequent Dogme pranks (who could forget The Idiots, in which a bunch of Copenhagen suburbanites pretended to be mentally disabled?) has Danish cinema been so talked about. Director Susanne Bier scooped this year&apos;s Oscar for best foreign language film with In A Better World, a\u00a0compelling drama about two schoolboys choosing between pacifism and violence, while Janus Metz&apos;s war documentary, Armadillo, records life at a Danish-British base in Helmand. If there&apos;s one thing that unites these two most-hyped exports, it&apos;s their determination to scuff up Denmark&apos;s reputation as the &quot;nicest&quot; nation in Europe. With a storyline that begins with playground bullying and takes in infidelity, bereavement, evil warlords and revenge, no one could accuse Bier of dodging the Big Issues. Her drama unfolds with a kind of relentless calm \u2013 huge African skies and flat Danish waters fill the screen even as the emotional screws tighten on the boys and their families. Bier has said the plot was engineered to question the cosy stereotype of her homeland as &quot;an harmonious society&quot; and a\u00a0&quot;blissful&quot; place to live. Minefields, real and ethical, also run through Metz&apos;s nonfiction work, which has shocked Denmark by showing its international &quot;peacekeepers&quot; as brutal killers. Armadillo has been compulsory viewing in that country \u2013 especially for the government, which has now set up an inquiry into the war crimes it may or may not portray. Liese Spencer Armadillo is released in the UK on 8 April. In A Better World is out in August.  The hot gastronomy     Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, chef at the best restaurant in the world, Noma, in Copenhagen. Photograph: Ty Stange for The Guardian    After a long, demanding day of Machiavellian political manoeuvring in episode 12 of The Killing, prospective Copenhagen mayor Troels Hartmann rewards himself with a chill-cabinet pepperoni pizza. But if he really wanted to prove his commitment to his city, he&apos;d be eating New Nordic. The food world&apos;s latest crush, the New Nordic culinary movement, was spearheaded by deeply photogenic young Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi. His restaurant, Noma, opened in Copenhagen in 2004 and the fact it now holds two Michelin stars and was last year voted into top spot in the San Pellegrino World&apos;s 50 Best Restaurants awards indicates he might be getting something right. The philosophy behind his menus is &quot;local, seasonal&quot; \u2013 of course it is \u2013 but Redzepi takes a hardcore approach, refusing to cook with anything that doesn&apos;t come from his home region. So &quot;nej, tak&quot; to olive oil, garlic, tomatoes and foie gras, but &quot;ja, hvorfor ikke&quot; to largely foraged ingredients such as marsh violets, silver birch sap, bulrushes and, perhaps more challengingly, cod milt (sperm). There&apos;s no point in pretending this type of cooking isn&apos;t ludicrously ripe for parody, but it&apos;s also delicious and kind of thrilling. Over here, fellow Dane Christoffer Hruskova, having started out at his first London restaurant, Fig, is continuing to riff on the New Nordic theme at his second place, North Road, applying Noma&apos;s zero-tolerance policy on olive oil and garlic, and its fondness for foraging and ancient cooking techniques (smoking, salting and pickling), to ingredients available in Britain. Jenny McIvor  The classic design     PH 50 lamp, \u00a3481, from Skandium.    Peek through the windows of any Danish home and chances are you&apos;ll\u00a0see one or all of the following classics: Poul Henningsen&apos;s flying-saucer PH lamp, a Series 7 chair by Arne Jacobsen, a Bang &amp; Olufsen TV\u00a0and a set of Georg Jensen cutlery. Danes are rightly proud of their rich design heritage, in all its functional, well-crafted, minimalist glory, but\u00a0the result is that almost every home\u00a0looks the same. &quot;We&apos;re such a small country,&quot; says\u00a0Poul Madsen, chief executive of\u00a0Normann Copenhagen, a well-known contemporary design company. &quot;If a lamp or chair is even\u00a0modestly successful, it means\u00a0most people own it.&quot; Such is the influence wielded by these masters, it can be hard for younger designers to find their own style. &quot;These old guys from the 50s and 60s really put Denmark on the map, but designers often feel their weight a bit too much,&quot; Madsen says. Those who are most successful, says Peter Bonn\u00e9n, founder of Muuto, another young design brand, take the functionality and craftmanship of Jacobsen et al and add a 21st-century twist.

Hannah Booth The most-wanted fashion     Jumper, 280 euros, from Gudrun & Gudrun    We&apos;ve had to wait a while for female detective chic to move to the next level, but Sarah Lund&apos;s cream-and-black Scandi knit is the unsung star\u00a0of TV drama The Killing and has, in one perfect knitwear coup de grace, ended the hitherto unassailable dominance of the DCI Jane Tennison skirt-suit and trench look. Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l, who plays Lund, has said the casting of the jumper is perfect because it shows that her character is at home with herself and isn&apos;t in thrall to the-woman-in-a-man&apos;s-world idea that forces many wardrobe departments to put female cops in suits. Well, there&apos;s that, and there&apos;s also the fact that the jumper just rocks. It looks lived-in but not\u00a0grungy, slightly 70s but not embarrassingly retro, and is perfectly pitched at the Alexa Chung end of the nerdy spectrum. No wonder knitwear specialist Gudrun &amp; Gudrun, which sells the jumper for \u20ac280, can barely keep up with demand. If you don&apos;t want to shell out on the original (spring is coming, so it&apos;s not the wisest moment to overspend on wool), there are still a lot of Fair Isle options on the high street. A man&apos;s in XS will give you that Lund look if you can&apos;t find the right one on the women&apos;s rails. If the classic Scandi knit has given you a taste for the Danish look full stop, the labels to investigate are Day Birger et Mikkelsen for bohemian glamour, M\u00faus by Malou Sander for simple leathers and R\u00fctzou for quietly chic dresses. Choose classic stuff \u2013 Malene Birger does the perfect blue shirt, R\u00fctzou has the loveliest simple pocket dress. Like Lund with her jumper, you&apos;ll never want to take them off.

Norwegian writer But what true enthusiasts know is that Denmark is where the real action is. While bleak, hypnotic thriller The Killing continues to enthral viewers on BBC4, Jo Nesb\u00f8&apos;s Oslo-set Harry Hole novels have been racing up the book charts both here and abroad, and this spring we are to be treated to Denmark&apos;s top crime writer, Jussi Adler-Olsen. Mercy, the first in his &quot;Department Q&quot; trilogy, has spent more than a year on bestseller lists in both Denmark and Germany, and film rights have been snapped up by trilogy-fan Lars von Trier&apos;s production company. Out here in May (Penguin, \u00a36.99), the novel sees troubled detective Carl M\u00f8rck setting up a department for unsolved cases. Or, as he sees it, &quot;a home for hopeless cases&quot;. His first investigation is into the disappearance of a missing politician, presumed dead, but in fact imprisoned. It features all the hallmarks Scandi-book fans have come to adore \u2013 complicated politics laced with a frisson of sexual tension, a disenchanted detective and coffee-fuelled crime-solving. But what set apart this recent rash of Danish tales are their credible characters. Where the novels of Patricia Cornwell and TV shows such as CSI almost fetishise gore and material evidence, Mercy and its ilk focus on narrative, motive and a refreshing dollop of social commentary. While never shying away from the gruesome, the\u00a0Danes are employing an age-old secret ingredient: gripping storytelling.

DB&apos;s ambition to launch a Teutonic Eurostar has been threatened by French objections to the state-of-the-art rolling stock it plans to use in the tunnel. David Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, are believed to have raised their concerns about the row with the French government, amid fears that it will hinder the growth of pan-European high speed rail services. However, this week the European Railways Agency is expected to endorse new trains manufactured by Siemens, the German industrial group, which beat France&apos;s Alstom to a coveted Eurostar rolling stock order. The order for inter-city express (ICE) trains, which will also be used by DB in its Frankfurt-to-London service, met with opposition on the other side of the tunnel. The French government supported Alstom&apos;s argument that the Siemens trains are unsafe because their motors are distributed under each carriage. The row split the Anglo-French intergovernmental commission (IGC) on channel tunnel safety, which resulted in the ERA being asked for a second opinion. Sources close to the process said the ERA is likely to recommend that so-called &quot;distributed power&quot; trains can be used in the tunnel, clearing the way for the ICE carriages. It is also understood that the report will not raise objections to DB&apos;s proposal to couple two separate trains \u2013 a proposal that raised safety concerns in some quarters. As a consequence, the IGC is expected to come under further pressure to allow the ICE trains to operate through the tunnel.

The brother of the conductor Semyon Bychkov, he emigrated to America in the mid-1970s but went on to hold a number of posts in Europe, performing regularly in both continents, as well as Asia. Born in Leningrad, he studied under the influential teacher Ilya Musin. Making his home in the US in 1976, he took up conducting fellowships at Tanglewood, studying with Leonard Bernstein, Seiji Ozawa and Erich Leinsdorf, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, where he worked with Michael Tilson Thomas. He won first prize in the Leopold Stokowski conducting competition (1986), and took the posts of music director of the Krefeld Opera and Lower Rhine Symphony Orchestra (1988\u201394). He was then appointed general music director of the Komische Oper, Berlin, where he collaborated with Harry Kupfer. There he conducted 10 new opera productions as well as orchestral concerts, winning an award from the German music critics&apos; association. In his latter years with the company, he fell foul of the political debates regarding funding of the various artistic institutions in Berlin. Kreizberg argued passionately that the house should be able to stage large operas, including those of Wagner and Verdi \u2013 his Don Carlos there was a statement of intent \u2013 and that it should receive adequate funding accordingly. Rival intendants in the city thought otherwise, and Kreizberg left in 2001. During the same period, however, he had made a considerable impact in Britain as the principal conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra (1995\u20132000), taking the orchestra to Carnegie Hall, the Vienna Musikverein and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. He made his debut with the New York Philharmonic in 1999, and also conducted the Philadelphia, Boston Symphony, Chicago Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras, but never succeeded in securing the music directorship in the US that his supporters felt he deserved. His British operatic debut was at Glyndebourne in 1992 with Janacek&apos;s Jenufa, when he impressed critics and audiences alike by bringing an ideal blend of incisive ferocity and searing lyricism to the score. He was equally successful when returning six years later with K\u00e1tya Kabanov\u00e1. His direction in other repertoire, including Mozart, could sometimes seem unduly hard-pressed, and his Rosenkavalier for ENO (1994), for all its vigour, lacked an innate feel for the blend of voices and instruments. In 2003 he was appointed chief conductor and artistic adviser of the Netherlands Philharmonic and Netherlands Chamber orchestras. In conjunction with these ensembles and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, whose principal guest conductor he became in the same year, he made recordings for PentaTone Classics, including well-received accounts of Shostakovich and Dvorak symphonies, the Symphony No 4 by Franz Schmidt and a number of discs with the violinist Julia Fischer. Also in 2003 he made his debut with the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Mahler&apos;s Symphony No 2 at the Barbican. He worked also with the BBC Symphony, London Philharmonic and Philharmonia orchestras. In 2009 he became music director and artistic director of the Monte Carlo Philharmonic. His warm personality and perceptive conducting also made him a great favourite at the BBC Proms. He was married to the American conductor Amy Andersson, with whom he had two sons.

The latter, written by Janine Brogt and directed by Pierre Audi, awkwardly dramatises music not intended for the stage. Berg wrote Lyric Suite for string quartet in 1926, reworking three of its six movements for string orchestra two years later: the remaining three are added here in a 2005 scoring by Theo Verbey.

Written for Argentinian cellist Sol Gabetta, this hauntingly beautiful work is among Van der Aa&apos;s finest. Gabetta, in a print frock, sits among the black-clad orchestra, spinning out a rapturous song without words, while on screen a similarly dressed older woman creeps furtively to a disused house to use an old, unspecified piece of electronic equipment.

Next year, however, when he starts primary school, he will get his first lessons in sex education, during the so-called Lentekriebels week \u2013 the Dutch word for &quot;spring itching&quot; or &quot;spring butterflies&quot;. This is not a joke, nor am I bringing up my offspring in a hippy commune. We live in a quiet middle-class neighbourhood in Amsterdam. Lentekriebels is a government-subsidised project for children aged four to 12. This year&apos;s Lentekriebels has just finished, with an exhibition about relationships and sexuality in hundreds of schools all over the Netherlands. My son won&apos;t bring home the leaflet &quot;Sex Yes, Worries No&quot;, about the use of contraceptives, until he is at least 10. He wouldn&apos;t be able to read it at the moment anyway. But his teachers will be talking about cuddling, friendship, newborn lambs in the fields and the differences between boys and girls. And his class might be visited by pregnant women and nursing mothers with their babies. The Netherlands has a lurid reputation abroad when it comes to sex. Everyone knows about the red light district in Amsterdam and legalised prostitution. So it might come as a surprise to some to hear that deep down, the Dutch are very conservative people who take sex seriously. Very seriously, in fact. Sex education has traditionally been an important part of the school curriculum here. Lentekriebels is in line with the Dutch tradition of assigning to schoolteachers responsibilities that might elsewhere be handled within the family. As my teacher in primary school in the 1970s told me: &quot;If your parents don&apos;t bring you up properly, our school has to do the job for them.&quot; The issue then was not sex but prayer (we didn&apos;t pray at home), but the principle is the same. Parents are not to be trusted to do a good job and sex is a danger zone, like drugs or smoking. To discuss it at school from an early age will make young people aware of the many risks when they start to experiment with relationships and sexuality. Dutch sex education doesn&apos;t stop at Lentekriebels. I remember vividly the little grey-haired lady with the large handbag who came to my high school to talk about &quot;the first time&quot;, true love, the effects of alcohol and how to use a condom. I was 14 and we all found it great fun. And the lessons went on until my final exams: prostitution, reproduction, sexually transmitted diseases \u2013 we were spared nothing. There is much to be said for the Dutch approach. Official figures show that the pregnancy rate here among teenage girls, 5.3 per thousand, is one of the lowest in Europe. The explanation is believed to be the open approach towards sexuality. And we see similarly low numbers when it comes to abortions and STDs. The UK, by comparison, has a teen pregnancy rate that is nearly 400% higher and a much higher abortion rate. In an attempt to make sense of these figures, we can turn to Nick Hornby&apos;s novel Slam, in which 16-year-old Sam gets his girlfriend, Alicia, pregnant. On the internet he finds government statistics about teenage parents:   And some of them were funny \u2013 like, one in 10 teenagers couldn&apos;t remember if they&apos;d had sex the night before or not, which is pretty incredible if you think about it. I think this meant that one in 10 teenagers had got so blasted the night before that they didn&apos;t know what had gone on. I don&apos;t think it meant they were just forgetful, like when you can&apos;t remember whether you packed your games kit.  Dutch teenagers are probably just as sexually active as British ones and may even drink as much. But thanks to the priority given to sex education, Sam&apos;s Dutch equivalent can go skateboarding without worrying whether he has knocked up his girlfriend. \u2022 This article was commissioned after being suggested by 13thDukeofWybourne.

School had prepared them well since, besides the usual subjects, there were courses in practical maths, technical drawing, woodwork, metalwork and citizenship. The system was excellent and turned out quality craftsmen and technicians, so what went wrong? The shift away from traditional industries, the establishment of comprehensive schools, and the raising of entry qualifications by professional bodies all contributed to its demise. But most damaging of all was the blinkered view of politicians and their mistaken belief that all kids are academically orientated. The old system wasn&apos;t perfect, but we should have at least looked at its merits before it was dumped. Perhaps, one day, sanity will prevail and we will re-establish highly professional vocational education and training to meet the new industrial challenges instead of squeezing more unfortunates into the current academic morass.

Rosemary Hewlett Canterbury, Kent  Ecstasy is far from harmless You recently reported: &quot;There is no evidence that ecstasy causes &apos;brain damage&apos;&quot;, in an article based on a new study by Halpern and colleagues (News). We were rather surprised, since in hundreds of our research publications we have presented reliable scientific evidence for cognitive and other deficits in ecstasy users. Furthermore, the Halpern study in Addiction does indicate significant cognitive impairments. Their ecstasy-user group was a highly selected sample, yet despite this careful pattern of drug usage, the users displayed several neurocognitive deficits. They occurred in psychological functions known to be sensitive to MDMA, such as memory and higher cognition, while depression was also higher in the heavier users. Turning to the wider question of &quot;brain damage&quot;, MDMA primarily affects the neurotransmitter serotonin. Several large studies have indicted &quot;serotonergic neurotoxicity&quot; in ecstasy users. The most recent showed significant reductions of Sert (the serotonin transporter) in every region of the cerebral cortex. The extent of these Sert reductions was associated with lifetime ecstasy use and the degree of neurocognitive deficit. Halpern and colleagues have shown that mild cognitive deficits can occur even in light and relatively careful ecstasy users.

This is the message in the House of Ulysses, as revealed in the latest collaborative fusion between English National Opera and the Young Vic. The hero, back home from one of those journeys from hell lasting 10 years and involving epic encounters with one-eyed giants and lotus-eaters, strips off and takes a power shower. This redemptive cleansing, nearly the final visual coup in Benedict Andrews&apos;s staging of Monteverdi&apos;s The Return of Ulysses \u2013 and despite some clever lighting leaving little to the imagination in case you wondered \u2013 comes after an accumulation of domestic activity: peeing, getting dressed, dealing with the aftermath of a massacre and cooking an omelette, not necessarily in that order In the intimacy of the Young Vic, a venue which seems to have a special gift of reining in and sharpening the more sprawlingly proportioned ENO, this had urgent, if doubtless to many irritating, impact. Andrews, an Australian theatre director, achieves shock impact by assaulting the senses, especially the visual. The use of big screens, as here projecting real-time close-ups, is already an operatic cliche which fights with the action and is best ignored. Stillness is an alien notion. Why stand on the spot to deliver your big, sensuous, ornamented aria when you could run, thrust your groin or, in one case, take your knickers off? That said, and despite a mild impression of yet another director thinking powdery old opera needs pepping up, it worked, though I doubt for everyone. This is a powerful, muscular, &quot;hey, count the hours we spend in the gym&quot; kind of show. Lingering reservations are blown away by the grit and intense energy of the performance. Conducted from the harpsichord by the brilliant Jonathan Cohen, the small ensemble of ENO and specialist theorbo, lirone and harp players made this music shimmer and blaze. The cast combined experienced ENO regulars, including Diana Montague as the nurse and Nigel Robson as Eumete, with newer talent (notably Thomas Hobbs as Telemaco, Ruby Hughes as Minerva) to gripping and traumatic effect. As the grieving Penelope, Pamela Helen Stephen was remarkable; all too credible in her exploration of loss, bold in physicality. She overcame occasional vocal weakness with a mesmerising, uninhibited performance. Her revealing dresses and teetering five-inch heels provoked no evident self-consciousness, despite being hugely shown on screen. When her cheap-suited suitors (all well sung) throw coloured confetti over her, she looks terrorised, as if tarred with feathers. This is one of many striking images, together with helium balloons, child puppet, grotesque clown mask and an upturned flour bag, in Bork\u00fcr J\u00f3nssons&apos; designs, lit by Jon Clark. Tom Randle, in wonderfully flexible voice as Ulysses, communicates with emotional directness. Restored to royal power in a sharp suit, he bears an uncanny resemblance to Barack Obama. Power, war fatigue and gun crime feature discomfortingly in this updating, set in a revolving glass house sleek with Mies van der Rohe leather and chrome, sickly with bowls of white lilies. It&apos;s a concept, yes. Yet it speaks with clarity. The same cannot be said of Peter Brook&apos;s free adaptation of Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, here called A Magic Flute. At 86, with 60 years of invention behind him, Brook&apos;s work at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des bouffes du Nord in Pars is reaching a close with this cuisine minceur version of Mozart. The empty stage, dreadlocks, long poles and jagged storytelling are familiar and often beautiful Brook traits, seen in 11 and 12 last year. Is this Flute opera or theatre? Is it an introduction to or a dissection of Mozart&apos;s original? I can find no way of answering these questions except in the negative. This difficult but enchanting late masterpiece has been reduced to marionette stiffness, its earthiness cleansed, its music parched to desiccation. The act of reduction is not in itself a problem, or a blasphemy. Brook&apos;s The Tragedy of Carmen took liberties with Bizet to brilliant effect. But if you remove, so must you add. Seven singers and two actors give a &quot;lite&quot; account of the plot. Franck Krawczyk played his piano score, a monochrome tutti frutti of Mozartian keyboard effect, elegantly enough in a corner with the lid down. It had all the tinkling hush of a clavichord, the instrument Handel used to play at night when his family was asleep. It gave no hint of the grandeur or scope of Mozart&apos;s operatic genius. In the dry acoustic of the Barbican theatre the voices sounded pinched. The other cast may have been better. Antonio Figueroa&apos;s Tamino had a good, virile purity. Papageno (Virgile Frannais) managed to raise smiles. The character of the Queen of the Night became, if you can believe it, quite normal. At the end, and in a single moment of magic, actor Abdou Ouloguem cleverly lost his flute. I had already lost marbles, patience and the will to live. The wasted evening might have been better spent on a second visit to Peter Maxwell Davies&apos;s enthralling Kommilitonen! (Young Blood), given its world premiere at the Royal Academy of Music in a crisp production by David Pountney, who wrote the libretto, incisively conducted by Jane Glover, the college&apos;s director of opera. The three-stranded plot entwines stories of student unrest in wartime Germany, Maoist China and civil rights in America, mirrored by stylistic distinctions in the music. With a large cast, onstage marching band, jazz trio and Chinese erhu player, it lent itself to student performance but also deserves, if ever practicable, a wider audience. How satisfying to have a full-scale opera written with the fluency of a composer who, at 76 and with several early theatre works to his name, understands the stage. Pastiche is skilful and immediate, only the showy top strata of a many layered and subtle score. Each singer (I saw the second cast) deserves credit. It would be invidious, given the work&apos;s ensemble character, to single any out. Did it matter that James Meredith, the activist specifically famous for being black, had to be played by a white singer? No, inasmuch as the story carries meaning for the human rights of all mankind, and no in that it was right to draw from the student talent available rather than import. It must have been a tricky question to resolve. But this bold adventure, a co-commission between the Royal Academy of Music and the Juilliard School, New York, has paid off. With bad timing, Kommilitonen!&apos;s first night clashed with the UK premiere of Up-Close for cello, string orchestra and film by the Dutch composer Michel van der Aa. Cellist Sol Gabetta and the Amsterdam Sinfonietta played the evocative, lyrical score, which made atmospheric use of electronics, at one side of the stage. On the other, a silent film of an older woman running through woods to an empty house offered a puzzling narrative. Gabetta and woman at times echoed each other. Eventually they find the same old-fashioned standard lamp and, as it were, everything is illuminated. It was a richly intriguing affair, the sort of thing that sounds dreadful and pretentious when described \u2013 words which could more aptly be applied to Pierre Audi&apos;s &quot;staging&quot; of Berg&apos;s Lyric Suite in the first half.

After a furious row over pay packages at Amsterdam-based ING in which thousands of customers threatened to make mass withdrawals, the Netherlands is now vying for the title of Europe&apos;s most bonus-hating country. A growing Dutch political storm could end with a blanket ban on bonuses to financiers who work for institutions bailed out by the taxpayer. ING customers mobilised on Twitter and other social networks to protest at bonuses paid to bosses at the bank, one of the biggest in the country. The threat of direct action raised the spectre of a partial run on ING, terrifying the Dutch establishment. Fred Polhout, union organiser at the bank, says: &quot;People were outraged. We heard about the bloated sums being paid again in the City and in New York; but suddenly the issue exploded on our own front door.&quot; Compared with the packages awarded to bankers in the US and UK, the Dutch bonuses were small potatoes. Jan Hommen, ING&apos;s chief executive, was due to receive a \u00a31m bonus \u2013 a pittance when you consider that Stephen Hester, head of state-controlled RBS in the UK, is in line for up to \u00a37.7m, Bob Diamond of Barclays is to collect as much as \u00a36.5m, and some senior bankers at Goldman Sachs and JP\u00a0Morgan are looking at windfalls of about \u00a340m each. &quot;Perhaps we are so upset because we are a small country that prefers to set an example, rather than follow others,&quot; suggests Polhout. So severe was the public reaction to Hommen&apos;s bonus that within days he had agreed to waive the award and told other ING directors to do the same. Now the Netherlands is going through a painful period of introspection and soul-searching. Politicians have voted to implement a 100% retrospective tax on all bonuses paid to executives at institutions that received state aid as a result of the financial crisis. In other words, no banker should get a bonus until the debt is cleared, and they should return payments made since 2008. ING was thrown a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.7bn) lifeline to stop it going under, while ABN Amro was nationalised. Numerous other Dutch financial firms received capital support, including Aegon, SNS Reaal and ASR Nederland. On the streets of Amsterdam, there is little sympathy for the bankers. Emma Rohl, who works at an English bookshop in the city centre, says: &quot;They shouldn&apos;t get bonuses at all. Why should people be paid vast sums for going into work and doing their jobs? It&apos;s utterly ridiculous.&quot; Erick Koenig at a nearby restaurant says: &quot;We rescued the banks from their own follies, and now they expect to be paid extra. I think they should work for free for at least five years.&quot; At a dusty office in a northern suburb of Amsterdam, Henk van der Kolk, head of the country&apos;s biggest trade union, FNV Bondgenoten, does nothing to conceal his frustration: &quot;Everybody is angry about what happened at ING. The board isn&apos;t in tune with public opinion. What were they thinking of? ING pensioners have seen their payouts frozen, while many employees were awarded a pay increase of just 1%.&quot; Van der Kolk&apos;s union is pushing for a law that would ensure that executive pay should never amount to more than 20 times the wage paid to the lowest-salaried employee. As for bonuses, the union feels payouts should not exceed 50% of a director&apos;s salary. Hommen&apos;s bonus was worth 92% of his \u20ac1.35m package. &quot;Remuneration for bankers was linked to financial machismo, which encouraged irresponsible lending. We want to get away from the bonus culture,&quot; says van der Kolk. But given the payouts to ING directors were relatively small, some Dutch bankers are shocked they have received another public mauling. One ING insider suggests the country was in the grip of a &quot;typically Dutch Lutheran and Calvinist backlash&quot; which cultivates the view that excessive wealth is somehow morally reprehensible and in contravention of traditional Dutch, Christian values. The source says: &quot;We went through this during the boom when ministers railed against stock options and bankers were accused of exhibitionism, and enriching themselves to the detriment of the nation.&quot; The bankers&apos; response that high remuneration is vital to retain talent and prevent Dutch financiers from defecting to overseas banks is given short shrift by Polhout. He says: &quot;Let them go abroad if they don&apos;t like it her;, there are plenty of clever people who will take their place and work for less. Good riddance, as far as I am concerned.&quot; Moderate opinion in Holland seems united in its belief that banks which received state aid should not be shelling out bonuses. And Dutch parliamentarians are saying the same thing, demanding the government take immediate action. ING may have made a net profit last year of more than \u20ac3bn, but it still owes the taxpayer \u20ac5bn. The uproar against Hommen&apos;s bonuses and those earmarked for the bank&apos;s senior executives have forced ING to rethink its position. Hommen promises no more bonuses till 2012/13 when the bank expects to have repaid all state aid. In a letter to Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, he said: &quot;We have underestimated the signal we sent to society. [We] have [risked] renewed damage to the recovering trust of our customers.&quot; Few doubt a critical factor behind ING&apos;s volte face was the boycott threatened by consumers. A spokesman for the bank admitted the payment of bonuses &quot;prompted a reaction from our customers via emails and telephone messages to our call centres&quot;. But he said only a few hundred people had actually closed their accounts. Now the ball is in the court of finance minister Jan Kees de Jager, who must decide how to respond to a proposal by parliament calling for the return of bonuses by all executives at state-supported banks. On a recent television show, he said such a law would be difficult to implement and would hit bankers on average salaries who receive bonuses of just a few thousand euros. But in today&apos;s highly charged political atmosphere, de Jager knows that doing nothing is probably not an option.", "sentences": ["After a furious row over pay packages at Amsterdam-based ING in which thousands of customers threatened to make mass withdrawals, the Netherlands is now vying for the title of Europe&apos;s most bonus-hating country.", "On the streets of Amsterdam, there is little sympathy for the bankers.", "I think they should work for free for at least five years.&quot; At a dusty office in a northern suburb of Amsterdam, Henk van der Kolk, head of the country&apos;s biggest trade union, FNV Bondgenoten, does nothing to conceal his frustration: &quot;Everybody is angry about what happened at ING."], "title": "Campaign via social media networks blocks Dutch bankers' bonuses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/27/dutch-bankers-bonuses-axed-by-people-power", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "European banks", "Netherlands", "Banking", "Europe", "World news", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-27T20:31:00Z", "article": "&apos;Spain is different,&quot; the tourist board once touted. It\u00a0is also complicated. Although a lot of energy, confidence and black money swirled around the Spanish art world over the past quarter of a century, today something is wrong. However lively Madrid or Barcelona might look, and a visit to any regional city greets you with a spanking new public art gallery, something is missing. For all the late dinners and cocaine nights, gleaming museums and prestigious international shows, there is an air of crisis. &quot;The party&apos;s over,&quot; Manuel Borja-Villel, director of the Reina Sof\u00eda museum in Madrid told me. Previously director of Macba (Museu d&apos;Art Contemporani de Barcelona), Borja-Villel is Spain&apos;s most influential museum director. He sees the current economic crisis as an opportunity, even if it is an unwelcome one. There is talk of cuts of up to 50% in the arts. How can art institutions compete with hospitals and education, whatever the talk of the necessity of culture? From the 1980s until recently, new museums by big-name architects opened all over Spain. Private foundations opened their doors and savings banks formed international art collections, setting up cultural centres as part of their social remit. As I write, I am installing a show for a cultural centre run by the Caja Madrid bank. Around the corner, queues line up for the Prado museum, for the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection and for the Reina Sof\u00eda, Spain&apos;s largest and liveliest museum of contemporary art, which opened in 1990. Private galleries flourish \u2013 and sometimes struggle \u2013 in the small streets behind the museums. Spanish institutions have always been prey to changes in government, with money and museum directors coming and going whenever political change happens at national, regional and even municipal levels. By achieving greater autonomy, the Prado has extricated itself from this damaging cycle, and the Reina Sof\u00eda is set to follow. The two museums now have a far more fruitful collaborative dialogue than the Tate and National galleries in London have ever had, co-ordinating exhibitions and lending works to each other. Regional and smaller Spanish institutions are less\u00a0protected. In the early 1980s, the Iberian peninsula felt far from the centre of the arts world, and both Spain and Portugal put a great deal of effort into building new artistic institutions. &quot;We used to think that media attention and crowds coming through the doors was the signal to success and social usefulness,&quot; says Borja-Villel. &quot;We mistook our place in the world. We imagined we had centrality. But we were never the centre. Spanish art institutions and artists were like good, diligent students. We didn&apos;t realise that there is no centre any more.&quot; But the real problem is a deeper one. Art itself, the only real indicator of cultural vitality, has somehow lagged behind. Going round shows here for over a quarter of a century, I keep thinking it should be better. Why is painting so lousy here? Why is so much meek and secondhand? Of course there are always exceptions, but you often have to leave Spain to find them. Which partly explains why so many of the best Spanish artists have always left \u2013 not just to escape the former dictatorship. Ambitious artists of the post-Franco period, such as Juan Mu\u00f1oz and Pepe Espali\u00fa, moved to London, Paris, New York. Turner prize contender Angela de la Cruz took off in the mid-1990s. Ambitious young artists still leave. &quot;Everyone should, at some point,&quot; said Borja-Villel. Paloma Polo, still in her 20s, escaped a conservative, moribund university art school in Madrid as soon as she could. &quot;It was like a handicrafts school,&quot; she told me from Amsterdam, where she now lives. &quot;There is no real scene of young artists in Madrid,&quot; she added, paradoxically putting part of the blame on the grants and prizes young artists have been given. &quot;They get big-headed, even though in the end they&apos;re unambitious to be anything more than local artists. No one outside Spain knows or cares about them. I\u00a0knew from day one I had to leave.&quot; A mountain range of the mind Unlike the UK, there are few alternative spaces, warehouse shows or ad hoc events in Spain. Those that take place are treated with suspicion. The sense of collaboration, which had certainly existed in the heady days of the 1980s, when I started coming here, did not last long. The sense of being part of a larger art world is somehow still stalled by the Pyrenees, though it is a mountain range of the mind. Spain has few serious collectors, and those who only began collecting a few years ago are giving up. They&apos;re broke, Catalan artist Ignasi Aball\u00ed told me. Aball\u00ed is surviving the downturn. He&apos;s showing everywhere from S\u00e3o Paulo to Ikon in Birmingham. &quot;The only way to survive is to show outside Spain,&quot; he said. This was true of artists like Mu\u00f1oz, too, who died in 2001. He lived and worked near Madrid, but developed his career outside Spain. The economic downturn is making everyone reassess the place of visual art in Spanish culture. Projects both modest and grandiose are floundering. La Caixa, a Catalan savings bank, has recently donated its collection to Macba. The future of another new project, the Can\u00f2drom contemporary arts centre, still being built on a neighbourhood dog track in Barcelona, is stalled. An overblown new &quot;city of culture&quot;, designed by architect Peter Eisenman on the outskirts of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, eats millions of regional euros and looks unlikely to be completed anytime soon. Cities and regions look for the miraculous &quot;Bilbao effect&quot;, the kind of urban and regional regeneration bought about by Frank Gehry&apos;s Guggenheim museum in that city, but it is an elusive panacea. Elsewhere in Galicia, Marco (Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo), housed in Vigo&apos;s old panopticon prison, is having problems. They&apos;re soon mounting Spain&apos;s first show of Scottish artist Martin Creed, but the programme is slowing down. &quot;[To us], 100,000 fewer euros is the same as a \u20ac1m cut for a bigger institution,&quot; Marco&apos;s director I\u00f1aki Martinez, told me. Martinez was also recently appointed president of Spain&apos;s Association of Directors of Contemporary Art. &quot;Artists are the ones who are suffering most,&quot; he said. &quot;The first thing that is revised is the acquisitions policy. Many public Spanish collections have been blocked, others have reduced their capacity to develop and build their collections. No one knows for certain what is going to happen next with regards to the cultural activity of the savings banks. There are a number of foundations dedicated to the work of single artists that are questioning their continuity.&quot; Chillida-leku, the foundation dedicated to the legacy of Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida, in the Basque region, has recently closed. &quot;Spain has rushed to create a cultural infrastructure which previously did not exist,&quot; says Martinez. &quot;In many cases it was carried out without planning, giving priority to the container, not the content, and now we do not know what to do with all these buildings. The\u00a0current situation simply demonstrates the result of the politics of waste and showbusiness.&quot; Borja-Villel remains optimistic. &quot;Smaller institutions need to find their own identity,&quot; he says. He sees the development of a sense of real communality as a solution. &quot;The question is how to use these spaces in a different way. We cannot be alone any more, we are living through a change in history, and must not be afraid to make mistakes.&quot; Better questions and better mistakes would seem to be the answer. Spain&apos;s five hottest artists Ignasi Aball\u00ed (Barcelona, 1958) is an heir to the spirit of conceptualism. Signature works include listings made up of newspaper cuttings and his explorations around\u00a0colour. Dora Garc\u00eda (Valladolid, 1966) will represent Spain in the Venice Bienniale. Her work has a complex performative dimension originating in her interests in literature and the conflict between reality and\u00a0fiction Lara Almarcegui (Zaragoza, 1972, pictured) investigates the relation between nature and urban landscape. She recently weighed and recorded the\u00a0open spaces of different\u00a0cities. David Bestu\u00e9 (Barcelona, 1980) and Marc Vives (Barcelona, 1978) are a good example of how the young generations look at the art of the 60s and 70s from an ironic perspective. Their sardonic approach has strong echoes of Dada. Paloma Polo (Madrid, 1983) has a profound interest in the cinematic. Her latest work evolves around the subject of light as a metaphor for the emergence of knowledge in the modern era.

Last year he completed a long expedition that offered him particular intellectual pleasure: he was on board the Dutch clipper Stad Amsterdam as it retraced the route of HMS Beagle around the world, from Plymouth to Salvador de Bahia to the Gal\u00e1pagos and on \u2013 &quot;the most important voyage ever made,&quot; he insists, &quot;far more so than man&apos;s journey to the moon&quot;. He was recruited as one of the presenters of a documentary series made by the Dutch broadcaster VPRO to celebrate the 150th anniversary of On the Origin of Species. Not surprisingly, O&apos;Hanlon, a figure of legendary bonhomie with a huge knowledge of natural history, became the star of the show. (Watch the YouTube footage entitled &quot;Rough Cut: Redmond on Alfred Russel Wallace&quot; for a display of his erudition.) His enthusiasm is catching: he would, he jokes in one early episode, have done anything to be on board, even become a stowaway. As a schoolboy, he read On the Origin of Species in bed with a torch; his first published words were about Darwin; he even grew his side-whiskers in homage to him. &quot;If I could choose a century to live in,&quot; he reflects, &quot;I would certainly choose the 19th, the best of all times, when there was still a whole world to discover.&quot; Yet O&apos;Hanlon is celebrated most of all for his perilous jungle mountain treks and exhausting paddles through river swamps \u2013 for sucking out monkey&apos;s eyes and dancing, drugged, for local tribes. In short, for having a really, comically terrible time. Isn&apos;t a trip among scientists on a well-equipped clipper a little tame? Rather, as perhaps befits a 64-year-old, he&apos;s delighted with the comforts of film-making, in contrast not only to the rigours of previous adventures, but as a way of circumventing the agonies of writing: &quot;It&apos;s all done for you: no more privations, no more suffering, never being alone, no chance to get really depressed, a lot of drinking. Wonderful.&quot; Sailing around the world is, after all, still boys&apos; own stuff, and O&apos;Hanlon, mischievous and laddish but very learned, became popular with the crew. The series shows him as something of an eccentric throwback, contentedly leafing through Robert Chambers&apos;s Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, consulting Lyell&apos;s Principles of Geology on the shores of Cape Verde and lying in a hammock turning the pages of other august volumes, which turn out to be deteriorating rapidly in the sea air. He isn&apos;t even irked that the wind blew off several pages from his precious first edition of On the Origin of Species: &quot;It was worth \u20ac40,000, and nothing now, but then again I got it for \u00a35 in the 1970s, before Darwin had been rediscovered.&quot; Each of the wonderfully recounted jungle adventures that made O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s name is centred on a near-impossible quest \u2013 to find a rare rhinoceros (Into the Heart of Borneo, 1984), to reach one of South America&apos;s highest peaks (In Trouble Again, 1988), and to catch sight of Lake Tele&apos;s mythical dinosaur (Congo Journey, 1996). For the Beagle series, he sets out on another quest, to Bacan Island, Indonesia, to spot the emerald-breasted bird of paradise known as Wallace&apos;s standardwing. Though hardly one of his sustained exercises in self-deprivation, the night-time journey has a familiar ring: &quot;the hills are nothing but mud, you scramble your way up, and slip down again. I thought I was definitely going to die.&quot; But with dawn came the successful sighting of the plumed bird, and into the bargain O&apos;Hanlon suffered the very direct sexual advances of a female orangutan (&quot;her hair was so soft . . . I still dream about her now and then&quot;). On previous expeditions, he contracted malaria and numerous other illnesses; this journey, too, was marked by a medical emergency. He is fond of sleep (his friend Ian McEwan likens him to Oblomov, Goncharov&apos;s character who refuses to leave his bed) and, travelling back on the plane, was exhausted after his Indonesian exploits: &quot;I&apos;m used to lying around all day with the cat.&quot; He slept for 17 hours straight and developed deep-vein thrombosis. In hospital he was visited by James Fenton, with whom he made the trip to Borneo in 1983. As O&apos;Hanlon tells it, Fenton smuggled himself into the ward, breaking all the rules preventing visitors. The poet doesn&apos;t recall any infraction, but then &quot;Redmond has a way of remembering these things, so . . .&quot; O&apos;Hanlon has long had a public profile in the Netherlands, but was chosen as a presenter of the Beagle series in large part thanks to his Dutch publisher, Emile Brugman. Brugman has, over the years, heard hundreds of O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s hair-raising anecdotes, but began to despair that he would ever read the autobiography for which he had long hoped. So he sent a Flemish journalist and travel writer, Rudi Rotthier, to tape hours of conversations with his author and write up a sort of ghosted memoir, with commentary. (&quot;Emile said: well, if you&apos;re not going to write, we know you can certainly talk.&quot;) Published in 2009 as God, Darwin en natuur, it reminded the TV producers of O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s extraordinary presence and assured him a passage on board the Stad Amsterdam. The book has now been translated and is published in Britain this month as The Fetish Room: The Education of a Naturalist. It is definitively not an O&apos;Hanlon production, but is notable for its sustained exploration of a different, more troubling side to the writer, who often appears a little unhinged in his books as he delves deeper into the discomforting unknown, but always for the sake of a telling the tale afterwards. For The Fetish Room, O&apos;Hanlon undertakes another, differently traumatic, journey \u2013 back to his childhood house, his school (Marlborough College) and Oxford. He&apos;s been recounting much of the book&apos;s substance for years to friends and interviewers: being beaten by his mother; his evangelical parents burning his books when he was a student (they considered them &quot;vile, indecent, an absurd waste of time&quot;); the self-immolation, aged 24, of his close friend Douglas Winchester (O&apos;Hanlon keeps the remains of his charred foot in a Maxwell House coffee jar). But assembled together here, in a more pedestrian context, they bring into focus someone who admits having found it hard to keep, in his own phrase, &quot;on an even keel&quot;. He is candid about his depressive tendencies and lightly calls himself an &quot;alcoholic&quot;. McEwan says O&apos;Hanlon is &quot;remarkably unchanged&quot; since the mid-70s: &quot;he has this wonderful carapace of comedy that protects a very serious spirit; there&apos;s all the mischief, fun and fizziness, but inside there&apos;s a darker quality.&quot; Julian Barnes, in his memoir Nothing to Be Frightened Of, relates his admission to his friend &quot;R&quot; that he thinks a great deal about death. The response came back: &quot;Your death-thoughts seem HEALTHY . . . Mine are v. v. sicko. Always have been = DO IT NOW type. Shotgun-in-mouth. Much improved since the Thames Valley Police came and removed my twelve-bore because they&apos;d heard me on Desert Island Discs. Now only have [his son&apos;s] airgun. No good. No blasto. So we WILL HAVE OLD AGE TOGETHER.&quot; The environmentalist Tim Flannery, meanwhile, admits to being &quot;a little scared of Redmond at times, especially of being in the bush with him. On our last adventure on the Hawkesbury River near Sydney, we were kayaking when we almost lost him to a quaking pit of bottomless mud, after he inexplicably upset his kayak. &apos;I&apos;m sunk up to my failing penis,&apos; he moaned over and over as I tried to haul him in.&quot; O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s house in Oxfordshire is notoriously messy and chaotic, with tilting piles of books and drifts of magazines: his attempts to tidy it up bring on panic attacks. When he moved to the house, he felt it necessary exactly to reproduce the look of his previous study; otherwise he felt unsafe. He likes to stack up around himself everything he has ever valued, as if he fears it&apos;ll all be taken away: stuffed animals, skulls, a giant pelican, a mummified frog, hundreds of photographs of pygmies, a pair of buffalo horns and lots of cabinets \u2013 for beetles, butterflies, birds&apos; eggs and an alarming spider. (Will Self included a description of the cottage in his novel Great Apes \u2013 a &quot;great simulacrum of his own mind&quot;.) And then there&apos;s the fetish room . . . O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s father was a believer in natural theology, and encouraged his son&apos;s interest in birds and entomology. The writer remembers the view from the vicarage study window, &quot;the yew, the bushes where we played jungles, the huge copper beech, the conker tree, and . . . a stream where I&apos;d catch minnows in Lucozade bottles baited with bread.&quot; When he was four, playing in the garden, a mistle thrush&apos;s egg fell to the ground in front of him. It was a magical, life-transforming moment. &quot;I thought that God had given me a present . . . For the first time in my life I comprehended how wonderful birds were.&quot; It took On the Origin of Species to remove his thoughts of religion; it was another &quot;revelation \u2013 Darwin liberated me from God.&quot; O&apos;Hanlon was hopeless at maths, so didn&apos;t read science at university, taking English instead. He was rusticated from Oxford for writing a druggy, supposedly pornographic novel (&quot;I didn&apos;t know enough for it to be properly pornographic&quot;), but used his time away from college to get married to a fellow student, Belinda Harty \u2013 they&apos;ve now been together for 44 years and have two children. Belinda opened a successful clothes shop, which over four decades helped them pay the bills (in the 60s it was, according to rumour, used by Howard Marks to launder the money from his drug deals). Having got a distinguished first, O&apos;Hanlon was briefly a don, but was sacked after he taught his students literature from the wrong century. His doctorate on Conrad and Darwin took him seven years (Galen Strawson, a former friend, speaks of 36-hour sleep cycles and barbed wire on the stairs), but he was by then part of a remarkable group of writers which used to meet fortnightly at Fenton&apos;s house: it included Barnes, McEwan, Craig Raine, Christopher Hitchens, Martin Amis and Timothy Garton-Ash. On one occasion O&apos;Hanlon took along Bruce Chatwin, who was keen to impress. He &quot;did everything he could to attract Fenton&apos;s attention. [In a high plaintive voice]: &apos;When I visited Somerset Maugham, we were standing by the pond. He took me from behind and fucked me on the spot.&apos; Fenton opened a lazy eye. Then shut it again.&quot; O&apos;Hanlon recalls McEwan in hippier days, driving an MG with a &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; sticker on the back. They still go on walks together, the novelist in awe of the naturalist&apos;s ornithological prowess, the naturalist noting that the novelist is &quot;disgustingly fit and extremely competitive&quot;. O&apos;Hanlon told Rotthier that he is &quot;happy that my friends are doing so well. Their value in the stock exchange of public esteem rises year by year. In that respect, I have made the best investment in friendship that you can imagine.&quot; When his friend Jeremy Treglown took over the editorship of the TLS in 1981, O&apos;Hanlon became natural history editor, a position he held for decades and clearly loved. He is still amazed that &quot;EO Wilson and Stephen Jay Gould . . . would listen to me and be prepared to do what I asked&quot;. He seems eventually to have become a kind of Father Christmas figure in the office, distributing Crunchie bars and Flakes on his monthly visits, as well as proving an unparalleled source of gossip. Fenton recalls that, around this time, when he first suggested an easy jungle-walking trip to the east, O&apos;Hanlon wasn&apos;t sure he could do it. Having been convinced, however, he &quot;really got the bit between this teeth&quot;, trained with the SAS and planned a journey that was, the poet says, &quot;wildly illegal, physically impossible and incredibly expensive&quot;. The route they eventually followed \u2013 up the Baleh River through a primary jungle unexplored by westerners since the 1920s \u2013 was merely &quot;foolhardy&quot;. They faced, among other delights, headhunters, wild boar ticks and a bowl of spaghetti that turned out to be parasitic fish worms. The poet suffered in another way, too \u2013 from the fact, as McEwan puts it, that the comedy of O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s books &quot;derives from taking along a companion and watching him suffer&quot;. Fenton himself sums up the method as &quot;it&apos;s not enough to succeed; somebody else must be seen to fail&quot;. A few years after the Borneo trip, O&apos;Hanlon asked Fenton to come with him on another expedition, this time to the Brazilian rainforest. The poet&apos;s reply to his friend is now renowned: &quot;&apos;Are you listening seriously?&apos; &apos;Yes&apos; &apos;Are you listening comfortably?&apos; &apos;Yes.&apos; &apos;Then I want you to know,&apos; said James, shutting his eyes and pressing his palms over his face and the top of his bald head, &apos;that I would not come with you to High Wycombe.&apos;&quot; Instead, O&apos;Hanlon asked along an old &quot;boozing mate&quot;, Simon Stockton, a casino manager, who cracked halfway through the expedition and returned home. A similar thing happened to the American zoologist Lary Shaffer, who accompanied O&apos;Hanlon to the Congo. Undermined by bureaucrats, made ill by eating rancid elephant meat and attacked by armies of ants, Shaffer declined O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s invitation to accompany him on the journey&apos;s final leg. Before they parted, he wrote a note that he asked O&apos;Hanlon to sign: &quot;I, Redmond, declare that I am going on the Lake Tele death trip of my own free will and hereby forgive Lary his escape.&quot; Forging ahead after Shaffer&apos;s departure, O&apos;Hanlon enters his own heart of darkness and becomes dislocated from reality; he comes to depend on a magic talisman, a lump of string and monkey fur wrapped around the severed finger of a dead child. O&apos;Hanlon always speculated that his travels were connected to a Protestant notion of virtue in suffering. To write his next book, he set out to face &quot;the ultimate fear&quot; and so sailed on an Orkney trawler to Arctic fishing grounds in the depths of winter. Claustrophobia, anxiety and sleep deprivation turn the narrative of Trawler (2003) into another spellbinding but unnerving study of derangement. As the trawler&apos;s net brings up strange, monstrous beasts \u2013 sea bats, snotfish, translucent giant octopuses, hideous hagfish \u2013 traumas emerge from the depths of the fishermens&apos; subconscious. O&apos;Hanlon had long been recognised as a great talker (&quot;I did Wogan six times \u2013 whenever somebody hadn&apos;t turned up. I was told only Joan Collins did more&quot;), but writing became increasingly hard \u2013 and hard, too, on his family. McEwan says that a page of one of O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s books represents about a week of his writing life. He writes at night \u2013 partly because this is when &quot;books come off the shelves and speak to you directly&quot;, and partly for fear of interruption. &quot;You are en route somewhere, on a journey, and in your imagination you experience it more intensely than when you were really there. If someone opens the door or asks a question at a moment like that, it&apos;s like being shot in the head.&quot; In The Fetish Room, O&apos;Hanlon tells Rotthier he has given up writing, yet he says now he &quot;might have to&quot; take up his pen again, because &quot;they want me to write the official book of the clipper&quot; (he has in fact already started it). And he is at work on a new TV series on naturalists, which requires much reading and research. Darwin is yet again proving a source of inspiration. &quot;I love every second,&quot; he says in his cabin on the Stad Amsterdam. &quot;I feel comfortable in my limited space and fear that if I leave the ship for too long or go too far, it may sail without me, and that then I would be lost in the real world that I have been trying to escape all my life. Here I can muse in my books, imagine myself to be in the 19th century and compliment myself daily that I am that fortunate child who sails the oceans of the world.&quot;", "sentences": ["Last year he completed a long expedition that offered him particular intellectual pleasure: he was on board the Dutch clipper Stad Amsterdam as it retraced the route of HMS Beagle around the world, from Plymouth to Salvador de Bahia to the Gal\u00e1pagos and on \u2013 &quot;the most important voyage ever made,&quot; he insists, &quot;far more so than man&apos;s journey to the moon&quot;.", "(&quot;Emile said: well, if you&apos;re not going to write, we know you can certainly talk.&quot;) Published in 2009 as God, Darwin en natuur, it reminded the TV producers of O&apos;Hanlon&apos;s extraordinary presence and assured him a passage on board the Stad Amsterdam.", "&quot;I love every second,&quot; he says in his cabin on the Stad Amsterdam."], "title": "Redmond O'Hanlon: A life in books", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/28/redmond-ohanlon-life-in-books", "tags": ["Books", "Redmond O'Hanlon", "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands holidays", "Charles Darwin", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-03-30T19:41:03Z", "article": "Arsenal are hopeful Robin van Persie could be available for Saturday&apos;s Premier League match against Blackburn Rovers despite the striker injuring his left thigh playing for Holland on Tuesday.

It didn&apos;t look very serious but it was too painful for him to carry on as he was hit by a knee above his own knee.&quot; Van Persie was on Wednesday assessed by the club&apos;s medical team and the seriousness of the injury will become clearer over the next 24 hours. Nicklas Bendtner returned from international duty having injured an ankle playing for Denmark but there is also optimism at the club that the striker will be fit for selection at the weekend, alongside the left-back Kieran Gibbs, who on Monday returned early from England Under-21 duty due to a groin injury.

Unskilled Africans may still be heading for Europe via the toe of Italy but, as their own country&apos;s domestic crisis deepens, many educated Portuguese head the other way. On 23 March, the socialist minority government of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates collapsed after the conservative opposition pulled the plug on the fourth package of deficit-cutting measures designed to appease Portugal&apos;s creditors \u2013 notably the EU, meeting two days later. Ratings agencies cut Portugal&apos;s status, twice, to triple B-minus, one notch above a junk bond and interest rates on five-year government borrowing rose above a crippling 9%. More than double Germany&apos;s, it leaves most political and financial analysts convinced Portugal cannot avoid the kind of financial bailout which the EU and IMF forced on Greece and Ireland before \u20ac9bn (\u00a38bn) becomes repayable in April and June. Yet the combative S\u00f3crates insists &quot;Portugal doesn&apos;t need to tap into any bailout&quot; and says \u2013 &quot;in defence of my country&quot; \u2013 he will prevent it happening. Some opposition MPs want a grand coalition, others an election campaign which, Portuguese law states, must last a full 55 days. EU summiteers were unenthusiastic. On Thursday night president An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, a 71-year-old technocrat and former liberal-conservative prime minister, was holding an emergency session of Portugal&apos;s council of state to seal a political deal without which the debt crisis can only worsen. Silva&apos;s task: to decide if \u2013 and when \u2013 to grant demands for an election as ministers resist pressure to accept an IMF/EU rescue, part of the &quot;grand bargain&quot; of measures designed to stem financial &quot;contagion&quot; over the fear of a debt default within the debt-strapped eurozone. Local unemployment is already in excess of 11% and Portugal is braced for renewed recession. So the grim-faced visitors to the Angolan consulate had already made their personal decisions to seek opportunity in London, Amsterdam or, increasingly, in former colonies such as Brazil and Angola. &quot;Our economy is very complicated, some people think it&apos;s suicidal,&quot; said a young woman handing out fliers to advertise her nearby photographic shop where . Just round the corner would-be migrants can fill in their paperwork there on visa applications. &quot;Many friends have gone. I don&apos;t know if Angola needs photographers, but I love the idea of working there. I do know Brazil and love it.&quot; Like Britain, whose global maritime empire did not last as long as Portugal&apos;s, Lisbon has a long history of two-way migration. Second only to Ireland, rural Portugal traditionally exported its young \u2013 10.7 million Portuguese in Portugal, 4 million abroad \u2013 until the boom decades inside the EU briefly reversed the trend. Now emigration is an issue again. Portugal&apos;s peculiar crisis How did it come to this? On Thursday Portugal&apos;s budget deficit was revised upwards to 8.6% \u2013 way over its 7.3% target, but still less than Britain&apos;s. Its accumulated debt, around 88% of GDP, is lower than Italy or Japan. Nor did Portugal enjoy a perilous boom-and-bust decade of rising wages inside the eurozone. Its banks did not go mad and build ghost housing estates like Ireland&apos;s \u2013 or underwrite their subsequent bankruptcy as Dublin&apos;s government rashly did. As elsewhere in what the Chinese are calling &quot;the North Atlantic crisis&quot; Portugal&apos;s post-2007 crisis was similar to its neighbours but peculiar to itself, rooted in habits that pre-date even the &quot;Carnation Revolution&quot;, which peacefully ended 50 years of dictatorship in 1974. &quot;The problem of our democratic framework is we do not have a political system strong enough to say &apos;No more money&apos; to the demands of private interest groups and some state groups,&quot; says Professor Jo\u00e3o Confraria of Lisbon&apos;s Catholic business university, FCEE-Cat\u00f3lica. &quot;We have failed to forge a viable domestic consensus for 150 years.&quot; Life goes on much as usual. Lisboners complain of shrinking budgets and rising prices. But their modern European city is criss-crossed by enviably wide boulevards, enough for six lanes of cars, and orderly rows of shade-giving trees just coming into leaf in the spring sunshine. Bars are busy and both Coldplay and Bon Jovi are soon to tour at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. The crisis bubbles away below the surface. During Portugal&apos;s modernising years, low productivity in industries such as textiles \u2013 vulnerable to emerging market producers \u2013 were sustained by EU cash transfers, by remittances from workers overseas, by foreign investment and foreign borrowing. &quot;For 20 years we have been running a current account [trade] deficit close to 10%,&quot; says Confraria. As conditions tightened across the EU \u2013 and the emerging Bric nations, including Brazil, rebalanced the world economy \u2013 the fix became unsustainable. Little wonder that the Portuguese, who know their country was briefly a United Kingdom with Brazil in the 19th century, look to their 190 millon-strong offspring for succour, even more than Brits cherish their &quot;special relationship&quot; with the US. Just as China (to whom Portugal returned Macao only in 1999, two years after Hong Kong) has offered to buy some of Lisbon&apos;s debt, so Brazil&apos;s new president, Dilma Rousseff, made a similar pledge to help out. &quot;We could simply merge with Brazil instead of with the EU,&quot; say Lisbon wits. In 2008 parliament here did what Westminster would find unbearable: it voted to adopt Brazilian spellings as the best way to protect their shared global language. But the immediate double problem, political and financial, is European. S\u00f3crates, PM since 2005 and re-elected for five years 18 months ago, has cut wages, pensions and benefits and raised taxes in three packages which the main opposition, the centre-right social Democrats (PSD) endorsed. But last month, they balked at a fourth, triggering S\u00f3crates&apos;s resignation, to the dismay of Brussels. A squeeze too far? Or mere opportunism? &quot;The political crisis is not our fault. We brought in new measures on which the European commission and others had been briefed,&quot; the government&apos;s spokesman, Mafalda Pereira, told the Guardian. Finance minister Carlos Costa Pinas says the &quot;cost of financing [the debt] was substantially worsened by the opposition&quot;. But the PSD is clearly banking on the electorate to repudiate a socialist (PS) government that has inflicted so much pain, as Irish voters brutally ejected Fianna F\u00e1il. With 81 seats against the PS&apos;s 91 in the 230-deputy chamber, the PSD, led by businessman, Pedro Passos Coelho, is 10% ahead in recent polls. It knows that it can obtain an overall majority in tandem with smaller, more conservative rivals, as the PS cannot do on the left. &quot;A left coalition is not possible for several reasons, ideological and historic&quot; says Andr\u00e9 Freire of the Lisbon University Institute&apos;s political science department. &quot;The left bloc is libertarian and the communists are orthodox. There is a lack of willingness to compromise.&quot; As for the grand coalition option to meet the crisis, the PSD has been in informal coalition to support PS austerity up to now. But Portuguese politics are notorious for &quot;bickering and point-scoring&quot; among the very male MPs whose faces dominate TV news. War reports from Libya this week have waited 20 minutes while bulletins examine rising bond market prices. &quot;Will voters blame the government or the opposition? That is the million-dollar question. It depends on which of the major challengers best gets his message across,&quot; Freire admits. &quot;Whoever wins, it is difficult to understand how they will provide different answers.&quot; The omens are not good. Huge demonstrations shook the political elite in November and 24-hour transport strikes continue. Fewer than 50% of voters turned out to re-elect Silva in January.

Those whom we barely remember, whose names have been all but lost, or are known only to people who actually and truly read history (or at least watch the History Channel), but who were part of important chains of events.  Rich category, eh wot? In my study of the French Revolution, for example, I took a bit of a shine to Camille Desmoulins \u2013 still a pretty well-known dude, I grant you, but not one of your front-line fame hogs like Robespierre and Saint-Just. Desmoulins was a journalist and, in the context of his times, on the left though not way on the left. In certain pictures, he looks like he could have been in Cream or something. My sort of fella. He fell to the blade, of course. In fact, it was right around now, I read this morning: he was arrested on March 31, 1794, and hanged on April 5 (justice was swift in those days). Danton was the most famous executed on that day.  Anyway. This was a challenge to put together in that it took a little more imagination than usual, but I think you&apos;ll enjoy it very much. We range here across a pretty vast landscape of subject areas, and there&apos;s even something in here for our noisy science caucus. So let&apos;s dig in. 1. Nearly everyone knows the most famous people in this category of endeavor, whose names are celebrated far and wide. But there were other practitioners such as George Peele and Thomas Kyd who, though famous in their time, are known to relatively few people today. What were they?a. Explorersb. Chancellors of the Exchequerc. Elizabethan playwrights 2. Everyone knows the most famous of America&apos;s founding fathers. But match these founders, all of whom attended the Philadelphia constitutional convention, to the states they represented at same:Roger ShermanJames McHenryThomas MifflinGeorge Wythe PennsylvaniaVirginiaMaryland Connecticut 3. Bonaparte, of course, commanded the French troops at Waterloo, and the Duke of Wellington the British. Less well remembered is that there was a sizable Prussian presence at the battle, fighting alongside the British. Under whose command was it?a. Frederick the Greatb. Gebhard von Blucherc. Hermann Broch 4. She was not among the first-rank American feminist leaders of the 19th century, but her name lives on in part because she promoted a then-radical fashion for women.a. Amelia Bloomerb. Ophelia Corsettec. Lucretia Espadrille 5. Some of his heirs have insisted on his innocence and sought to clear his name, but as far as the official record is concerned, Dr. Samuel Mudd was indeed a conspirator in:a. The vast opium trade in China in the mid-19th century that started the Opium Warsb. An unsuccessful attempt to kill Sir Robert Peelc. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln 6. George Henry Lewes was a philosopher and critic but is better remembered to history as:a. The longtime lover of George Eliotb. The secretary of the Royal Geographic Society who accompanied Stanley on his search for Livingstonec. The frequent co-author of Social Darwinist Herbert Spencer 7. The Serbian inventor Nicola Tesla, overshadowed for decades, has become well known in recent years, and his rivalry with Thomas Edison is much discussed and dissected. Meanwhile, the Italian inventor Antonio Meucci remains largely unknown, even though the US House of Representatives in 2002 officially declared him the true inventor of:a. The sewing machineb. The telephonec. The threshing machine 8. In 1927, who were Earle Combs, Bob Meusel and Tony Lazzeri?a. Members of Eliot Ness&apos; &quot;Untouchables&quot;b. Co-counsels, alongside the famous Clarence Darrow, for Thomas Scopes at his famous &quot;Monkey Trial&quot;c. Lesser-known stars in the New York Yankees&apos; &quot;Murderer&apos;s Row&quot; batting lineup 9. Churchill&apos;s war cabinet contained giants \u2013 Clement Attlee (deputy prime minister), Ernest Bevin (labour), Anthony Eden (foreign secretary from 1942), Churchill himself (prime minister and defence). Who held the crucial but less celebrated post of minister of production from 1942 to 1945?a. Oliver Lyttletonb. Donald Macleanc. Desmond Llewelyn 10. Who was Miep Gies?a. He worked with Raoul Wallenberg from Sweden to rescue Jews from the Holocaustb. She hid Anne Frank and her family in an attic in Amsterdam, and later discovered Anne&apos;s diaryc. A Danish national, he cast the deciding vote at the San Francisco conference in support of creating the United Nations 11. According to Keith Richards, who is the true and proper founder of the Rolling Stones?a. Bill Nanker-Phelgeb. Ian Stewartc. Alexis Korner 12. To this day, the identity of this man is not known; when asked what ever happened to him, one of the rulers of the country in question said, &quot;I think not killed.&quot;a. The man who stood in front of the tanks in Tiananmen Squareb. The man who first pushed his way through the Berlin Wall, as throngs followedc. The man who shot the video of Neda Agha-Soltan, the Iranian woman killed in the 2009 protests Okay, that was really pretty good, wasn&apos;t it? A lot to chew on. Let&apos;s take a look at the answer key. Answers:1-c; 2: Sherman=Connecticut, McHenry=Maryland, Mifflin=Pennsylvania, Wythe=Virginia; 3-b; 4-a; 5-c; 6-a; 7-b; 8-c; 9-a; 10-b; 11-b; 12-a. Notes:1. Not an easy one to start with, though I tell myself I vaguely remember their names and could have gotten it.2. Rudimentary knowledge of US history and geography was your crutch here. There&apos;s a Fort McHenry in Maryland, a Wytheville in Virginia and a Mifflin township in Pennsylvania. Sherman is, to me, considerably less obscure than those other three.3. I didn&apos;t know this until this morning, but Frederick was dead by then, and Broch of coure was a later novelist.4. I want confessions out of those of you who actually guessed Lucretia Espadrille!5. Pretty well known to Yanks, I think.6. Excellent fake answers, especially the one about the Royal Geographic Society.7. I had no idea of this, and least of all my government&apos;s official recognition of the man. So, Expat Scotsman, what do you make of this? Alexander Graham Bell was a fraud!8. Scopes trial was 1925. Untouchables was a tough fake answer.9. I assume this was easy for Brits. I tried to make it easy for Americans because Maclean of course was one of the famous spies, and Llewelyn played Q in the Bond movies. I never joke about my work, 007.10. She popped into my head a couple of weeks ago, and that is actually when I thought up this quiz. Plus she&apos;s in here for Bookfan.11. Boogie with Stew, kids. 12.

NYSE Euronext said it would &quot;carefully review&quot; the offer before deciding whether to stick with Deutsche B\u00f6rse or switch allegiances to the new suitors. The bid is substantially higher than the $9.5bn all-share deal NYSE agreed with the German exchange group in February \u2013 as well as including a cash component, which may prove attractive to its shareholders. Under the terms of the $42.50-a-share offer ICE, the Atlanta-based derivatives market, would take on NYSE Euronext&apos;s derivatives business, including Liffe, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, Europe&apos;s second largest derivatives market. Nasdaq OMX, the New York technology bourse group, would acquire the stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, as well as the US options business. Nasdaq and ICE claimed that within the next 12 to 18 months they could cut about $740m from the resulting entities&apos; combined annual operating costs, the bulk of which they said would come from &quot;consolidating platforms&quot;. They declined to comment on likely job losses. Deutsche B\u00f6rse is understood to be considering its options, with analysts split on whether it would increase its previous bid or throw in the towel. The Nasdaq offer is 19% higher than NYSE&apos;s closing price on Thursday night and 27% higher than its valuation before Deutsche B\u00f6rse made its intentions known. Karl Morris, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said: &quot;It&apos;s quite a bold move from Nasdaq and ICE. Certainly I think the premium they&apos;re paying is quite high ... It makes you wonder what Deutsche B\u00f6rse is going to do about this and I struggle to see how they can lift their bid to match.&quot; Dick Grasso, the former NYSE chairman who was forced to quit in 2003 after a row about the size of his $140m pay package, saw things quite differently. &quot;What would you pay for the Mona Lisa? I wouldn&apos;t look at this proposal from Nasdaq to be its final bid,&quot; Grasso told Bloomberg TV. Nasdaq&apos;s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, is &quot;a very capable CEO and isn&apos;t going to put out his final offer because he knows Deutsche B\u00f6rse is going to outbid him&quot;, Grasso added. Nasdaq&apos;s attempts to unseat Deutsche come amid a flurry of deals as bourses attempt to cut costs and offset declining profits from equity trading with options, futures and derivatives platforms. The more companies expand through acquisition, the more they can cut costs and the greater the need for rivals to follow suit so they can continue to compete. Last October, Singapore Exchange made an $8.3bn bid for Australia&apos;s ASX, regarding a transaction that is still under discussion. Meanwhile, in February, London Stock Exchange agreed to buy Canada&apos;s TMX Group  and Deutsche signed its deal with NYSE. Bats Global Markets, the third largest US stock exchange, agreed to buy Chi-X Europe, the continent&apos;s largest alternative trading system. Analysts said proposal could raise questions about competition, since it would unite the two largest US exchanges. However, the deal agreed with Deutsche B\u00f6rse is also expected to raise competition concerns since it would give the resulting entity a huge presence in some parts of European trading. Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said: &quot; The combination of the two leading US exchanges delivers an opportunity to build a global exchange platform that has scale and growth potential to benefit investors, issuers and other market participants. We believe it would increase transparency and liquidity in US markets and create jobs as new companies raise capital.&quot; The offer consists of $14.24 a share in cash, as well as 0.4069 Nasdaq OMX shares and 0.1436 ICE shares for every NYSE Euronext share.", "sentences": ["Nasdaq OMX, the New York technology bourse group, would acquire the stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, as well as the US options business."], "title": "Nasdaq leads $11bn counterbid in heated battle for NYSE Euronext", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/01/nasdaq-counterbid-nyse-euronext-stock-exchange", "tags": ["Nasdaq", "Stock markets", "US news", "London Stock Exchange", "World news", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-01T19:36:30Z", "article": "Performed by Toneelgroep Amsterdam in Dutch, and directed by the brilliant Ivo van Hove, this was an amazing show. Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra were combined in brilliantly edited versions in what became a six-hour show with no intervals. It seems rather austere to watch six hours of Shakespeare in a language you don&apos;t understand but it was thrilling and incredibly accessible. Every single actor was remarkable but the most astonishing performance was that of Hans Kesting who played Mark Antony. He&apos;s a huge bear of a man, but captures incredible tenderness; it was the tension between that tenderness and his visceral force that really haunted me. Kesting played Antony in a wheelchair with his leg in a cast. At the time I thought this was a brilliant bit of direction because Antony is the heroic, damaged soldier, but it turned out that Kesting had broken his leg the week before! But it was an extraordinary way of articulating Anthony&apos;s state of paralysis in his relationships with Cleopatra and with the murderers of Caesar. The audience was free to move around the auditorium, and I was sitting on a sofa on the stage about four feet away from where Kesting delivered the burial speech. His combination of raging fury and deep, proper love for Caesar, captured in this damaged body, made the hairs on my arms stand up. And the desire, eroticism and damaged love for the final hour when he was playing Antony with Cleopatra was mind-blowing. It was epic but desperately intimate at the same time. I&apos;ve never seen anyone direct Shakespeare with that level of imagination. The show as a whole was one of the best theatre experiences I&apos;ve ever had, with Hans Kesting&apos;s Antony a startling climax to an exceptional evening.

This year, next year, his ship is always about to come in. Or so say the admirers of this 37-year-old artist, maker of multi-part videos and animatronic heads that gurn, spew and mumble, mangling language to the fascination of curators and commentators who find in Mellors a piquant interplay of low humour and high philosophy. He has a powerful wind behind him. You can, for instance, see Mellors&apos;s work represented in both the current British Art Show at the Hayward Gallery and in Ourhouse, a one-man exhibition at the ICA. Both present the trademark screen-sculpture combination, which seems to imply by sheer proximity a relationship between the people in the video and these extremely life-like androids, as if both belonged to the same crazy species of talking head. The Hayward has the ruder of the heads, hooked up to an alimentary system of tubes and vomiting some nameless spume into a bucket. It never stops throwing up, as if permanently sick with itself. And it accompanies, or is accompanied by, episode 2 of Ourhouse, a series of six videos of which three have so far been produced. I&apos;d like to think that the head might even be responding, however crudely, to the film. It looks very like the man in the white tracksuit who suddenly appears out of nowhere in the library of Ourhouse, to the consternation of all the other characters. He is called the Object, and is played by the poet, sculptor and performance artist Brian Catling. Two members of the audience, the day I was there, were tickled to see their old tutor from the Ruskin School of Drawing got up in sportswear. Perhaps the in-joke adds a crucial piquancy to the narrative. Certainly the standard euphemism applies: this is a work that will be experienced on several different levels.     Richard Bremmer as Daddy in Nathaniel Mellors's Ourhouse. Copyright the artist and courtesy, Galerie Diana Stigter, Amsterdam; Matt's Gallery, London and Monitor, Rome     The ICA is separately screening all three episodes of Ourhouse in a cycle of gross, garrulous, barmy confusion set in that perennial English trope, the decaying country house. The father is an ageing aristo-hippy with a passing resemblance to the Marquess of Bath, tyrannical to his offspring Truson and Faxon (fake-son) but oleaginously pleased with his sculptress girlfriend. In a parody private view, he mouths the purest artspeak about her half-baked sculptures, which look in turn like send-ups of works by established artists such as Martin Creed and Tomoko Takahashi. But the tone is hard to read \u2013 if there is any discernible tone. For what strikes straight away is the arch absurdism of Ourhouse. The sons argue over an ancient work of &quot;pornology&quot; one has bought on eBay. The girlfriend subjects the gardener to psychosexual taunting because he cannot spell cant or pyewacket. The Object slowly chews and ingests several books in the library \u2013 The Classic Slum, in the episode tendentiously titled Class. The others all believe him to be some sort of non-being, possibly a sculpture. Maybe this has something to do with Gilbert and George, or Catling, or Kant. Or nothing so shiningly clear. Normal questions don&apos;t apply. Why do the sons have such different accents? Why doesn&apos;t the gardener just get up and go? Where are all these word games and malapropisms heading? Why does your neighbour think it so hilarious when a letter from the council gets dropped into the swanky swimming pool, or is it just the sheer release of nerves? This banal slapstick is more humorous than anything else in Mellors&apos;s laborious quasi-comedy with its allusions to Pasolini, Wittgenstein, Rabelais and John Cleese (episodically evoked in Richard Bremmer&apos;s performance as Daddy). But I&apos;m not sure that anyone is playing for laughs. Ourhouse could equally well exist to irritate and oppress \u2013 as it does \u2013 in equal measure. It doesn&apos;t stand up as comedy. It wouldn&apos;t cut it in a cinema. I doubt the most assiduous philosopher would find much grain among the chaff. It lacks the wit (both kinds) of Monty Python, or the political punch of Jonathan Coe&apos;s What A Carve Up! It could easily persuade a pessimist that art world expectations, in these respects, must be lower. And the show&apos;s punchline \u2013 two animatronic heads connected by a single hank of hair, entitled Hippy Dialectics \u2013 seems to confirm it. The spacey dialogue has hardly begun before it reaches its jokey reductio ad absurdum: yes, yes, yes; no, no, no etc. Comparisons with Beckett are surely misplaced, to say nothing of Python. The renowned Irish artist Dorothy Cross has a fine pairing of object and moving image in her new show at the Frith Street Gallery. In a film, the great stalactite of Doolin cave in County Clare emerges out of darkness like some magnificent inverted spire, a monument not made by human hand. Alongside, hundreds of bronze-cast hands gather together, fingers pointing downwards, striving to make a comparable form.

Sound is matched to vision \u2013 the fine high notes that might shatter the crystal, the little voice against the immense rock \u2013 in a subtle metaphor of awe and fear. Cross has a gift for delicate transformations. A baby tooth has literally become a pearl, courtesy of a helpful oyster.

And, you know, we&apos;ve dealt with them.&quot; It has not been the easiest of starts for McCall, who joined easyJet after 24 years at Guardian Media Group, parent company of the Observer. Critics of her appointment worried that she had neither airline experience nor a track record of running a stockmarket-listed company. It&apos;s been a steep learning curve \u2013 McCall reckons she has picked up &quot;about five years&apos; experience in eight months&quot;. Adding to the mix, McCall has faced sniping from easyJet&apos;s founder and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who, although no longer on the board, has a loudly articulated opinion on every decision taken by the airline&apos;s management. And a trading statement went awry in January, sending easyJet&apos;s shares south by 17% in a day \u2013 a &quot;very, very weak day&quot; for the stock market generally, McCall points out defensively. Last week was supposed to offer relief \u2013 easyJet launched its longest ever route, a five-hour haul from Gatwick to Jordan&apos;s capital, Amman. En route to Jordan, McCall gamely took a turn with the on-board rubbish bag, collecting discarded sandwich wrappers and talking to passengers. But the timing was awkward \u2013 the launch came two days after protests for political reform in Jordan turned ugly, leading to the death of one demonstrator in Amman and injuries to 130 more. Could easyJet face the same fate as rival BMI, which began a service to Tripoli in February and cancelled it 24 hours later? &quot;We won&apos;t fly anywhere we don&apos;t evaluate as safe,&quot; said McCall, breezily reassuring even when her coach from the airport encountered noisy flag-waving demonstrators blockading a roundabout. &quot;People in all sorts of countries are demonstrating about things \u2013 look at what happened in Trafalgar Square.&quot; A 49-year-old mother of two who began her career as a planner in the Guardian&apos;s marketing department, McCall is warm and approachable in person but has a reputation for ruthless decisions. Her early moves at easyJet included removing the airline&apos;s operations chief and ordering senior ranks to focus relentlessly on punctuality. EasyJet attracted derision in June when its on-time record at its biggest base, Gatwick, fell to 48% \u2013 worse than Air Zimbabwe&apos;s time-keeping. Things are, gradually, looking up \u2013 easyJet has got 72% of flights away on time so far this year, compared with 66% for the same period in 2010, helped by improved crew rosters and fleet flexibility. That&apos;s still below Ryanair&apos;s 76% and British Airways&apos; 74% \u2013 but McCall says it&apos;s not bad for an airline with swift turnaround times at congested airports. She argues that Ryanair flies from &quot;airfields&quot; rather than airports and that BA has a long-haul operation that doesn&apos;t rely on split-second boarding: &quot;This month we&apos;ll be over 80%. Seventy per cent is not our aspiration \u2013 it&apos;s actually a minimum threshold below which I don&apos;t want the organisation to ever go.&quot; McCall isn&apos;t wildly complimentary about the management team she inherited from her predecessor, Andy Harrison, who left to run the hotels and restaurants firm Whitbread: &quot;The leadership team is very united and facing in the same direction, which it wasn&apos;t when I arrived \u2013 it was very divided and, really, there weren&apos;t clear goals other than ROE [return on equity], which a lot of people didn&apos;t understand.&quot; Still, plenty of challenges persist. The price of oil remains stubbornly above $100 (\u00a362) a barrel, causing huge expense for airlines in aviation fuel. Even as easyJet prepares to take delivery of its 200th aircraft, McCall warns that the airline will have to be &quot;much more brutal&quot; about poor performers among its 550 routes \u2013 Helsinki was recently axed and easyJet is preparing to pull out of Belfast&apos;s George Best airport, focusing instead on Belfast International. McCall plans to pick her battles more carefully: &quot;On routes where we&apos;re competing, we&apos;ll review which of those competitive battles we have to fight and which we&apos;ll just say: &apos;Forget it, it&apos;s not worth it&apos;.&quot; The days when easyJet could promote itself as a quirky maverick are gone. Founded in 1995, easyJet carried 48.8\u00a0million passengers last year to 29 countries, generating revenue of \u00a32.9bn. But it retains a budget culture \u2013 its no-frills headquarters are in a large orange building called Hangar 89, opposite Luton airport&apos;s departures terminal. Like it or not, easyJet is a substantial multinational and McCall clearly wants the airline to punch its weight politically. She is none too thrilled with the government&apos;s approach towards aviation: &quot;In terms of transport policy, they seem to be obsessed with high-speed rail.&quot; McCall aligns herself with 74 business leaders who wrote to the Times last week complaining about a lack of a coherent aviation strategy from the Conservative-led coalition. Corporate bosses are worried about overcrowded airports, punitive taxes and about Heathrow&apos;s gradual erosion as a global hub. EasyJet is particularly disgruntled over air passenger duty, which adds at least \u00a312 to every ticket in and out of Britain. It wants a shift in this levy from a &quot;per passenger&quot; basis to a &quot;per plane&quot; tax, which, it believes, could create a framework for rewarding more fuel-efficient aircraft. During a visit to Hangar 89 back in July, David Cameron committed himself to such a change \u2013 but in the budget, George Osborne killed it, describing it as &quot;illegal under international law&quot;. The Treasury cites the 1944 Chicago convention, which governs global air transport. McCall isn&apos;t buying this \u2013 she reckons legal obstacles could be easily surmounted. &quot;When they launched their manifesto, they knew about the Chicago convention. They knew about it! So I don&apos;t understand why that&apos;s such a surprise to them,&quot; she says. &quot;They can&apos;t say they care about the environment and then kick that into the long grass.&quot; She accuses the coalition of succumbing to lobbying by British Airways, which has an older, more gas-guzzling fleet and presently benefits from an exemption from duty for its lucrative transfer passengers who change planes at Heathrow. &quot;Find out how many people they have in their lobbying team,&quot; she says. On top of this, easyJet is uneasy about the government&apos;s intention to cut its 49% stake in Britain&apos;s air traffic control service, which McCall worries would encourage Nats to diversify into distracting, irrelevant activities \u2013 even running roads, rail and other transport infrastructure: &quot;We believe the government should have a shareholding because it&apos;s a strategic asset and an essential service.&quot; Touring Jordan last week, McCall was greeted by folk dancers in the ancient city of Petra and was presented with an elaborate mosaic by the Jordanian government to mark easyJet&apos;s arrival. With long-haul firmly ruled out, Jordan is at the outer limit of the range of easyJet&apos;s fleet of Airbus short-haul jets. The priority, for newly acquired planes, will be to &quot;thicken&quot; busy trunk routes with more services between cities such as London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Madrid. McCall is determined to prove her mettle this summer by preventing a repetition of last summer&apos;s tardy holiday flights. Staff have been instructed to focus on &quot;zero to three&quot; \u2013 getting planes out within three minutes of their timetabled departure, rather than the official punctuality definition of within 15 minutes. Risking becoming a hostage to fortune, she makes a blunt pledge about peak season, declaring that easyJet &quot;could not do anything more&quot; to assure punctual holiday flights: &quot;If something happens in the summer, it will be because of external events we can&apos;t control.&quot;", "sentences": ["The priority, for newly acquired planes, will be to &quot;thicken&quot; busy trunk routes with more services between cities such as London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Madrid."], "title": "Turbulent takeoff for easyJet's new boss", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/03/easyjet-new-chief-carolyn-mccall", "tags": ["Airline industry", "easyJet", "Carolyn McCall", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-04T13:57:49Z", "article": "If it was not for a cold case review by Dutch detectives in 2008, the identity of the headless, handless corpse found in an army kitbag in the Westersingel canal in Rotterdam in 1990, might never have been linked to six holdalls containing body parts discovered in Regent&apos;s Canal, London, 10 years later. Familial DNA tests revealed the Dutch victim as Melissa Halstead, 33, the daughter of an Illinois dentist, working as a freelance photographer and beautician. She had moved to London to further her career and met John Sweeney, a carpenter, while living in Chelsea, and the two embarked on a relationship said to have been fuelled by drink and drugs. When Halstead was deported for overstaying her visa, he followed her around mainland Europe including to Italy, Austria and the Netherlands. A man &quot;disposed to using serious and escalating violence&quot; toward girlfriends, he already had convictions for assaulting Halstead in London, and in Vienna attacked her with a claw hammer. Yet she bailed him out. &quot;I asked if she had lost her frigging mind,&quot; her sister, Chance O&apos;Hara, 63, told the jury. But she said Sweeney had &quot;cried and begged and promised to leave her alone&quot;. So Halstead, then living in Amsterdam, obliged \u2013 and then simply vanished. Halstead had, with chilling accuracy, predicted her death at Sweeney&apos;s hands, telling her sister, who was living in California, if she ever went missing he would have killed her &quot;and would make sure no one would ever find her body&quot;. He almost succeeded. With no identification \u2013 her head and hands have never been found \u2013 it took 18 years for forensic scientists to put her name to the remains. Cause of death has never been determined. It was not until the Dutch set up their first missing person DNA bank in 2007, that samples from the remains in Rotterdam were matched with reports of Halstead&apos;s disappearance in Amsterdam, and a link to a British police investigation was made. Sweeney, who described himself in what police claimed were &quot;confessional&quot; poems as a &quot;manimal \u2013 twisted, confused, and very dysfunctional&quot;, returned to London and embarked on a relationship with a nurse, Delia Balmer, living in Kentish Town. She ended it in 1994, a decision she almost paid for with her life. Sweeney responded by holding her hostage for a weekend, tying her to her bed, torturing and threatening to kill her. When police, alerted by a concerned friend, arrived and arrested him they found in his rucksack plastic sacks, waterproof clothing, Marigold gloves, rolls of tape, a saw blade, string, rope and a sponge. Everything required to kill, dismember and dispose of her was there. But as no one yet knew of Halstead&apos;s fate and, as a carpenter, he could explain the items away. Eventually granted bail a month later, he headed straight to Balmer&apos;s flat. On hearing her screams and seeing Sweeney repeatedly hacking at her with an axe and knife, a male neighbour ran to her rescue and whacked him with a baseball bat. Sweeney ran off, and would remain on the run for six years. Balmer, who was severely injured, told police of a bizarre confession Sweeney had made while holding her hostage. He spoke of having killed before, mentioning a girlfriend called Melissa, and two German men who were friendly with her. He would make the same confession to his best friend, and later his former wife, whom he had married at 18 in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, and with whom he had two children. But still no one knew of Halstead. During the six years before he returned to Britain, Sweeney worked on building sites all over Europe under various aliases. One of these was Scouse Joe, and this was what Paula Fields, a fellow Liverpudlian, knew him as. A crack addict leading a chaotic life that involved prostitution in the UK capital, she vanished in December 2000, three months after meeting him in Highbury, north London. In February 2001, her remains were discovered in Regent&apos;s Canal. Like Halstead, her head and hands were missing, and so were her feet. Subsequent inquiries led police to realise Scouse Joe was John Sweeney. He was arrested at a building site in central London, and charged in connection with the Balmer attack. A search of premises connected to him yielded a hoard of violent drawings and poems, depicting bloody attacks on female victims. One, entitled The Scalp Hunter, showed a female skull hanging from a belt and an axe. A poem written on the back of a scratchcard read: &quot;Poor old Melissa, chopped her up in bits, food to feed the fish, Am*dam was the pits&quot;. Removing correction fluid, police revealed a gravestone with &quot;RIP Melissa Halstod born 12th December 56. Died -&quot;. Sweeney was convicted of Balmer&apos;s attempted murder in November 2001 and sentenced to life. He denied any involvement in or knowledge of the two murders, indeed he tried to suggest Fields may have been the victim of Anthony Hardy, a serial killer at large in Camden, two of whose victims were prostitutes and who lived a few hundred yards from the Regent&apos;s Canal. But for today&apos;s convictions, Sweeney would shortly have been able to apply for parole. Rejection was not in Sweeney&apos;s lexicon, the jury heard. Both Halstead and Balmer were attacked as a result. As for Fields, with whom he also had a sexual relationship, the motive may have simply been he believed she stole money and his phone from him for drugs. When arrested in his cell at Gartree prison, Leicestershire, last April for the two murders, police discovered another drawing, an image of a headless body dissected into 13 pieces in the way Fields&apos;s had been. As the jury heard, time had failed to dim Sweeney&apos;s fascination and preoccupation with dismemberment.", "sentences": ["So Halstead, then living in Amsterdam, obliged \u2013 and then simply vanished.", "It was not until the Dutch set up their first missing person DNA bank in 2007, that samples from the remains in Rotterdam were matched with reports of Halstead&apos;s disappearance in Amsterdam, and a link to a British police investigation was made."], "title": "Canal murders solved by detective work, technology and luck", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/04/canal-murders-solved-detective-luck", "tags": ["Crime", "UK news", "Netherlands", "London"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-04T14:12:00Z", "article": "A Liverpool-born carpenter has been found guilty of murdering two former girlfriends and dumping their dismembered remains in canals in Rotterdam and London. John Sweeney, 54, who worked on construction sites across Europe, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the 1990 murder of Melissa Halstead, 33, a former model from Ohio who was living in Amsterdam, and of the murder in 2000 of Paula Fields, 31, who he had befriended in north London. Sweeney is already serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a third girlfriend in 1994. British detectives fear there may be more victims of a man described as being &quot;hateful, controlling [and] possessive&quot; and &quot;prone to outbursts of rage and murderous violence&quot;. There are concerns for three other women: a Brazilian called Irani, a Colombian called Maria and a woman called Sue. Police believe clues could lie in &quot;lurid and demonic&quot; artwork and poems by Sweeney, found at his home. Sweeney is also said to have told an ex-girlfriend and a male friend that he killed two German men. The men are said to have known Halstead while she was living in the Netherlands. The body of Halstead, whose head and hands have never been found, was discovered in a canal in Rotterdam but remained unidentified for 18 years until Dutch police embarked on a cold-case review in 2008. The body parts of Fields, who moved to north London from Liverpool, were found in six holdalls in the Regent&apos;s canal, King&apos;s Cross, in 2001. Her head, hands and feet are still missing. The jury heard she had been a crack cocaine user leading a chaotic life and earning money as a sex worker in north London when she met Sweeney, 10 years after Halstead&apos;s disappearance. Sweeney was arrested in March 2001. He had been on the run for six years after an attack on a nurse, Delia Balmer, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment in November 2001. Only in 2008, when Halstead&apos;s remains were identified, could a link could be made with Fields&apos;s murder. A search of Sweeney&apos;s flat revealed more than 300 pieces of violent artwork and poems. Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, told the jury: &quot;Police discovered amongst his possessions often lurid and demonic sketches and paintings, as well as pages of verse which reveal an obsessive and virulent hatred of women, and a preoccupation with dismemberment. By butchering and disposing of bodies in this way, the killer had intended that neither they should be identified, nor he should be.&quot; Sweeney showed no sign of emotion as he was convicted. He was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice in disposing of Fields&apos;s body. . Sentencing was put off to Tuesday after Sweeney refused to leave the cells. The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, said he was considering passing a whole-life term. Detective Chief Inspector Howard Groves, joint leader of the investigation, said after the verdict: &quot;Melissa Halstead and Paula Fields were killed and their bodies disposed of in the most callous and undignified manner possible. &quot;I would like to thank the families of Paula and Melissa for their patience and dignity throughout the years, and hope that these convictions will enable them to finally close a chapter in their lives knowing that justice has finally been served. &quot;Sweeney had convinced himself that he would never be caught for these heinous crimes. However, he underestimated the resolve of officers from the Met&apos;s specialist crime directorate, the Rotterdam cold case team, prosecutors in the UK and Holland and the witnesses from across Europe who gave evidence during the trial. As he contemplates a life behind bars, I can assure him that this investigation will continue as we seek to identify and trace other potential victims in the UK, Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe who may have suffered a similar fate to that of Melissa and Paula.&quot; He said police were appealing for information to trace a number of women associated with Sweeney. Irani was believed to have been living or working in north London in 1996-97. Thought to have been in her mid-40s, she frequented pubs and restaurants in the Highbury and Holloway Road areas, and is believed to have worked in kitchens as a cleaner. Maria also frequented pubs and restaurants in the Holloway Road and Finsbury Park areas, in 1997-98; she is believed to have been in her late 30s at the time. During this period Sweeney was working on constructions sites under assumed names. A third woman is believed to be called Sue, from Derby or Derbyshire. Police said she would have been in her late 20s or early 30s in the late 1970s to early 80s, and living, working or frequenting the Holloway Road and Seven Sisters areas of north London. She possibly attended a nursing college while training to be a nurse, and went to Switzerland to work, police said. There was some information to suggest she was a devoted churchgoer in the north London area. The Rotterdam cold case team is also appealing for information to trace individuals who were associated with Sweeney or people who know his exact whereabouts while he visited the Netherlands and worked there regularly, between 1989 and his arrest in 2001.

As he awaited sentence police said they feared at least three other women may have fallen victim to a man described as &quot;hateful, controlling, possessive&quot; and &quot;prone to outburst of rage and murderous violence&quot;. Detective Chief Inspector Howard Groves said they were seeking information about a Brazilian woman called Irani, a Colombian called Maria, and a Derbyshire woman called Sue who was possibly a nurse who moved to Switzerland. All knew Sweeney in north London and are thought to have disappeared in the 1980s and 90s. The Dutch are also investigating claims made to friends by Sweeney that he had killed two German men known to Halstead. The case is the first cross-border murder investigation to be funded by the EU&apos;s Eurojust scheme. Sweeney, who worked under assumed names on construction sites in London and mainland Europe, disposed of the bodies of Halstead and Fields &quot;in the most callous and undignified manner possible&quot; and &quot;convinced himself he would never be caught for these heinous crimes&quot;, said Groves. Grieving relatives said it was their wish he die behind bars. A cold case review by Rotterdam detectives in 2008 finally linked the cases of Halstead&apos;s unidentified headless, handless corpse found in an army kitbag in the Westersingel canal in 1990 and Fields, whose remains were found in six holdalls by schoolboy anglers in the Regent&apos;s canal, Camden, a decade later. Halstead, a freelance photographer and beautician in London, had embarked on a tempestuous relationship with Sweeney, a divorced father of two. A man &quot;disposed to using serious and escalating violence&quot; towards girlfriends, he had threatened his ex-wife with a hammer and axe and he had three convictions for attacking Halstead in London. When she was deported as a visa over-stayer in 1988, he followed her to mainland Europe. In Vienna he attacked her with a claw hammer, but received a suspended sentence after she pleaded for leniency. &quot;I asked her if she had lost her friggin&apos; mind,&quot; Halstead&apos;s sister Chance O&apos;Hara, 63, said in video evidence from California. Shortly afterwards, Halstead vanished from her flat in Amsterdam. She had, with chilling accuracy, predicted her death at Sweeney&apos;s hands, telling her sister if she ever went missing he would have killed her. But for 18 years no one linked her disappearance to the body found in Rotterdam. Dutch detectives were finally able to put her name to the remains in 2008, one year after the first missing person DNA database was set up in the Netherlands. Sweeney, who said he regularly took cannabis and LSD and described himself in poems as &quot;a manimal \u2013 twisted, confused, and very dysfunctional&quot;, returned to London in 1990 and embarked on a relationship with nurse Delia Balmer, living in Camden. When she ended it in 1994, he attacked her, repeatedly hacking at her with an axe and knife, until a male neighbour ran to her rescue and hit him with a baseball bat. Sweeney ran off, and remained on the run for six years. Balmer, who suffered terrible physical injuries and psychological damage, told police of a bizarre confession he had made shortly before the attack. He spoke of having killed a girlfriend called Melissa, and two German men who were friendly with her.

The women&apos;s remains were found a decade apart, and detectives fear three other women known to Sweeney may also be victims. Sweeney, already serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a third girlfriend whom he attacked with an axe and a knife, refused to leave his prison cell at Belmarsh prison to hear his sentence. Judge Mr Justice Saunders, sentencing him in his absence, said the gravity of the offences was exceptional and only a whole life term was appropriate. &quot;These were terrible, wicked crimes. The heads of the victims having been removed, it is impossible to be certain how they were killed. The mutilation of the bodies is a serious aggravating feature of the murders. &quot;Not only does it reveal the cold-blooded nature of the killer, but it has added greatly to the distress of the families to know that parts of their loved ones have never been recovered.&quot; The remains of Halstead, whose head and hands were missing, were found in the Westersingel canal in Rotterdam after she vanished from her Amsterdam flat in 1990. She was only identified in 2008 after Dutch detectives carried out a cold case review and matched familial DNA. A freelance photographer, she met Sweeney in London and embarked on a tempestuous relationship, with him following her to Europe when she was deported from the UK for overstaying her work visa. Fields, originally from Liverpool, a crack cocaine user leading a chaotic life in north London that involved working as a prostitute, met him in 2000. She vanished three months later and 10 body parts were found in six holdalls in the Regent&apos;s Canal near King&apos;s Cross in February 2001. Her head, hands and feet were missing. Saunders said the killings had been planned. &quot;The method of disposal of the bodies demonstrates that there was a substantial amount of planning. &quot;Why the killings occurred, I cannot be sure, but I am satisfied that this defendant is controlling in his relationships with women and, chillingly, that control extends to deciding whether they should live or die.&quot; The jobbing carpenter, who worked under assumed names on construction sites around mainland Europe and south-east England, had denied both murders. But, the jury heard, he had a hatred of women and turned violent when they tried to reject him. In 1994 he went on the run living under assumed aliases following the attack in Camden on Delia Balmer, a nurse, with whom he had a relationship. He was finally arrested six years later at a central London building site after the discovery of Fields&apos;s remains. Police then realised there was a connection. The identification of Halstead then allowed them to place crucial pieces in a gruesome jigsaw they fear may not yet be complete. Detectives are appealing for information about three other women, about whom they only have sketchy information, who may also have been killed by him. One is a trainee nurse called Sue, from Derbyshire, who was said to have left for Switzerland in the late 1970s or early 80s. Two former girlfriends of Sweeney, a Brazilian known as Irani, and a Colombian called Maria, have not been seen since the late 1990s, when they knew Sweeney in north London. Asked if the three women were thought to have been murdered, Detective Chief Inspector Howard Groves said outside court: &quot;We have some information which would suggest that is a possibility.&quot; Clues to Sweeney&apos;s visceral hatred of women were found in a hoard of more than 300 violent and lurid paintings and poems found at his home, with one, entitled the Scalp Hunter, depicting a female victim and a bloody axe. On the back of a scratchcard he had written a poem: &quot;Poor old Melissa, chopped her up in bits, food to feed the fish, Am*dam was the pits.&quot; They also found a calendar on the back of a minicab receipt with 16 December 2000 circled and then &quot;9 1/2 weeks&quot; and the letter &quot;P&quot; written under it which within three days was the period before Paula&apos;s body was discovered on 19 February 2001. The jury heard that while on the run Sweeney had told his best friend that he found Melissa in bed with two German men and had killed them all.

Mecom, which owns 87% of Wegener, is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but the Dutch publisher has retained a &quot;sleeping listing&quot; in Amsterdam. The banks&apos; proposal would also see Wegener take complete control and merge with Limburg Media Group, which is 100% owned by Mecom. One source with knowledge of the banks&apos; plans understands they are keen to take a controlling stake in Wegener, which rebelled against former Mecom chief David Montgomery after the operation&apos;s chief executive, Joop Munsterman, was ousted last year. However an email from Truls Velgaard, the non-Dutch-speaking former chairman of Mecom&apos;s Norwegian operation parachuted in to run the Netherlands business, said the offer was for Mecom to remain the majority shareholder with &quot;around \u2013 or slightly above \u2013 50%&quot; of Wegener. The banks tabled the outline proposal at a meeting of the Mecom board in London last week. Stephen Davidson, who took over from Mecom founder and chief executive David Montgomery after he was ousted in January, &quot;flat out&quot; rejected the proposal. Velgaard describes the proposal as &quot;totally unattractive&quot;. &quot;Normally any serious proposal would be considered diligently from Mecom&apos;s side,&quot; he said. &quot;This proposal was anyhow so unclear ...

The proposal goes against the strategy outlined by Davidson last month, when he stated Mecom was seeking organic growth and potentially acquisitions in each of the European markets it operates. Last year a group of disgruntled investors argued the company should be broken up to focus solely on the Netherlands operation. Late last year Mecom rejected a merger approach from Trinity Mirror.

Crouwel&apos;s rational, modern visual world of grids and pure lines feels as intriguingly artificial as the painstakingly constructed Dutch landscape. His revered body of work, which spans 60 years, has a deep humanity and an artistic quirkiness that combines precision with emotion. You can see for yourself by joining the crowds of graphic designers who have been making a pilgrimage to London&apos;s Design Museum to pay homage to the Dutch master&apos;s work in the first major retrospective of his career held in Britain. Wim Crouwel: A Graphic Odyssey is an exhibition that anyone with the remotest interest in typography and graphic design will find utterly engrossing. There is a fascinating tension at work in Crouwel&apos;s prolific output: between the rational and the irrational, the logical and the illogical, the scientific and the waywardly artistic. Crouwel, born in Groningen in 1928, began his career as a painter. His expressionist paintings were a stark contrast to the delight he took in the Bauhaus-inspired typography of the Swiss designers Karl Gerstner and Gerard Ifert. And yet, while he believed in the machine aesthetic espoused by the Bauhaus, he is on record as saying, the best part of 60 years ago, &quot;the machine cannot replace the precision of the human eye and human feeling&quot;. This is why he was also influenced by the work of Eric Gill, the English letterer, sculptor, sex maniac and type designer whose epochal sans-serif typeface Gill Sans (inspired by Edward Johnston&apos;s display face for the London Underground) showed how a machine type could also be imbued with a humanity that came from craftsmanship.     Crouwel's 1957 poster for a Leger exhibition. Photograph: AccuSoft    When Crouwel took to typography on an almost industrial scale with the founding of the Total Design studio in 1963, he honed a distinctive approach to design that has captivated fellow designers since. Crouwel&apos;s work for the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam from 1964 showed how seemingly cool typography could be used to subtly evoke the characteristics of the artists on show. He had, in fact, been working on this approach since the early 1950s: his poster of 1957 for an exhibition of Leger paintings held at the Stedelijk van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, is so in tune with the artist that it&apos;s not surprising that, while not quite commanding the price of a Leger in auction rooms today, you would have to pay handsomely for an original Crouwel poster. In day-to-day service, perhaps the best-known Crouwel typeface is Gridnik \u2013 a digitised version of the Politene face he designed for Olivetti in 1974. Shaped on a square grid, each letter has an elegant machine quality balanced with a playfulness that makes you want to look at it for its own sake as well as read the messages it was designed to give, most famously on the standard issue postage stamps issued by the Dutch PTT between 1976 and 2002. The Politene that became Gridnik was originally designed for Olivetti&apos;s latest generation of electric typewriters, but as these became outmoded almost immediately, the typeface was rescued to live another life. Crouwel&apos;s eye-boggling New Alphabet of 1967 was another historical accident of sorts. It was meant to be a purely experimental design based on cathode ray tube technology, with each letter abstractly composed of vertical and horizontal lines, some of them \u2013 g, j, s, w and z \u2013 all but unrecognisable. &quot;The New Alphabet was over the top,&quot; Crouwel has said, &quot;and never meant to be really used. It was unreadable.&quot; But, it was also great fun in a space age, computer-era way. Crouwel, busy today as an adviser to the company that has become Total Identity, is aware of the seeming contradiction in typography: the fact that many of the best-loved typefaces are looked at for their design rather than the written messages they convey. But that&apos;s the joy of type. You can read words on the page to gain understanding of what they impart while still enjoying their form. If they become too fussy, and you spend more time looking at the curves of individual letters than reading, the type designer has failed you. Crouwel has never disappointed. He is the first to say his work shouldn&apos;t be fetishised, but see if you can visit Wim Crouwel: A Graphic Odyssey and not be caught in this Dutch designer&apos;s captivating grid.", "sentences": ["Crouwel&apos;s work for the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam from 1964 showed how seemingly cool typography could be used to subtly evoke the characteristics of the artists on show."], "title": "Wim Crouwel's extraordinary alphabets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/07/wim-crouwel-design-museum-typography", "tags": ["Design", "Typography", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-08T18:17:28Z", "article": "The Champions League broadens horizons but it also sharpens perspectives. What may be laudable in domestic competitions can be a handicap on the bigger stage. Aspiring teams, confident of their abilities, are apt to find the Champions League a humbling experience. Wednesday&apos;s opening leg of the quarter-final between Chelsea and Manchester United would have passed muster as a Premier League fixture. It was more entertaining than the series of clinches that are usually the case when these teams meet. The football was fast and eventful and there was plenty of goalmouth action. In Champions League terms, however, the standard of much of the play was indifferent. There were too many unforced errors and the ball was given away with depressing regularity. The one moment of genuine class was the superb touch with which Ryan Giggs met Michael Carrick&apos;s crossfield pass before setting up Wayne Rooney for the winning goal. Perhaps we have all been spoiled by Barcelona. Teams of this quality come along once in a generation, if football is lucky, so everybody else is bound to suffer by comparison. Nevertheless, Bar\u00e7a are the ones to beat and, as Arsenal showed at the Emirates, they can be defeated. Last season, moreover, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s Internazionale found the organisation and the firepower to overcome Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals and Chelsea and Manchester United have each beaten them in recent tournaments. But that was then. The likelihood of a team emerging from a generally fallow season in the Premier League to take on Lionel Messi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Xavi and the rest and emerge triumphant was always doubtful. Manchester United are now the only serious candidates. Chelsea are hard to take seriously with their coach, Carlo Ancelotti, who was compelled to play Fernando Torres ahead of Nicolas Anelka as Didier Drogba&apos;s partner in a Champions League quarter-final. Watching Torres fumble his way through the match while TV cut away to Roman Abramovich viewing his \u00a350m signing impassively from the back of the stand, was to be reminded of the moment in Citizen Kane when the great man&apos;s protege is singing her little heart out and the camera pans up to two stage hands on a platform high above. One looks at the other and their eyes meet in silent disapproval. On Tuesday night, Tottenham Hotspur could be said to have joined Arsenal in suffering the Camp Nou experience, except that their conquerors were not Barcelona but Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u. Spurs, like Arsenal, had a player, Peter Crouch, sent off. Yet, even if they had remained at full strength, it was difficult to see how they would have been able to retain possession long enough to get the ball up to the tall\u00a0striker. In the Premier League, Tottenham and Arsenal try to impose their authority on opponents through their ability to retain possession and outpace defences. But, in losing to Real and Barcelona respectively, they found that pace means nothing without the ball and, in both matches, neither could put two passes together without losing it. It is an old lesson that English teams need to relearn, even if they are now multinational sides born from those overseas areas of the game where the importance of not giving the ball away is drummed into players practically from birth. Bill Shankly&apos;s Liverpool were taught it on a foggy night in Amsterdam in 1966, when the Ajax team being nurtured by Rinus Michels won 5-1 and English football first noticed a young Dutchman called Johan Cruyff. Red Star Belgrade forced the message home when they knocked Liverpool out of the European Cup in 1973 and were applauded off the pitch by the Kopafter winning 2-1 at Anfield with patient, probing football. Shankly dismissed Red Star as &quot;a bunch of fancy men&quot;, but his successor, Bob Paisley, later admitted that &quot;our approach was a bit frantic. He treated every match like a war. We discovered it was no use winning the ball if you finished up on your backside in a desperate position&quot;. Tottenham are 4-0 down to Real but, before attempting to salvage something from the tie at White Hart Lane, they have a game against Stoke, who do tend to treat every match as world war three. On Saturday, Spurs will need the pace which carried them past Inter and Milan but, against Real on Wednesday, they will have to find something more profound, if only for pride&apos;s sake.", "sentences": ["Bill Shankly&apos;s Liverpool were taught it on a foggy night in Amsterdam in 1966, when the Ajax team being nurtured by Rinus Michels won 5-1 and English football first noticed a young Dutchman called Johan Cruyff."], "title": "Possession: the old lesson Premier League teams must relearn in Europe | David Lacey", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/apr/08/possession-premier-league-europe-lesson", "tags": ["Champions League", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Real Madrid", "Chelsea", "Manchester United", "Premier League", "Premier League 2010-11", "Champions League 2010-11"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-08T23:02:55Z", "article": "I&apos;m influenced by men&apos;s fashion.

In fact, she took me to play miniature golf. We weren&apos;t a\u00a0wealthy family by\u00a0any stretch of\u00a0the imagination, but it\u00a0was hardly a\u00a0teenage boy&apos;s dream. Being 15 \u2013 meaning kind\u00a0of\u00a0a monster \u2013 I did nothing to hide my displeasure. Undeterred, she rented us putters and handed me\u00a0a short pencil and a score sheet. &quot;This will be fun,&quot; she said. And it was, in its silly way. Miniature golf, like billiards, is a game of angles. And, like billiards, most of the fun is in pretending you know what the hell you&apos;re doing. The worse you do, the more you have to laugh. And soon enough you&apos;re actually having a decent outing with your mother. Somewhere before the last hole, my mother stopped, mid-swing. The park wasn&apos;t crowded, so it wasn&apos;t as if we had to rush. She set the putter back down, looked at me directly and said, &quot;I don&apos;t think you should have any children.&quot; At the time, this made me laugh more than my worst putt had done. No children? Had she taken a look at me lately? Her affection made her overlook my hideous (and thick) glasses, a chunky stomach and an awkwardness with strangers that could only be described as &quot;punishing&quot; (to both them and me). At school, I&apos;d been working overtime just to get a girl to kiss\u00a0me. Sex remained the ultimate goal, of course, but you wouldn&apos;t warn a child against mountain climbing when he&apos;s doing his best just\u00a0to get up a tree. But I realised my mother didn&apos;t see it this way. Her son had turned 15, old enough \u2013 in her mind \u2013 that sex became a genuine possibility. And now she meant to warn me off teen fatherhood. I felt flattered by her faith in me, so I smiled when I\u00a0said, &quot;You won&apos;t have to worry about that for a\u00a0long, long time.&quot; She lifted the little putter and lightly tapped the head on the artificial grass, as if she was working at a particularly fragile nail. &quot;I don&apos;t mean just now,&quot; she told me. &quot;I don&apos;t think you should ever have children.&quot; Then she took her shot and walked on to the next hole, leaving me there. My mother didn&apos;t have a grudge against me. She held a grudge against my blood, and hers. Our DNA. Our family suffers from a\u00a0hereditary condition called, generally, mental illness. Specifically, multiple family members in successive generations have suffered from either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The difference between these two illnesses can be hard to parse for people who haven&apos;t experienced either. Bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic depression, means that the moods swing from wildly high (not happy, necessarily, but manic) to profoundly low, and the sufferer has as much control over the changes as we do over the tides. The schizophrenic, meanwhile, lives in a world that&apos;s a bit of our reality and a bit of her own. Hallucinations can occur, both visual and auditory. The sufferer works hard to differentiate between reality and delusion, but this gets to be exhausting. Think of driving a car when you&apos;re very tired and it becomes difficult to stay in one lane. The lines blur and with a blink \u2013 without even realising what&apos;s happened \u2013 you&apos;ve run right off the road. By the time my mother took me on that miniature golfing trip, she&apos;d watched one of her siblings suffer with schizophrenia his entire, short, adult life. I never met the man, because he killed himself before I was born. She had also wrestled with her own highs and lows for many years, so her fears \u2013 about the inheritance of illness, about the hardships of such a life \u2013 weren&apos;t academic. They were personal. Now, I&apos;d turned 15, the age when those two illnesses often first manifest themselves, and my mother must have been scared. Maybe she&apos;d been running through every fight we&apos;d had in my awkward adolescence so far, sifting for evidence of the legacy she was afraid she had passed on. And I had a younger brother, so even if I turned out to avoid either illness, my mother would have to hold her breath again in a few years&apos; time. She explained all this to me as we drove back from the golf course. I&apos;d held on to our score sheets, a series of numbers without real meaning, and found myself staring at the marks as she spoke. It was better than looking her in the eye. I felt her fear becoming my own, though I wasn&apos;t conscious it was happening. I breathed in the anxiety and, just that fast, now it was mine. Fifteen years later, I&apos;d bought a more stylish pair of glasses, learned to exercise and control my appetite, and my awkwardness had been tamed. At 30, I&apos;d found both a woman and a passion \u2013 writing. My girlfriend and I moved into a small flat. We weren&apos;t wealthy, we weren&apos;t even solvent sometimes, but that was all right. Around this time I was working on my first novel, the story of a young man \u2013 obese and awkward \u2013 who gets kicked out of college for bad marks and bizarre behaviour. He returns home to his family who are determined to help him get better, but the reader soon realises that the narrator&apos;s family is worse off than him. Each one is madder than the last. These characters weren&apos;t exactly my family but amplified versions. And yet the longer I lived with the story, the harder it became to separate from real life. Almost without realising it, I became that 15-year-old in the car with his mother again. Afraid of the worst. Expecting it. What made this fear all the more real was the fact that my brother had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It manifested itself around the age of 13. My mother&apos;s great fear had come true. By the time I&apos;d turned 30, my family had been living with that illness \u2013 because everyone around the ill person is afflicted, too \u2013 for seven years. By the third year of my relationship, I had become terrified of that next step: marriage. We never actually talked about this, but her parents had been married for more than 30 years and seemed pretty happy, so why wouldn&apos;t she want to follow that route? And once you consider marriage, then children probably won&apos;t be far behind. Now, had she actually brought this up? Not exactly. She seemed pretty content with our life, actually. But my anxieties were conspiring against us. I wasn&apos;t sharing any of this with my girlfriend. I held lengthy debates about how to get out of our relationship, but she wasn&apos;t invited to participate. When I pulled away, she was shocked. But I&apos;d already made up my mind. I remember our last argument, the two of us shouting in the hall. In my arm I had the manuscript of my novel: in a sense, my entire past. I was off to meet my editor and discuss the last changes. My girlfriend stopped me at the front door. The hallway didn&apos;t have any windows, so even though it was the middle of the afternoon, she and I were standing in the dark. I\u00a0felt trapped. I&apos;d told her I wanted to split up. She thought I was making a rash decision, whereas I\u00a0thought of myself as a man who&apos;d considered all the options and found the only sensible solution. &quot;Let&apos;s just get married,&quot; she said. &quot;This is\u00a0ridiculous.&quot; Maybe I was being unfair, but in that moment it seemed as if she&apos;d finally revealed her &quot;true&quot; intentions all along. I&apos;d been right! Marriage. And soon a child. I felt even surer of my decision. It was better to be alone than stay together and risk having children. &quot;You think you know what&apos;s going to happen in the future, but you&apos;re not even looking ahead. You&apos;re only looking backward,&quot; she said. Her wisdom is so obvious that the only shock to\u00a0me now is that I didn&apos;t hear it then. I opened the door. I disappeared. The only thing I left with was my book. And for about five years that was plenty. I\u00a0published two books and started on a third. I\u00a0travelled and spent time with some wonderful women. I enjoyed myself. But eventually I\u00a0wanted something else. A home, I guess. In a sense it had taken me five years really to hear what my ex-girlfriend had said to me as we stood at the door. In that time, I&apos;d left behind the novel about my family and the obsessive mining of our history. And I&apos;d watched my brother face the various trials we all do in life: dating, finding work, staying healthy. Sometimes he failed, but only sometimes. At other times he succeeded, moving out of my mother&apos;s house and getting his own apartment; living with a roommate and getting along with them. And my mother had discovered sources of happiness, too: gardening, becoming a reader, even becoming politically active. So maybe joy wasn&apos;t impossible to find. I\u00a0guess I became optimistic. Or at least hopeful. I\u00a0hadn&apos;t stopped fearing the chance of passing on an illness, but that fear had become balanced by the observation that being ill wasn&apos;t the same as being beaten. When I first met my wife, Emily, it was obvious that up until then I hadn&apos;t been with the right woman. I started wanting that home for real. Still, neither of us had the courage to admit enthusiasm about dating the other. She&apos;s a writer, too, and had come out of a serious relationship. Independence suited her well. She and I went on 15 dates before we handled this impasse the traditional way: we went to a bar called the Fat Black Pussycat and drank until love finally sprang. Pounced, really. I&apos;d come to understand how keeping all my thoughts, fears and concerns inside had been part of the problem with my last serious girlfriend. I felt less pressure this time and more trust. So I\u00a0decided to share it all over dinner, early on in our relationship. At least then Emily could make her decisions about whether to stay with me, or leave, based on the complete truth. I gave her the whole history, all the way back to that miniature golf game with my mother. I must have talked for half an hour. When I was done, I felt tired and she stared at me, a little stunned. Finally she said, &quot;Why are you talking about marriage and children with me? We&apos;ve only been together for a month.&quot; In other words: slow down. In the years after that, we talked quite a lot about our future; my fears and newer-found optimism. Three years later, she agreed to marry me and, in August 2010, we had a bit of a honeymoon in Amsterdam. Our place overlooked the Spui, one\u00a0of the most popular squares in Amsterdam. On Fridays, booksellers set up shop there; on Saturdays, it&apos;s the art dealers. Political rallies and even bands regularly gather there. So it wasn&apos;t so odd when, one morning, an entire marching band gathered below our window. They played a lovely, and loud, set of songs. Emily particularly enjoyed them. The music seemed to promise a lovely day. We happened across a rarity that day in Amsterdam, a church that was actually still a\u00a0religious institution. We were more used to finding some old cathedral that had been turned into a community centre or even a squat. We went inside to find lots of other tourists there, too, looking equally surprised to find a church service going on. The pews full. The church had grand ceilings and stone walls, and was lit only by candles \u2013 hundreds of them \u2013 that set a tone of reverence. Emily saw a statue of Joseph and wanted to light a candle, so we fished around for a coin and she perched at the altar. While she kneeled, I stood beside her, reading the notices on the nearby bulletin board. Then Emily handed me a slip of paper. On it she&apos;d written, &quot;You are going to be a father.&quot; I nodded. I thought it was a nice prayer to\u00a0make at Joseph&apos;s altar. I turned away while she\u00a0finished up. But when we got outside she seemed thoroughly depressed. She wouldn&apos;t even look at me. I\u00a0tried to cheer her up with the offer of real Dutch pancakes for brunch, but it didn&apos;t help. &quot;What&apos;s the problem?&quot; I finally asked. Her eyes fell and her mouth tightened to a line. &quot;I told you I&apos;m pregnant and you don&apos;t even care.&quot; Instantly I pictured my reaction in the church, as she must have seen it. I&apos;d read the paper, grinned, stuffed it in my pocket and gone back to reading the bulletin board. That&apos;s it. She must have been horrified. This is the guy I married? This is about to be the father of my child? A man who&apos;s more excited about breakfast than our baby? But I&apos;d thought the slip of paper was a wish, not a birth announcement! I wanted to explain, but thought that would only make it worse. And, to my own surprise, I had a more visceral reaction to her news. I couldn&apos;t stop smiling. I\u00a0hadn&apos;t thought about what she told me, only felt it, like a current. When I grabbed her and kissed her, I thought she&apos;d feel a jolt. We&apos;re having a boy. The gender didn&apos;t matter to me. The thing I worry about can&apos;t yet be discovered in any test available to medical science. But for some reason, now, I don&apos;t feel myself transported to that afternoon with my mother, as I did when I was 30; when even the inkling of a child made me sweat. I feel as if I\u00a0encountered a monster when I turned 15, then spent 24 years fleeing from it. I just got exhausted and finally stopped running. But it&apos;s one thing to stop, it&apos;s another to turn around and confront the beast. I realise I might pass down an incurable illness to my son, but living based on what might go wrong seems like less and less of a life as I get older. The one thing I\u00a0can try to control is whether I teach my child to be ruled by anxiety, by fear. That&apos;s something that gets passed down, too. There&apos;s nothing to do but try, right? That&apos;s the task all of us face with every challenge. At least attempt. And I&apos;ve been surprised by how much that kind of bravery \u2013 the courage to try \u2013 has changed more people than just me. When I told my mother we were going to have a baby, she laughed and cheered despite herself. She&apos;s excited to meet him. My brother is, too. \u2022 Victor LaValle&apos;s latest novel, Big Machine, is published by No\u00a0Exit Press at \u00a38.99.

Enjoy &apos;cucumber season&apos;       Smoked cheese for sale in a farmers' market Photograph: Simon Target    Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It&apos;s the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries. There are daily farmers&apos; markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch.

There were also at least 16 people wounded during the attack at the Ridderhof mall in the suburb of Alphen aan den Rijn, 15 miles (25km) southwest of Amsterdam. The mayor, Bas Eenhoorn, said children were among the victims, but he could not confirm whether they were among the wounded or dead, or both. &quot;It&apos;s too terrible for words, a shock for us all,&quot; he said. A witness identified as Maart Verbeek told the Dutch state broadcaster, NOS, that he had seen five people he believed were dead. &quot;There was a panic in the mall, a lot of people running,&quot; said Verbeek, a pet shop owner. &quot;I see the attacker coming, walking, and I go inside the store ... and I see him going by with a big machine gun.&quot; NOS cited witnesses as saying the man later shot himself in the head with a second weapon, a pistol. The gunman was described as a 25-year-old white male with blond hair who was wearing a leather jacket and camouflage pants. His identity was known and it was &quot;all but certain&quot; he acted alone, district attorney Kitty Nooy said, but investigators were not yet ready to release his name or age. She said he was a native Dutchman from Alphen who has a criminal record. Martine Spruit, a 41-year-old receptionist, said she was shopping at a drug store when she heard bangs and people in the store hid behind shelves. When they realized a shooting was taking place, customers shouted for employees to lock the doors. &quot;Then we heard the shots getting further away, so he was walking back and forth,&quot; she said. &quot;Then we thought we&apos;d have a look and there were two people lying dead near the entrance ... then he came back shooting so we locked the door again.&quot; &quot;You hear about this sort of thing happening at American schools and you think that&apos;s a long way away,&quot; said Rob Kuipers, 50, a project manager. &quot;Now it&apos;s happened here in the Netherlands.&quot; A resident who lives near the mall who gave his name as Marijn said the shooting went on for several minutes. When he went to see whether friends working at the mall were OK, he saw the shooter lying dead in front of a grocery store. &quot;There was glass everywhere,&quot; the resident said. &quot;He was just shooting everywhere as if it were the Wild West.&quot; Four of the wounded are in critical condition, five were in serious condition and at least two others were slightly wounded, Eenhoorn said.

The fictional council house development in Greater Manchester that forms the backdrop to Shameless, one of Britain&apos;s longest-running drama series, is packed with dodgy incident. Such as the end of series one when charming Steve, played by James McAvoy, hands Fiona, played by Anne-Marie Duff, the keys to her own house \u2013 but only after blowing it up. Or the sombre scenes in the second series when Steve has to slip off to Amsterdam to avoid the law. Or perhaps the moment in the third series when lovable layabout Frank, played by David Threlfall, and Veronica, played by Maxine Peake, dig up a stash of fake gold. Oh, and a dead body. Yet one story rarely told about the nefarious and intertwined characters that have peopled Paul Abbott&apos;s fictional Manchester for seven years is the one of just how the Shameless casting team have managed to pick out so many acting stars of the future. As Duff is hailed this month for her &quot;electrifying&quot; West End performance as the scandalously adulterous Alma Rattenbury in Terence Rattigan&apos;s Cause C\u00e9l\u00e8bre, Peake&apos;s career is also in top gear. The recommissioning of the successful BBC1 series Silk, in which the actress plays an ambitious barrister, followed on the heels of her stage appearance in another Rattigan play, The Deep Blue Sea, at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Peake plays the worldly wise Alice Aisgill in a subtle new adaptation of John Braine&apos;s Room at the Top. Transmission last week was postponed at the last minute due to a contractual problem over the rights which the BBC is urgently trying to unravel. But with a film about the 1996 IRA Manchester bombing due to be shot over the summer and TV roles in The Devil&apos;s Whore, The Street and Little Dorrit already on her CV, Peake&apos;s decision to leave the role of Veronica in 2007 after 27 episodes of Shameless has been vindicated. Her only fear is that she will not find a path back to comic roles. &quot;When I started out I got pushed into comedy and was always desperate to play these parts. Now I&apos;m going, &apos;Please can I do a comedy?&apos; I don&apos;t know how much more I&apos;ve got in me,&quot; Peake said recently. The actress moved to Salford in 2009, after 13 years in London, and claims she has no strong desire to work in America. &quot;I don&apos;t have massive ambitions to be anywhere other than in this country doing good work, but I&apos;d be lying if I said I wasn&apos;t intrigued. It&apos;d be nice to go and earn a bit of money,&quot; she explained. Duff&apos;s on-screen boyfriend and real-life husband, McAvoy, has, of course, prospered, too, since his days stealing cars on Chatsworth. He has made the journey out to Hollywood, winning the lead role in the action film Wanted last year after acclaimed performances in Atonement and The Last King of Scotland. Since then he has appeared to lie comparatively low in his home in Hornsey, north London, enjoying becoming a father to Duff&apos;s baby son, Andrew, last summer. In fact, the actor is due to erupt onto cinema screens in June in the next X-Men film, First Class, in which he takes the part of Charles Xavier, or Professor X, the younger version of a character previously played by Patrick Stewart. &quot;To play the young Patrick Stewart and to fully engage at warp factor 9 with any part he&apos;s played is great fun,&quot; McAvoy told Empire magazine this month as he stood on the set in his blue and yellow X-Men uniform. It will be a big change of tone when he moves on to make a big screen version of Tolstoy&apos;s Anna Karenina alongside Keira Knightley and Jude Law for the Atonement director Joe Wright later in the year. Alongside these prominent Shameless stars are many others also in the ascendant, such as Gerard Kearns, who played Ian Gallagher and went on to Mark of Cain; Jody Latham who played Lip Gallagher and is now in EastEnders; and Ben Batt, who played Joe Pritchard, and has since appeared in Jimmy McGovern&apos;s Accused and in Peter Kosminsky&apos;s The Promise; or Rebecca Ryan who played Debbie Gallagher and is now in the BBC&apos;s award-winning show Waterloo Road. The story behind the discovery of all these talents is largely the story of Beverley Keogh, who helped develop the show in 2003 for Abbott and who still works with fellow casting director David Shaw to bring the right faces to Shameless. Keogh is based in Manchester and runs casting sessions across the country for a long roster of shows including Queer As Folk, Fat Friends, Clocking Off and Life On Mars. Discreet and retiring, Keogh and Shaw rarely comment on their work, preferring to put forward their talent instead, but their handiwork can also be spotted in the work of Ken Loach and Jimmy McGovern. When it first hit screens in 2004 the impact of Shameless was immediate. Duff and McAvoy were offered barrel-loads of work and left reluctantly after two series. Duff, who was playing 20-year-old Fiona at the age of 33, has described it as a very hard decision. &quot;I knew, creatively, it was time to move on. We filmed the second series for seven months and I just didn&apos;t want to be doing something for that long again that was the same,&quot; she said. Since then she has played Margot Fonteyn in a BBC4 film and took the role of John Lennon&apos;s mother in Sam Taylor Wood&apos;s debut feature film Nowhere Boy in 2009. In the same year she appeared as Sasha Tolstoy in The Last Station, with Helen Mirren. Her stage performances as Joan of Arc and now as Alma Rattenbury in Cause C\u00e9l\u00e8bre have been highly praised. &quot;Admittedly Anne-Marie Duff is not obvious casting as the happily hedonistic Alma. But she invests the role with a fragile intensity as if she is experiencing a bad dream, and has one wonderful moment when her eyes gaze adoringly at her young son who has been strategically placed in the courtroom,&quot; wrote Michael Billington in a review in the Guardian. Charles Spencer in the Telegraph suggested that Duff captured &quot;all the complexity of a woman driven by love and lust, at times repellent in her manipulation and vulgarity, at others deeply moving in her flayed emotions and what we come to recognise as a truly noble generosity of spirit&quot;. Judicious casting by Keogh and Shaw has also helped the careers of established actors. Threlfall, who already had a reputation as a great actor after television roles such as Leslie Titmuss, the unappealing MP in John Mortimer&apos;s Paradise Postponed, and who had enjoyed a theatrical career that started with the role of Smike the foundling in Trevor Nunn&apos;s epic staging of Dickens&apos;s Nicholas Nickleby, is now ingrained in mainstream popular culture after eight series playing Frank. Other experienced actors, including the likes of Marjorie Yates, Sean Gilder, Jack Deam and Anne Reid, have also benefited from the Shameless factor. Keogh and Shaw are the first to point out that it is not just the on-screen talent that has used Shameless as a launchpad. The writers and directors who first brought the show to British screens have also gone to influential positions in the industry. Writer Jack Thorne, for instance, has followed in Abbott&apos;s footsteps writing The Scouting Book for Boys, while Danny Brocklehurst has written Sorted, the nuclear war drama Decades for the BBC and Exile, which was created by Abbott. Mark Mylod, who directed the first episode of Shameless, is now a co-producer on the HBO television series Entourage in America and has also directed the American version of Shameless, while fellow director Dearbhla Walsh won an Emmy for her work on Andrew Davies&apos;s adaptation of Little Dorrit and then filmed the thriller The Silence and the historical drama The Tudors. The Chatsworth story is not over yet. With 22 new episodes going out this year in total, Shameless will celebrate its 100th episode this season and series eight is due to resume on 2 August. Is this perhaps the year that will propel Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths, the actor who has played the aggressive and sexually disoriented Mickey Maguire since series four, to wider stardom?", "sentences": ["Or the sombre scenes in the second series when Steve has to slip off to Amsterdam to avoid the law."], "title": "How Shameless stars came of age on West End stage", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/10/shameless-peake-duff-acting-talent", "tags": ["Shameless", "Comedy", "Television", "Culture", "UK news", "Comedy", "Anne-Marie Duff", "Maxine Peake"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-11T08:13:00Z", "article": "At the end of last week Patrick Ness set out his top 10 &apos;unsuitable&apos; reads for teens - the books that are best read when people tell you that you are too young to read them.

Paula:As a librarian who serves children, teens and adults, I am often at a loss when I meet kids and teens who disdain anything that isn&apos;t &quot;true&quot; but to whom ancient Rome or medieval England seem as fictional as Hogwarts. For these kids I am always looking for true crime, and there is no more inappropriate true crime story than the one that haunted my nightmares from the time I read it at age 14 until, at least, college - Helter Skelter, the story of the Manson &quot;family&quot; and the crimes they committed. I think teens are just at the stage, as they pull away from their own families, to understand the charismatic lure of a substitute family, even one as horrible as Charlie&apos;s squalid band. Anthony:  I&apos;d choose The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel&apos;s Game by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. I think, as teens, we find the mystery just so much better and we appreciate it more, and it&apos;s exciting. The same goes for The Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  I&apos;d also choose The Reader by Bernhard Schlink because it&apos;s about comprehending the Holocaust and what to do. It&apos;s perfect for teens because we can learn about it.  Thula-Thula is a Afrikaans book by Annelie Botes (I don&apos;t know whether it was translated into English). It&apos;s about a girl who is sexually abused by her father and about how her mother ignores it. It is very graphic but gripping and teens I think will connect with the girl.  30 Nights in Amsterdam by Etienne van Heerden is about the Afrikaners, Apartheid and the colonisation of Africa and our identity in South Africa.

Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, which organises the prize, said: &quot;The diversity of styles in the shortlisted portraits, and the skill of the works selected from this record entry to the BP Portrait Award, show how contemporary portraiture remains an energetic and telling force.&quot; For the fifth year the competition, originally intended for young artists from the UK, has been open to any age from any country, and this year 2,372 entries were submitted, 1,644 from the UK, up 196 on last year. Of these 55 have been chosen by judges for the exhibition which opens at the gallery in June. In some years competitors have stretched the definition of &quot;portrait&quot; to breaking point, but the four shortlisted works are all traditionally painted portraits of recognisable individuals. The most startling is one that would not have caused Victorian audiences to turn a hair, an 8ft-tall canvas of a naked model called Holly, handcuffed to a rock, a female allegory of Prometheus looking up patiently towards the eagle coming to gnaw at her innards. The painting is by Louis Smith, from Manchester, and if it looks stagey, that may be because he has also studied scene painting at the Royal Academy. In contrast, Sertan Saltan&apos;s model, Mrs Cerna \u2013 the younger sister of a friend in New York where the Turkish-born artist is based \u2013 is fully clothed but far more menacing, sharpening a\u00a0cleaver, rubber-gloved and ready. &quot;The contrast of knife, gloves and rollers brought both humour and horror to mind,&quot; he said. &quot;The animated sharpening of the knives and thoughtful facial expressions were burned into my mind&apos;s eye.

Distracted, by Amsterdam-based Wim Heldens, is a portrait of Jeroen, a now 25-year-old philosophy student to whom Heldens has been a &quot;father figure&quot; and has drawn and painted since he was four years old. Heldens is a self-taught, professional artist. The prize last year was awarded to a the haunting painting of a dead 100-year-old woman, made over three days as a devotional study by her artist daughter, Daphne Todd.

This old favourite genre, in which players use one stick to move and one to fire, has already been exhumed via the likes of (deep breath) Assault Heroes, Alpha Squad, Microbot, Inferno, Zombie Apocalypse, Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime, Aqua: Naval Warfare and Geometry Wars (and relax). There&apos;s something about the combination of top-down 2D visuals, hardcore shooting action and retro appeal that makes this gametype a fertile hunting ground for indie studios.  The latest entry is Gatling Gears from Amsterdam-based developer, Vanguard Games, which has followed Klei Entertainment and Hothead Games into Electronic Art&apos;s Partners programme. Due out on PC, PSN and Xbox 360 soon, this mecha-flavoured steam punk romp is set on a once beautiful planet that&apos;s gone through a hyper-accelerated industrial revolution, leaving it with a shattered ecology and a lot of steam-powered robots and fighting vehicles charging about the bespoiled countryside. At the centre of the destruction is an evil Empire intent on wringing out the last of the world&apos;s resources. Now, a retired pilot from the Empire&apos;s own army of mech commanders must stand against his ex-employer.            What this sets up is an intense blast-&apos;em-up, where players clamber into robot walkers and ceaselessly pound waves of enemy tanks, choppers and war bots, each of which are quite happy to ceaselessly pound right back. The three weapons are a chain gun, which has unlimited ammo but limited damage and range; a canon that fires powerful long-range projectiles; and a grenade launcher. Each of these can be upgraded as you pick up cash in the game world, plus there are temporary power-ups which massively boost the capabilities of specific weapons for a set period. Oh, and when it all gets too much, a smart bomb option, limited to one per level, will helpfully obliterate everything on screen. It&apos;s a familiar foundation, then, but what really works in Gatling Gears&apos; favour is its impressively detailed visual style. The player controlled mechs look and move like the scout walkers from Return of the Jedi, stomping over the landscape with a lovely loping stride. Each vehicle is packed with intricate moving parts, from revolving guns to opening turrets and there&apos;s a huge array of enemies, escalating in size from lone soldiers with rocket launchers to mammoth drop ships that crunch out of the sky spitting venomous fire in all directions. Each of the six chapters ends with a boss battle; I got to play one against a giant hovering craft that zooms out of a ravine and fills the screen with laser blasts \u2013 there&apos;s a real bullet hell feel about the encounter. Each chapter features a different landscape type taking in the usual range of frozen wastelands, scorched deserts, and lush green fields. Each has a high level of destructibility, so buildings and natural obstacles are blasted to fragments during the chaos.       At EA&apos;s recent showcase event in London, I played through the countryside chapter and enjoyed the brawling madness, with helicopters swooping down and tanks rolling in over rickety wooden bridges. The only slight pain is the grenade, which requires you to hold down a button, aim a reticule at where you want the projectile to land, and then release. It&apos;s fiddly, inaccurate and time-consuming, and your shields (which can also be upgraded, thankfully) often take a sizeable battering while you&apos;re lining up a shot.  The game will be best experienced in the two-player co-op mode, which can be enjoyed locally or online.

To download all 36 songs in one file click here ENGLAND       The Guardian Music BlogHoly Other - Touch  A nameless character who works variously in Berlin, Gothenburg and Manchester, Holy Other is a British musician who, like his US counterpart How To Dress Well, has a penchant for taking contemporary R&amp;B and draining it of all passion and all its sexual signifiers. What you&apos;re left with is music like Touch: slow, drifting electronica, marked by glitches, with an almost church-like atmosphere that has led some to describe it as &quot;ambient goth&quot;, an affecting mix of spectral sonics and ghostly vocals, as un-earthy as it is unearthly. ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieVioleta Castillo - La Batalla Del Movimiento  Violeta is a young and promising singer-songwriter from Buenos Aires who just released her first recordings in the form of two EPs, Uno and Otro. La Batalla Del Movimiento is a sweet pop ballad with great arrangements, thanks to her collaboration with a great band called Monoambiente. You can listen to both EPs and buy the MP3s from her Bandcamp page. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Khancoban - Until It Takes You Over  Sure there are big drums and meandering atmospherics that do tab out a few pages of Neon Bible, but Khancoban manage to verge on &apos;epic&apos; without coming out too overtly pomp. For what it lacks in lyrical diversity, it makes up for in delivery - a steady build that abruptly cuts off after only three minutes. New album Arches Over The Sun drops in July. Until then, this one will be a good excuse to wake up early and mull over my cereal to. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoLu\u00edsa Maita - Lero-Lero  Lero-Lero is the minimalist samba that opens the debut album from singer Lu\u00edsa Maita. It&apos;s a song that calmly grows, almost without you noticing - her soft voice takes you to a special place in your head and suddenly you&apos;re just dancing and singing along with her. This track is also available for free download on Bandcamp. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicDora Alexander - Travelers  Yes, Dora Alexander sound just like a version of Radiohead that ceased to exist somewhere between The Bends and OK Computer. But you know what? It&apos;s been about a decade and a half since then, so it&apos;s probably safe for someone else to claim that sound. And, as Travelers - both this song and their debut EP of the same name - demonstrates, Dora Alexander are ready to pick up that mantle. Here&apos;s hoping they stick with it a little longer than the originators. CHILE       Super 45DeMentira - Post-Tbc  Ariel Altamirano, the DJ and producer better known as DeMentira, is the founder of Chilean netlabel Discos Pegaos, specializing in electronic music and abstract beats. The label was responsible for debut albums by Vaskular and Motivado as well the release of Chinpanc\u00e9 EP, first solo effort from DeMentira since his introduction as producer and rapper for the trio Iris in 2006. Post-Tbc is the first single from Chinpanc\u00e9 EP where we find mysterious beats, not dissimilar to dubstep, as well the experimental nature of the wonky sound. CHINA       WooozyFriend Or Foe - Snorting Clorox  Friend Or Foe are a secretive, occasionally masked rock trio who have been tearing up the Shanghai scene lately with their brand of fun-filled, balls-out rock. Preferring to keep their identities a secret, the band promulgate the myth that they are in fact three illegitimate demons, raised in Heaven: guitarist and vocalist Rabshakeh and often topless drummer Mahanehdan are joined by bassist Bill. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaJiggy Drama - Me Vale  Jiggy Drama is a musical phenomenon in Latin America. His &apos;Nerdside&apos; style has the total attention of radio stations and nightclubs, generating an internet boom with his urban alternative music. His most recent single, Me Vale, is a Cumbia fusion with some Caribbean sounds. DENMARK       All ScandinavianFrederik Teige - You Always Tried To Pull Us Down  He&apos;s been touring with Efterklang since 2007, but thankfully singer, songwriter and guitarist Frederik Teige has also found time to write and record material of his own. The climax so far is his self-released full-length debut Body God - nine songs worth of awesome alternative pop - which you can get for as much as you feel like paying (free is even an option) on Bandcamp. ESTONIA       PopopMimicry - Godspeed  Aggressive and arrogant, otherworldly and expressive, Mimicry fuses electroclash with psychedelic techno, ethnic beats and garage rock. Their aim: to produce perfectly mindblowing party music and provoke emotions never felt before. FINLAND       GlueNT&apos;s White Trash - Whistle  The most recognizable Brit in Finnish indie, Nick Triani, put together NT&apos;s White Trash with the aim of making some noise, which is captured in the band&apos;s debut Mourning Becomes Electric due in May. Whistle is a catchy two-and-a-half minute guitar-pop song, with an uplifting\u2026 well, whistling. It is a smooth exception on an album that promises some edgier sounds. FRANCE       Yet You&apos;re FiredThomas Kieffer - Summertime  Thomas Kieffer is a talented songwriter, offspring of the Strasbourg rock scene. At 15 years old, he was hugely impressed by bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple and started playing in different bands. Today, at 35, his resum\u00e9 is very impressive: he has opened for legendary artists such as Canned Heat, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Gary Moore, NOFX and Scorpions. He started a solo career two years ago, giving up on hard rock and metal, and should succeed with it and his album Beautiful Hands. GERMANY       BlogparteiJoasihno - Von  Joasihno&apos;s songs benefit a lot from his percussionist skills and his open-mindedness for playful but cautious arrangements. His wanderlust is almost tangible as he sings, although he is deeply rooted in Bavaria. Von is taken from his forthcoming debut We Say: Oh Well which is being released on Kyr Records. GREECE       Mouxlaloulouda2L8 - Don&apos;t Follow Me  2L8&apos;s music lurches deftly between emotional intimacy, ambition and experimentation. Their two well-received previous releases (download them for free here) proved they are one of the most creative and compelling acts in the musical underground. They are running a campaign on Pledge Music to help them unleash their forthcoming double album, New Battles, Without Honor And Humanity. The magnificent Don&apos;t Follow Me, a Music Alliance Pact exclusive, drips with melancholy. It blends warmth and brooding, existential contemplation with a repetitive but mesmerizing acoustic guitar melody full of subtlety and distinct sonic accents, and swims in gorgeous sheets of trembling, passionate vocals. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaSk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld - Kva\u00f0ning  Sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld is a metal band formed in August 2009. The six members had been formerly active in other bands, not all metal. Their music can be described as powerful, melodic and epic Viking metal, along with various folk influences. The lyrics follow the strict rules of traditional Icelandic poetry. Kva\u00f0ning is featured on last year&apos;s debut record Baldur, a concept album telling the epic and dramatic tale of the viking Baldur. INDIA       IndiecisionPentagram - Tomorrow&apos;s Decided  Pentagram is one of India&apos;s biggest acts. The band has been around for the better part of the past two decades, creating music that&apos;s always been a contemporary, cutting edge reflection of the generation it is part of. The band recently released its fourth studio album Bloodywood, arguably its most evolved work yet. Tomorrow&apos;s Decided uses a traditional, folk-based drum beat and surrounds it with quintessential, soaring Pentagram electro-rock goodness to create four of the most intensely exciting minutes you&apos;re going to have today. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarGugun Blues Shelter - White Dog  Gugun Blues Shelter is probably one of Indonesia&apos;s best exports, with recognition from the blues community in Europe, USA, Asia and Australia. The band have played at international events such as the Belfast Big River Blues and Jazz Festival and Great British R&amp;B Festival. And no big festival in Indonesia would be complete without them. IRELAND       Nialler9SertOne - Past Present Future  Reminscent of RJD2, J Dilla and all those fine beat maestros that no doubt inspired him, Liverpool via Portadown&apos;s SertOne aka 21-year-old Gareth McAlinden is certainly a producer to watch. This tune contains a unique Belfast sample, twisted brass and a head-nodding beat that makes you sit up and take notice. You can find it on the recent seven-track The View From Above EP through Melted Music. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelGevolt - Bay Mir Bistu Sheyn  Yiddish metal pioneers Gevolt took this 1932 Yiddish musical track (that incidentally was a big hit in Nazi Germany until they figured out it was Yiddish) and made glorious metal out of it. Their sound resembles a happy-go-lucky Rammstein/Linkin Park hybrid with violins. But since a lot of their songs are versions of the old ones my grandmothers sing, they have an unmatched nostalgic beauty. Download their second album Alef Base for free while you still can at their site. ITALY       PolaroidLove Boat - You Know I Really Want You  These guys from Sardinia are probably more known around Europe than in Italy. That&apos;s how bad this country has gotten. Anyway, they have a new album on the German label Alien Snatch and a 7&quot; EP on Shit Music For Shit People. This song comes from the latter&apos;s B-side. Grab everything and start to dance a wild garage party - this is good rock &apos;n&apos; roll. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaToy Selectah - No Pasma feat. Isa GT  In the last decade, Cumbia has become the &apos;lingua franca&apos; to fill Latin-oriented dancefloors worldwide. Its saucy rhythms and nasty grooves easily adapt to many other musical forms: from techno to reggae, passing through favela-funk or dubstep. With a career spanning 15 years (and dreadlocks nearly that long), Toy Selectah has earned respect as a Cumbia-lord, trading the genre and cross-pollinating it with his constant travels and after-hours gigs. His Mex Machine EP out on Diplo&apos;s Mad Decent label is an infectious state of affairs. On No Pasma, the Colombia-born, London-dwelling singer Isa GT throws some cocksure chants on a perfect groundshaking Cumbia. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDeath Letters - Your Heart Is Upside Down  It&apos;s nice to see a bit of international buzz building for a young Dutch band. This duo aren&apos;t even legal to enjoy a good piss-up in Texas, which is where they headed last year to record an album with Chris &apos;Frenchie&apos; Smith (Jet, The Dandy Warhols, Smog) and where they returned to for SXSW last month. The resulting album, Post-Historic, isn&apos;t the band&apos;s first effort but it&apos;s markedly different from their self-titled debut. Here they leave behind their original blues-rock trappings and fire through Glassjaw post-hardcore, Biffy Clyro post-grunge and ...Trail Of Dead post-rock &apos;n&apos; roll. That may be a lot of &apos;posts&apos; but they make an incredibly energetic yet refined racket on stage. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalGhost Wave - Sunsetter  Ghost Wave hits you like a motorik wall of noise, with its hypnotic waves of reverb guitar, mechanical drums and atmospherics. Matt Paul&apos;s project started after his solo electronic act Street Beat gave way to this united front, with drummer Eammon Logan, guitarist Rikki Sutton and bassist Alex Grant. Live they&apos;re enigmatic with tightly wound, ravaged Clean-style hooks and perfectly warped pop songs. Their debut EP was released earlier this month on Arch Hill. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceBeatbully - B\u00f8lleboogie  Beatbully is an offspring of the Norwegian skweee label D\u00f8dpop. Skweee is a genre of Nordic heritage, based on classic hip hop beats with heavy influence of modern electronica. Although mainly composed for a live audience, Beatbully invites skweee to your living room as well. This winter, he released Kosmisk Regn (&quot;Cosmic Rain&quot;), the first solo album in D\u00f8dpop&apos;s history. B\u00f8lleboogie has an irresistible beat that leaves no one behind on the dancefloor, and the juicy melody won&apos;t release you till its over. It&apos;s a three-minute piece of bliss that will make even your grandmother dance. PERU       SoTBKuraka - Fuego Negro  Kuraka is a rock group that spawned from the collaboration of renowned musicians of local bands such as Emergency Blanket, Zen, M.A.S.A.C.R.E. and Inyectores. The diversity of styles seemed an obstacle to assemble their ideas, but the bonds of friendship led to them making something interesting. In 2009, they released a few singles that whetted the appetite for their debut album Fuego Negro, which came out in August 2010 on Mundane Records. Take a listen to the great song that gives the album its name. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?They&apos;re Heading West  - My Case Is A Different One  They&apos;re Heading West are three singers/composers (Jo\u00e3o Correia, Francisca Cortes\u00e3o, Mariana Ricardo) and a drummer (S\u00e9rgio Nascimento) who decided to get together and play songs from their bands and solo projects. They only have one set of songs, recorded live at a national radio station, which is not yet available commercially. The song featured this month is, therefore, a MAP exclusive as a free download. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseParachute Pulse - Hopscptch  Parachute Pulse is the brand new project of Ana Roman. Her debut album, Kingdom, is a collection of cinematic sounds, moods and emotions. The album is available for free download on her label&apos;s page, Asiluum. Hopscptch is a collaboration with Res Es of Semiosis, who were featured in the Music Alliance Pact back in May 2009. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopSebastian Dangerfield - You Played Your Part, Singer!  Sebastian Dangerfield are a four-piece from Edinburgh who are little-known even in their home city. But that shouldn&apos;t be the case for much longer if the band continue to show such an accomplished grasp of Americana-tinged folk-rock amplified with a healthy dose of scuzzy-pop zest and various stringed instruments. The wonderfully-named You Played Your Part, Singer! is taken from their new EP, The Sound Of The Old Machines, which you can find on Bandcamp. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...DJ Koflow - Make Your Hands Clap, Toes Clap  DJ Koflow is one of Singapore&apos;s most celebrated DJs. His claim to fame started when he won the national DMC Championship in 2003, and he continued to skyrocket by receiving many honourable mentions in local and international media. He dropped his debut album The Turntable Instrumentalist despite a heavy production and performance schedule, with the record speaking volumes of his myriad influences. Jazz, hip hop, funk and soul all seamlessly flow together in the hands of one of the country&apos;s brightest mix masters. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Battle Beyond The Stars - The Desert  Philip Kramer, aka Battle Beyond The Stars, is a Cape Town-based DJ and producer. He is best known for his unique blend of electro, French house and unusual tracks that no DJ in their right mind would play in public. He recently released an EP entitled Memory which gave his awaiting fans a concrete collection of songs. With his new offering The Desert, he injects his signature sound to create a shimmering, synth-infused song that shows off his immense talent with its subtly. For his latest work download and have a listen to Drifter&apos;s Theme. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKNeon Bunny - Long-D  Yoojin Lim is the sole member of Neon Bunny, who debuted with an album called Seoulight in late March. Having been a session keyboardist for successful power-pop act The Black Skirts - the very first South Korean MAP contribution - her own sound is on the electro side, influenced by Ladyhawke and Phoenix. Long-D is a semi-catchy track with something of a retro sound. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerDisco Las Palmeras! - La Casa Cuartel  Disco Las Palmeras! are a three-piece band from Galicia, hometown of related acts such as Franc3s, Mequetrefe or Tri\u00e1ngulo de Amor Bizarro and cradle of the new Spanish noise wave. La Casa Cuartel opens their debut album, Nihil Obstat, released earlier this year. The song is about a terrorist strike on a police station and features hypnotic drums and suffocating guitar riffs that recall exactly the same feelings the lyrics talk about: fear and anxiety. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseSummer Heart - Please Stay  It&apos;s almost spring which means summer is still a while away. But we can dream, can&apos;t we? That&apos;s where this song from Malm\u00f6-based band Summer Heart comes in. It&apos;s called Please Stay, but with its Beach Boys harmonies, groovy beat and summer feeling, it may as well be the band&apos;s coup d&apos;\u00e9tat. SWITZERLAND       78sPamela M\u00e9ndez - Bubble Bubble  Bubble Bubble is the first single from Pamela M\u00e9nedez&apos;s critically-acclaimed debut album I Will Be Loved, released in February. The Bern resident, whose father is Mexican, belongs to a new breed of female singer-songwriters popping up in nearly every Swiss town. Heidi Happy, Sophie Hunger, Lena Fennell and Lea Lu are others to check out. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingSupreme Cuts - Amnesia  Chicago&apos;s Supreme Cuts describe their sound as &quot;future R&amp;B&quot; - a perfect name for the sample and bass-heavy slow grooves they weave into their songs. Amnesia is perhaps their most supreme cut, a ridiculously addictive head trip that could soundtrack a nightclub as easily as it could an R Kelly video from the 90s. VENEZUELA       M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sUnos Infames - Pagando Es Que Se Puede  You could say that Unos Infames is just another rock band. But no. To hear and see them live you will realize that their strength on stage belongs to a mega band. Unos Infames, who formed in Barcelona, Anzo\u00e1tegui, is made up of experienced musicians who fuse some blues influences with controversial lyrics. They are currently recording their debut album.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDeath Letters - Your Heart Is Upside Down  It&apos;s nice to see a bit of international buzz building for a young Dutch band."], "title": "April's best new music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/apr/15/april-new-music-map", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Electronic music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-16T23:05:00Z", "article": "I was a really picky eater as a child. Because I was obsessed by Popeye, my mum and aunts would put my food in a can to represent spinach and we&apos;d hum the Popeye tune and then I&apos;d happily eat it. My Auntie Chrissie would knock up apple pies, cakes and scones with the radio on and a fag hanging out the corner of her mouth in a way that seemed effortless. My primary school teacher once poured a bottle of curdled school milk forcefully down my throat. Then I threw it up all over her suede shoes. I&apos;d rather have drunk from the spittoon in Barney&apos;s barber shop. I&apos;ve since been to every chippie in the north of England yet I&apos;ve never tasted fish and chips as good as at Mrs Cunningham&apos;s in Birkenhead. Mrs Cunny, as we called her, was a wonderful woman, with a smile and a wink for everyone. Queuing up for my weekly treat I&apos;d say: &quot;Can you put a big one in for me, Mrs Cunny?&quot; The first caff I ate at when I came to London was the New Piccadilly Cafe on Denman Street. All human life was there. I would sit looking out like an Amsterdam tart. I make a wonderful cure-all called Four Thieves, just like my mum did. It&apos;s cider vinegar, 36 cloves of garlic and four herbs, representing four looters of plague victims&apos; homes in 1665 who had their sentences reduced from burning at the stake to hanging for explaining the recipe that kept them from catching the plague. Maybe it&apos;s just a placebo. It&apos;s always worked for me. Every week I have a disaster in my kitchen. The fire alarm goes off repeatedly. But it doesn&apos;t stop me being adventurous. Recently I brought home a Viennese cookery book and had a go at a special apple pie, but it came out looking like the Elephant Man. On the mantelpiece above the Aga there&apos;s old chemist&apos;s bottles labelled &quot;Poison&quot;, &quot;Belladonna&quot; and &quot;Arsenic&quot;, which I use to store herbs. It worries people when I\u00a0sprinkle them in their spaghetti bolognese, and I keep a straight face and let them sweat. The person I always enjoy having a meal with is Cilla Black. I might not see her for months, but then I&apos;ll pick her up at her flat and we&apos;ll go to a restaurant and it&apos;s like I&apos;ve seen her that morning. She makes fabulous chips, Cilla. When I&apos;m at her place in Barbados I&apos;ll say: &quot;Go and do one of your mean pans of chips, will you, love?&quot; My idea of food hell is a balut. It&apos;s an egg sold as a delicacy on the streets of Manila, where I once worked as a waiter in the brothel Gussie&apos;s Bar. A balut&apos;s been boiled soon before it hatches, so when you crack it open there&apos;s this fetus swimming in grey liquid. You could torture me on the rack and I&apos;d still refuse to eat one.

Branded the eternal Booker bridesmaid, Bainbridge was shortlisted five times for the Man Booker prize between 1973 and 1998 but never won. Following her death last July, aged 75, organisers of the award decided to honour an author who had made the shortlist more frequently than any other writer by creating a &quot;Best of Beryl&quot; Booker, and asked the public to vote for their favourite of Bainbridge&apos;s shortlisted books. Over 1,000 readers voted in the contest, with Master Georgie squeaking in just ahead of Every Man for Himself, published in 1996. The other titles in the running were all older novels: The Dressmaker (1973), The Bottle Factory Outing (1974), and An Awfully Big Adventure (1990). Set during the filth and misery of the Crimean war, Master Georgie tells of the adventures of surgeon and photographer George Hardy as he leaves London for the Bosphurus, trailed by his adoptive sister Myrtle, lapsed geologist Dr Potter and photographer&apos;s assistant and fire-eater Pompey Jones. The Times said on publication: &quot;It is hard to think of anyone now writing who understands the human heart as Beryl Bainbridge does.&quot; Ion Trewin, literary director of the Booker and a former judge, said: &quot;I have a feeling that, wherever she is now, she&apos;ll be hugging herself and saying &apos;gosh, how lovely&apos;. Over the years when she didn&apos;t win, she thought oh well, and had another puff on a cigarette and a drink. But to win \u2013 well, I can&apos;t believe it would give her anything other than immense pleasure. He added: &quot;She may have been known as the eternal Booker bridesmaid, but we are delighted to be able finally to crown Master Georgie a Booker bride.&quot; Trewin announced Master Georgie&apos;s success at a party in Soho on Tuesday evening, where Bainbridge&apos;s daughter Jojo Davies and grandson Charlie Russell accepted a one-off designer-bound copy of the book as the prize on behalf of the family. &quot;There were fewer than 100 votes between first and fifth so it was a very close-run thing,&quot; said Trewin. &quot;It just demonstrates that her books are pretty universally loved. As far as I&apos;m concerned Master Georgie is an absolutely terrific choice, but I could have chosen any of the other four too.&quot; Bainbridge wrote 17 novels, from her debut, A Weekend with Claud (1967), to her final work, The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress, which will be published posthumously by Little, Brown in June. Set around the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the author was putting the finishing touches to it when she died. &quot;Not all that many writers, over a 50-year career, can still be turning out absolutely first-rate writing,&quot; said Trewin. &quot;She just went on writing great novels.&quot; Although Bainbridge missed out on the Booker, she was a two-time winner of the Whitbread award. Master Georgie won the author the WH Smith literary award and the James Tait Black memorial prize.

Holland&apos;s Eurovision song contest organiser, Rene, checks we&apos;re all here. &quot;San Marino?&quot; he calls out. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Croatia.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Russia . . . Russia?&quot; He gives the Russians a look. &quot;Yes we are here.&quot; &quot;And UK.&quot; &quot;Here,&quot; chime Simon Webbe, Lee Ryan, Duncan James and Antony Costa, AKA Blue. We could be on the road to Euro triumph for the first time in many years. Blue are visiting country after European country to boost support, and show the rest of Europe they really want to win. The countries are asked to hold a flag to show who they represent. As Blue get off the bus, they are told their flag is unnecessary. Six years since they split up, the band are still famous. Newly reformed, they have been hand-picked as the UK entry. They have a strong song, I Can, and the only way is up. They look little different from their boyband glory years \u2013 bigger biceps and more facial hair, but that&apos;s about it. The mayor of Volendam welcomes us to the fishing village with the very best of Holland \u2013 salted cod, mackerel and herring \u2013 and the Dutch entrants, 3JS, perform live for us. Even though the Netherlands are pleased with their effort, it is unlikely to make the final. And this gets to the heart of the hostility to the UK \u2013 not only have most recent songs been risible, but the UK, alongside Spain, France, Italy and Germany, gets a free pass to the final. No wonder they want to kick us in the Baltics. Way back in the 20th century, when Abba and Celine Dion won Eurovision, the UK treated it with respect. Great artists such as Sandie Shaw and Lulu came home victorious, as did Brotherhood of Man and Bucks Fizz. Then came the bleak decades, when our entries were regarded as ironic at best, or simply rubbish. In recent years, the UK has been dismissed with contempt by the rest of Europe. We had no political allies, we were said to have the wrong attitude, and country after country ganged up against us. The nadir came in 2003, when Jemini&apos;s Cry Baby suffered the ignominy of nul points. Last year, Josh Dubovie finished bottom with 10 points. But now we&apos;re ready for a Eurovision renaissance. For three glorious years in the early 2000s, Blue were huge \u2013 their three albums topped the UK charts and there were 11 top 10 singles (including All Rise, One Love and a cover of Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word with Elton John). They were not manufactured (though they looked as if they must have been) and dominated the tabloids by saying the unsayable. Then saying it again, only worse. But by 2005, nobody wanted to know \u2013 the final two singles didn&apos;t chart in the UK. The boys went on to experience mixed fortunes \u2013 Simon enjoyed greatest success as a solo artist. Duncan has done well in West End musicals such as Legally Blonde, Lee has had a few hits and Antony has dabbled in acting. All four now have children, have separated from their partners, and are struggling romantically. Duncan recently announced he was bisexual \u2013 cynics suggested it was publicity stunt. This month they marked their return with a nude photoshoot for the gay magazine Attitude. Blue&apos;s former manager, Daniel Glatman, described the decision to enter Eurovision as &quot;reckless insanity&quot;, saying: &quot;They will have to win. Anything less and their reputation would be in tatters. It is the equivalent of Lewis Hamilton entering a go-kart race.&quot; Do the band think it a risk? &quot;Honestly?&quot; Duncan says. &quot;I\u00a0thought it&apos;s going to go one way or another. But we were a massive band in Europe, and we want to let everyone in Europe know we&apos;re back. What bigger platform could we use to let everyone know in one hit? One hundred and twenty-five million people watch it on the night, not including people watching on the net. So we sat down and went, you know what, it&apos;s a no-brainer.&quot; In Amsterdam, the nude shoot is a popular topic of conversation. Are they stripping their way to success? &quot;Well, that&apos;s not a bad way of putting it, but if that&apos;s the way to get there why not?&quot; Duncan says. &quot;We&apos;re in shape, we work hard and it&apos;s a good way to let everyone know we&apos;re back.&quot; We head back to the hotel. A handful of fans who greeted the band at the airport have reconvened in the lobby. Priscilla Vanhuystee, a big, beautiful girl in her mid-20s, is trying to explain her obsession. &quot;It started in 2003. I\u00a0can&apos;t tell you how many times I saw them. It&apos;s a disease, it really is, because normal people don&apos;t understand it. They are very good singers, and I like them as a group, and it&apos;s just fun to get to know the people.&quot; Is it wise for Blue to make a comeback? &quot;They are still young men. I think they are better-looking now. They are like grownup men now, not the boyish thing now.&quot; She loves the fact that you never know what Blue are going to come out with next. What&apos;s her favourite story? &quot;Lee having a baby with his fan. He dated this girl from MySpace who sent him naughty pictures. Hahahaha!&quot; Lee is sitting on the table next to us, so we ask him if it&apos;s true. &quot;No, it&apos;s bullshit.&quot; Lee, the youngest member of Blue, was only 16 when the band got together, and was often the source of the news stories. He says he has always been. Where does it come from? &quot;Stupid fucking journalists writing what they want to make me look like a cunt. It&apos;s really frustrating. I&apos;m not like that at all.&quot; Take\u00a0the 9/11 controversy, which almost did for the band. At the time, they were trying to make it in America, the twin towers had just been blown up, and Lee suggested that worse things were happening in the world. &quot;I just said there were kids dying of Aids and stuff, and the whole country went on a campaign for New\u00a0York, and I\u00a0was just saying there are plenty of other things we can change now. Listen, it was a tragic thing that happened, but there have been tragic things that have happened since then that don&apos;t get half as much of the coverage. And that&apos;s the truth.&quot; He pauses. Actually, he says, he knows what really did for him. &quot;The thing is, I\u00a0said the words &apos;Fuck\u00a0New York&apos;, but I didn&apos;t mean it in a malicious way, it just\u00a0came out as a 17-year-old articulating himself.&quot; What he said was: &quot;Who gives a fuck about New York when elephants are being killed?&quot; &quot;I got about 20,000 emails saying they wanted to shove anthrax down my throat.&quot; Did it scare him? &quot;Yeah, it scared my mum. Cos you get some crazy fucks in America.&quot; He became disillusioned with the industry, and still is. &quot;I will never ever work with a major record label again in my whole life. Cos they&apos;re crap, they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing. And if they fuck it up, it&apos;s your fault . . . I don&apos;t think you need a record label these days.&quot; He sips his latte. &quot;You know what pisses me off most about this industry is when people call me thick. I hate that. Because things I say sometimes come out stupid. But I don&apos;t need to prove myself. I know what I&apos;m good at.&quot; It&apos;s nearly midnight and we&apos;re heading off to a club in the centre of Amsterdam where the Eurovionistas are singing. Blue have top billing, and are on last. Everybody has been telling the band they are favourites to win, and this is worrying them. &quot;No,&quot; insists Antony, &quot;we&apos;re only second favourite and if we finish top five we&apos;ll have done well.&quot; I ask Duncan about the different personalities in the band. Well, he says, first there are the voices. &quot;Lee&apos;s like the voice of the angels \u2013 a really high, beautiful voice. Antony has a rockier voice. Si has got the open kind of sound, very soulful, and I&apos;ve got quite a husky voice. And personality: Lee is a law unto himself, the crazy one, the genius. They say with geniuses, they&apos;re all a bit unbalanced in their head, which, in the most loving way, he is.&quot; In what way is he a genius? &quot;His brain works on such a different level. Lyrically, the way he writes, the way he paints, he&apos;s just very creative. I&apos;m the worrier of the band, the dad of the band. Sometimes I can be a bit too bossy. I need to learn to chill. Ant is the comedian of the band. He&apos;s the joker. When everything gets a bit too much he&apos;ll diffuse it instantly and everything&apos;s cool again. Si&apos;s very chilled, very laidback, very hard-working.&quot; Who&apos;s the most popular? &quot;We all have different fans,&quot; Duncan says. &quot;I\u00a0get a lot of the mums and the disabled children. A lot of my fans have got cerebral palsy, but you know what? I love children like that, and I love people who have got disabilities because I spent a lot of time in hospital with my grandparents when they were ill, and Mum was a nurse. It&apos;s just in my nature. I&apos;m like a magnet to them, and I treat them like normal people so they latch on. I once had a launch party and there was a queue of disabled kids all in wheelchairs come to see me, and Sara [the band&apos;s manager] walked in and goes: &apos;What is it with you and disabled people?&apos;&quot; The sound is so bad at the club that they decide to mime. Twelve hundred middle-aged men in checked shirts pump their fists in the air to I Can. After the performance, they retire to a tiny staircase where a journalist interviews the band while squeezed between the knees of Simon and the chest of Duncan. He looks like he&apos;s in heaven. I wonder if he knows his trouser buttons are undone. Later, in a cab, they weigh up their options. &quot;I&apos;d really like to get mashed,&quot; Lee says. &quot;It seems mad being in Amsterdam and not making a night of it . . . but we&apos;ve got telly tomorrow and it won&apos;t be a good look.&quot; In the old days, yes, but now they&apos;ve matured. So we retire to the hotel bar for a Glenfiddich or two. They chat away, obviously happy in each other&apos;s company. Towards the end of Blue mark one, they were getting tired and irritable, but now it&apos;s all fresh again. It really is like starting out again, Simon says \u2013 sharing rooms with other bands, constantly on the road, working around the world. Yes, he says, he enjoyed life as a solo artist, but there was something lonely about it. Was he surprised he did so well? &quot;You bet.&quot; He gives me the recipe for his success. &quot;When I grew up there was only one CD I had, which was Bill Withers. And he had a song called Grandma&apos;s Hands, and I thought I want to write a song like that so I wrote Lay Your Hands. He had Just The Two of Us so I did After All This Time. And he had Lean On Me, which goes &apos;Sometimes in our life we all have pain&apos; so I went &apos;So, is this how it goes?&apos;&quot; So basically he nicked all Bill\u00a0Withers&apos;s songs? &quot;You&apos;re damned fucking right I did.&quot; At nearly noon the following day, there is no sign of the boys. I\u00a0assume they are still in bed. Then I\u00a0feel a tap on the shoulder. It&apos;s Lee, and he fancies heading into Amsterdam for something to eat. Great, I say \u2013 what about the others? He&apos;ll try calling them. No response, he says. It&apos;s a beautiful day, and we&apos;re sitting in the midday sun sharing pizza and pasta and garlic bread, and Lee is talking about his son, Rayn Amethyst (Rayn is an amagram of Ryan, but he&apos;s trying to get it changed to Rain), and how he&apos;d like to produce films and write scripts. He&apos;s already written one that he hopes to make into a film about a boy with attention deficit disorder who is forcefed the drug Ritalin. Is\u00a0it\u00a0autobiographical? &quot;In some ways. They\u00a0tried to make me take it, yeah. That&apos;s why I came up with the idea of the film.&quot; And did he take it? &quot;No, and\u00a0then they kicked me out of\u00a0school.&quot; When we get back to the hotel the boys are outside waiting for us. &quot;Where&apos;ve you been?&quot; asks Duncan. &quot;Why\u00a0didn&apos;t you ask us?&quot; Lee did, I\u00a0say \u2013 he rang you. But the boys aren&apos;t happy. They start interrogating me. Antony: &quot;What did he eat?&quot; &quot;We had pizza, pasta . . .&quot; Duncan: &quot;We&apos;ve been measured for our Eurovision suits. He&apos;s in trouble.&quot; Lee gets back on the bus just in time to take the heat off me. Simon: &quot;You&apos;re in trouble, young man.&quot; Duncan: &quot;Yeah you&apos;re in trouble, bruv.&quot; Duncan gives me a withering look. &quot;You just forcefed him crap, didn&apos;t you? Feeder!&quot; Then he looks at Lee. &quot;You&apos;re out of order, man. You been eating pizza!&quot; Lee: &quot;Yeah, what&apos;s the matter with that? I had a little bit of pizza.&quot; Simon: &quot;Aha! We&apos;ve heard, and the garlic bread. He&apos;s already grassed you up.&quot; The boys are serious, but they&apos;re also laughing about it. We&apos;re at the studio of the popular cooking-and-chat show Life 4 You, where Blue will be singing. Sara irons trousers and advises on the routine while the boys warm up with a barbershop number. Their voices are very good. Duncan says they have become better singers since they split up \u2013 in his case, largely due to the West End musical training. They sing live, and the mix isn&apos;t good \u2013 Lee is too low, Duncan can&apos;t hear properly. It&apos;s not disastrous, just not the impression they&apos;d hoped to make. Duncan is deflated. &quot;Was I flat?&quot; he asks. &quot;He&apos;s going to be worrying all night\u00a0now. Checking his Twitter every minute,&quot; says Sara. &quot;Anyone taking responsibility for these pants?&quot; she adds, with a pair of briefs in each hand. Lee arrives a little later. He has been on set cooking with the stars. &quot;Did you see the cooking? I thought I&apos;d get more air time. They gave me a cookbook in Hollish. What&apos;s it called, Dutch, sorry. How useful will that be?&quot; &quot;Just sign that autograph will you, Lee,&quot; Duncan says. &quot;In Hollish.&quot; We talk about the hairy moments the band has had in the few months they&apos;ve been back together. The most public was Antony being caught on camera urinating against a cash machine. To be fair, that&apos;s not all he was doing. &quot;I was taking money out, texting my friend to see if she got home all right, and weeing,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&apos;t think you could do that,&quot; Sara says. &quot;I\u00a0thought it was\u00a0a given that one had to hold one&apos;s penis. I didn&apos;t think men could multitask, but no one said good on him.&quot; Antony looks shame-faced. &quot;I\u00a0never got a pat on the back. I&apos;ve learned the hard way and trust me it\u00a0will never happen\u00a0again.&quot; Look, Duncan says, Weegate is already in the past, and now the most important thing is to do the UK proud. &quot;This is just the beginning for Blue,&quot; he says. \u2022 Blue&apos;s single I Can is released on 1 May on Blue World Records", "sentences": ["The coach comes to a stop in Volendam, a village just outside Amsterdam.", "So we sat down and went, you know what, it&apos;s a no-brainer.&quot; In Amsterdam, the nude shoot is a popular topic of conversation.", "I know what I&apos;m good at.&quot; It&apos;s nearly midnight and we&apos;re heading off to a club in the centre of Amsterdam where the Eurovionistas are singing.", "&quot;It seems mad being in Amsterdam and not making a night of it .", "It&apos;s Lee, and he fancies heading into Amsterdam for something to eat."], "title": "Blue: the UK's best Eurovision hope for years", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/19/blue-eurovision-song-contest", "tags": ["Blue", "Eurovision", "Pop and rock", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-20T09:17:53Z", "article": "It&apos;s easy to see the latest people&apos;s jury Booker vote as a publicity stunt. Not least because (to a certain extent) it is. Yet I&apos;d be surprised if many people object to Beryl Bainbrbidge being the subject of this posthumous attention. It must have been agony to turn up for the award ceremonies in 1973, 1974, 1990, 1996 and 1998 and clap and smile for the cameras when different names were called. It may be too late for her to enjoy the honour but still it feels like some balance has been restored. Her daughter Jojo Davies says: &quot;Beryl did want to win the Booker very much despite her protests to the contrary. We are glad she is finally able to become the bride, no longer the bridesmaid.&quot; I&apos;m not about to argue with that. More contentious, though, is the question of whether Bainbridge ought to have won the prize when she was alive \u2013 and why she didn&apos;t. Many think she was robbed. No less an authority than Ion Trewin, the literary director of the Man Booker prizes, says: &quot;Beryl Bainbridge was the greatest novelist of her generation who didn&apos;t win the Man Booker prize, and quite underservedly so.&quot; Some are even more forthright. Paul Bailey, her friend and fellow author said when she died: &quot;She should have won it three or four times \u2013 because hers were better than the junk that did win.&quot; Considering that she lost out to books as good as JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur, AS Byatt&apos;s Possession and Stanley Middleton&apos;s neglected but wonderful Holiday, all that seems excessive. So too do most of the suggestions I&apos;ve read about why she might not have won. These are neatly summed up in an essay the Booker authorities have placed on their website, written by Alvaro Ribeiro. Like all the best conspiracy theories, these sound very convincing until you actually know anything at all about the subject. The most notable suggestion is that Beryl Bainbridge&apos;s origins in Liverpool disqualify her from being able to &quot;censure British ways&quot; in the eyes of right-on judges: &quot;In this perceived betrayal from within, we confront that striking characteristic of the Booker prize best described as &apos;the Empire strikes back&apos;. This phenomenon allows novelists from the Commonwealth and overseas the privilege to write, as Salman Rushdie (1981), Kazuo Ishiguro (1989), or Michael Ondaatje (1992) do, with impunity as they sharply critique British culture, playing on Britain&apos;s massive sense of postcolonial guilt. But for Bainbridge, a native of Liverpool, to do so quite so insistently makes her into an internal threat. Thus do Booker judges marginalise her, and down she goes at the last hurdle.&quot; I&apos;d go along with that if it weren&apos;t deeply insulting to suggest that \u2013 say \u2013 a book as good as Midnight&apos;s Children won the award out of some sense of &quot;guilt&quot; rather than its own merit \u2013 and if every single person who won in the years Bainbridge was shortlisted weren&apos;t Caucasian. Indeed, when she was first shortlisted in 1973, the winner was JG Farrell&apos;s The Siege of Krishnapur. That was a book written by an, erm, Liverpudlian and it provided just the kind of critique that poor Dame Beryl supposedly wasn&apos;t allowed to make. The more simple truth is that she was unlucky. Plenty of people consider The Dressmaker her best book, but as Hilary Mantel says in a fond tribute to Bainbridge, that still doesn&apos;t mean it deserved to beat The Siege of Krishnapur. Ribeiro&apos;s other big idea is that Bainbridge&apos;s books were too short. &quot;Booker Prize judges, faced with the gravity of their decision, naturally lean towards the gravitational pull of a big complicated book: Midnight&apos;s Children (1981); Possession (1990); Sacred Hunger (1992); The Blind Assassin (2000).&quot; Hopefully, if you&apos;re a stats nerd like me, you&apos;ll already have noticed that only one of those books ran against Bainbridge \u2013 Possession. Once again, it&apos;s an extraordinary book that took on Bainbridge&apos;s novel that year, An Awfully Big Adventure, and won. What&apos;s more, when Bainbridge was in the first stage of her career and writing the kind of short book that Ribeiro claims the judges don&apos;t like, she lost out to two short books: Holiday and The Conservationist. Again, those are both fine novels. So much for providing a coherent explanation for Bainbridge&apos;s misfortune. The more prosaic truth is that there are no real patterns that explain why books win the Booker (beyond the fact that the judges tend to come from the media establishment and don&apos;t like SF unless it&apos;s written by Margaret Atwood). Each year is a lottery. Beryl Bainbridge also had the bad luck to be up against some excellent competitors. Most of the time. Sadly, it was later on in her career, when the Booker bridesmaid jokes must have really begun to sting, that her books were beaten by two singularly unpopular winners: Graham Swift&apos;s Last Orders and Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam. &quot;There was only one time that I cared, I think about the fourth time, when I began to kid myself that I would win; everybody said so, all the bets and everything. And that was quite a bit of a shock,&quot; said Bainbridge during an interview for Desert Island Discs in 2008. Ouch! It might not necessarily right any wrongs, but it&apos;s nice to know that she couldn&apos;t lose this time around.", "sentences": ["Sadly, it was later on in her career, when the Booker bridesmaid jokes must have really begun to sting, that her books were beaten by two singularly unpopular winners: Graham Swift&apos;s Last Orders and Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam."], "title": "Beryl Bainbridge deserves her Booker, but she was never robbed", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/apr/20/beryl-bainbridge-booker-never-robbed", "tags": ["Beryl Bainbridge", "Books", "Booker prize", "Fiction", "Awards and prizes", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-20T14:09:09Z", "article": "Not long ago I had a conversation with a man in a regional theatre bar who told me about seeing Maggie Smith play an acidly funny, magisterially tragic Hedda Gabler when he was in his 20s. It had been on his first date with the woman who eventually became his wife, and who had recently died. He described the performance in such vivid detail he made it feel as if the show was yesterday, not more than 40 years ago. And he made me feel as if I had been there in the audience too. If somebody said to me: &quot;Maggie Smith&apos;s Hedda Gabler?&quot; I might find myself replying without thinking, &quot;Oh yes, I saw that,&quot; even though I didn&apos;t. Funnily enough, I seldom get the same sense of immediacy when reading about performances from the past, even when written by great critics such as Tynan. There is something about somebody telling you about a performance \u2013 or sometimes even about just a moment \u2013 in their own voice that brings it uniquely alive. Perhaps it&apos;s because, in the telling of it, they bring themselves to the story, make it theirs. You see the whole event through their eyes. Critical writing has changed a great deal in the last few years, but the fiction is still often maintained that the reviewer enters the theatre as a blank slate, ready to write about the performance with a cool, dispassionate eye. Quite how vivid the first-person recollection of performance can be is demonstrated exquisitely in We See Fireworks, Helen Cole&apos;s installation, part of the Spill festival at the Barbican this week. Cole has gathered a growing collection of 280 audio recordings in which people recall performances or performative moments. You enter a dark, womb-like space, lit only by light bulbs that glow and occasionally fizz, and find yourself listening to brief accounts of performances witnessed and now lost forever, but kept alive in the memory. The stories don&apos;t feel rehearsed. Real life and the theatre, fact and fiction, merge and bump up against each other just as they do in everyday life. A single moment of a performance in an Amsterdam church sits next to a man&apos;s account of a conversation with his 98-year-old grandmother in a bedroom on Christmas Eve, where she acted out a moment from her past. Someone else describes a childhood visit to the ballet to see Nureyev  dance \u2013 all the more compelling because it was layered with an insight into childhood, family and the sudden realisation of what time does to our bodies. When people talk of these performances, it is as if they are keeping something ephemeral alive in a way that the traditional review \u2013 or even digital technology \u2013 can&apos;t. Although both may be an infinitely more accurate record of a performance, I&apos;m often surprised on reading my own old reviews to discover how great the gap is between what I wrote about a show at the time and how I recollect it now. &quot;It starts with the premise that theatre is essentially viral, built on collective memory, shared moments and personal responses,&quot; Cole says. But it also reminds us that one of the most basic theatre experiences is sitting in the dark and listening to stories that matter a great deal to the people telling them \u2013 and to us too.", "sentences": ["A single moment of a performance in an Amsterdam church sits next to a man&apos;s account of a conversation with his 98-year-old grandmother in a bedroom on Christmas Eve, where she acted out a moment from her past."], "title": "What's past is prologue: share your theatre memories", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/apr/20/theatre-memory-past-performance-plays", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Installation", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-20T14:55:22Z", "article": "Motoring organisations expect the busiest Easter on the roads for several years, with Britain forecast to bask in glorious weather in one of the hottest Aprils on record. But the temptation to make a getaway could lead to snarlups, they warn. Temperatures are likely to reach 26C in London and parts of the south-east over the four-day break, more than 10C higher than the national average for this time of year. Homebase has reported a 20% rise in barbecue sales compared with Easter last year and said it would sell enough gas &quot;to fuel 300,000 barbecues\u2026 and enough garden chairs to fill Westminster Abbey 30 times over&quot;. Road The AA expects traffic to start building , with a total of 10m cars \u2013 a third of all vehicles in the UK \u2013 on the move during the long holiday weekend. It estimates that the recent spike in petrol and diesel prices will add an extra \u00a32 to to the cost of each 100 miles driven by holiday motorists. According to Trafficmaster, the hotspots will be the A21, M3, M4, M5, M11 and M27. Additionally, the cross-Channel routes \u2013 the M20, A20 and A2 to Eurotunnel, Folkestone and Dover \u2013 are expected to be exceptionally busy. Although most restrictions for roadworks will be lifted during the Easter period, some big works will still go ahead, bringing congestion on the M1 between junctions 10 and 14 and the M25 between junctions 18 and 21A, and junctions 27 and 30. The M1 still threatens to disrupt north-south journeys after a fire under a raised section of the motorway in north London forced the Highways Agency to implement lane closures and speed restrictions. Three lanes should be reopened by Thursday but a 50mph speed limit will still be in place for safety reasons. The government has urged motorists to consider alternative routes such as the M40 and A1. Edmund King, president of the AA, said the temptation to hit the road, lured by good weather and the long break, could be tempered by punishing fuel prices. &quot;The roads are still going to be busy but I think drivers will choose to go to the closest beach. So we predict that there will be slightly shorter trips, as many drivers try to economise.&quot; Rail Fewer delays on the railways, plus ever-present road congestion, could persuade some motorists to take the train. According to the Association of Train Operating Companies, there will be 6.5m rail journeys over Easter, up from 6.2m last year, although the network will be less busy than on an average working day. Network Rail has promised fewer replacement bus services than last year, as part of its drive to eliminate one of the holiday traveller&apos;s biggest bugbears. The number of trains running will be 18% up on last year. Acknowledging that Good Friday will probably be the busiest day on most routes, Network Rail says there will be one-third more services that day than in 2010. Nonetheless, improvement work will continue on some lines including the Great Eastern route between London Liverpool Street and Shenfield; the Thameslink service across central London; and, on Saturday and Sunday, sections of the west coast main line. Virgin Trains, the London-to-Glasgow operator, said it expected Thursday to be its busiest day of the year, with more than 100,000 passengers using the service, including some travellers keen to avoid the M1 bottleneck. &quot;We have seen an increase in bookings over the past few days, which may be down to people worried about travelling by car due to the M1 closure,&quot; said a Virgin Trains spokesman. Air  Despite the hot weather in the UK and an awful forecast for rainy Madrid, millions of air passengers are expected to take their chances at the airport. Departure and arrival lounges are expecting one of the busiest weekends of the year as about one in 10 holidaymakers buck the trend of holidaying at home. Heathrow estimates it will handle 1.1 million passengers over Easter, with its owner, BAA, expecting to process a total of 1.8 million passengers at its airports including Stansted, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Heathrow&apos;s top destination will be New York followed by Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. Malaga will be the top destination at Britain&apos;s second-largest airport, Gatwick, which will process nearly 500,000 people over Easter with nearly one in 10 passengers heading for the Spanish resort. Gatwick said that, including the royal wedding weekend, travel numbers would be up 4% on last year. A peak-time period for air travellers wouldn&apos;t be the same without some form of disruption and there could be a problem for duty-free shoppers this Easter. The government is refusing to meet the 29\u00a0April deadline for lifting the Europe-wide ban on carrying duty-free liquids bought on flights originating outside the EU on to connecting flights in the UK.

We pulled up after midnight after the long drive to south Devon. The directions from the farmhouse to the impossibly secluded Beach Hut were clear, but scrambling across cliff tops with bags and very unsensible footwear, we had only an inadequate torch and the alarming sound of crashing waves to make sure our romantic holiday didn&apos;t start with the wrong sort of splash. Once there we just climbed the little ladder to our bed in the eaves, so the next morning, we were unprepared for the picture-book adorableness of our surroundings. The Beach Hut is fairly basic, but no less lovely for that: there&apos;s no electricity, but a woodburner and gas hob \u2013 and a wood-burning hot tub outside (everything is eco, including the loo)!

So for a few years it was activities (rafting, canyoning) and cities (they loved Amsterdam). But teenagers grow up, go to university, and suddenly mooching around Europe is possible again. And cheap. Term time in Sicily and not only were hotel rooms almost half the summer price, half-board was sometimes thrown in. We stayed at friendly Pensione Tranchina in Scopello, an hour from Palermo, and ticked off all the things our offspring would have moaned about. No pool, tiny rocky beach, no shops, nothing to do after dinner except sit chatting with the owner over a digestivo. Worst of all, the rugged Zingaro natural park stretches for 7km up the coast, with footpaths for long bracing walks. There were even \u2013 horror! \u2013 wild flowers. Some things the youngsters would have liked: the fantastic food, and especially our cute black hired Fiat Cinquecento. But that&apos;s the sort of iconic vehicle only the child-free can bomb around Italy in. No room in the back for long teenage legs.

Away from the big resorts, the easternmost of the Canaries is a heady mix of wild volcanic landscapes, surfer-friendly beaches, theatrical modernist architecture and vineyards made up of volcanic stone circles that could have been designed by Andy Goldsworthy. You can reach them all easily enough from the coastal resorts with a hire car, but a much better idea is to base yourself at Caser\u00edo de Mozaga, an 18th-century country house in the centre of the island that&apos;s been turned into a very stylish boutique B&amp;B with restaurant.

It had all the ingredients for a romantic break \u2013 the bare minimum, but done in style. We had three gorgeous bedrooms at our disposal, an airy open plan living space of white sofas, and an infinity pool surrounded by funky day beds. There was almost nothing to do, but that was fine by us \u2013 all we wanted was to loll around in the sunshine and spend time together. Then it poured with rain all week. Instead of languorous afternoons in the pool our memories are of drinking Mythos beer behind a rain-splashed plastic awning, paddling in the drizzle at beautiful Daf Noudi beach, and getting caught in a dramatic storm while half-way across to the neighbouring island of Ithaca in our rented motorboat. There, we were revived at the magical Polyphemus restaurant by an inebriated communist chef who fed us Che Guevara rum and sun-dried octopus for hours, then insisted he drive us back to the harbour. We even made up a silly song about Polyphemus which make us feel like teenagers recalling their first kiss when we sing it now.\u2022 Villa Trizoni has weeks available in May, July and August, from \u00a31,239 a week, with holidaylettings.co.uk.

But nothing prepared us for the staggering Alpine beauty of the region \u2013 flower-filled meadows, crystal-clear rivers and lakes \u2013 nor the views from Nebesa&apos;s chalets; snow-capped mountains to the east, endless valleys to the west, trailing down to the Adriatic. Four glass-fronted chalets are the base from which to soak up these views. From our terrace, we watched a storm come in, then get chased away by glorious sunshine. We hiked up the mountain one day and white-water rafted down the turquoise Soca the next. In the evening we took at taxi to Hisa Franko, Slovenia&apos;s answer to The Fat Duck, for a sublime gourmet feast. The X factor at Nebesa isn&apos;t the luxuriousness of the hotel \u2013 it&apos;s actually fairly simple.

But at some point since the 1980s, it had morphed into a quietly hip surfing mecca. My then-boyfriend suddenly looked interested. We camped under the pines in the main surfie site at Anglet and walked down to the beach every morning. Compensating for the lack of kitsch, the boyfriend even serenaded me with Elvis Presley on the sand. Surf by day, cosmopolitan comforts by night: we ate outside at pretty old clifftop restaurants, drank wine from G\u00e9rard D\u00e9pardieu&apos;s nearby vineyards, and wandered along the pier that juts from the spectacular coastline out through the breakers.

When we woke, it was a short hop over the border to San Sebasti\u00e1n \u2013 or Donostia, as it is known by its Basque inhabitants. We chose from one of scores of affordable pensions in the beguiling parte vieja (old town). We spent lazy days on the city&apos;s beautiful beaches, and late nights bar-hopping. The city specialises in pintxos, simple Basque tapas: we wandered from tavern to tavern, greedily sampling as many as we could. For a once-in-lifetime meal, try to get a table at legendary restaurant Arzak (arzak.info), ranked eighth in the world. We relaxed at La Perla (la-perla.net), a beachside spa; visited Eduardo Chillida&apos;s wave-lashed sculptures in La Concha Bay; and climbed Mount Urgull for the castle, enormous Jesus Christ statue and panoramic views.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said that the the high pressure system expected to prevail during the weekend made high pollution levels likely, partly owing to the warm still air.  The alert came as the first of an estimated 2 million holidaymakers left the UK for supposed hotspots, many of which are currently cooler than southern England&apos;s daily highs of 24C (71F). Pullovers were evident on flights to Barcelona and Corfu, where the temperature was 16C (61F) and 17C (63F), while relatives seeing travellers off were in T-shirts. Another 5 million people are expected to take breaks in the UK with at least one overnight stay during the bonus extended break offered by the succession of Easter, the royal wedding and May Day weekend. Roads and railways are already feeling the strain, despite reassuring bulletins from the Met Office that warm, dry and calm conditions will continue into next week, lending no urgency to getaway plans.

Monitors on the traffic-choked Marylebone Road were showing readings breaching European Union limits on ozone and pollutant particles linked to respiratory and other health problems. Air pollution or no, the mayor, Boris Johnson, was doing his best to persuade capital-dwellers to stay put during the holiday break by opening a temporary &apos;beach&apos; on the Thames south bank, near the London Eye. Funfairs, candy floss and 70 metres (230ft) of sand are on offer, although paddling in the river is not part of the deal.

The men, who are among six protesters to have not eaten for 16 days, say they were beaten, tortured and in one case raped after taking part in anti-regime protests that swept Iran in 2009. They claim that although their lives would be in danger in Iran they have been &quot;ignored and dismissed&quot; by UK authorities since they sought refuge in the country last year. &quot;We have sewn our mouths because there is no other way,&quot; said Keyvan Bahari, 32, who has scars across his back and arms from what he said was 12 days of being slashed with razor blades by the Iranian authorities when he was a student. &quot;Nobody in the UK hears us or cares what we say so we have no other option but to do this.&quot; Bahari, a former champion wrestler who ran his own training centre in Tehran, said the media and government in the UK and US had encouraged him and tens of thousands of other young people to stand up against the regime but had now &quot;washed their hands&quot; of the protesters. &quot;When I was back in Tehran, I was seeing Obama and British officials on our illegal satellite TVs, encouraging us day in day out to continue our protest,&quot; said Bahari, who is one of three men camping on the pavement outside Lunar House immigration centre in Croydon. Speaking with difficulty through his sewn-up lips, which are already sore and infected, he said: &quot;They said that they will support us but now that I&apos;m stuck in here and need help, they are nowhere.&quot; The men say they are taking liquids, but doctors say that even so, they could deteriorate quickly, especially if they have pre-existing medical conditions. Mahyar Meyari, 17, lying in the small tent next to Bahari, recalls how he was raped after being arrested following a demonstration on al-Quds day in 2009. &quot;I was blindfolded and taken to an unknown place where I was kept for a week. I was kicked on the head by batons many times \u2026 and even raped,&quot; he said before breaking down. Mahyar paid a smuggler to get him out of the country but says he did not know where he was being taken before he arrived in the UK 16 days later. &quot;I can&apos;t explain how I feel here, I can&apos;t believe what&apos;s happening to me,&quot; said Mahyar, who does not speak English. &quot;When I claimed asylum with the Home Office, they first didn&apos;t believe that I&apos;m 17 years old, they said I was lying. There&apos;s a culture of disbelief in the Home Office, everybody thinks you are lying by default.&quot; The men&apos;s asylum claims were all turned down, although some are still involved in appeals. They say they feel let down by the legal system and the lawyers appointed by the Home Office to represent them. &quot;I&apos;m very discontent about my legal representation,&quot; said Bahari. &quot;I saw my lawyer more as a Home Office officer than a lawyer there to protect my rights. He was more looking after the rights of the Home Office.&quot; A government spokesman said the UK Border Agency &quot;takes every asylum application it receives seriously&quot; adding the men were given &quot;every opportunity to make their representations to us as well as a right to appeal the decision to the courts&quot;. He added: &quot;They all had access to free legal advice as well as a designated UK Border Agency caseowner who considered their case on its individual merits.&quot; However, the men say they have had very little contact with the Home Office since they began their protest and campaigners \u2013 and fellow Iranian activists \u2013 say asylum seekers are fighting a culture of disbelief across the government. &quot;The people who are supposed to interview asylum seekers in the Home Office, they do not interview these people, they interrogate them,&quot; said Akbar Karimian, an Iranian activist who has been helping the group. &quot;They search for an error or a mistake in their testimonies so that they can find a contradictory evidence to reject their claim. You imagine that the officers in a refugee organisation of this government are there to help these vulnerable people, but they are there to find a way to send them back.&quot; Campaigners say the UK hunger strike is a sign of the increasing desperation among Iranian asylum seekers. One man died after setting himself alight in Amsterdam this month and 25 Iranians sewed their lips together in Greece in an attempt to secure refugee status. The Medical Foundation, which is preparing a report on Meyari&apos;s condition for his next appeal, says 293 Iranians were referred to the organisation for help in 2010. Lying in the tent, Mahyar said the UK hunger strikers, like many fellow Iranians, were prepared for drastic action. &quot;I prefer to die here than going back to Iran.

Since 2002 it has also been the home of an integrated professional and amateur network of 2,700 clubs that this week Uefa stated should be the model that English football adopts if it is ever to replicate the kind of success enjoyed by Dutch players and\u00a0teams. Whereas Cruyff and his compatriots have helped Holland to three World Cup finals and victory at Euro 88, England have contested only one World Cup and two European Championship semi-finals since Bobby Moore lifted the Jules Rimet trophy 45 years ago. This week William Gaillard, the adviser to Uefa&apos;s president, Michel Platini, identified English football&apos;s factional nature and lack of significant funding as the fault lines that blight the sport here. Gaillard told a parliamentary select committee that the Football Association should look to the Netherlands if England is ever going to address the malaise in player development. He said: &quot;There is no doubt that turf wars have damaged English football, and the FA is probably in a weaker spot than any other in Europe. Holland is an excellent grassroots model.&quot; A tour around amateur clubs in the Amsterdam area showed the stark difference in facilities between the Netherlands and England. Clubs such as ASV Arsenal, Sporting Martinus, SC Buitenveldert, Swift, AFC, SV Bijlmer and Legmeervogels boast facilities that always include floodlit grass and artificial turf pitches, dedicated medical centres, warm changing rooms, hot showers, spacious clubhouses and adequate car parking and bicycle ports \u2013 all of which placed the clubs at the centre of their local communities. Their structure is also more professional than amateur. Dennis van Soest, who runs the commercial affairs of Legmeervogels, says: &quot;Legmeer has 1,250 members. The owners are the members. Control and management is executed by the board of directors, which consists of 10 persons, of which five are part of the daily board. We have a chairman who is responsible for the youth department. &quot;Daily maintenance is done by our facilities&apos; managers. We have around 200 active volunteers and 120 companies that sponsor our association. Membership costs on average \u20ac180 [\u00a3160] per year.&quot; Broadly, the Dutch model that allows all this has been in place for nine years. Louis van Gaal, then the national coach, integrated the sport across six regions on behalf of the Dutch FA, the KNVB. This pyramid consists of the 2,700 clubs \u2013 of which 36 are professional \u2013 that are governed by a single body, the KNVB, with the amateur game benefiting from \u20ac1bn a year of investment. The KNVB has around 1.2 million members (7% of the Dutch population), with local authorities contributing 90% of the \u20ac1bn investment and the government the remainder. English football&apos;s ongoing dispute between the FA, the Premier League and the Football League has resulted in inferior funding for the amateur game, in comparison to the Netherlands. In 2000 the Football Foundation stated that the FA would contribute \u00a320m per annum to grassroots football in England. Yet by last year the FA&apos;s contribution was only \u00a312m. The Premier League contributes \u00a343.4m, less than 5% of its latest \u00a33.1bn TV rights deal. In the Netherlands the key ethos is that all age-group teams should play 4-3-3 and that coaching sessions should be fun, with individuality allowed whether players are future stars of Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and FC Twente or destined to remain in the grassroots game. Competitive youth football is also played between professional and amateur clubs, which means standards between the sport&apos;s two strands are closer. In England winning, not enjoyment, has traditionally been the end game. And it would be unheard of for a youth side from Manchester United, Chelsea or Liverpool to play against, say, an equivalent team from the Civil Service or Enfield Old Grammarians. Bryan Roy, the former Nottingham Forest and Holland forward, is a coach at the Jong Ajax academy, which is a renowned conveyer belt of fresh talent. He confirms the closer dynamic between the amateur and professional game. &quot;Until the age of 14 our teams from professional clubs still play against teams from amateur\u00a0clubs,&quot; he says. &quot;Holland&apos;s overall football philosophy is to always focus on ball possession to create opportunities. This is also true at amateur clubs. In the youth they always think in an attacking\u00a0way.&quot; In 2008 one enlightened English father, Steve Lawrence, decided to harness the Dutch vision by moving his family to Amsterdam so that his then 16-year-old son, Jamie, could improve his development there, after he had formerly been with Arsenal and Queens Park Rangers. Jamie began at HFC Haarlem, then a professional club, and is now at Ajax. His father was the architect of the original feasibility study and master plan for the London 2012 Olympic Games. He submitted written evidence to the same parliamentary select committee that Gaillard addressed. &quot;I&apos;ve visited about 60 or 70 amateur football clubs [in the Netherlands]. On average they have around \u20ac3-4m of facilities [in] land and buildings. That&apos;s about \u20ac10bn in total. Effectively, they&apos;re all better than the standard academies in England so Holland has 2,700 academies. It&apos;s no surprise that Holland is No2 in the Fifa world rankings.&quot; While the two nations have an almost identical population density, they are on very different points on the development scale. Roy states that Holland is intent on becoming more successful on the field. &quot;We tend to focus more on tactics instead of technical improvements \u2013 that&apos;s the next step,&quot; he says. English football&apos;s dream is to have only this concern.", "sentences": ["Holland is an excellent grassroots model.&quot; A tour around amateur clubs in the Amsterdam area showed the stark difference in facilities between the Netherlands and England.", "In the youth they always think in an attacking\u00a0way.&quot; In 2008 one enlightened English father, Steve Lawrence, decided to harness the Dutch vision by moving his family to Amsterdam so that his then 16-year-old son, Jamie, could improve his development there, after he had formerly been with Arsenal and Queens Park Rangers."], "title": "How Dutch seeds can help England's grassroots youth football to grow | Jamie Jackson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/28/fa-england-holland-grassroots-football", "tags": ["The FA", "Football politics", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-28T20:18:17Z", "article": "&quot;I&apos;ve been at Ajax now for two seasons. I had been with Arsenal in their under-9s until under\u201111s, then I moved to QPR where I was in the under-14 age group. But I left because the standard of coaching at QPR was terrible, I was hardly tired after sessions and it was not enjoyable at all, though I have heard since that they changed all this. I came over to Holland three years ago and joined HFC Haarlem [then a professional club], which is just outside Amsterdam. My dad, Steve, did some research and then emailed a few clubs and Haarlem were the club that wrote back. I went over in the summer that I turned 16 and halfway through the following season Haarlem said Ajax were interested. There was a coach from Ajax who was helping out at Haarlem so at the end of my first year there he took me over for a trial, and then I joined. The way they train their coaches at Ajax is different. I&apos;d grown up in England and seen Arsenal and Dennis Bergkamp. When I went to Ajax he was just starting coaching and they put him in charge of my team for my first game. I was sat in the changing room and the coach walked in and said: &apos;Guys, here&apos;s your trainer for the day.&apos; I looked up as he walked in and I could not believe it. But for all the rest of the team it was just normal, they knew him. The main difference between how I am coached in Holland and how I was coached in England is that here they focus on possession and they want the centre-backs to play out from the back and control the game. Also, they look to develop all the technical sides of your game \u2013 the emphasis is on what you are good at but they also work on technique, and your passing. In England this is less so, I suppose because it&apos;s more of a physical game. This season I&apos;ve now fully recovered from injury and played my first 90 minutes two weeks ago which went well. I was recently with Tottenham as part of a young team that competed at a tournament. That was a great experience. As I had just come back from injury it was about me getting a few games under my belt and for them to see how I work and for me to see how they work.I was up at Spurs Lodge [the training ground] and they were actually talking to me about how they have adopted the 4-3-3 style that the Dutch teams play and they are now trying to implement the Dutch style into the club.&quot;", "sentences": ["I came over to Holland three years ago and joined HFC Haarlem [then a professional club], which is just outside Amsterdam."], "title": "Jamie Lawrence: 'The way they train coaches at Ajax is different'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/28/jamie-lawrence-ajax-coaching", "tags": ["Ajax", "Football", "European club football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-04-28T21:15:01Z", "article": "The Amsterdam Sinfonietta is Holland&apos;s only professional string orchestra, and\u00a0seems to make a speciality of performing works from the chamber-music repertory in expanded versions.

In the distance to the right, the spires of the Empire State and the Chrysler buildings reflect the sunlight as if dipped in molten gold. But the pier itself is not such a happy sight. A wasteland of concrete, rusty steel frames, rotting blocks of wood and mounds of gravel, it is testament to the decline of this stretch of Brooklyn, as well as to the neglect that for many years has defined New York&apos;s relationship with its waterfront. There are few cities in the world that can compete with New York for the extent and diversity of its water. It has 520 miles of shoreline \u2013 more than Chicago, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle combined. The city is embraced by two powerful tidal rivers, the Hudson and the East river, and two major bays, Long Island Sound and the Atlantic, affording New Yorkers the pleasures of 16 miles of beaches. Yet, until recently, you would hardly have noticed it. New York City looked inward to its famous buildings and Central Park, away from the gift of its waterways. As the mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has said: &quot;At some point in our history, we literally and figuratively turned our back on the waterfront.&quot; Now Bloomberg and his team have declared that they are determined the waste will be brought to an end, that New York will be reconnected with its water. Bloomberg has announced a $360m (\u00a3215m) three-year action plan that aims to bring the shoreline back into the heart of the community. &quot;The water is the connective tissue of this place \u2013 we see it as our sixth borough,&quot; said Amanda Burden, the city&apos;s chief planner. &quot;The ambition is to make New York City once again one of the world&apos;s great harbour cities and to reclaim the water as a part of New Yorkers&apos; everyday lives.&quot; That is not an insignificant goal. Julia Vitullo-Martin, an expert on cities at the Regional Plan Association, said that making the most of rivers, lakes and seas had become an economic imperative. &quot;When you think of any successful modern city \u2013 London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Sydney \u2013 they are all making great use of their waterfronts.&quot; Under the new plan, 130 projects have been funded including 14 new greenways and esplanades and 20 hectares (50 acres) of new waterfront parks. New Yorkers will be encouraged not just to go to the water, but to go on to it. Within three years, there will be 60 launching pads around the city for those who want to go canoeing or sailing. From this summer, a high-speed ferry service will run every 20 minutes between Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, which Burden says will help blur the boundaries of the five boroughs and integrate the city. Economic incentives will be used to revitalise the port, which remains the largest on the US east coast, providing $6.8bn in business revenues. The paradox is that New York became the powerhouse that it is today largely because of the water, both in terms of its population, which swelled with the arrival of European immigrants landing at Ellis Island, and economically, with the triangle trade in cotton and slaves between Africa and the American Deep South. &quot;It&apos;s incredible given its origins that the waterfront has become such a dead loss to New York,&quot; said Lisa Keller, a historian at the State University of New York and executive editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City. The trouble began, Keller explained, in the 1840s when railway lines were laid along the shoreline, cutting off New Yorkers from their rivers. That was accentuated in the early 20th century when the main roads through Manhattan, the East River Drive (opened 1929) and the West Side Highway (1931), were carved in concrete swaths all the way along the respective perimeters of the island. &quot;You have just two arteries in Manhattan \u2013 only two \u2013 and they put them both on the water. That was crazy!&quot; said Keller. When low-cost housing was built after the second world war, that too was put on the water. Industrial decline in turn took its toll, leaving large stretches in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn derelict and dangerous to the public. Since he entered City Hall nine years ago, Bloomberg has tried to tackle this sad anomaly. The city has bought up 151 hectares of shoreline and turned it into parks and recreation areas, and there are already 20 miles of accessible waterfront paths, such as the greenway along Manhattan&apos;s West Side, which has become a favourite haunt of joggers and cyclists. Burden said that the aim of the three-year plan was to build on what had already been done and knit it together so that New York really began to feel like a water city once more. There are still daunting hurdles ahead. The major highways and housing projects that created the problem in the first place cannot be removed without massive expense, which New York cannot afford, and much of the waterfront remains in the hands of private owners who may resist public access. But the change is palpable, and spreading steadily across the city. In June, on the Manhattan side of the East river, a new Waterfront Park will open within walking distance of Wall Street. And within a year or so pier six on the other side of the river will no longer be the concrete wasteland it is today. Work has begun that will transform it into a park where Brooklynites will be able to watch open-air films on balmy summer nights or stroll up to Brooklyn Bridge, where the waterfront has already been converted into glorious green public space. That stunning view of the Manhattan skyline will then be there for everyone to celebrate, not behind the ugly wire fence that encloses the pier but from the water&apos;s edge with the powerful East river lapping at your feet.", "sentences": ["&quot;When you think of any successful modern city \u2013 London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Sydney \u2013 they are all making great use of their waterfronts.&quot; Under the new plan, 130 projects have been funded including 14 new greenways and esplanades and 20 hectares (50 acres) of new waterfront parks."], "title": "New York aims to become a great harbour city once again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/01/new-york-harbour-city-again", "tags": ["New York", "Water transport", "US news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-02T19:59:24Z", "article": "After three years&apos; closure and \u00a315m spent, one of the best-loved regional museums, the Holburne in Bath, is set to reopen with a shocking array of fakes and forgeries. The museum reopens on 14 May, with a spectacular Eric Parry designed ceramic and glass extension into the beautiful gardens behind the original building, once a hotel for wealthy tourists when Bath was one of most fashionable spa resorts in Europe. Visitors will see hundreds of objects never displayed before \u2013 but many are not what Sir William Holburne hoped when he stuffed his home with treasures, with more than 100 pieces of china, 15 tables, 21 chairs, a grand piano and scores of paintings displayed in his drawing room alone. When he died in 1874, his sister, Mary, bequeathed his entire collection of paintings, armour, ceramics, bronzes, snuff boxes, books and furnitureto the people of Bath, including a Leonardo da Vinci that wasn&apos;t, a vase that wasn&apos;t Roman, and a porcelain monkey that wasn&apos;t made for a German emperor, all of which had cost Holburne very dear. The museum&apos;s most famous fake, however, has been partly rehabilitated. His Leonardo was one of Holburne&apos;s most prized possessions, and when he lent it to an exhibition in Leeds in 1868 he labelled it: &quot;This exquisite female head by Leonardo da Vinci&quot;. It was exposed as definitively not da Vinci almost a century ago by a former curator, and since it was once owned by Sir William&apos;s neighbour, an artist called Thomas Barker \u2013 renowned for his imitation Old Masters \u2013 the museum feared the worst. Cleaning for the redisplay revealed a surprise: not a Leonardo, but not a Barker either, a beautiful fragment of a genuine early 16th century work. &quot;We&apos;ve lost a dodgy Leonardo and gained a gorgeous genuine nymph, we&apos;re very well pleased with the bargain,&quot; director Xa Sturgis said. Many of Holburne&apos;s acquisitions were genuine treasures, including a bronze St George and the Dragon once owned by Charles I, and an extraordinary 16th century folding combined fork, spoon and pen.

The spoon marked a death warrant for many in England: despite panic stricken quarantine measures detailed in Samuel Pepys&apos;s diary, the epidemic spread to London in 1665 where it was known as The Great Plague, and killed an estimated one in five of the population. \u2022 The Holburne museum reopens on May 14, free apart from a \u00a36.50 admission charge for a temporary exhibition of work by and memorabilia owned by Sir Peter Blake.", "sentences": ["&quot;This is our attempt to make spoons look interesting,&quot; Sturgis sighed over one of the many new spoon displays and research for the opening has revealed that one in gold, ornamented with skeletons, commemorated a seven-year-old Dutch girl, Elisabeth Boser, who died in a plague epidemic in 1664 in Amsterdam which also killed Rembrandt&apos;s mistress Hendrickje Stoffels."], "title": "Fakes and forgeries mingle as Holburne museum ushers in new era", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/may/02/fakes-forgeries-holburne-museum-new-era", "tags": ["Museums", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-03T09:26:25Z", "article": "Just recently home after five days displaying our stock at the New York Antiquarian Book Fair, and I&apos;m resting. You need to: it&apos;s a peculiarly exhausting business, exacerbated by the fact that I had flown in from Sydney via London, and kept waking at 2am longing for bacon and eggs. For the first three mornings I eventually got up at 6am and went out to dinner. Worked for me. Great steaks in New York. We do three fairs a year \u2013 California, New York, and London \u2013 and none of them are much fun. In the olden days (I feel an old fart moment coming on) fairs had a real buzz about them. During set-up (when dealers unpack their trunks and shelve the books) other dealers would crowd round, checking out each book as it emerged, picking up the occasional bargain. Set-up was why you were there, to see if you could buy something before the public got a look-in, and sell enough in that hectic first few hours to cover your costs. No more. Things are tighter and tougher, we&apos;ve seen each other&apos;s books in catalogues and online, and there is no excitement during the two-day (too long!) set-up period. We sold one book for $5,000 (\u00a33,000), which is better than five for $4,000, and pretty much in line with what I would have expected. The key to surviving a fair emotionally is to keep expectations realistic, which means low. I set our bottom line hope at sales of $40,000, though whether such a sum is profitable depends on what you have sold. Sometimes we have books on consignment at 20% to us, at others we may be selling something we own \u2013 better yet, have owned for ages \u2013 and get an entirely positive cashflow boost. I need one. I have, alas, taken my eye off the ball this last year, with reading for the Man Booker International prize, and the effect on the business has been predictable. Even my bank manager is starting to twitch an eyelid. So it was essential both to get some money in from New York, and to generate a project or two with clients or other dealers: find a collection to buy, an archive to sell, a line to pursue. But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself, and it may be hard for you to envisage what I&apos;m talking about. People in specialist trades often do this, and lose their audience in a welter of trade jargon and inappropriate assumption that one will be understood. So: What is an antiquarian book fair, anyway? It is an arena for members of the rare book trade publicly to offer their stock, and for collectors to peruse it. That sounds a little dull, doesn&apos;t it? OK, then. Dealers sit in their little, lit booths, displaying their wares like girls in Amsterdam windows. A few potential customers drift by. Sometimes money is exchanged. Some pleasure is had. Usually nobody gets hurt, but many wives are not told of the transaction. Or husbands. What sort of things might one see at the fair? Enticing ones, naturally. Hand-coloured antique maps, letters by Freud or Dickens, leatherbound sets of Jane Austen, rare books on travel, nature or military history, books illustrated by Arthur Rackham or Beatrix Potter, first editions by most of the greatest writers. Why are first editions valuable? They&apos;re not. Most first editions are worthless, because most books are first editions \u2013 that is, not worth reprinting. A tiny number of these first editions are desirable because they are by collected authors, and were printed in small numbers. How can you tell if a book is a first edition? Generally, it can be assumed unless there is any evidence to the contrary. Why are some authors collected? Most, because they deserve to be: John Milton, Jonathan Swift, John Keats, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, James Joyce, Graham Greene. Some, because whatever their deserts, people love them: Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming, JK Rowling. Does the condition of the book matter very much? Hugely, as with all collectibles. If a book looks fresh and near-as-damn-it new, it will fetch many times more than a tired and worn copy. With 20th-century books, the presence of the original dust wrapper is crucial. A first edition of Brighton Rock (1938) without the dust wrapper is worth, say, \u00a32,000. With it? I just paid \u00a380,000 for one, on behalf of a customer. Isn&apos;t that silly? Very. But the argument is that a book without its dust wrapper is as incomplete as a Chippendale chair without its legs. Do you think that&apos;s a fair argument? No. How does one know if the asking price is right? There is no &quot;right&quot; price for a rare book, though there are certainly wrong ones. If you buy from a reputable member of the trade, and you are happy with your purchase, then the price is probably right enough. But isn&apos;t a book worth whatever it fetches? Certainly not. If I convince a muddle-headed plutocrat to pay me \u00a31m for a common book, it doesn&apos;t mean it is worth it. It means I am a crook, and he is an idiot. Books can be under- or over-priced. That&apos;s part of the fun: trying to locate the former and avoid the latter. When I find what I want, should I ask for a discount? Yes. Will I get one? These days, for sure. What advice could you give to a new collector? Only buy what you like. Always buy the best copy you can afford. Buy fewer books, at a higher level. Buy from someone you have reason to trust. Spend 30% more than you can afford. What about buying and selling at auction? Auctioneers claim that (1) you get the best bargains if you buy at auction, and (2) you can get the best prices if you sell at auction. Both can&apos;t be true, though it is amazing how many people believe it. But about 90% of the books at auction are sold to members of the book trade. It&apos;s best to know what you are doing. Can&apos;t you get a better deal on ebay, and cut out the middleman? Every now and again you might. You are more likely to end up roasted with an apple in your mouth. How do you explain the allure of rare books? You either feel it or you don&apos;t. It&apos;s a matter of taste, and inclination, and, like love, doesn&apos;t need to be justified. I think holding a copy of the first edition of Ulysses, or Great Expectations, is thrilling, especially with a presentation inscription by the author. If you don&apos;t feel similarly, you haven&apos;t got the makings of a book collector. In fact, I don&apos;t even think I would like you. Final note: we ended up with takings of $60,000, which was not bad, and buying three or four things at reasonable prices, that will make one or two of our collectors very happy. I am now eating breakfast in the morning, and dinner in the evening. Maybe I will sleep through the night one day soon.", "sentences": ["Dealers sit in their little, lit booths, displaying their wares like girls in Amsterdam windows."], "title": "An insider's guide to book fairs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/may/03/insider-guide-book-fairs", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Booksellers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-04T15:34:00Z", "article": "In short Dutch choreographer Hans van Manen has been called the Mondrian of ballet, the Versace of ballet, the Pinter of ballet and the Antonioni of ballet \u2013 but really, he is just the Hans van Manen of ballet, with a distinctive personal style that mixes formal austerity and glassy elegance with erotic charge. Backstory Hans van Manen was born in 1932 in Nieuwer Amstel in the Netherlands. After his father&apos;s death from tuberculosis in 1939, the family moved to central Amsterdam, close to the city theatre. As a boy, Van Manen was smitten with dance: he would give solitary performances to radio broadcasts when no one was home, and peek into the windows of the theatre studios. At 13, he began to work for a theatre makeup artist, and at 18 he joined Sonia Gaskell&apos;s company Ballet Recital. A year later he moved to the Netherlands Opera Ballet, where he stayed for seven years; there he was promoted to soloist, and created his first choreographic works. Escaping the &quot;ballet war&quot; in the Netherlands (several rival companies had emerged in the late 1950s), Van Manen left to join Roland Petit&apos;s company in Paris. But in 1960 he returned to join a breakaway group of dancers from Gaskell&apos;s troupe who formed a groundbreaking new company in The Hague: Nederlands Dans Theater. Van Manen was resident choreographer and joint artistic director from 1961 to 1971. Internal disputes led Van Manen to quit NDT in 1971, working as a freelancer for a couple of years before joining Dutch National Ballet as choreographer in 1973. He stayed there for 15 years until internal disputes again drove him away \u2013 and back to Nederlands Dans Theater, in 1988. Another 15 years passed before more disputes led to his leaving again \u2013 and returning to Dutch National Ballet in 2003, where he has remained to date. Alongside NDT and Dutch National Ballet, Van Manen has created works for Dutch company Introdans. Outside Holland, his works have been staged by companies across the world, including Stuttgart Ballet, the Royal Ballet , National Ballet of Canada, San Francisco Ballet and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Outside dance, Van Manen is well known as a photographer. His work \u2013 glossy, often homoerotic (Robert Mapplethorpe was an important influence) \u2013 has been exhibited internationally. Watching Hans van Manen The technical foundation of Van Manen&apos;s style is classical ballet, but he hybridises it with elements from American modern dance (Martha Graham was an early influence) and with other idioms \u2013 gymnastics, martial arts, everyday gesture. George Balanchine was another early influence; like him, Van Manen favours plotless works. But Van Manen is less interested in &quot;pure movement&quot; than Balanchine, and elements of drama and characterisation are often quite explicit in his pieces \u2013 especially in duets (which he clearly enjoys choreographing). His Four Schumann Pieces (1976) was once described as &quot;a dramatic ballet without a story&quot; \u2013 a formulation that could serve for his work in general. On the one hand, Van Manen choreographs formally, concerned with clarity of shape, motif and development; but on the other, he choreographs dramatically, and is specifically interested in the field of gender and sexuality (the visceral matters of roleplay, conflict, dressing/undressing, fetishism and arousal rather than in the transcendent ideals of heterosexual romance). While the look of his ballets is sparse and austere, the feel is charged with drama and eroticism. Van Manen is always interested in the &quot;look&quot; of his works. He choreographs how and where the dancers look as much as how they move. He&apos;s also interested (as befits a photographer) in how the audience looks, and one of his most famous pieces, Live (1979), explicitly addressed audience voyeurism. (With its live camera relay of the stage action, it&apos;s also pioneering in its use of film technology within choreography.) Van Manen often choreographs to piano music, partly because it combines intimacy with clarity, and partly because it&apos;s cheap \u2013 a combination of artistic conviction and practicality that also marks his choreography. For an in-depth look at Van Manen&apos;s choreography, Michael Kroes&apos;s lengthy article in Ballettanz 2007 is well worth a read. Who&apos;s who Keso Dekker has been a regular set and costume designer for Van Manen, Joop Caboort a frequent lighting designer. Fact When Nederlands Dans Theater presented Glen Tetley and Van Manen&apos;s &quot;nude ballet&quot; Mutations at London&apos;s Sadler&apos;s Wells Theatre in 1970, someone sprinkled itching powder and ground glass on the stage, which added &quot;a fresh set of contortions to the choreography&quot; and left the Dutch with a &quot;rather grim view of the English attitude to art&quot;. &quot;For the rest of the run,&quot; remembers a technician, &quot;we had to have plain clothes coppers at the back of the stage and one in the auditorium.&quot; In his own words &quot;I&apos;m very bad at telling stories, and that&apos;s the reason why I never make full-length ballets.

To get a taste of his adventurous offerings on the staid Upper West Side, check out Fatty Crab, his large Malaysian-inspired spot on Broadway and 77th. Expect all kinds of spices, sauces, noodles, curries, stews, and seafood, and while the menu rotates with regularity, classics like their fatty duck (duck is brined and fried) and Dungeness chilli crab are mainstays.

So it was a relief to both the locals and the occasional uptown visitors when this minuscule taqueria opened in the area in 2009. The Mexican spot \u2013 serving high quality but affordable tacos and street food counter-style \u2013 was so overwhelmed by the early response that within the first year they had to relocate to a larger space up the block. Now they&apos;re expanding across town to the Upper West Side. Don&apos;t miss the tacos, made from special nixtamal corn, the house-made chorizo and their monster cemita poblana.

But it&apos;s also a small restaurant, perfect for a snack and a drink \u2013 white anchovies marinated in oil or some chickpea crostinis.

Melon serves a juicy, sizable (but not unmanageable) pub burger grilled on a well-seasoned flat-top and served on a lightly toasted bun with red onions and pickles. Get it. Maybe even with some bacon on top and a side of quarter-sized cottage fries and beers.

SlutWalking, designed to highlight the wrongful attribution of blame to rape victims based on their clothing, was triggered by inflammatory remarks made by a Toronto police officer three months ago.  Michael Sanguineous sparked the phenomenon after comments made to a group of students at Osgoode Hall Law School during a talk on personal safety. Sanguinetti is purported to have said: &quot;women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised.&quot; Now thousands of women worldwide are taking to the streets in organised walks to protest against a culture in which people believe victims of sexual assault are to blame. The SlutWalk Cardiff event \u2013 organised on Facebook \u2013 has already totted up more than 200 votes of support via a group set up on the social networking site. Under the group description is a link to a Guardian article on the USA SlutWalks as well as this blurb:  &quot;Whether a fellow slut or simply an ally, you don&apos;t have to wear your sexual proclivities on your sleeve: we just ask that you come. Singles, couples, parents, sisters, brothers, children, friends. Come walk or roll or strut or holler or stomp with us.&quot;  The group are yet to set a date for the walk, but plan to march from the Civic Centre through the city centre down St Mary Street and end with an anti-patriarchy party \u2013 providing permission from South Wales Police is granted. Comments on the Facebook group suggest the march may take place on 4 June when SlutWalk in London, LA and Amsterdam are also due to take place. Lemon Cottrell, who is helping to organise the event, said:  &quot;We feel that attitudes towards violence, sexual assault and rape need to change dramatically: one of the slogans of the original SlutWalk Toronto is &apos;because we&apos;ve had enough&apos; and we agree entirely. We&apos;ve had enough of hearing how the clothes we wear justify our being assaulted.  &quot;We&apos;ve had enough of being told how not to be attacked, when in reality the message needs to be &apos;do not attack&apos;. We&apos;ve had enough of victim-blaming, &apos;she was asking for it&apos;, &apos;he had it coming&apos;.  &quot;This is why we are proud to be an official satellite of SlutWalk Toronto. We are showing that Cardiff is a city in which we can feel safe and free to be who we want to be, dress how we want to dress, and that we will not stand for victim-blaming and slut-shaming.&quot;  The group also has guidelines for the SlutWalk based on the original Toronto SlutWalk website \u2013 including:  * SlutWalk is not about hate, and we do not use hateful language. * SlutWalk aims to reclaim the word &quot;slut&quot; and use it in a positive, empowering and respectful way. * Refer to sexual assault, not solely rape. * Do not frame sexual assault as something solely done\u00a0by men\u00a0to women.

Some 3,000 marchers were motivated by the controversial comments made by a police officer in a lecture to law school students on the subject of personal safety. &quot;Women,&quot; he told them, &quot;should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised.&quot; The effect has been incendiary: in cities across North America, from Arizona to Wisconsin, Oregon to Illinois, they have marched, and now the world follows suit: Sweden, Argentina, Australia, with SlutWalks scheduled for London, Los Angeles and Amsterdam on 4 June.

Two was more than enough, and I fired off an eager &apos;hello&apos;, saying I&apos;d love to bring Literary Death Match to Wales, a country with a seriously rich literary history (the Hay Festival, Laugharne Weekend, Dylan Thomas). They both wrote back saying it was a must. Fast-forward nine months: Tuesday night (10 May) at Cardiff Arts Institute marks the first-ever Literary Death Match in the City of Arcades. And if our five-year history has taught me anything: it&apos;ll be a can&apos;t-miss night that&apos;ll go down in Welsh literary history.  So, what happens at Literary Death Match?

But beyond the &quot;About&quot; of LDM, the stranger bit is how we got here. Not just to Cardiff, but to 33 other cities around the globe (from San Francisco to Amsterdam, London to Montreal, Beijing to Chicago). Our trick has been crowdsourcing brilliant, local talent, which I wrote about last week for Book Machine. It never ceases to amaze that we&apos;re able to dive into a city (spoiler alert: I&apos;ve never been to Cardiff!), and come up with a fantastic sampling of the local literary and comedy scene just by knocking on email, Twitter and Facebook doors. I&apos;ve said it out loud recently, and I&apos;ll write it here: Literary Death Match wouldn&apos;t exist without social media.

Facebook was hardly a flutter on the edge of my thoughts - I still had a MySpace account.  Now, we it&apos;s hard to see anything other than cynical snark from the legions of chicken littles that scramble around shouting about how the publishing world has basically imploded. But I do believe there&apos;s a way to put literature back into the centre of the pop culture conversation, and our way of pushing it in that direction is to seamlessly marry literature and comedy at an event that very much feels like a party. Like so many, books still thrill us, we still think reading is incredibly cool, we love conversing with whip-smart readers, and we&apos;ll keep bringing together the lit-intelligentsia to celebrate whenever, and wherever, we can.

But recent comments of one Toronto police officer, who reportedly told a group of women at Osgoode Hall Law School that they should &apos;avoid dressing like sluts in order to not be victimised&apos;, have provoked a fierce global backlash, and served as a catalyst for women and men around the world who are sickened by the notion that there are excuses for sexual assault.

Since then, the SlutWalking movement has snowballed, with more marches organised in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  When we saw a link posted to the original Guardian article on Facebook, we felt that something had to be done. We decided to organise a march in Cardiff, and set up a group. The members started adding up \u2013 first 20, then 50, then 100 \u2013 we were astounded by how many people were showing an interest. The next day, we started receiving emails from radio stations and newspapers, and we have conducted interviews for the Guardian and BBC 2 Radio. We have now received official support from the original Toronto SlutWalk group, and set a date for the march (4 June). It&apos;s been exhausting \u2013 but exhilarating. We truly feel that we are part of a global phenomenon \u2013 on the same day that we are holding the Cardiff march, demonstrations are taking place in London, Los Angeles, and Amsterdam.  There has, of course, been criticism. One accusation levelled at the movement it that it is simply &apos;common sense&apos; that women should avoid dressing &apos;provocatively&apos; if they want to stay safe. We, however, think this is a disturbing \u2013 and misleading \u2013 example of victim-blaming. No matter how short a woman&apos;s skirt is or how much cleavage is on show, she never &apos;asks&apos; to be attacked. Dressing to attract attention is not an open invitation to violence. Furthermore, the notion that &apos;provocative clothing&apos; inflames potential attackers&apos; desires is misleading. Contrary to popular belief, rape is not driven by sexual desire, but by a wish to dominate and control. As one listener to our BBC Radio 2 interview put it, &apos;rape happened before the 60s, when the miniskirt was invented&apos;.      Protesters chant during the SlutWalk in Boston on Saturday, May 7, 2011. Photograph: Josh Reynolds/AP    The second point of contention is the use of the word &apos;slut&apos;. SlutWalking is a deliberately provocative name that attracts attention to a worthy message. However, it is more than this: we want to reclaim the word &apos;slut&apos; and use it in a positive, empowering way. Historically, it has been used by misogynists to degrade women who are sexually assertive \u2013 whilst men in the same position have been hailed as &apos;studs&apos; or &apos;ladies&apos; men&apos;. We wish to make it know that women are well within their rights to have consensual sex and to display their sexuality however they like. The bottom line is that victim-blaming is unacceptable. Rape and sexual assault are already under-reported crimes: only 11% of all victims in England and Wales last year told the police about their sexual assault, and a huge 38% of victims told no-one at all. SlutWalkers believe that comments such as those made by the Toronto police officer only serve to shame more victims into silence. If you agree with us, please spread the word and join the movement. We welcome all genders, ages, and sexualities \u2013 if you don&apos;t identify as a slut, come simply as an ally. On 4 June, we will walk, roll, stomp, and strut through Cardiff to spread one simple message: it is never the victim&apos;s fault.

ARGENTINA: ZonaindiePablo Krantz - Et C&apos;est Ainsi Que Tu T&apos;en VasPablo Krantz is a well-established musician and writer born in Buenos Aires. After making a name for himself in the local alternative scene with two great albums, he moved to Paris for several years, where he released an album in which he sings entirely in French. D\u00e9monos Cita En Una Autopista (Para Volvernos A Estrellar) is his fifth record, and the first one since he returned to Argentina. A mix between these two stages in Krantz&apos;s career, Et C&apos;est Ainsi Que Tu T&apos;en Vas is a great song to start digging into his work.  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Chet Faker  - No DiggityChet Faker is a new electronic artist on the Melbourne scene. His tie-dye facial hair + wifebeater singlet + smoooooooth cover of a bangin&apos; 90s anthem has definitely brought him some attention. TOP THIS. No, this isn&apos;t a (total) joke - it&apos;s a sweet 2011 treatment for a song that many people probably didn&apos;t think was worth a revisit.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoLise - Parece ConstantinaParece Constantina is a preview of Qualquer Fr\u00e1gil Fio de Fantasia, the new album from Lise, which is the side-project of multi-instrumentalist Daniel Nunes (drummer of the band Constantina, who played at this year&apos;s SXSW). The name of the song means &quot;sounds like Constantina&quot;, in reference to his main band. Despite being a very experimental post-rock/electronic project, this track dialogues with hip hop through the vocals from members of Zimun and increases the musical spectrum of the genre.  CANADA: I(Heart)MusicThe Guest Bedroom - Tough LuckBuzzing guitars, thundering drums, impassioned female vocals... Sleater-Kinney and their grrrl-y ilk may be gone, but The Guest Bedroom show they&apos;re not forgotten. For three albums now - up to their most recent, A Year&apos;s Supply Of Rabbit&apos;s Feet - TGB have shown that there&apos;s plenty of life in a genre too many people thought died at the turn of the century and, as songs like Tough Luck show, they know how to make that old music sound as fresh and as vital as ever.  CHILE: Super 45Megajoy - Rainbow Drama&quot;Techno sudaka sci-fi from the information age&quot; - that&apos;s how Megajoy (alias for Hector Llanqu\u00edn) defines his peculiar musical view. Nervous beats, insane samples and a million pop references per second are the raw materials which Megajoy works with. His debut album Avidya (self-released, 2011), available for free download on his website, is a collection of twisted dance songs with a strong sense of humor and a subversive spirit, making this record one of this year&apos;s essentials.  CHINA: WooozyShanren - Thirty YearsYunnan folk-rock phenomenon Shanren fuse Yunnan/Guizhou indigenous music with various modern styles to produce a fresh sound as accessible as it is unique. They aim to promote and preserve the combined and diverse heritage of Yunnan and Guizhou&apos;s many ethnic minority groups through their own original compositions and reworkings of local folk melodies.  COLOMBIA: Colombia UrbanaKatamaran - Ella No Es Como TuKatamaran is a ska band from Bucaramanga. Their most recent album, Imparable, mixes horns with others styles including rap. This single, Ella No Es Como Tu, is in the Colombian indie chart.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianMescalin, Baby - She&apos;s Near, She&apos;s Near, She&apos;s HereMescalin, Baby release their full-length debut, Air Air, on May 23, following up on 2009&apos;s debut EP, No Time For The Old In-Out Love, which earned the quintet both praise and airplay. The retro-orientated rock with splashes of folk on the forthcoming album stands a good chance of repeating the success, and I&apos;m happy to be able to share She&apos;s Near, She&apos;s Near, She&apos;s Here with you as a MAP exclusive.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogBen Howard - Empty Corridors (Live)Male British singer-songwriters are hardly thin on the ground and yet, even given the crowded market, Ben Howard stands out. A 24-year-old Devon boy with a penchant for surfing, he&apos;s just released an EP on the Mumford-affiliated Communion label and has signed thereafter to Island - he apparently inked the deal because of their history with Nick Drake and John Martyn. And that&apos;s Howard all over: folk-pop with substance and class. On this, a live version of Empty Corridors, he showcases, as a recent New Band of the Day article put it, a &quot;guitar sound that recalls Drake&apos;s complex tunings, while every so often you expect his gently gruff tones to start warbling Martyn&apos;s Bless The Weather&quot;. Marvellous.  ESTONIA: PopopKali Briis - Home AloneAfter releasing some EPs, two of them available for free here, Kali Briis is finally bringing out his full-length debut album Homewrecker on May 16. Kali doesn&apos;t care much about borders of genres, feeling equally comfortable in R&apos;n&apos;B, electro, hip-hop or any other style he feels like trying. MAP exclusive Home Alone from the new album is a full-on handmade electro track featuring synths, guitars, bass and drums all played by Kali himself.  FINLAND: GlueMummypowder - A HouseAfter a few years struggling with the precarious stability of an indie band, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Janne Lehtinen got his mummies together and this month he is finally publishing Mummypowder&apos;s long-awaited fourth album. The first single, A House, is a melodic power-pop ballad with Janne&apos;s vocals upfront accompanied by layers of guitars to build up an intense momentum.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredPorco Rosso - 10.000 Lieues \u00c0 La RondeSinging pop in French is not easy, and not every band gives it a try, but some brilliantly succeed, as Porco Rosso show. Formed in 2002, the three members have found their own style - a balance between their influences and their personality. After releasing two EPs (2004, 2006), they dropped their LP, La Vie Sans Moi (&quot;Life Without Me&quot;), last year. You might not understand the lyrics of 10.000 Lieues \u00c0 La Ronde, but you don&apos;t have to - the rhythm and the vocals are too catchy not to appreciate.  GERMANY: BlogparteiAngela Aux - Smells Like Screen SpiritAngela Aux is the solo project of Heiner Hendrix aka Flo from last year&apos;s MAP featured L&apos;egojazz. He calls the style of his recently released debut, Whatever You Guess It&apos;s Not, weird Kraut-folk. Smells Like Screen Spirit is a fine m\u00e9lange of groovy, catchy bass, scratchy sound effects and melancholic vocals. It will fit perfectly with a summer sunset at your local lake when you&apos;re cheerful as well as blue.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaMay Roosevelt - Dark The NightMay Roosevelt&apos;s sophomore, self-released album harnesses a spectrum of emotions unveiling a dark and reclusive universe defined by motion and dance. Rhythms rich with contemporary elements weaved on theremin sounds, electronic beats and synthesizers coalesce with evocative melodies drawing on Greek traditional musical heritage. Every note is considered and played with care and a sense of craft. The more you listen to it, the more it falls into place and traps you under its spell.  ICELAND: Icelandic Music MaffiaNolo  - Pretty FaceNolo is a young, very promising band from Reykjavik. They are two 18-year-old guys, Nonnji Lorange and Iv\u00f6r Bj\u00f6rnsson, who had already played together in different bands for some years before they deceided to work together as Nolo. They record all their music with lo-fi equipment in Iv\u00f6r&apos;s basement, using two guitars (electric and acoustic) and an organ.  INDIA: IndiecisionPeter Cat Recording Co - Love DemonsPeter Cat Recording Co is one of the newest, freshest young talents to emerge out of the growing Indian indie music scene. The quartet from New Delhi create orchestral soundscapes that throw Neutral Milk Hotel and disco Bollywood in a washing machine with cabaret Tide. Love Demons represents this musical laundry cycle perfectly. The song, one of the highlights of the band&apos;s wholly refreshing debut album Sinema, channels Quincy Jones and Bappi Lahiri for five minutes of an exciting car chase through the crowded streets of Delhi.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarSwimming Elephants - SarahSwimming Elephants are a collective of young people who write complex arrangements of pop music pieces using simple chords. They are one of the best newcomers in the Indonesian indie scene.  IRELAND: Nialler9Le Galaxie - Midnight MidnightDublin-based mischievous visualists Le Galaxie release their debut album Laserdisc Nights II on June 10 after a few years honing their astral night-time music. Midnight Midnight is a perfect indicator of the four-piece band thus far: thumping electro, sci-fi synths, big 80s drum drops and vocals that make you go &quot;woooooooo&quot;. TUNE.  ISRAEL: Metal IsraelSpawn Of Evil - First StoneSpawn Of Evil is an iconic death metal band that&apos;s been on the Israeli scene for 13 years. Guitarist Miko Haronian describes First Stone as not &quot;so political as it looks - more reality. Some leaders say &apos;Destroy Israel&apos; all day long and the world is silent... so this is our answer to this - come on, try!&quot; Spawn Of Evil mixes rambunctious gleeful energy release with quality meat and potatoes death metal. They are seeking a label for their latest album, Ecstatic Aggressive Behavior. Check them out.  ITALY: PolaroidQuakers And Mormons - New York TownMaolo and Mancho are from the band My Awesome Mixtape, which was featured in the June 2009 edition of MAP. Now they&apos;ve started a new project, more hip-hop oriented. Think of a sound influenced by Anticon and Antipop Consortium, and mixed with some of the sumptuous TV On The Radio arrangements. Add dark lyrics delivered with an apocalyptical strain and, bang, you have this killer debut album, aptly named Evolvotron.  MEXICO: Red Bull PanameriKaAeiou - Vivimos In L.A.Aeiou&apos;s album Space Hymn is the unexpected joint venture between elfin vocalist Juan Son and Simone Pace (Blonde Redhead&apos;s drummer), with some surprising collaborations with Kelley Deal (The Breeders) and an unnamed, mysterious character. Vivimos In L.A. (&quot;We Live In L.A.&quot;), reflects the city-hopping lifestyle experienced by the members: Simone has lived in Milan, Montreal, Boston and New York; while Juan, born in Guadalajara, has also had L.A. and the Big Apple as homes. Irrespective of the passports, the song and album show touches of ethereal, androgynous space-beauty.  NETHERLANDS: Unfold AmsterdamAux Raus - Oh No, It&apos;s Them!You can technically get away with calling this Amsterdam duo&apos;s music &apos;electro punk&apos;, but whereas most bands courting such a label want to fuse those two elements, Aux Raus come across like a drunken punch-up between them - the wiry punk riffs and roars virtually taunting the techno and gabba-spewing drum machines. And that&apos;s just the start of a series of contrasts which include: songs channelling equal measures of political fury and silliness; that they&apos;re part anonymous anarcho-freaks and part leaders of style cool; and that they&apos;re at their best wreaking havoc in a club with 300 moshing kids but can easily transfer such energy to headlining festivals. This track is from their newly released third album, All Creeping Things Stopped Creeping.  NEW ZEALAND: Einstein Music JournalSheep,Dog&amp;Wolf - Not AquaticA MAP premiere - former Bandicoot drummer Daniel McBride presents his solo project Sheep,Dog&amp;Wolf, leaving behind his punk roots to weave a complex fusion of Motown, jazz and pop music. After months recording in his bedroom, the 17-year-old multi-instrumentalist&apos;s music resembles a young Sufjan Stevens, layered with strings, horns and percussion, while curious time signatures and his beautifully incandescent voice balance an unusual amalgamation of whimsically flirtatious styles.   NORWAY: Birds Sometimes DanceBurning God Little - Notes On Being SnowblindMartin Hartgren aka Burning God Little has been played quite a lot on Norwegian radio lately. Call it chillwave, call it dreampop, bedroom electronic, samplertronica, even shoegaze - whatever it is, it&apos;s great. You can easily hear inspiration from Neon Indian, Washed Out, Panda Bear and Gold Panda, but he&apos;s never a dull copy. He has his own way of mixing heavy backbeat drumbeats, samples and sometimes hauntingly beautiful harmonies and melodies.  PERU: SoTBPilotocopiloto - InfantePilotocopiloto is an instrumental rock duo consisting of Carlos Freyre and Juan Pablo Aragon. Their music can be described as a powerful fusion of guitar and drums, with their interest in experimentation allowing them to dabble in minimalist ambient sounds and psychedelic effects. This mixture fills their instrumental songs with freshness. They recently released their self-titled debut album which is just as well because Infante definitely makes you want more.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Norton - Two PointsNorton is band from a city in the center of Portugal with a considerable fanbase and three albums to their name. Their latest one, Layers Of Love United, is a turning point for the band after their lead singer left and was replaced by one of the members who used to be on backing vocals. They have toured Europe and have had quite favorable international reviews.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseBlue Nipple Boy - Bear Comes NakedBlue Nipple Boy are actually four boys from Bucharest, ready to conquer the music scene with an indie/alternative approach. Although new to it, they are rapidly increasing their fanbase with each single. And how could people not like the smooth rhythms, catchy lyrics and good vibes their songs have? The guys are working on their first album, but till then, I give you their freshly released third single, Bear Comes Naked, which will soon have a video as well.   SCOTLAND: The Pop CopWe See Lights - My Oh My Oh MyLet&apos;s see if you can guess what We See Lights sound like before you listen to them. The group hosted an event this month called The Twee Jamboree in their native Edinburgh with live music and home baking, while their new Twee Love Pop EP features a song entitled I Hope You Like The Smiths. I think you get the picture. My Oh My Oh My is by far their finest moment to date - it&apos;s an utterly adorable anthem for the lovestruck and has some delightful banjo playing. Check out Bandcamp or iTunes for more of their music.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Monster Cat - MannequinsIt intertwines like a ball of yarn unraveling as feline claws playfully pounce upon their five-track debut EP Mannequins. The guilty party is collectively known as Monster Cat, who at first mention do not hint at their psycho-folk-rock tendencies. Yet, as you sink deeper into their depravity, it starts to make perfect sense. Mannequins is a bold debut that bares all and holds nothing back, along with all the vulnerability of a gentle kitten. You can download their EP for free via their website during the month of May and pledge your allegiance.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!The Pretty Blue Guns - Shed Your SkinThe Pretty Blue Guns are four best friends who love making a noise. With their second album, Shed Your Skin, they abandoned any expectations people might have had and the result is a record that is deeply personal and shows the band&apos;s growth. The first single, Shed Your Skin, is an introspective look at life and people around them aptly showing off their self-described sound - a mix of &quot;blues, rock &apos;n&apos; roll, country, soul - all put together in a little wooden box, doused in gasoline, set alight&quot;.  SOUTH KOREA: Indieful ROKParyumchiakdan - A Night Of WineParyumchiakdan, which translates as &quot;The Infamous Orchestra&quot;, was formed three years ago with the vision of making music based on 70s punk-rock with an East Asian pop sound, playing it as if they were a 60s garage rock band. The sound has changed a bit since, but the members still cite GO!GO!7188 and Korean psychedelic musicians of the 70s such as Kim Jung Mi as influences. The band recently self-released their first EP, A Night Of Wine, and the title track has an awesome modern retro sound that invites foot-tapping.  SPAIN: MusikornerEl Estudiante Larry - Mejor Que YoFormed in Murcia, a city renowned for its hot indie music scene, El Estudiante Larry is frontman Larry Sandoval and fellow musicians V\u00edctor, Seka and Porras. After releasing three CD-Rs (available for free download), they collaborated with #Fo - side-project of Klaus &amp; Kinski&apos;s \u00c1lex Mart\u00ednez - to release a split EP, Gulag Split, which can be downloaded for free on Bandcamp. El Estudiante Larry songs can be made from psychedelic beats, a classic indie sound or even a Nashville rock taste, which is the case with Mejor Que Yo, the last but not least track on the EP.  SWEDEN: SwedespleaseMasquer - HappinessSuper lo-fi indie-rock that reminds one of 1/3 Cure, 1/3 Siouxsie Sioux and 1/3 Madonna. Count me in! Masquer is the new side-project of Kiki from Lowood/Idora and Pelle of Idora. The new song is called Happiness and continues to play to the band&apos;s strengths - mainly its 80s retro indie-rock sound and the spellbinding vocals of Kiki. Lyrically, its anti-establishment lyrics and chorus of &quot;I&apos;ll never conform&quot; would be a perfect addition to the soundtracks of any John Hughes films from that period.  SWITZERLAND: 78sWe Love Machines - Carpentizer (feat. Orlando Menthol)The two Swiss guys from We Love Machines nailed our attention a year ago. They caused a big stir with Ed Banger-influenced sounds that totally hit it. Now they&apos;ve released their debut, which is actually full of hits and some surprises. One of them is the Balkan-esque electro tune Carpentizer which features another Swiss electronic genius, Orlando Menthol, and some Swiss-German singing parts.  UNITED STATES: I Guess I&apos;m FloatingAuditorium - SundayAuditorium (formerly Field) is the work of Spencer Berger, whose debut album Be Brave was released in January. Berger specializes in &apos;glam-folk&apos;, whereby theatrical, multi-layered vocal harmonies shine throughout the album, telling stories of love, nature, cities and people in a remarkably engaging way. Auditorium is beginning to make waves in LA and beyond - get on board now before your friends are barking at you about it in a few months.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sLa Abuela Disco - 4.30La Abuela Disco is an alternative rock, post-grunge and electronic-influenced band formed in Acarigua (Portuguesa) in mid-2009. In late April, they finally released their first studio album Polvo Lunar, a name that fits perfectly with its sound. It can be downloaded for free at the band&apos;s website.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS: Unfold AmsterdamAux Raus - Oh No, It&apos;s Them!You can technically get away with calling this Amsterdam duo&apos;s music &apos;electro punk&apos;, but whereas most bands courting such a label want to fuse those two elements, Aux Raus come across like a drunken punch-up between them - the wiry punk riffs and roars virtually taunting the techno and gabba-spewing drum machines."], "title": "May's best new music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/may/16/may-new-music-across-map", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Electronic music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-16T15:51:58Z", "article": "Ajax&apos;s Maarten Stekelenberg has added his name to the growing list of butter-fingered players capable of winning trophies but seemingly unable to hold on to them.

Plans by the LSE to merge with the Toronto stock exchange have been jeopardised by the intervention of nine of Canada&apos;s banks and pension funds, which tabled an alternative, higher offer for the Canadian exchange. The consortium, which has nationalistically dubbed itself the Maple Group, has proposed paying C$3.58bn (\u00a32.27bn) for TMX Group. The Maple proposal is worth $48 per TMX share, while the LSE merger values the exchange at about $40 a share. In another twist to the consolidation under way among the world&apos;s exchanges as they race to cut costs, a two-way tussle for the New York stock exchange drew to a close after two US exchanges \u2013 Nasdaq and ICE \u2013 dropped their challenge to an agreed deal by Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Nasdaq and ICE cited insurmountable regulatory hurdles to their rival offer for NYSE Euronext. This led to speculation that the acquisition-hungry Nasdaq could look elsewhere, possibly even to the LSE, which has fended off its advances in the past. James Hamilton, a Numis analyst, pointed out that the LSE&apos;s relatively small size could make it attractive to a predator if the TMX deal folded. But he also noted that LSE could increase its bid \u2013 it expects \u00a3100m of cost savings \u2013 and still justify this higher price. This, though, would mean the LSE might find it harder to win regulatory approval for the deal. &quot;The main problem here, however, becomes regulatory,&quot; said Hamilton, &quot;as any increased offer removes the concept of a merger of equals.&quot; Keith Baird, an Oriel analyst, said: &quot;If the counter-offer succeeds, as it might well do, it would be a severe blow for the LSE&apos;s response to global exchange consolidation and specifically the NYSE/Deutsche B\u00f6rse [merger]. The LSE&apos;s strategy of diversification away from dependence on London (and to a lesser extent Milan) and securing extra growth would be badly damaged.&quot; Deutsche B\u00f6rse, an arch-rival of the LSE, is now at an advantage, analysts believe. Konrad Becker, at Merck Finck, said: &quot;The fact that Nasdaq and ICE are withdrawing their offer for NYSE is no surprise. It became clear already that the offer wouldn&apos;t be successful. It&apos;s good news for Deutsche B\u00f6rse.&quot; If Nasdaq and ICE had succeeded in buying NYSE Euronext, they would have split it up. Nasdaq would have acquired NYSE&apos;s equities and equities options business, and ICE would have bought its London-based futures unit, Liffe. NYSE had rejected the unsolicited offer, and Nasdaq and ICE had been ready to launch a hostile bid. Now, though, they recognise it would fail. Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, said: &quot;We took the decision to withdraw our offer when it became clear that we would not be successful in securing regulatory approval for our proposal despite offering a variety of substantial remedies. &quot;We saw a unique opportunity to create more value for stockholders and strengthen the US as a centre for capital formation amid an ongoing shift of these vital activities and jobs outside of our country.&quot; Deals diary The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been at the centre of a string of proposed merger and acquisitions in the last decade. May 2000 The LSE and Germany&apos;s Deutsche B\u00f6rse unveil plans to merge, after Euronext is set up by Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. August 2000 A hostile \u00a3808m bid from Sweden&apos;s OM exchange for the LSE scuppers its Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger. December 2004 Deutsche B\u00f6rse tables a \u00a31.3bn offer for the LSE but is rebuffed. February 2005 Euronext outlines the terms of a potential offer for the LSE but fails to put a price on its plans. December 2005 LSE rejects a &quot;derisory&quot; \u00a31.5bn takeover offer from Australia&apos;s Macquarie Bank. March 2006 Nasdaq makes a \u00a32.4bn bid for the LSE, which is also rejected. May 2006 NYSE bids $8bn (\u00a315bn) for Euronext; Deutsche B\u00f6rse then makes a counter offer valuing the European bourses at $11bn. December 2006 Nasdaq raises its LSE stake to 28.75% and makes a \u00a32.7bn hostile offer. An $11bn deal between NYSE and Euronext is approved. February 2007 Nasdaq wins just 0.41% of acceptances from LSE shareholders. June 2007 The LSE seals a \u00a31.1bn deal to buy Italy&apos;s Borsa Italiana. August 2007 Nasdaq agrees to sell most of its LSE shares to Borse Dubai. February 2011 The LSE and TMX, the Canadian stock exchange, agree to merge, with the LSE owning 55%. May 2011 The Maple Group, made up of nine Canadian banks and pension funds, propose a counter offer for TMX.

As a card-carrying optimist working on the sustainable development agenda, I was struck by how pessimistic the expert community has become about humankind&apos;s prospects this century. Where a decade ago there was still optimism that things could be turned around on issues like climate change, deforestation and over-fishing, people are now openly saying that it is too late. Humankind will have to experience a profound crisis before it understands that the &quot;doom and gloom&quot; and &quot;limits to growth&quot; fraternity were right after all. As a regular attendee of international sustainability events, let me share with you a few examples of what I heard during April. First, there was a business and industry conference hosted by the UN Environment Programme and International Chamber of Commerce in Paris on 11-12 April. The purpose of the event was to explore ways of accelerating progress towards a low-carbon, resource efficient, green economy, the theme of a major UN sustainability conference to be held next year. While it was more or less common ground among the more than 200 business, government and NGO participants that the current economic growth model was unsustainable (and for many, deeply unfair), there was little optimism that things would change as quickly as needed. Although the formal sessions provided a range of proposals (including my own thoughts) on how government policy could be more effective and the private sector better engaged, in the corridors things were bleaker. Whatever the assessment of the core underlying problems \u2013 be they the failure of economic systems to reflect the real cost of natural capital, the failure of governments to implement past commitments, and the lack of incentives for business to develop new business models \u2013 the basic feeling was that the problems we now face are too interlinked, too complex, to be quickly or neatly solved. Some people pointed to the lack of political leadership. Where was the &quot;sustainability Churchill&quot;, who could deliver the modern version of the &quot;nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; rallying cry? Others pointed to the weaknesses of electoral and lobbying systems, which make it virtually unthinkable to elect someone like that. Still others talked of denial being a &quot;great place to live&quot;, referring to the seductive charms of the high-turnover short-term consumer economy and the absence of any serious or sustained attention to the sustainability agenda. In short, we are getting the ultimately self-destructive economy we chose with our purchases, pension contributions and votes. And, while everyone agreed that clean technologies could be fast-tracked and often made economic sense, social and political inertia (think the US Congress) would keep us on our current suicidal course until things broke down. Outside the conference, however, the spring warmth and blossoms of Paris \u2013 and a glass of the local wine \u2013 made it easier to hope that this was more of a theoretical problem. But then came the Amsterdam launch of Paul Gilding&apos;s book The Great Disruption. Gilding&apos;s thesis \u2013 that we&apos;ve run out of time and ability to prevent a climate crisis, and must now steel ourselves to handle the impending economic and societal mess \u2013 is not altogether new. It shares the increasingly laden bookshelves with a range of works whose central message is that when the laws of physics and natural systems collide with the resource-intensive consumer economy, the latter will lose. Soft landings are not on offer. For the people overflowing on the cafe terraces of Amsterdam enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, however, this was not a message that would get much attention. The month ended with the Association for the Study of Peak Oil conference, which I had the pleasure to chair. The &quot;peakers&quot;, as they call themselves, are essentially a group of academics, former oil company men and economists who think that the world is now running on less than half a tank of oil. While we will continue to find more oil, they contend, the amounts will never match past finds and global production declines \u2013 already documented \u2013 will continue, driven ever faster by rising demand, particularly from China and India. The geologists produced persuasive arguments about oil, gas and even coal being finite resources, and wondered aloud about the fact that the remaining accessible stocks were in increasingly turbulent Middle Eastern countries, or in remote and high risk areas (as BP&apos;s Deepwater Horizon showed) . The economists talked darkly about a future of oil price increases driving higher costs across all oil-dependent sectors (agriculture, transportation and chemicals, for example), leading to a major recession, possibly in the next year or two. While there were differences about exactly when the peak of oil production would be reached, the issue was when, and not if. Everyone shared the concern that renewable energies were not yet mature enough to fill the gap of any sudden shortfall. The transition from oil to whatever replaces it would be neither smooth nor easy. On the margins of the conference there was a strong sense of frustration that the possibility the world was running out of one of its most important raw materials was nowhere on the agenda of government or business. My salmon dinner that evening seemed to summarise the month. The bad news is that wild fisheries are in crisis. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that commercial fishing could collapse well before 2050. The good news is that the aquaculture sector \u2013 which provided my fish \u2013 has developed to the point where it supplies almost 40% of fresh fish on the market. Here, at least, a smooth transition seems to be taking place. For my part, I am persuaded by much of what I heard. We are nearing a crunch point of our rising demand and the planet&apos;s declining capacity to supply. Smaller scale changes have caused civilisations in the past to collapse. We now need to summon up the maturity and honesty to face this risk. Resignation, inertia and pessimism are no response. There is an amazing amount of good that is being done and still more that can be. For those interested in following future monthly blogs, I plan to set out my own analysis of what the key policy challenges are and how, collectively, we can tackle them.

As Europe&apos;s policy elite met for fresh crisis talks today, the dark fear that haunted everyone around the table was this: if the bankruptcy of a middling-sized Wall Street investment bank with no retail customers could have such dire consequences, what would happen if the Greeks decide they have had enough and renege on their debts? Could Greece, in other words, be the new Lehmans? Given the structure of modern financial markets, with their chains of derivative trades and their pyramids of debt, there is only one answer. Greece could certainly be the next Lehmans. The likelihood that a Greek default would pose a threat to the future of the eurozone as well as to the health of the world economy means it has the potential to be worse than Lehmans. Much worse. Given that gloomy prognosis, the European Union and the currently rudderless International Monetary Fund know something has to be done but are not quite sure what. To be fair, it&apos;s a tough one. A single currency that involved a hard core of European countries that were broadly similar in terms of economic development and industrial structure might just have worked. Bolting together a group of 17 disparate economies with different levels of productivity growth, different languages and different business cultures was an accident waiting to happen, and so it has proved. The weaker countries, on the fringes of the single currency area, have not been able to cope with the disciplines involved in giving up control of their interest rates and their currencies, with the problem going much wider than the three countries \u2013 Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u2013 that have sought bailouts. Spain&apos;s housing boom and bust was the result of the pan-European interest rate being too low; Italy&apos;s increasing lack of competitiveness stems from a lack of exchange-rate flexibility. It was also clear from the outset that the structure of monetary union would result in struggling countries being subjected to deflationary policies. Since the eurozone is not a sovereign state there is no formal mechanism for transferring resources from rich parts of the monetary union to the poor parts. Nor, given language barriers and bureaucratic impediments, is it easy for someone made unemployed in Athens to get a job in Amsterdam. Instead those countries seeking to match Germany&apos;s hyper-competitive economy have to cut costs, through stringent curbs on wage increases and fiscal austerity. This was the plan A that was wheeled out for Greece last spring, when it became the first eurozone country to run into trouble, and it has been repeated for Ireland and Portugal. Plan\u00a0A\u00a0involved providing Athens with a bridging loan so that it could continue to meet its debt obligations, while at the same time insisting on draconian steps to cut Greece&apos;s budget deficit. Pain plus procrastination: the traditional recourse for policymakers who lack imagination, as Europe&apos;s have done throughout the sovereign debt crisis. Clearly, plan A has\u00a0not worked, as anyone who has piled up too much debt on their credit card could have predicted. Just like an individual who can&apos;t stop interest charges going up and up, despite trading down to a budget supermarket, cancelling the gym membership and abandoning the holiday, Greece has found that the belt-tightening has left it with a bigger central government budget deficit in the first four months of\u00a02011 than it had in the first four months of\u00a02010. It&apos;s not difficult to see why this has happened. Those who put together Greece&apos;s programme underestimated the extent to which public spending cuts and tax increases would hamper the growth potential of the economy, particularly given the lack of scope for the currency to fall. Historically the IMF&apos;s structural programmes for troubled developing countries have involved devaluation, so exports became cheaper; but Greece&apos;s membership of the single currency has meant there has been no external safety valve to compensate for the domestic squeeze. Greece needs to have the scope to grow its way out of its debt crisis. Failing that, the rest of the eurozone has to be prepared to stomach not just a second, but a third and perhaps even a fourth bailout so Athens can keep up with its debt repayments. Hence the drumbeat of speculation that Greece would be better off defaulting, or leaving the eurozone altogether. There is no suggestion that the Greek government is planning anything of this nature. Default and devaluation pose big risks, particularly since the debts would have to be in a redenominated currency (like the drachma) that creditors would deem to have junk status. In the short term, Greece&apos;s economic and financial crisis would almost certainly deepen. Athens would prefer the EU to provide a second bridging loan and to reschedule its debts over a longer period so the interest payments become less onerous. But that is at best a stopgap solution, because it does nothing to address the structural weaknesses of the eurozone. For this, there are really only two solutions. The first is to turn monetary union into political union, creating the budgetary mechanisms to transfer resources across a single fiscal space. That would fulfil the ambitions of those who designed the euro, and would recognise that the current halfway house arrangement is inherently unstable. The second would be to admit defeat by announcing carefully crafted plans for a two-tier Europe, in which the outer part would be linked to the core through fixed but adjustable exchange rates. Neither option, it has to be said, looks remotely likely, although the collapse of Lehmans shows the limitations of the current muddling-through approach. The eurozone&apos;s future will not be decided in Athens or Lisbon but in Paris and in Germany. Both the big beasts have invested vast stocks of political capital in &quot;the Project&quot;, and insist that there will be no defaults and no departures from the club. Yet German public opinion was sniffy about the Greek bailout in May 2010, kicked up a fuss at being asked to pick up the tab for Ireland last November, and is positively furious about having to sort out the mess in Portugal. Despite the strength of the German economy, Angela Merkel is facing strong political resistance to more bailouts. The political calculus is clear: cutting Greece and the other weaker euro-area economies adrift would end the dream of monetary union as a club where European countries, big and small, weak and strong, could rub along together with a single economic policy. But failing to cut them adrift could cost Merkel her job.", "sentences": ["Nor, given language barriers and bureaucratic impediments, is it easy for someone made unemployed in Athens to get a job in Amsterdam."], "title": "Could Greece be the next Lehman Brothers?

He was in command of a fleet of 41 ships moored between Dunkirk and Nieuwport when a storm blew up from the north-east on 18 May. Cables started breaking, so the fleet weighed anchor and took shelter near Dover, where an English naval force was already stationed. Although relations between England and Holland were strained in 1652, the two fleets were peaceable enough at first. As the weather improved the Dutch prepared to leave with a merchant convoy which had also taken shelter. English commander Admiral Blake fired a cannon, the usual signal that the Dutch should lower their flags and salute, as they were in English waters. Two signals were ignored; the third cannon shot struck the Dutch flagship, the Brederode. Accounts differ as to what happened next, but it turned into a full-scale naval action. Although outnumbered, the heavier and better-armed English ships prevailed in the battle of Goodwin Sands. Two Dutch warships were damaged and captured while the rest sailed off. This was the start of the First Anglo-Dutch War. Without that skirmish, diplomacy might have succeeded and 22 years of intermittent warfare could have been averted.

Barbara Hepworth is the automatic assumption of most people reading about this \u00a335 million cultural starship and wondering about its name; but the Wakefield-born sculptor is only part of the story. Just as important is the Yorkshire city&apos;s truly exceptional record as a determined buyer and encourager of contemporary art. This goes back to the first art gallery&apos;s opening in Wentworth Terrace in 1934, when times were a great deal harder in the West Riding than they are now, and the notion of a Labour council spending public money on &apos;strange&apos; art, as opposed to the gilt-framed &apos;proper&apos; stuff, was not easy to sell to voters. Providentially, three curators in turn were outstandingly tough characters: Ernest Musgrave, Eric Westbrook and finally the multiple egg-server, Helen Kapp. The Hepworth&apos;s many interesting debut exhibits include a small but excellent archival taster of their robust work, which attracted attention from the likes of the Guardian and the Times. This was invaluable to all three when assailed by the Wakefield Express, which did its share of carping in the early, vulnerable days of the Hepworth. Kapp wrote: &quot;I propose something, there&apos;s a fuss in the local paper for a couple of weeks, and then we carry on.&quot; Those interested can find out more by appointment from the Hepworth which, in spite of its name, is far more than a Barbarafest. All the rich and varied collection of the old Wentworth Terrace gallery is there, in wonderfully enhanced surroundings and space. The collection includes a rarer copy of Take Forty Eggs which Kapp wrote and illustrated with boldly simple cartoons, much like those by Osbert Lancaster in books such as Home, Sweet Home. When I Googled for it, I found that my nearest library copy is in Amsterdam. There are huge lessons to be learned from this faithful adherence by a succession of hard-pressed Labour councils in Wakefield to the belief that voters do not live by bread alone. Musgrave &amp; Co played their part in creating a milieu in which Hepworth and Henry Moore (from Castleford which is within the Wakefield council district) could flourish, even if Leeds School of Art was ultimately more important. And for those who insist on the bottom line (as in the end, I suppose, we all must), it is already evident that the new gallery is reinforcing the marvellous Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Walton Hall, Nostell Priory and much else in making Wakefield one of the UK&apos;s leading cultural attractions.

It was announced on 11 May that Princes Street would need to be shut for 10 months and completely dug up for a second time. On Monday councillors began investigating the cost of canceling the project. Then on Thursday the project&apos;s chief executive Richard Jeffrey resigned.  Earlier this week we asked for supporters of the troubled project to speak up and explain why they still back it.  With \u00a3440m of the \u00a3545m budget spent, some doubted whether anybody would come forward to pledge their support for the trams, but plenty did. Some said they would approve of private finance helping to complete the line. We&apos;ve compiled some of their responses below.  Chris Romain RIBA, via email:   I have been following the progress, or lack of it very closely. I have always been an avid supporter of the project even though I no longer live in Edinburgh but regularly visit family. The present state of affairs is unbelievable, in view of its importance to Edinburgh and cost to the taxpayer. I believe that the disputes started with utilities diversions, which, from my own experience in the construction industry, is no surprise. I have read that the additional costs incurred in diverting underground services is approximately \u00a3100m, which if recovered from the Statutory Undertakers, would go a long way to getting the project completed. I believe that the system should be finished all the way from the airport to Newhaven. It would be quite wrong to lease any of the trams to Croydon: that is defeatist. The design of the trams by CAF is very good and, in my opinion, befitting the capital. I was very impressed with the production vehicle displayed on Princes Street last year. I note that PFI is being considered to assist completion and this could be a possible way forward. The scheme must be completed as soon as possible and this intransigence has to stop: it is harming the reputation of Edinburgh and stopping the city from getting a high quality 21st century transport scheme which I am sure will be liked by everyone when it is complete.   Edinburgh Napier student David McGregor:   I am a firm believer that the trams in Edinburgh are a great commodity for the city and I think it is a shame that even the thought of cancelling the trams, after so much time effort and money has been spent on the project, is even being considered. Instead of just concentrating on the costs that has been spent so far, the people of Edinburgh need to embrace the trams and look to the future and see what they will be like after they have been completed and how they will benefit the city as a whole. I also believe the full route should be completed, from the airport to Granton Square. And then in the years to come more routes added. People need to look at how successful the trams are in Manchester and Amsterdam to see how successful they can be here, I&apos;m sure when they were being completed they also had their problems but now the residents have forgotten this and are now proud of their tram structure!  Edinburgh needs to talk less and get on with completing the project, I have heard that London now want to bring the trams back and I support that too!  Simon van Heyningen, Edinburgh Southside resident:   Ridiculous to stop now, in spite of the obvious problems. Anyone who has been anywhere that has recently had new trams knows how wonderful they can be.   Edinburgh&apos;s Labour group leader Andrew Burns insists on his blog that he is still a supporter of trams returning to Edinburgh. But he admits: &quot;Revelations of the last few months would test the forbearance of the project&apos;s most ardent supporter.&quot; He calls on stronger leadership of the project.  We also put the question out on Twitter, and Storified the following responses:    [View the story \"Tram supporters\" on Storify]   There were also voices of support for the project in the comments on this post.  Other side of the debate  In the interest of fairness, here are some of the comments and questions we saw this week from those who no longer want the project to continue.  Dr Ashley Lloyd of the Moray Feu Residents Association said &apos;pressing on&apos; is exactly the wrong thing to do.   &quot;The announcement, that just months after the chaos and upheaval on Princes Street ended is to be done all over again, illustrates better than any words the chaos of a project that has totally lost its way.  &quot;TIE who just a few weeks ago wre still saying the original \u00a3545m would cover the route being pushed to York Place, now says it might be \u00a3600m, or even more, just to get to Haymarket.  &quot;It must be realised before it&apos;s too late that &apos;pressing on&apos; is exactly the wrong thing to do.&quot;   Alan Rudland, chairman of Leith Business Association was a guest discussing the trams on BBC Radio Scotland&apos;s Call Kaye show during the week. Hear what he had to say here.  BBC Scotland&apos;s Lisa Summers has a round up of recent trams news and speaks to local people in this video clip.

We first meet him interviewing for the role of tutor to the son of the wealthy hotelier, Maarten Vermeulen-Sickerts. All is not well in his gilded household. Egbert, the son, is agoraphobic. The matriarch, Jacobina, hasn&apos;t been touched by her husband in almost a decade. Into this highly strung atmosphere comes Piet, charged with the task of freeing Egbert from his paralysing fear of the outside world. We soon realise, however, that Egbert isn&apos;t the only one in need of help. Piet sets about liberating the libidos of the repressed family through music \u2013 championing bawdy Bizet over abstract Bach \u2013 and oral sex.

The Bad Sex awards are something more than just a very British chortle at willies and bums. In describing sex, authors must use language to convey experience which lies in a realm far removed from it: a test which many of the best fail.

Piet&apos;s downfall comes in the form of a semen-stained dress, a fitting metaphor for the career of this sexy rake. A &quot;miniature silver model of a man on a tightrope, balancing precariously&quot; appears repeatedly, representing both Maarten&apos;s risky business enterprises and the perils of Piet&apos;s position within the household. It&apos;s also a symbol of Mason&apos;s writing. History of a Pleasure Seeker could have been disastrous; instead it&apos;s an enthralling, perfectly paced romp that breathes new life into the picaresque genre.

It might come as something of a surprise to people who don&apos;t come to these events just how buddy-buddy hackers and software corporates are these days. Hack in the Box (HiTB) isn&apos;t an ersatz event put together by some canny event company; it&apos;s organised by hackers for the community. Indeed, over the years, nothing has succeeded in persuading the guys behind it to try to make a reasonable living out of it. But for all the hacker cred HiTB enjoys there&apos;s no sense of cold-shouldering the suits, or in this case logo-emblazoned T-shirts. RIM, Facebook, Google and Mozilla are all sponsors and Microsoft is paying for the floating after-party on the Ijsselmeer. Indeed, the boundaries between software companies and hackers have been growing steadily more fluid over the years. The big names are here to make friends, listen to the latest research and to recruit. Often their in-house security teams claim to have a degree of autonomy that other divisions \u2013 such as sales, marketing and R&amp;D \u2013 don&apos;t. These, after all, are the guys who have to saddle up occasionally and ride out of the stockade at Fort Gates into the wild west of software. I&apos;d say some of them seem to prefer it out there. If all this sounds slightly counter-intuitive, bear in mind that in this particular world there are a lot of people out there with a lot of different coloured hats. Taking a lead from the visual language of the westerns there are white hats (the good guys), the black hats (the bad guys) and the grey hats (either the morally ambivalent or the guys who didn&apos;t figure out which washing machine cycle to use). The white hats are essentially freelance security experts who look for vulnerabilities in software and who then sometimes develop &quot;exploits&quot; or tools to take advantage of them. If you want a visual metaphor the conference handily provides one in the shape of the &quot;lockpick village&quot; \u2013 a table of enthusiasts who bring along a bag of brass or steel locks and padlocks and sit there picking away at them until they&apos;ve cracked every one. One of the major themes here is how the big software companies reward the hackers for their efforts. Different corporations respond to hackers in different ways. Mozilla, the company behind the Firefox browser, was one of the first to pay these freelancers for drawing their attention to vulnerabilities or even better for coming to them with a solution as well as a problem. Google is here to ensure the hacking community knows it is following suit and offering a bounty on every one they report. Chris Evans, who is head of security for Google Chrome, describes it as &quot;recognition for their efforts&quot;. Chris and Lucas Adamski, director of security engineering at Mozilla, are sharing a panel platform with senior security people from RIM, Adobe and Microsoft. The latter doesn&apos;t pay hackers for coming up with exploits. But as Adobe senior security strategist Steve Adegbite explains, direct remuneration isn&apos;t the only way that big companies reward hackers. Most give public credit to those who identify problems, others offer paid freelance work or full-time jobs and, where freelancers set up their own consultancies, they can get big-name endorsements. &quot;We actually go out there and vouch for good researchers,&quot; says Adegbite. &quot;If somebody comes to us and says &apos;we want somebody to look at our technology that&apos;s similar like yours&apos;, we&apos;ll recommend somebody.&quot; His opposite number at Microsoft, Katie Moussouris, takes a similar line, saying that flagging vulnerabilities is a good billboard for hackers seeking security jobs.

Understandably, some hackers are a little sceptical. But sceptical doesn&apos;t even begin to describe their feelings towards Sony. Google pays hackers for their help; Adobe praises them; Sony sues them. There is a feeling among the white hats that Sony isn&apos;t handling the PlayStation Network situation well. Perhaps a little more than not well. One conference-goer put his hands over his eyes and chants &quot;there are no bugs at Sony, there are no bugs at Sony&quot;. Others simply don&apos;t believe that the Japanese giant&apos;s corporate culture will allow it to get a grip. &quot;It&apos;s a totally different mentality&quot;, says Lucian Constantin of the tech website softpedia.com. &quot;Sony isn&apos;t a software company, it&apos;s a hardware giant. They make firmware. They&apos;re very entrenched into that mindset of enclosed and proprietary systems. They tried to defend themselves through the legal system and it backfired; a great deal.&quot; No data security breach causes reputational damage like loss of financial details does. Sony may not need the hackers. Indeed Microsoft, Mozilla and Google arguably don&apos;t need the hackers as they have sizeable security teams of their own, but they do see a beneficial relationship to be had and they certainly see the downside of a hostile one. The question for Sony, given the way security challenges only serve to whet the hacking community&apos;s appetite, is whether it wants the tech equivalent of a Vietnam; an unseen and resilient enemy with no shortage of recruits and little or nothing to lose while it is big, out in the open and has a target painted on its corporate posterior.

Geoff Husband of Brittany-based firm Breton Bikes reports kids as young as five who go on his holidays are not only sleeping through the night for the first time, but even have to be woken up in the morning. Some of my own family&apos;s best holiday memories have been on two wheels (or four if you include the toddler trailer). We&apos;ve cycled as a family all over northern France, in Amsterdam and elsewhere in the Netherlands, in Lancashire and the Lake District, on traffic-light roads and in the grounds of farms, campsites and wooded holiday villages. But our preference is naturally for off-road trails \u2013 even on a country lane in the back of beyond, where you&apos;re worried about a tractor lurching over the next hill. In France, they&apos;re lucky enough to have the extensive network of voie vertes or &quot;greenways&quot; and newer voie bleues or &quot;blueways&quot; (the latter alongside urban rivers and canals). Our favourite, so grand that it&apos;s been named an &quot;avenue verte&quot;, is the 45km Dieppe\u2013Forges route from the Channel port to the heart of the Normandy countryside (one day, they say, it will be part of a mighty &quot;avenue verte London\u2013Paris&quot;). Its current endpoint, Forges-les-Eaux, is not only a designated green holiday resort but also a &quot;station famille plus&quot; for its family-friendliness. As well as tot-friendly cycling, there&apos;s a forested nature reserve with lakeside discovery trails, horse-riding, giant outdoor chess, and a family-friendly spa-hotel. In the UK, there is a relative scarcity of off-road trails for families and beginners. But this is changing and has been a big factor in the opening of the \u00a31.5m National Cycle Centre in the National Forest, with 13km of off-road trails, a bike-hire and repair shop, a caf\u00e9 and a play area, all in an building with impressive eco-friendly credentials. Now, the National Forest is not actually a forest \u2013 it&apos;s a &quot;forest in the making&quot;, created in 1990 in the Midlands to regenerate an area left scarred both physically and economically by the demise of its mining industry. But it&apos;s already a great place to cycle in a safe natural environment with young kids. Even before the centre opened, we spent a fabulous weekend in the National Forest ambling around the Rosliston Forestry Centre on bikes, hopping off at will for bug-hunts and pond-dipping sessions, or just to sit and soak up the peace, before heading back to the sanctuary of our onsite timber lodge to refuel over a barbecue. As for practicalities, we usually take along a bike for my middle son, who finds many hire bikes for his age/height too heavy \u2013 something that can put a severe kibosh on our plans. But with two-day bike-hire averaging about \u00a360 for all of us, and set to rise when my toddler can pedal himself around, we&apos;ll soon have to start looking at a five-bike carrier and taking our own gear. In terms of where we&apos;ll go, I&apos;d like to build up to a dedicated cycle-camping holiday offered by the likes of Breton Bikes, where you cycle on quiet safe roads along a string of rural campsites. Unlike most cycling holidays, this is suitable for any age. Or the Adventure Company&apos;s Malta and Gozo trip, which includes exploring trails and paths on Gozo by bike, and is open to kids as young as three. Less ambitiously, I&apos;ve earmarked the two family cycle trials starting at the wonderful Rendlesham Forest Centre in Suffolk, and the circular family route in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire.

Photograph: Adam Woolfitt/Corbis    Northumbria university&apos;s historians are coming to the rescue of us poor old English, after years of neglect as an &apos;ethnic group&apos; all of our own. Thanks to our record of rampaging round the world in pursuit of adventure, knowledge and trade (step forward the most famous Yorkshireman ever, Captain James Cook), everyone else has apparently defined themselves against us. This is going to change, thanks to an academic team led by Prof Don MacRaild, Dr Tanja Bueltmann and Dr David Gleeson, plus \u00a3286,000 from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Their three year project is called Locating the Hidden Diaspora: The English in North America 1760-1950, and it promises interesting revelations about &apos;encouraged Englishness&apos; at a time when our culture was not so self-confident. German was at one time a serious contender as the official language of the young United States, whose many different ex-European communities had good reason to distance themselves from the former colonial power. In response the &apos;ethnic English&apos; created St George&apos;s Societies, held evenings dedicated to English food, encouraged loyal toasts to successive monarchs and even promoted morris dancing. Goodness. &quot;The Irish, Scots, Germans, and many other European ethnic groups have been subjected to dozens if not hundreds of studies, but not so the English,&quot; says the prof. &quot;The standard historian&apos;s answer has been that the English assimilated more easily to Anglo-American culture so removing the need for ethnic expression. However, far from being an invisible group within a world of noticeably ethnicised European immigrants, the English consciously ethnicised themselves in an active way. &quot; Thousands of unread documents, pictures and presumably morris dancing programmes are involved in the study.

Ryanair claimed it had flown a Boeing airplane through a no-go part of the ash cloud over Scotland this morning and found no harmful effects to the engines or fuselage, while the International Air Transport Association alleged that the UK air safety watchdog, the Civil Aviation Authority, did not have an atmosphere monitoring plane available. Although airports remained open on Tuesday, airlines halted hundreds of flights amid safety concerns at the high density of ash caused by the eruption of the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn volcano, in Iceland. British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, Aer Lingus, Loganair, Flybe and KLM were among carriers cancelling flights. Transatlantic flights operating through Icelandic airspace suffered delays of up to an hour today as they were diverted around the densest parts of the ash cloud emitted by the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn volcano. However, BMI was still operating out of Edinburgh and Glasgow, saying the ash remained further north than forecast earlier. The airline was constantly reviewing the situation, it said. The Barcelona football team said it would travel to London on Wednesday night for Saturday&apos;s Champions League final against Manchester United, in case the ash cloud left the team contemplating an epic rail journey. There were concerns the cloud would later spread south, affecting flights to northern England and Northern Ireland. A number of flights from Newcastle international airport have been cancelled, including services to Paris, Brussels, Faro, Amsterdam, Aberdeen, Belfast international and Malta. Arrivals to Newcastle from Aberdeen, Amsterdam and Exeter have also been cancelled. Meanwhile, four easyJet flights to and from Belfast international (flights to and from Newcastle and Glasgow) have been cancelled. Philip Hammond, the transport secretary, who has promised there will be no blanket airspace closures similar to those last year, suggested on the BBC&apos;s Newsnight on Monday that &quot;we have got to learn to live&quot; with disruption. There were now &quot;much more robust systems to minimise the disruptive effect&quot;, he said. Since last year&apos;s eruption the authorities had gained a much better understanding of the risk from ash clouds, he said. &quot;Most importantly, the basic situation now is that the threshold for most aircraft is 20 times where it was last year. We have got from 200 micrograms (mcg) per cubic metre, to 4,000mcg per cubic metre as the threshold up to which most aircraft can fly. &quot;What we can&apos;t promise is that there won&apos;t be disruption when there is a major natural event like this.&quot; Hammond will chair a meeting of the government&apos;s Cobra committee on the ash cloud later on Tuesday. A government source said the situation remained variable, with the possibility that dense ash would drift over Glasgow and Edinburgh between 1pm and 7pm before clearing. The source added: &quot;These things change from hour to hour.&quot; Mass cancellations at airports on Tuesday by airlines including easyJet and British Airways are viewed as an operational decision as those companies try to ensure their schedules operate more smoothly once the ash clouds clear. According to the latest forecasts, high-density ash could begin to affect southern England by Friday. Ryanair, Europe&apos;s largest short-haul airline, condemned the new regulatory regime today. Its one-hour test flight took off from Glasgow Prestwick, then flew to Inverness, on to Aberdeen and down to Edinburgh \u2013 all of which, according to CAA charts, were in a zone of high concentration of ash. In a direct challenge to the efficiency of the safety regime, Ryanair urged the Irish and UK regulators to &quot;reopen&quot; airspace over Scotland. Ryanair said in a statement: &quot;There was no visible volcanic ash cloud or any other presence of volcanic ash, and the post-flight inspection revealed no evidence of volcanic ash on the airframe, wings or engines. &quot;The absence of any volcanic ash in the atmosphere supports Ryanair&apos;s stated view that there is no safety threat to aircraft in this mythical &apos;red zone&apos;, which is another misguided invention by the UK Met Office and the CAA.&quot; Regulators, including the CAA, are likely to object to Ryanair&apos;s claim that Scottish airspace is &quot;shut&quot;, because airlines can fly through medium or high ash concentrations, providing they make a sufficient safety case. The Irish Aviation Authority added to the confusion by stating that Ryanair&apos;s first application for safety approval had to be sent back to the carrier on Monday for unspecified reasons, and a tweaked proposal was still under consideration. An IAA spokeswoman said: &quot;They are not cleared to fly. We have not had time to analyse the safety case and until that is done they do not have permission to fly [in contaminated airspace].&quot; The International Air Transport Association (IATA) also joined Ryanair in condemning the approach of regulators. In a letter to the transport secretary, Philip Hammond, the airline industry&apos;s main lobbying body claimed the CAA&apos;s monitoring plane is not in use and there is no spare. As a result, the CAA has not monitored the density of the cloud from the air. In a robust letter to Hammond, the chief executive of IATA, Giovanni Bisignani, said: &quot;It is astonishing and unacceptable that Her Majesty&apos;s government cashes \u00a33.5bn each year in air passenger duty but is incapable of using a small portion of that revenue to purchase another Cessna to use as a backup aircraft. I ask please that you ensure that all possible efforts are made to get the existing aircraft operational in the shortest possible time.&quot; Bisignani added that non-European airlines could be confused by the ash cloud because their regulators would be insufficiently aware of the latest EU guidelines on flying through volcanic plumes. &quot;We need a clear, consistent and appropriate response, which is workable for all airlines globally, not a repeat of the fragmented mess that happened last year.&quot; Pointedly, the chief executives of British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and bmi were cc&apos;d into the letter. Under previous guidelines, aircraft were summarily grounded if there was any volcanic ash in the air; airlines may now fly through ash plumes if they can demonstrate their fleets can handle medium- or high-level densities of ash. Meanwhile, passengers at Glasgow airport were preparing for long delays in reaching some destinations. Elizabeth Flaherty, from East Kilbride, was hoping to travel to Mallorca at 8.30am. She arrived at the airport just before 6am to be told her flight would not be leaving. She said she had been told a coach would take her to Manchester at 12.45pm for a flight at around 5pm. She said: &quot;It&apos;s going to be a long day. I&apos;m trying to stay cheerful. There&apos;s nothing else I can do.&quot; Pat Gribbon, from Renfrew, was due on the same flight for a holiday with his wife, Rita. He said: &quot;Everyone has been very helpful. It&apos;s just a question of waiting. &quot;I suppose it&apos;s just one of those things. No one can help it, but it is frustrating. I feel sorry for people with kids.&quot; The Met Office&apos;s volcanic ash advisory centre is tracking the cloud, aided by satellite images, weather balloons and a radar system installed in Iceland last year. Once information is relayed to airlines, they will need to prove they can fly through the zones by producing &quot;safety cases&quot; that will include information from aircraft and engine manufacturers on the airline&apos;s tolerance to volcanic ash. Ryanair was seeking an urgent meeting with Irish aviation authorities on Tuesday, saying it had been told late on Monday that it could not operate flights to Scottish destinations until at least Tuesday afternoon. &quot;Ryanair believe that there is no safety risk to aircraft on fights operating to and from Scotland,&quot; the company said.", "sentences": ["A number of flights from Newcastle international airport have been cancelled, including services to Paris, Brussels, Faro, Amsterdam, Aberdeen, Belfast international and Malta.", "Arrivals to Newcastle from Aberdeen, Amsterdam and Exeter have also been cancelled."], "title": "Volcanic ash cloud: airlines challenge rulings by aviation regulators", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/24/volcanic-ash-cloud-airlines-regulators", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2011 (Grimsvotn)", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Iceland", "World news", "Airline industry", "Business", "Air transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Transport policy", "Politics", "Ryanair", "easyJet", "Volcanoes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-24T16:56:36Z", "article": "Airline passengers should be spared disruption from the ash cloud threatening to disrupt UK airspace on Wednesday according to Met Office forecasts, as airlines accused regulatory authorities of mishandling a volcanic eruption for the second time in 13 months. A dense plume from the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn volcano in Iceland that forced the cancellation of more than 250 flights in Scotland and northern England on Tuesday will have dissipated by Wednesday, the Met Office said, aided by volatile weather and less explosive eruptions from Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn. Scottish airports were the worst affected on Tuesday, accounting for the majority of the 252 cancellations announced by Eurocontrol, the air traffic control body whose members handle about 29,000 flights per day throughout the continent. A Met Office spokesman said the thickest concentrations of ash, which airlines still cannot fly through, will have drifted across the North Sea by 6am on Wednesday, allowing airlines to resume normal services. &quot;High concentrations of ash will be moving towards Germany, Holland and Denmark.&quot; The spokesman said windy and wet weather was helping to disperse the particles, unlike last April when the UK was caught in a dead calm of high pressure that prevented dispersal of a cloud from Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallajokull volcano. &quot;The weather is much more dynamic. There is a succession of high and low pressure areas [creating wind] coming across the Atlantic and there is a lot of rain that tends to wash out the pollutants.&quot; The Met Office rejected claims by Ryanair that it had put out &quot;mythical&quot; weather charts that erroneously placed dense ash clouds over Scotland throughout much of yesterday, citing evidence of ash falls in Glasgow, Kirkwall airport and a ship travelling between Iceland and Scotland. &quot;We have seen lots of evidence from various sources that the ash is present across Scotland and fits in with the computer models that we are running continually.

The centre will host the biggest exhibition in the UK for 40 years on the Bauhaus design school, which flourished in the 1920s and early 30s. &quot;In 2012, London welcomes the world for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the Barbican will be at the forefront of that international moment with an extraordinary range of cultural experiences for all,&quot; said Barbican director Sir Nicholas Kenyon. He predicted that London will &quot;punch above its weight&quot; in the arts festival, and promised &quot;something for everyone&quot;, both within the concrete bunker of its Barbican home and in many events across the capital. &quot;This is not an imported rent-a-festival that is happening all through the world. It is a real collection of things that we believe in that represent the Barbican values.&quot; Kenyon can afford his starry spending spree because the Barbican \u2013 whose core funding comes from the City of London \u2013 will receive a special grant of \u00a3700,000 from the London Olympics organisers to join the nationwide arts festival planned to coincide with the Games. The Barbican also pulled off a funding coup recognising its eclectic programming \u2013 which is both popular and critically acclaimed \u2013 when it won a substantial increase in Arts Council funding at a time when hundreds of other organisations were being slashed. Programme director Louise Jeffreys said the Barbican represented the Bauhaus principles in breaking down divisions between art forms. &quot;We continue to push forward the pioneering spirit. In 2012 stars of stage and screen will rub shoulders with first-timers, international artists will meet local people, and the traditional will meet the new.&quot; The Bauhaus exhibition, Art as Life, will track the design school from its founding in 1919 by Walter Gropius, to its last director, the architect Mies van der Rohe, and its forced closure in 1933 by the Nazis, who detested its radical modernist ethos. The exhibition will include painting, sculpture, film, photography, textiles, ceramics and architecture. French film star Binoche, who made an acclaimed debut on the London stage at the National Theatre in a dance piece with the choreographer Akram Khan, will return in a more conventional acting role, in Mademoiselle Julie, a new version \u2013 in French \u2013 of August Strindberg&apos;s play about seething class and sexual tensions, with costumes by couture house Lanvin. The Australian actor Cate Blanchett, star of the 1998 film Elizabeth \u2013 and better known to a younger audience as Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings \u2013 returns to the London stage after 13 years in a new version by the British playwright Martin Crimp of the German play Gross und Klein, in the role of a lonely wife implausibly deserted by her husband. The show will be a co-production between the Barbican and the Sydney theatre company Blanchett runs with her husband. Co-productions are a feature of the programme: the Barbican is getting together with Sadler&apos;s Wells for the first time to bring in one of the most acclaimed dance companies in the world, the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch in a month-long season across the two venues. Classical stars include the New York Philharmonic, the Concertgebouw orchestra from Amsterdam, and the Kronos quartet, which will also play a concert at the Hackney Empire in east London. Ninagawa, renowned for his take on Shakespeare, will direct a new version of Cymbeline in Japanese, and the theatre season will also include a major new production by Simon McBurney for the Complicite company.

He stretches out his legs for the day and gazes at the London skyline as he thinks of his fridge back home in Pretoria. &quot;I&apos;ve got a little calendar on my fridge door and I&apos;m ticking off the days until London 2012. That&apos;s why I know we&apos;re down to less than 430. It&apos;s really getting close now.&quot; Pistorius laughs but it seems striking that he should highlight the fact that 428 days are left before the start of the London Olympics. As an athlete known as the Blade Runner, as the multiple Paralympic record-holder and serial gold medal winner, it might be assumed Pistorius would concentrate on a different opening ceremony. But the South African is determined to make history next year by becoming the first disabled athlete to compete in both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. He knows that 461 days remain before the Paralympics because Pistorius also aims to surpass his achievement in Beijing where, in 2008, he won three golds. &quot;I&apos;m excited about running the 4x100m relay,&quot; he says of a fourth medal chance to supplement his individual events in the\u00a0100m, 200m and, his best race, the 400m. &quot;I ran it for the first time at the Paralympic world championships this January. We only practised for 20 minutes but ended up five\u2011hundredths of a second off the world record. The relay could be a big highlight.&quot; At those championships Pistorius lost a 100m race for the first time in seven years \u2013 to his closest rival, Jerome Singleton. He responded magnificently and, in March, achieved the 400m Olympic &quot;B&quot; qualifying mark of 45.61sec. Over the next month, beginning on Friday at the BT\u00a0Paralympic World Cup in Manchester, he plans to run the &quot;A&quot; qualifying time of 45.25 which would guarantee automatic entry into the Olympics. &quot;I&apos;m on track to achieve it and the closer we get to it the hungrier I am. I&apos;ve improved by nearly half a second over the last year so I really should make it. The ability is there \u2013 and so is the focus. Last week in training I ran a 10.99 in the 100m. So I&apos;d like to go under 11 in Manchester as it hasn&apos;t been in done in five years. It would send a message back to Jerome: &apos;What&apos;s up buddy? Come out and play.&apos;&quot; An extraordinary story began in November 1986 when a baby was born in Johannesburg. Oscar Pistorius was perfect from his chubby thighs up to his bright little brain. But he had a genetic disorder in both his legs. Each was missing its fibula, the long bone running from below the knee joint and down to the ankle. His parents confronted a stark choice. Should they prepare their child for a life in a wheelchair or could they face sanctioning a double amputation? When Oscar was 11 months old Henke and Sheila Pistorius decided on amputation. A South African surgeon, Gerry Versveld, successfully severed both legs and, within six months, a tottering toddler took his first step on a set of fibreglass pegs. Oscar&apos;s childhood was still bookended by heartache; his parents divorced when he was six and, far more devastatingly, his mother died when he was just 15. But he developed startling self-belief as, inspired by his mother, he played rugby, water polo and tennis not far below junior provincial standard. He only discovered running after he had been injured in a rugby match. During rehab he showed a rare talent for sprinting on prosthetic legs. Pistorius competed at his first Paralympics in Athens eight months later. Aged 17 in 2004 he just lost the 100m final but won gold in the 200m. He might have made it to the Beijing Olympics in 2008 had he not been banned by the IAAF the year before. Showing the same insensitivity it would exhibit in 2009, during the gender furore surrounding Caster Semenya, who trains at the same Pretoria track as Pistorius, the IAAF stooped to spying on him and then announced its tests proved his &quot;blades&quot; provided an unfair advantage over able-bodied athletes. Pistorius refused to buckle. He gathered some renowned scientists around him and coolly demolished the IAAF case at the court of arbitration for sport. He was granted permission to run in world and Olympic competition. &quot;I thought I&apos;d be ecstatic,&quot; Pistorius remembers, &quot;but it was more a case that at last I could get back to doing what I&apos;m meant to be doing. The IAAF and I are getting on quite nicely now.&quot; Convinced that he will face no further legal challenges, he reacts with interest when told that David James, a sports engineer at Sheffield Hallam University, still argues that Pristorius&apos;s &quot;Cheetah Flex-Foot&quot; blades give him a &quot;distinct advantage&quot; over the last half of a 400m race. James appears to ignore the glaring disadvantage Pistorius encounters over the first 200m when, without ankles to power him from the blocks, his passive blades are of limited use. Instead, James suggests that advances in modern technology could lead to someone, wearing high-tech blades, running 100m in 8sec by 2016. Pistorius, who has little hope of making a 400m Olympic final, acknowledges the rocketing rate of technology. &quot;You probably could run 100m in eight seconds \u2013 because people are coming up with pretty radical ideas. But they&apos;d never be legal. Whenever we make any modifications we have to send it to the IAAF. We have to submit the design, and explain the reasons for the modified composition, and then they test it and say whether or not it&apos;s fine. We can&apos;t just slap on changes and turn up to race.&quot; Has Pistorius tried out any radical designs \u2013 just for fun? &quot;The prosthetic companies we work with are medically based. They&apos;re not trying anything superhuman. But they do cool stuff with feet. One company makes an advanced foot worth thousands of pounds. It can make 55 readings a second so if you&apos;re walking uphill it senses the incline and lifts the [prosthetic] foot higher. It also has a USB in it, which I noticed when they asked me to test it.&quot; Pistorius cackles mischievously. &quot;I plugged my iPod into it and this scientist [in Reykjavik] came in. They&apos;re very serious and he shouted: &apos;No! You can&apos;t do that!&apos; I said: &apos;Listen, you should put a memory stick in here and I could load my music into my leg.&apos; I thought it was quite funny; he didn&apos;t. So I took it out but it had charged my iPod. That night we went for dinner and I still had these feet on. I was relaxed and had my legs crossed at the ankles. But, when it was time to leave, it turned out that the batteries in the one foot had gone flat. It wouldn&apos;t move and, of course, this was the foot that had charged my iPod.&quot; He tells various airport anecdotes about the trouble he has run into with his legs. &quot;At Heathrow the security guys thought my legs were rocket launchers. The worst was in Amsterdam [when Pistorius was suspected of being an international terrorist and handcuffed]. My phone was flat and I&apos;d packed my wallet in my luggage so I couldn&apos;t call anyone or buy any food. In the end they&apos;d only let me go if I got an affidavit from the police station \u2013 and I&apos;d just told the police exactly what I thought of them. I had to go back and say: &apos;Sorry, I really didn&apos;t mean it \u2013 and can I have an affidavit now?&apos;&quot; Pistorius has also fallen on the track. &quot;We&apos;ve had serious training accidents. Once a bolt came off the back of my leg. The guy who had changed the alignment on my leg had put in a different bolt and it was too short. The bolt stripped out and I hit the deck at 45kmh. The tartan is really dirty and disgusting and I had chunks of it in me.&quot; How did Pistorius cope when even bigger chunks were taken out of him? &quot;Fifteen is a tough age to lose your mother. It&apos;s strange. In her will she said we must throw a party when she passed away and so we did. We celebrate her every year but we [his brother and sister] make an issue of not calling each other that day and being all morbid. The way we handle her loss is that we&apos;re more grateful for the time we had with her. My father wasn&apos;t around much when we grew up. I saw him seldom \u2013 and it&apos;s the same now. He lives and works very far from me on a dolomite mine.&quot; Do they talk on the phone? &quot;Mmmm, not much. We chat about once a month. He&apos;s a cool guy but he&apos;s more of a mate. He&apos;s not much of a parent. It&apos;s just life.&quot; Pistorius shows the kind of bracing courage which attracts the glittering eye of Hollywood. Tom Hanks has, supposedly, long been beguiled by the Afrikaner&apos;s Blade Runner story. &quot;Oh, the movie stuff,&quot; Pistorius shrugs. &quot;I enjoy my privacy and so that&apos;s something I never wanted \u2013 to be famous. And I like to think the story of my life is not yet over.&quot; He is already a remarkable athlete but, over the next 475 days, Pistorius might become a truly iconic sporting figure. As he strives to burst on to the Olympic stage with even greater impact than he has achieved as a Paralympian, the 24-year-old is aware of wider responsibilities. &quot;One of my goals is to educate people about disability. I go to a shopping centre after training in my shorts and a kid will stare at my prosthetic legs. The mother or father turns the kid&apos;s face away and says: &apos;Don&apos;t stare.&apos; But they don&apos;t take time to explain it. So I&apos;ll go up to the kid and say, &apos;My name&apos;s Oscar and I&apos;ve got these really cool legs. My own legs got bitten off by this huge shark.&apos; If the mother&apos;s good looking, I&apos;ll say: &apos;They fell off because I didn&apos;t eat my vegetables.&apos; Then I&apos;ll explain it so the next time they see prosthetic legs it won&apos;t be so weird. My disability has never been a negative because the way other people perceive you is the way you perceive yourself.&quot; Pistorius rightly regards himself as a future Olympic athlete \u2013 and a Paralympic champion. &quot;That&apos;s how I want to be seen. I don&apos;t want to be treated differently to any other athlete. If I do badly in a competition I want people to be honest. The same goes if I do well. That&apos;s the only thing that motivates me \u2013 the fact that I&apos;m an athlete. I&apos;m a runner.&quot; Oscar Pistorius is a BT ambassador.

After completing a diploma in fine art, I decided to choose a different career path and decided on fashion. As someone who has always been passionate about clothing both inside and out of work, it seemed like the perfect career for me. Post my diploma, I studied fashion design at university. As part of my course, I took part in Graduate Fashion Week 2009 where I debuted my final year collection. I was fortunate to win the Portfolio Award \u2013 an award that commends the designs and ideas in your portfolio. My collection was conceptual and colourful and I think this really helped me to stand out. Winning this award gave me great exposure and the chance to show my work to industry directors. My boss Fiona Lambert (brand director at George) has been a mentor at GFW for a number of years so I was delighted the show gave her the chance to see my designs. On the back of Fiona seeing my work, I was invited to an interview at George, which ultimately led to me being offered the position of assistant designer. This year George is the main title sponsor of Graduate Fashion Week 2011 and I&apos;ll be at the event on the George stand offering advice to graduates about working in fashion. It&apos;s so nice I can come back and be a part of GFW as it really helped to launch my career. Although it&apos;s not imperative to study a specifically fashion-led degree to succeed in the world of fashion, having a creative degree helped as it&apos;s a good platform for a job as a designer and teaches you skills such as how to use programmes including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I use these programmes almost every day when illustrating and sketching my designs. Most fashion companies worldwide use this software so it&apos;s worthwhile taking time to learn it if you haven&apos;t already. It also helped choosing a university course that included a one-year industry placement \u2013 I worked for a supplier in London which taught me the skills I now use on a daily basis. I learnt time-management, how to work under pressure and how to communicate effectively \u2013 something really important as it&apos;s imperative I explain my ideas clearly and fluidly. For anyone wanting to get into design, I&apos;d advise making sure you have a vibrant portfolio that shows a broad range of design and drawing skills, always show enthusiasm for any job you are working on, work very hard and keep your mind open for ideas to flow. As an assistant designer, I get to be creative, designing the shapes for garments, choosing fabrics etc, which I love. But it&apos;s also important to keep in line with forthcoming fashion trends and the commercial strategy and direction of the George business. A very important aspect of my job is identifying and researching &quot;of-the-moment&quot; trends. I&apos;m constantly scouring trend books and magazines and going to festivals to see what everyone&apos;s wearing, which is fun as well as helpful to my role. Nautical has been a strong trend over the last few seasons and I&apos;ve included this in many of my designs \u2013 it&apos;s a great look as kids love it and so do mums. I always think a designer must be able to think fast and react to new trends so that you&apos;re delivering what your customer wants and needs \u2013 you must remember when designing not to design for yourself but design for your target audience. We often visit stores to speak to the customer directly to gain their feedback and gauge exactly what they are looking for. It&apos;s essential you have a good eye for colour \u2013 understanding which colours work well together and which colours are suited to which fabrics and so forth. I couldn&apos;t do my job without it. One of the many highlights of my job is that I get to travel abroad and visit various cities in England too. It&apos;s essential that designers go overseas to find inspiration for new designs. In my department, we find a lot of our inspiration in Amsterdam where the clothing is bright and urban. But Barcelona, Paris and London are also good places to spot new trends. Working as an assistant designer for George is my dream job \u2013 it is hard work and can be challenging at times, but it&apos;s a great place to be. There&apos;s a real buzz at the moment too as George is celebrating its 21st birthday on 26 May. It&apos;s a great landmark \u2013 as the pioneer of supermarket fashion, it&apos;s a true testament to how far the brand has come. I feel very lucky to be a part of it.Dulcie Dryden is assistant designer at George at Asda To get more content and advice like this - including links to forthcoming Q&amp;As - direct to your inbox, you can now sign up for our weekly Careers update.", "sentences": ["In my department, we find a lot of our inspiration in Amsterdam where the clothing is bright and urban."], "title": "Behind the job title: assistant fashion designer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/assistant-fashion-designer-first-job", "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "All sectors", "Graduate", "Jobs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-27T23:08:00Z", "article": "Guus Hiddink has waived an opportunity to commit his long-term future to the Turkey national team, with Chelsea&apos;s principal managerial target admitting he would consider any &quot;concrete offer&quot; for his services. The 64-year-old said his focus remains fixed on next Friday&apos;s Euro 2012 qualifier in Belgium, a game Turkey, third in Group A, can ill afford to lose. Yet Chelsea are confident they can secure Hiddink&apos;s release from the final 12 months of his contract, and the Turkish Football Federation&apos;s resolve to retain the Dutchman will be tested after the match in Brussels. On Friday Hiddink declined to speak explicitly about Chelsea, where he enjoyed a three-month spell as caretaker manager in 2009, but suggested he would be eager to return to day-to-day club management. &quot;At the moment there&apos;s nothing concrete to talk about, but if there was a concrete offer I would think about it,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ll play this game and then we&apos;ll see. The moment things are concrete, I&apos;ll go to where I have to be. My thoughts are, first, on this difficult game next Friday. Then we&apos;ll see. &quot;I have the energy. I&apos;m not feeling that I should sit back. As long as I feel fresh, and as long as young people \u2013 players \u2013 are not getting annoyed with me, then I will continue. I feel energetic to go on. Sir Alex Ferguson is a lesson to all of us. I read that his wife told him to get back to work, not just to sit there in the garden and do nothing. You should only walk away if you start repeating yourself and can&apos;t keep it fresh. But I don&apos;t feel like that at this moment. And my wife thinks I&apos;m a lousy gardener.&quot; Hiddink is understood to earn around \u00a33.5m a year and is overseeing a week-long training camp in his native Netherlands ahead of the Belgium game. He has not held a permanent position at a club since leaving PSV Eindhoven in 2006 for roles with Australia, Russia and now Turkey. His brief spell at Chelsea, as an interim manager following Luiz Felipe Scolari&apos;s dismissal in February 2009, was combined with his duties with Russia, although that arrangement could not be repeated. &quot;That was an exceptional situation,&quot; he said. &quot;Roman Abramovich was also supporting Russian football very strongly so, when they asked me to jump in for that period, we spoke with the president of the federation in Russia and all agreed. But you must only do one job.&quot; Turkey would not countenance a similar job-share over the final season of his current contract. His tenure with the TFF has been far from spectacular and there was fierce criticism after a qualifying defeat to Azerbaijan. He has retained the support of the TFF president, Mahmut Ozgener, though the federation is due to hold a presidential election in mid-June. Defeat in Belgium, which would leave the Turks four points adrift of the group&apos;s play-off place, would prompt calls for Hiddink to be dismissed. &quot;I have a good relationship with the president,&quot; said the Dutchman, who commutes to and from Istanbul from his home in Amsterdam. &quot;He&apos;s a very modern-thinking guy, and we always talk when needed, every fortnight. Whatever happens in the elections, my focus will remain on winning. &quot;But the reaction here is rather up and down and, should we lose, I can imagine they would say it would be better if I quit. As they did when we lost to Germany and Azerbaijan. There are rumours, too, that it would be easier for me to leave if we lost to Belgium, but I&apos;ve been in this business a long time. That is not influencing my approach to the team. The focus is on the job and this game. That&apos;s it.&quot; The squad are already familiar with Hiddink, who has acted as an adviser to Abramovich on an ad hoc and unpaid basis since leaving Stamford Bridge in 2009, a loose arrangement he also enjoys with PSV. &quot;The people at Chelsea, including the Boss (Abramovich), were always welcoming after I left,&quot; he added. &quot;So, every now and then, we have contact.&quot; The 2010 Premier League champions, who are looking for the seventh manager of Abramovich&apos;s eight-year ownership, dismissed Ancelotti after a trophyless season. They would prefer to secure Hiddink as a manager to oversee what will be a summer of relative upheaval at Stamford Bridge, potentially with the prospect of him becoming a director of football at some stage in the future with a younger coach recruited beneath him.", "sentences": ["&quot;I have a good relationship with the president,&quot; said the Dutchman, who commutes to and from Istanbul from his home in Amsterdam."], "title": "Guus Hiddink will consider 'concrete offer' if Chelsea come calling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/28/guus-hiddink-chelsea-turkey", "tags": ["Guus Hiddink", "Chelsea", "Turkey", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-28T07:00:02Z", "article": "Even a man as addicted to conflict as Sir Alex Ferguson knows there is no point in picking a pre-match quarrel with as civilised and courteous an opponent as Pep Guardiola ahead of Saturday&apos;s European Cup final. It is possible to get under Guardiola&apos;s skin, as we saw in his exasperated response to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s taunts before the first leg of Barcelona&apos;s semi-final with Real Madrid last month, but the exchange had only one winner, and it was not the Portuguese provocateur. Perhaps that explains Ferguson&apos;s sotto voce threat to ban the journalist who dared to mention Ryan Giggs at the first of this week&apos;s press conferences. Sotto voce, or stage whisper? Was he consciously inserting a bit of grit into the contest, to dispel the possibility of blandness in the run-up to the biggest night of the year? This is, after all, a man who has worked so hard to create a siege mentality that whereas the whole of England \u2013 even the whole of the British Isles, given the nationalities of George Best, Denis Law, Pat Crerand, Tony Dunne and Shay Brennan \u2013 stood behind United when they faced Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final, four decades later a large part of the country will be cheering for Barcelona, and not just because the Catalan club is held to represent the forces of footballing enlightenment. History is in the bones of this meeting at Wembley. Two of the three biggest and richest football clubs in the world will be fighting over the most coveted trophy available to them, on the pitch where each of them experienced the euphoric release of winning it for the first time. This, too, is an occasion relished more than any other by the game&apos;s connoisseurs. Only the naive switch on a World Cup final anticipating a feast of football, as last July&apos;s disfigured contest in Soccer City confirmed. But when the players of Barcelona and Manchester United walk out to compete for the European Cup, they will be expected to provide football of the highest quality. That special optimism dates back to Real Madrid&apos;s domination over the early years of the tournament, when Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and his colleagues opened the eyes of a generation to the beauty that footballers could create. Half a century later, the trophy glitters with a lustre imparted by the individual contributions of Eus\u00e9bio, Johan Cruyff, Gerd M\u00fcller, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten. Human nature and football being what they are, the expectation of quality is not always met. Red Star Belgrade&apos;s victory over Olympique Marseille after a penalty shootout in Bari is remembered 20 years later with a shudder, and few outside Italy and England can have enjoyed Milan&apos;s win over Juventus at Old Trafford in 2003 or Manchester United&apos;s joyless tussle with Chelsea in Moscow in 2008, two sterile games ultimately settled by the same agonising method. Ferguson, who was among the 135,000 at Hampden Park in May 1960 when Real Madrid scored seven goals to Eintracht Frankfurt&apos;s three, has a keener understanding than most of the moral requirements that also form an integral part of Guardiola&apos;s Barcelona heritage. Both clubs are acutely aware that the winners will move up a rung in the tournament&apos;s all-time table, joining Ajax Amsterdam and Bayern Munich on a total of four wins, below Real Madrid (nine), Milan (seven) and Liverpool (five). At their level, these things matter a great deal. But so do the countless subplots, chief among which must be Ferguson&apos;s desire, midway through his 70th year, to take his revenge on the man on the adjacent bench. When Barcelona comfortably defeated United in Rome two years ago, Guardiola had been in the job not quite 12 months. Ferguson will not want another lesson in tactical composure from a man 30 years his junior, however respectful he may be. United began that last final with an exhilarating charge that produced five shots and a series of nervous errors from Barcelona&apos;s defenders in the first nine minutes. Then Samuel Eto&apos;o broke away to prod the ball past Edwin van der Sar and the match was as good as settled a full hour before Lionel Messi looped his cunning header over United&apos;s horrified goalkeeper to complete the scoreline in a match that ended with a flurry of yellow cards for the frustrated losers. Barcelona, it is said, are even better now: more compact, more controlled and controlling, and routinely able to command more than 70% of possession, allowing their skilful players to rest on the ball while their opponents are driven to distraction and exhaustion. A personal belief, close to heresy in the current climate, is that while all this is demonstrably true, the present side lack the extra dimension provided in the last season or two of Frank Rijkaard&apos;s time at the Camp Nou by the presence alongside Messi of Eto&apos;o, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry, whose unpredictability and breakaway pace constituted a pretty useful Plan B. David Villa and Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, Messi&apos;s accomplices in Guardiola&apos;s current team, are accomplished finishers, their skills finely integrated into the attacking labyrinth created by Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Sergio Busquets. But on the rare occasions when the current Barcelona find themselves in a tactical stalemate, they have problems conjuring an alternative approach. Before Ferguson&apos;s players can hope to profit from such a situation, they must first create the stalemate. Lying awake in recent weeks, the manager&apos;s principal concern must have been the centre of his midfield. Should he play two men there, with two others wide and two up front, or try a straight match-up with Barcelona&apos;s trio? The key figures will be Giggs, a far more effective player now than the one who endured a rotten night in Rome, Michael Carrick, who seems to have recovered some of the qualities that persuaded United to invest \u00a318m five years ago, and Darren Fletcher, a Ferguson favourite for big matches. Fletcher, whose absence from the 2009 final through suspension was a key factor in United&apos;s failure to compete with Barcelona, missed most of March and all of April with a &quot;mystery virus&quot;. The 27-year-old Scot returned to play the last 20 minutes of the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Schalke on 4 May, and was given the whole 90 minutes against Blackpool last Sunday. He seems to have lost weight from his already lean frame, but if he is anywhere near full fitness Ferguson will rely on his driving energy and anticipation of danger to disrupt Barcelona&apos;s web-spinning before it gets going. A combination of Carrick, two months away from his 30th birthday, and the 37-year-old Giggs would not appear to present as formidable a barrier to the Catalans. It was good enough to see off Chelsea in both legs of the quarter-final and in the crucial Premier League meeting at Old Trafford a month ago, but Chelsea are not Barcelona. While Ferguson prefers to add a little spice to his preparations and makes a science of rotating his squad, Guardiola operates in the most serene and stable of environments. Whereas several options of formation and selection are still open to Ferguson, only last-minute injuries would disrupt Barcelona&apos;s plans. A lack of self-confidence will not be their problem; an excess of it could be. Even the humblest player might be affected by a couple of years of being told, by the credulous and the sycophantic, that he is a part of the best football team ever put on earth. If anything threatens the spectacle, it is the habit, common to both teams, of putting the referee under pressure. Viktor Kassai, the 35-year-old Hungarian official, may need to call on almost a decade of international experience as he is surrounded by players \u2013 one or two of them older than him \u2013 demanding favourable decisions and waving imaginary cards. This is Wembley&apos;s sixth European Cup final, to follow those of 1963 (won by Milan), 1968 (Busby&apos;s United), 1971 (Ajax), 1978 (Liverpool) and 1992 (Barcelona). But it is the first at the new stadium, the most expensive ever built to house football, its giant illuminated arch replacing the old twin towers as the venue&apos;s signature. With a minimum ticket price of \u00a380, and hospitality suites going for \u00a345,000, the match cannot help but symbolise football&apos;s new realities.

An investigation into the services found they gave wildly different results, and in some cases arrived at medical predictions that were no better than flipping a coin. The findings of the Dutch study will bolster calls for tighter regulations around personalised genetics tests which can cost more than \u00a3500. Critics claim the tests are a waste of money that could mislead people about their future health. According to the group at Erasmus University medical centre in Rotterdam, tests from rival companies predicted conflicting risks for some diseases, often because they disagreed on how common the conditions were in the general population. Another flaw was that the tests looked only at genetic factors, whereas many diseases are governed more by lifestyle and other environmental factors. In the study, researchers used a computer to simulate genetic information for 100,000 typical people. They then used formulas from two of the largest genetic testing companies, deCODEme and 23andMe, to predict the risk of eight medical conditions, including heart attack, prostate cancer, coeliac disease, an eye disease known as age-related macular degeneration and diabetes. &quot;When we looked at individual risk of disease, we saw enormous differences between the two companies,&quot; said Cecile Janssens, an epidemiologist who led the research. &quot;A major problem with these tests is that they don&apos;t take other factors into account, such as your age, diet, exercise and whether you smoke, which in most cases have a greater impact on disease risk. &quot;For complex diseases, if you ignore these non-genetic factors, you are looking at only a small part of the picture and missing the main story,&quot; she said. While the companies used similar techniques to predict an individual&apos;s risk of disease, the test results differed in some cases by more than 50 percentage points. A number of tests based on deCODEme risk models appeared to suggest the odds of developing five disorders, including age-related macular degeneration, were greater than 100%, a result that in itself raised concerns over the validity of the tests, the researchers will tell the European Human Genetics Conference in Amsterdam . But Kari Stef\u00e1nsson, the chief executive of deCODEme, said the Dutch team had misinterpreted the computer models their findings were based. &quot;We never report a lifetime risk over 90%. This is not how we use these models.&quot; Brian Naughton, founding scientist at 23andMe said: &quot;We are aware that most people will be at low risk for most diseases \u2013 this is what we expect, and is not an indication of inaccuracy. &quot;23andMe takes extensive measures to provide both accuracy and to highlight the context for relevance at all steps in the process of analyzing and presenting data. In addition, research undertaken by 23andMe seeks to expand relevant findings. &quot;Lastly, 23andMe cautions that conclusions regarding 23andMe&apos;s accuracy and relevance should not be based on review of deCode or others.&quot;", "sentences": ["A number of tests based on deCODEme risk models appeared to suggest the odds of developing five disorders, including age-related macular degeneration, were greater than 100%, a result that in itself raised concerns over the validity of the tests, the researchers will tell the European Human Genetics Conference in Amsterdam ."], "title": "Genetics tests flawed and inaccurate, say Dutch scientists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/30/genetics-tests-flawed-dutch-scientists", "tags": ["Genetics", "Controversies", "Science", "Health", "Society", "UK news", "Netherlands", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-05-31T11:31:23Z", "article": "Live coverage of the Social Capital Markets conference in Amsterdam   [View the story \"Social Capital Markets\" on Storify] ", "sentences": ["Live coverage of the Social Capital Markets conference in Amsterdam   [View the story \"Social Capital Markets\" on Storify] "], "title": "Live: Social Capital Markets conference", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2011/may/31/live-socap-conference-storify", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Social enterprise"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-01T15:46:51Z", "article": "If there&apos;s one city in Europe that seems to be in the vanguard of energy-efficiency, it&apos;s Amsterdam.\u00a0The Amsterdam Smart City initiative is held up as the example of how to retrofit a city to improve living and economic conditions and reduce carbon emissions. But, Ger Baron, who leads the initiative, admits that the city&apos;s emissions are rising by 1% a year and are on track to have risen by 30% by 2025 against 1990 levels. That puts its ambition to reduce emissions by 40% by 2025 into the clear light of day.\u00a0Is it achievable? Baron joined me and a range of other business and government leaders to debate the future of cities in a live online global sustainability forum.\u00a0The starting point appears bleak.\u00a0Sabrina Soussan of Siemens Building Technologies told us that cities generate 80% of global emissions and account for 75% of the world&apos;s energy consumption. But as Paul James, director of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Cities programme, said, that doesn&apos;t mean that cities are the problem. In a world increasingly urbanised, they have to be the solution, the &quot;basis of possibility&quot;, given their concentration of skills, finance, technology and efficient forms of production, transportation and living. He pointed to two key factors driving progress: for the first time we are seeing systematic integration within cities and technologies helping to distribute energy generation and management, resulting in lower-level governance. Much of the cities talk is about smart technologies: smart grids, smart buildings, water systems and intelligent transport.\u00a0But it&apos;s clear that they cannot be seen in isolation. All too often, fragmented projects \u2013 often of a prestige kind \u2013 have resulted in unsustainable and costly ventures. Central to the success of intelligent cities is an open platform that unites all government departments, services and technologies. It is important that we don&apos;t focus entirely on the technology, but on outcomes and consumer and citizen engagement. Clara Gaymard, CEO of General Electric France, gave the example of transport management in Lyon, where consumer research revealed that drivers were as equally interested in reducing emissions as cutting their commute time. The intelligent management of traffic circulation could reduce fuel consumption by 50%, she claims.\u00a0 The idea of communicating with consumers via mobile technology to let them know when to leave their home is therefore the kind of solution that is required. In Amsterdam, children are encouraged to share an interest in reducing domestic emissions with cartoon-based applications that make energy efficiency fun and engaging. And a &quot;smart working network&quot;, building on the principles of cloud computing, encourages businesses to share their redundant space and even telepresence facilities to improve efficiencies. This has had spin-off benefits in the form of creating new virtual communities that did not exist before. The UNGC&apos;s Paul James struck a cautionary note about the use of apparently green solutions and about the pressure to act in response to the various external forces, whether they be regulations, carbon taxes or public expectations. For instance, it would be perfectly reasonable for people to expect that Melbourne, one of the most livable cities in the world, would race to introduce electric vehicles. But given the expansion of the city and its dependence of the local economy on brown coal, EVs are not likely to reduce emissions, but increase them in that city. He reminded participants that we don&apos;t need just smart technologies, but smart people. And smart people need to build in time, money and space for failure.\u00a0Gaymard reminded delegates that we must be prepared for the failure of electric vehicle projects in some places.\u00a0New technologies and entirely new forms of cross-sector collaboration will not always function and will not always gain consumer traction.\u00a0We are in for a long period of experimentation. So what are the guiding principles for the creation of successful intelligent cities? I would concur with Philippe Delorme of Schneider Electric, who joined our panel and who pointed to the need for public leadership to incentivise private sector involvement, collaboration between sectors on standards for processes and technologies, and ownership by consumers and users of the new solutions that are being developed.\u00a0So even though Amsterdam has a long way to go, these are the reasons why we should hold it up as an example to the world.

It does this by transforming the bases on which we make decisions about our health and how we engage with health professionals.  In a medical model of health, we are patients carrying descriptions of pain and dysfunction with the expectation of an expert opinion on how these are to be reduced or removed. In a social model of health, we move from patient to activist by taking a shared role in understanding and managing our condition. Social media can facilitate this process in a variety of ways. It can expose us to a much greater range of information, experience and opinion from both peers and professionals. For example, being able to track others routes through terminal diagnoses on www.patientslikeus.com or access health analytics on the performance of particular consultants through www.drfosterintelligence.co.uk. It can enable us to engage more directly and equally with professionals through online programmes and communities to arrive at a diagnosis, to explore treatment options and to negotiate health outcomes. This opens the door, for example, to a choice such as quality of life retention over quantity of life extension: &apos;to die well&apos; rather than &apos;to live poorly&apos;. Further, social media can mitigate the loneliness of ill-health. Mobile and digital devices can allow us to track elements of our health and share these with others. They can also remind us to take medications or let &apos;buddies&apos; know how we are progressing.  Essentially, social media presents an opportunity to turn the pursuit of health into a networked activity where the elements of relationship to others, combined with the health benefits of taking as much control as possible over our own health, are given an equal weight to the choice of diagnostic and treatment path.  Perhaps I am reading these early symptoms of social health a little too optimistically, given the contra-indications. For example, the difficulty of more information is knowing what to trust. While Trip Advisor may reliably suggest the best hotel in Amsterdam it may be harder to place your faith in contributions to mybestappendectomy.com. Even clinicians struggle to answer that eternal call, echoing down the halls of the Department of Health, for &apos;evidence&apos;. I cannot be the only one who has studied hundreds of online images of bumps, lumps and rashes trying to identify what ails my daughter. Then there is the issue of safety. How can we know how others are using what we share in open environments, and can we be sure that what we write in distress may not come back to haunt us later? I have been working with a group of people offering online mental health services to devise some guidelines to good practice in these areas. For example, we have looked at the importance of skilled moderation to ensure that health communities become intolerant of viral bullies or carriers of internet Munchhausen disease. However, self-regulation will not be sufficient without educating ourselves about informed and safe use of the internet. This means that the ability to self-manage extends beyond health choices in social media to the use of the medium itself. Beyond this lies perhaps the most fundamental challenge of all. The ability of the health professional and the patient to re-imagine their roles from something like &apos;expert to guide&apos; and &apos;ill person to activist&apos;. I have known well-qualified people retreat battered from engagement with online communities; not from criticism but from a reversal of roles. Social media renders public what is often the preserve of consulting rooms which can feel exposing and threatening to those who have yet to learn new means of connecting. Similarly, there are those who will be daunted by taking greater control for their own health and who will need support to take those steps. Notwithstanding the challenges, it appears to me that we are already on the road to social health and have moved well beyond a mate tweeting they have bird flu to a new landscape of engagement for health. How many of us could not walk bravely into this landscape if we have waited long hours for a few minutes of expert time or who have left a consultant remembering only the words between the lines or come from the GP clasping a prescription whose contents we do not understand? Similarly many professionals would prefer to see someone take leadership for their own health journey and be happy to help guide them along the way.  So there appears to be little to fear in the early symptoms of social health. Rather, they seem to represent an opportunity to be healthily embraced.

His arraignment in court 1 of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague gives the families of thousands of his army&apos;s victims their first clear look at a man who went on the run 16 years ago when he was first indicted for his alleged role in ethnic cleansing in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995: including the siege of Sarajevo, the Srebrenica massacre and the hostage-taking of UN personnel. Mladic&apos;s long-awaited appearance in front of three judges \u2013 from the Netherlands, Germany and South Africa \u2013 promises an insight into his health problems, which are concerning prosecutors. His lawyer, Milos Saljic, on Thursday claimed to have documents proving that the former general, now 69, had suffered lymph node cancer and was treated at a Serbian hospital in 2009. However, a source close to the tribunal said that Mladic did not currently have the disease, as shown by tests conducted since he entered custody in The Hague. Court officials said that since Mladic&apos;s entry into custody on Tuesday night, following his extradition from Serbia that day, he had been communicative for long periods and co-operative. He had undergone a battery of health tests to sort fact from rumour, officials said. When faced with the charges Mladic could re-state his position that he does not respect the legitimacy of the court; he could enter a plea immediately or within 30 days, or he could refuse to respond to the charges and the court would then \u00a0enter a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; on his behalf. However brief it is, Mladic&apos;s appearance looks set to test the extent of the Netherlands&apos; anguish over its role in the 1995 killing of more than 7,000 people in Srebrenica, since Dutch soldiers acted as UN peacekeepers in a safe haven supposedly to protect the Muslim population. Dutch soldiers, politicians and historians all stress that it is a bigger moment for the families of Bosnian Muslims killed by Mladic&apos;s Serb forces than for any Dutch person. However, the Netherlands has been haunted by guilt over the atrocity too. Its government resigned in 2002 over the issue, some soldiers have sought therapy, and the most senior commander of the Dutch forces in Bosnia was hounded out of the country into exile in Spain. &quot;We are attached to Mladic in that we are almost victims of the same genocide,&quot; said Liesbeth Zegveld, an Amsterdam lawyer who is representing the families of two victims of Srebrenica in the early stages of a criminal case against three leading Dutch military commanders. &quot;The military have a reason to feel they were dropped into a situation they were not prepared for,&quot; she added Rene Jagt, a 37-year-old veteran of the 400-strong Dutch corp, was one of the many UN peacekeepers taken hostage by Mladic&apos;s forces. Jagt was among veterans who came out to see the former fugitive Mladic&apos;s arrival at prison this week. There was little joy, although there was some satisfaction. &quot;I didn&apos;t feel responsible at that moment because [it was Mladic] killing the people \u2026 It was not my war. But for people who have lost their husbands and children, for them [Mladic&apos;s arrival] is a big moment. For us soldiers, we have had a lot of negative press. Now with the capture of Mladic it is finished.&quot; But not for everyone. The case Zegveld is bringing against Commander Thomas Karremans, Deputy Commander Rob Franken, and Berend Oosterveen, a personnel officer, has been filed on behalf of the families of Rizo Mustafic and Muhamed Nuhanovic, who were each taken from the Srebrenica safe-haven guarded by the Dutch and later found in mass graves. Karremans was famously photographed drinking a toast with Mladic. State prosecutors are considering the claims that the three men were complicit in war crimes, genocide and murder, and have not decided whether to press charges. The rehabilitation of Dutch soldiers and with it Dutch national self-esteem about the military has taken time, said David Barnouw, a researcher at the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which produced a 2002 report into the role of the Dutch peacekeepers. &quot;When it happened there was a sense in the Netherlands that there had been a big massacre and the Dutch soldiers had stood by and done nothing. TV showed pictures of them dancing and then pictures of dead bodies, and it was a big shock to the nation. There was an idea that our soldiers were cowards, only looking out for their own safety.&quot; The report seemed to exonerate the soldiers but the Dutch government and military officials were blamed for failing to prevent the massacre. After this, the Dutch prime minister, Willem Kok, and the entire cabinet resigned. &quot;There is a feeling that this could be the end, the last stage of the Srebrenica issue,&quot; said Barnouw. Mladic might not allow that and there are fears now that he will mount a defence that implicates the peacekeeping force. &quot;The attention around Mladic&apos;s case [in the Netherlands] has very much to do with the fact that people want to push their guilt onto him and get rid of it,&quot; said Zegveld. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t really work. I expect if Mladic pleads not guilty and mounts a defence he will refer to the Dutch role and he may even call Karremans. He will make clear this was a joint liability.&quot; If he does, any satisfaction at seeing justice done for the Bosnian Muslims could be complicated in the Netherlands by a deeply uncomfortable resurgence of guilt.", "sentences": ["&quot;We are attached to Mladic in that we are almost victims of the same genocide,&quot; said Liesbeth Zegveld, an Amsterdam lawyer who is representing the families of two victims of Srebrenica in the early stages of a criminal case against three leading Dutch military commanders."], "title": "Ratko Mladic: After long delay, families await suspect's day in the dock", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/02/ratko-mladic-hague-ill-health", "tags": ["Ratko Mladic", "Netherlands", "Serbia", "World news", "Europe", "War crimes", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "United Nations", "Srebrenica massacre", "International criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-02T17:15:00Z", "article": "British oil company Cairn Energy has filed legal papers with a Dutch court to fine Greenpeace \u20ac2m (\u00a31.76m) a day if the campaign group disrupts its oil drilling operations in the Arctic.

However, Cairn says in the court documents: &quot;The defendants are preventing the exploitation of the platform.

Disco, for\u00a0example, has undergone a number of\u00a0largely\u00a0kitschy revivals since the early 90s \u2013 think of the very different uses of it by acts ranging from Deee-Lite, Masters at Work and DJ\u00a0Sneak to Daft Punk, Escort, and LCD Soundsystem. But dance music&apos;s deeper past tended to be the preserve of those with insider knowledge. That, though, has\u00a0begun to change, as dance music undergoes its first serious wave of reissued classics and rarities. &quot;With house music, it&apos;s been 25, 30 years of history,&quot; says Christiaan Macdonald, Rush Hour Recordings&apos; label manager, &quot;and there&apos;s a new generation of kids listening to it.&quot; Based in Amsterdam, Rush Hour has become a key label in electronic dance&apos;s sudden reissue bloom. Rush Hour shines on the new-title front, thanks to sparkling singles by FaltyDL, Nebraska, and Tom Trago \u2013 but it&apos;s proven invaluable for bringing to light legendary but little-heard music from the mid-90s, an era so teeming that it is to dance music what the 60s are to rock. Beginning with the October 2008 issue of Kenny Larkin&apos;s The Chronicles \u2013 a double-CD collection of the Detroit techno producer&apos;s privately pressed 12in singles from 1992 to 1997 \u2013 Rush Hour has concentrated on reissuing vintage Chicago\u00a0house and Detroit techno. Last year, they repressed vintage 12ins such as Robert Hood Presents Floorplan&apos;s Funky Souls from 1996, and put together Anthony\u00a0&quot;Shake&quot; Shakir&apos;s three-CD Frictionalism 1994-2009, which plays like\u00a0an alternate-universe greatest hits \u2013 and in a way, it is. This is a significant shift. For all its sourcing in earlier music, electronic dance\u00a0has tended not to be the most overtly nostalgic of forms, but that&apos;s begun to change recently. There have long\u00a0been retrospective series, such as the\u00a0Sessions double CDs on Union Square\u00a0Music, or Mastercuts&apos; Classic series, which tend to take a broad overview\u00a0that presumes everyone listening is coming to\u00a0this music for the\u00a0first time (not to mention that several volumes of the Sessions series are intrusively, and badly, DJ-mixed). But thanks to everything from YouTube\u00a0to the disco re-edit underground to Detroit techno and Chicago house stretching toward three decades of existence, dance fans seem to be hungering for older music more than at any time before. Jungle and 2step DJs would never\u00a0have thought to mix old Chicago or Detroit tracks into their sets, but newer DJs see no impediment to doing so; if anything, it gives the music a trans-historical kick. Dance fans who came of age in the 90s are seizing their heritage, while younger newcomers are claiming their roots. And as a result, dance compilations and reissues are going deeper than ever. That&apos;s true of disco as well. There&apos;s been a boom in books on the subject \u2013 Alice Echols&apos;s Hot Stuff and Peter Shapiro&apos;s Turn\u00a0the Beat Around are just two of many.\u00a0But even a box set as judiciously chosen as A\u00a0Complete Introduction to Disco 1970-1980, issued by Universal last\u00a0August,\u00a0can&apos;t dive into the music&apos;s many strange corners. Luckily, for those of us that have always wanted to hear the\u00a0Andy Williams disco record, there is the recent Disco Discharge: Mondo Disco \u2013 &quot;23 weird &amp; wonderful disco artefacts,&quot; as the sleevesticker promises, which contextualizes Williams&apos;s weirdly Euro Love Story (&quot;She fills my HEEEAAAARRRRT!&quot;) with equally garish tracks by 5000 Volts, Disco Circus, and Cerrone. Mondo Disco is just one of four volumes in the double-CD Disco Discharge series issued this spring, bringing the total to 12;\u00a0it was joined by Cruising the Beats (gay-bar pickup music, featuring  This\u00a0Girl&apos;s Back in Town by Raquel Welch),\u00a0Euro Beats (they love Giorgio Moroder), and Disco Fever USA (male and\u00a0female belters dominate). These CDs are as gloriously over the top as their subject, and packaged with smart attention to detail by compiler Mr Pink \u2013 aka David Akerman \u2013 a supply chain manager at Demon Music Group, which issues the discs. &quot;Each set takes approximately eight months from concept to release,&quot; says Akerman. He often chooses the black-and-white art before the track lists are finalised.\u00a0&quot;Finding the owners of tracks that were released on independent labels\u00a0is quite often a problem,&quot; he says. &quot;There are tracks that are lost for ever due\u00a0to the fact no one can legally confirm who owns them.&quot; It&apos;s partly for that reason that dance history has largely been lost until recently.\u00a0&quot;This is a music that historically was disrespected by the mainstream media, mainstream compilers, mainstream attention,&quot; says Andy Zax, a veteran reissue producer in Los Angeles who has worked extensively with Rhino, for whom he helped produce the mid-00s Talking Heads reissues. &quot;It&apos;s like how garage rock had a substantial following, but it was under the radar to a certain degree. If you were somebody on the internet fanatically trying to download B-sides, you can disagree. But in terms of\u00a0serious professional attention being paid, the degree of interest from the major-label music business has been spotty and intermittent at best.&quot; The classic example is Machine Soul. In\u00a0the late 90s, New York writer and collector Johan Kugelberg put together a four-disc box for Rhino \u2013 &quot;a pretty good overview of electronica,&quot; says Kugelberg, using the vogue US term of the time. &quot;The\u00a0sales department at Rhino decided that a two-CD set was all the marketplace could carry, so it was chopped down, and became yet another neither-here-nor-there compilation.&quot; &quot;Any kind of compilation \u2013 single artist or genre or scene or region or sound or what have you \u2013 is an argument,&quot; says Zax,\u00a0who saw Machine Soul deflate. &quot;It should be like a well-structured essay whose topic is why you should care about this thing under consideration. Good compilations do that; bad compilations don&apos;t do that. What they put out was one of those packages it&apos;s hard to imagine it making anyone happy at all, despite the obvious quality of most of what&apos;s on it.&quot; The tide for dance compilations began turning around the mid-00s. Soul Jazz salted its usual jazz, funk, reggae and post-punk collections with nods to the\u00a0rave diaspora, Acid: Can You Jack? and\u00a0Rumble in the Jungle, while Planet Mu\u00a0put\u00a0out a pair of seething mid-90s compilations by the jungle producer Remarc. That&apos;s the kind of reissue that&apos;s gaining traction: period-specific, in-depth surveys aimed at hardcore fans. In some cases, these have been coming from the original labels. The past few years\u00a0have seen a number of rave-era imprints making their catalogues available on download sites such as iTunes and eMusic. The important early jungle label\u00a0Reinforced, for example \u2013 which incubated the first work of scene heroes 4Hero, Goldie (then Rufige Cru), and Doc Scott \u2013 recently collected its artists&apos; mid-90s singles under the series title The Early Plates. Kniteforce, an early happy-hardcore imprint, got noticed back in late 2008 by putting its entire back catalogue up for free download; the offer has long since been discontinued, as the music makes its way to the online stores. The most resonant of these reclamations has been R&amp;S Records, founded in 1984. During the early 90s, R&amp;S was as reliable and varied a rave label as there came, issuing parameter-expanding classics by Joey Beltram, Aphex Twin, Human Resource, Jam &amp; Spoon, Jonny L, Mescalinum United and Jaydee at a lightning clip, setting the stage for later big-tent dance enterprises such as Kompakt. R&amp;S gradually lost steam, moseying along till the early 00s, at which point the label went on indefinite hiatus. That changed in 2006, when founder Renaat Vandepapeliere revived it, handing the reins to label manager Andy Whittaker and young A&amp;R man Dan Foat, who now run R&amp;S in London. &quot;There&apos;s been many other older dance labels relaunched which have just mined the back catalogues and updated them with new remixes,&quot; says Whittaker. &quot;But\u00a0Dan and I wouldn&apos;t have been part of it if this was how R&amp;S was to be run. We have a remit to make the label great again.&quot; R&amp;S did indeed reissue its classics digitally\u00a0and, more selectively, on CD; the 2008 collection In Order to Dance featured a bonus disc of old warhorses newly remixed, such as Prins Thomas&apos;s version of Outlander&apos;s Vamp, and Boys Noize making over CJ Bolland&apos;s Horsepower. But those were merely steps toward a new beginning: Improbably, R&amp;S has become one of dance music&apos;s premier labels in the here and now, thanks to a head-turning assortment of EPs by right-now acts such as Radio Slave, Pariah, Space Dimension Controller, Untold, and \u2013 oh yes \u2013 James Blake, whose 2010 R&amp;S 12-inch CMYK is the track that launched the hype machine into overdrive. &quot;The fact the label has such a great heritage for working with people like Aphex Twin and Juan Atkins definitely helps us sign new artists,&quot; says Whittaker of his label&apos;s wraparound latter-day success \u2013 using vintage classics to launch into new directions. &quot;Although now the new artists we sign are as impressed by our current roster as the back catalogue.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;With house music, it&apos;s been 25, 30 years of history,&quot; says Christiaan Macdonald, Rush Hour Recordings&apos; label manager, &quot;and there&apos;s a new generation of kids listening to it.&quot; Based in Amsterdam, Rush Hour has become a key label in electronic dance&apos;s sudden reissue bloom."], "title": "Dance music gets nostalgic: the disco and rave reissue boom", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/02/dance-music-nostalgia-rave-disco-reissues", "tags": ["Dance music", "Electronic music", "Clubbing", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-03T08:52:15Z", "article": "Not for Tim Powers the mealy-mouthed aspirations towards literary fiction that more sensitive genre authors can spout. No. For Powers \u2013 the award-winning fantasy author whose novel, On Stranger Tides, provided the basis for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film \u2013 there is no higher aspiration than good fantasy. &quot;Since everybody is so susceptible to being scared of the dark and nervous of graveyards at sundown, it strikes me that it&apos;s an artificial restriction to write mainstream fiction,&quot; he says, speaking from his home in California. &quot;It&apos;s like being asked to do a painting but not use the colour blue. Even total materialists get nervous about movies like The Ring. For all their rational scepticism, there&apos;s a part of their brain that powerfully responds to that stuff. So why arbitrarily leave it out of your tool box? If I was to try to write a mainstream book I would be constantly bumping my elbows up against the restrictions. If I were to try to write a book about a handicapped boy coming of age in Pittsburgh he&apos;d start getting phone calls from his dead grandfather before the end of the first chapter.&quot; From voodoo-chanting pirates (On Stranger Tides) to brainwashed Lord Byrons (The Anubis Gates), supernatural spy thrillers (Declare) to an occult history of Einstein (Three Days to Never), Powers always makes sure to keep everything in his tool box. The winner of a clutch of World Fantasy, Locus and Philip K Dick awards, and acclaimed as a founder of steampunk, Powers is undeniably one of fantasy&apos;s grand masters. Until now, he has failed to collect the following he deserves in the UK \u2013 but with a new publishing deal with independent press Corvus bringing old and new titles into print, and the release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, that might just be set to change. It&apos;s no surprise that Disney pounced on the 1987 novel. Packed with voodoo and ghosts, black humour, zombies and rip-roaring, rum-swilling adventure, it follows the travails of one Jack Shandy, press-ganged into piratedom and a quest with the notorious Edward Thatch \u2013 Blackbeard \u2013 for the Fountain of Youth. Like all Powers&apos;s books, it has its roots in real history \u2013 this is one author who, when faced with the perennially dreaded question, &quot;where do you get your ideas from?&quot; is able to answer with ease. &quot;I look for a situation or historical character or place that looks likely to have elements that will make a good book,&quot; he says. &quot;Of course I&apos;m just guessing, but at this point you think &apos;that looks like a rich field&apos;. And then I read extensively: biographies, journals, ideally contemporary travel guides, things like that, always looking for something that is too cool not to use.&quot; It&apos;s a way of approaching the world &quot;with a kind of paranoid squint. I think &apos;what was really going on there?&apos; I know what the history books say, but why did this guy really do that?&quot; Reading about Blackbeard&apos;s more incomprehensible actions \u2013 twining lit matches into his beard, shooting his friend&apos;s leg off, drinking rum and gunpowder, getting himself captured so easily \u2013 Powers found a rich seam to mine. &quot;Blackbeard behaved insanely. Of course in real life these things happened because these people were crazy. But for the purposes of my book, I said &apos;let&apos;s say they weren&apos;t. Let&apos;s say these were very shrewd moves, but in a supernatural context. Why would he tie burning things in his beard? Well, probably fire is some kind of magical protection. And why did he mix gunpowder with rum? I don&apos;t know, read up on voodoo, there must be lots of things about gunpowder and rum in voodoo law.&apos; And once I find all these things, the trick is simply connecting the dots. I&apos;ve often said that my system of writing is designed for someone with no intrinsic imagination. I don&apos;t have to make anything up, I just have to find it all.&quot; Sometimes, he says, it clicks together so smoothly that he starts to think &quot;well, gee, maybe you&apos;re not making this up, maybe this literally happened. Usually it&apos;s very late at night I think that ... &quot; Powers is pretty sure he could take his approach with anyone, given a long and detailed enough biography. &quot;I bet I could read biographies of Beatrix Potter,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m sure there were things in her life that would lead me to think &apos;aha, what was she really up to? What&apos;s the subtext of Peter Rabbit and Mrs Tiggywinkle?&apos; What would slow me down is, I like Peter Rabbit and Mrs Tiggywinkle. I wouldn&apos;t want to represent them as being diabolical.&quot; One advantage of rooting his stories in the real is, he hopes, that readers will be more likely to suspend their disbelief. &quot;It gives a lot of real-world lumber to support my crazy supernatural business. I&apos;m always very aware of the risk that a reader will blink and say wait a minute this is all made up crap, isn&apos;t it?&quot; he says. &quot;But if I talk about carriages and shoe buckles and George III and commerce between London and Amsterdam, the reader will be a little more tilted towards thinking this is happening in the real world. If I wrote about the magical kingdom of Ding Dong and the lost prince and the dark lord, I would have ceded a whole lot of territory as far as plausibility goes. There is a speed bump to credulity, when you ask readers to take seriously things like ghosts and vampires, and I want to make it as low as possible. I want to be able to have them go over it without any kind of jolt.&quot; Next up is a novel based around the Rossetti family, a loose sequel to The Stress of Her Regard, which placed the Romantic poets in a world peopled by vampires. The new book, out next March, is set in Victorian London, but Powers is quick to insist that he&apos;s not being &quot;trendy&quot;. He&apos;s referring to the recent appetite for all things steampunk \u2013 the genre he, along with his college friends and fellow authors James Blaylock and KW Jeter, is said to have invented. Powers isn&apos;t so sure, although he does admit that the three of them published steampunk novels around the same time: his time-travel story The Anubis Gates, Blaylock&apos;s Homunculus, Jeter&apos;s Morlock Night. He&apos;s happy to take the label \u2013 it means his books stay in print \u2013 but he&apos;s &quot;afraid if they look closer they&apos;ll see it&apos;s fraud&quot;. &quot;There was a Michael Moorcock book before then, I think, Warlord of the Air, and there was Harry Harrison&apos;s A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! But I think the thing is we three had books come out at roughly the same time and we all knew each other, so it looked concerted. I love it though, I&apos;ve been guest of honour at a steamcon, although it seems to be mostly about funny hats and weird goggles. I&apos;m very happy that they consider us pioneers of it.&quot; It was with Blaylock and Jeter, too, that Powers got to know Philip K Dick. The pair became good friends in the last 10 years of Dick&apos;s life, and the science fiction author wasn&apos;t, says Powers, at all like his caricature. &quot;He wasn&apos;t crazy, he wasn&apos;t taking any kind of drugs. He was very funny and very kind and infinitely erudite,&quot; he says of his friend. &quot;If you went over to his place he&apos;d say &apos;I&apos;ve been reading Pythagoras and the neo-Platonists and the pre-Socratic philosophers and I&apos;ve come to these tremendous conclusions about the universe and God&apos;, and you&apos;d think &apos;Really? Wow! What?&apos; He&apos;d explain it all to you, and then the next day if you mentioned it he&apos;d say &apos;oh, I decided that was all nonsense&apos;.&quot; Dick was &quot;very much not the mystical hermit that you get the picture of: he was very funny and very sceptical and very derisive of his own theories&quot;. For now, the author is reading &quot;everything I can get my hands on&quot; about the Rossetti family, and is delighted with the inconsistencies and potential supernatural explanations he keeps stumbling upon. &quot;I came across the fact that when [Dante Gabriel&apos;s] wife killed herself, in his grief and guilt, very valid guilt, he put his whole poetry manuscript in the coffin with her. And she was buried. And then several years later a publisher told him &apos;if you had a collection of poetry we could publish a book of it&apos;. And he said &apos;ah, give me a couple of days&apos;, and he dug her up. My immediate thought was &apos;why did he really dig her up? It wasn&apos;t to get the book of poems, that was an excuse&apos;. He had to get something else out, or he had to put something in ... &quot; &quot;There was a lot of very nice stuff for me, in my non-imaginative way, to discover, like the Rossettis never had children or at least no children who survived. But then Edward Trelawny gave one of them a piece of Shelley&apos;s jawbone salvaged from the pyre, and after that they could all have children.&quot; It was perfect Powers material. &quot;I thought, well now, I don&apos;t even have to make stuff up!&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;But if I talk about carriages and shoe buckles and George III and commerce between London and Amsterdam, the reader will be a little more tilted towards thinking this is happening in the real world."], "title": "Tim Powers: 'I don't have to make anything up'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/03/tim-powers-i-dont-have-to-make-anything-up", "tags": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-03T13:51:00Z", "article": "&quot;Why are all good books British?&quot; asked the latest person to question Book Doctor. &quot;They&apos;re not,&quot; replied Book Doctor. She went on to name some of the many brilliant books that come from outside the UK - but we spotted one thing. Most of the examples she mentions are from the United States. Since we have so many members who live outside the United States and the UK, we thought we&apos;d ask you to tell us about your favourite books from around the world. Did you know, for instance, that Pippi Longstocking (pictured, in our favourite Lauren Child version) was originally a Swedish character, born Pippi L\u00e5ngstrump? Were you aware that The Little Mermaid and all the other famous fairytale characters of Hans Christian Andersen swam out of Denmark, or that Rapunzel and Hansel and Gretel were made in Germany by the Brothers Grimm? Some of our members from outside the UK have already introduced us to books we didn&apos;t know before. Anthony, from South Africa, wrote that one of his favourites was an Africaans novel called 30 Nights in Amsterdam by Etienne van Heerden. &quot;It is about the Afrikaners, Apartheid and the colonisation of Africa and our identity in South Africa. It helped me understand what really went on during Apartheid and stopped me from growing up biased.&quot; SophieDophie tipped us off about a French picture book, The Secret Lives of Princesses by Philippe Lechermeier, which comes with its own English language website with games, puzzles and a quiz. &quot;Although it looks as if it&apos;s a picture book for younger children, I think it&apos;s actually for older children (from about the age of 10) who will understand the puns, the &apos;in&apos; jokes and the double entendres.&quot; she wrote Groovy Dhruv reminded us of an Indian novel, which is no longer in print in the UK - Malgudi Schooldays, by RK Narayan. He wrote: &quot;Malgudi Schooldays is a book that my parents used to read when they were little so it&apos;s a classic. It is about childhood in a small Indian village.&quot; But even though there are so many great books around, &quot;few British or American children get a chance to read anything that isn&apos;t originated in English,&quot; said Book Doctor.  We think this is a shame, and we&apos;re hoping you will share more of your favourites with us by emailing them to childrens.books@theguardian.com Your favourite non-British books SophieDophie: There are loads and loads of French books which are wonderful, but when we looked to see whether they had been published in English, there were very few to choose from! Ages 5-7:  Madeleine was the first book my mother remembers borrowing from the library! It my was written by Ludwig Bemelmans, a French-speaking Austrian, and we have both the French and English versions. Madeleine goes to school in Paris but one day ends up being rushed to hospital... Ages 8-10:  Le Petit Nicolas (by Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and Jean-Jacques Semp\u00e9) is a brilliant book which should make you really laugh. Nicolas and his friends are always getting into trouble but he&apos;s not naughty like Horrid Henry, he&apos;s just unlucky! Ages 9-11: Susie Morgenstern is an American who moved to France in the 1960s and who writes in French. La Sixi\u00e8me is a story about the first year of coll\u00e8ge (secondary school), so I read in my last year of primary school (CM2). The books which have been translated into English are for children who are younger (ages 7-9). Ages 10-99: Everybody always mentions Le Petit Prince , by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, when they talk about French books (It&apos;s called The Little Prince in English). I studied it last year at school (in French). I&apos;d like to read it in English one day to see how the story comes across when it&apos;s translated. Ages 10-14: La Pierre Sculpt\u00e9e (by Guillaume Prevost) is the first book of a trilogy called &quot;The Book of Time&quot; in English. Sam searches for his missing father and discovers a secret passage in the book shop where his father works... Caroline:Any book by Ana Maria Machado (Hans Christian Andersen Award winner in 2000) or Ruth Rocha, the must popular children&apos;s book writes in Brazil. My personal favorite is &quot;Bisa Bia, Bisa Bel&quot; (Me in the Middle). Danielle:So many Canadian children&apos;s books one could name! Start with Kenneth Oppel&apos;s amazing bat trilogy: Silverwing, Sunwing, and Firewing. For younger readers, try the Mordecai Richler classic, Jacob Two Two Meets the Hooded Fang. One of my favourite books when I was a child (in the 1970s) was Jean Little&apos;s From Anna, a moving story about a German family that moves to Canada after Hitler comes to power. And of course, there&apos;s LM Montgomery&apos;s Anne of Green Gables. Parents suggest: Jane R:  Just seen your call out for non-British books. I want to tell you about Fox by Margaret Wild and Ron Brooks (Australian). This is a brilliant picture book about friendship and betrayal, so powerful I didn&apos;t want to read it to my daughter until she was old enough to know the world was not always a nice place. The pictures evoke this hot dry land in rich reds, ochres and greys. The language is spare and taut. The text is handwritten in ink and becomes integrated into the artwork. The tension in the developing relationship between Dog, Magpie and Fox builds to a frightening climax; the final page leaves a chink of hope, but for anyone who has ever betrayed or been betrayed, the book and its haunting images will live long in the mind. Claire Y:  I recently discovered a great little New Zealand publisher, Gecko Press, which publishes books from around the world. One of their most recent is from Poland. It&apos;s a picture book about the different sorts of homes people live in in various parts of the world. It&apos;s by Aleskandra Machowiak and Daniel Mizielinski and it&apos;s really imaginitive and fun. Publishers suggest: Bodour Al Qasimi, Arab Emirates:Thank you for shedding some light on this subject! I am a publisher of children&apos;s books in Arabic and I do believe there are some wonderful books out there if people only took the time to look for them. I would nominate one of my favourite titles in our list My Own Special Way by Maitha Al Khayyat, a writer from the United Arab Emirates. The story is a coming of age tale of a young girl who wants to start wearing the hijab or veil yet she is not sure how to go about it. It&apos;s quite humorous at times when her older sisters show her the &quot;right&quot; way to wear it, but in the end she finds her own special way. Now I might be biased because I did publish this book, but Orion books agree with me, so much so that they have picked up worldwide rights for this book in English! So we will soon see this non-British story in the UK!

Don&apos;t despair: there are loads of things you can sow or plant now\u00a0that will bring you bounty later in the summer, or over the winter. Courgettes and cucumbersCourgettes and cucumbers grow fast, and you can still sow them now and get good crops. And even if you&apos;re feeling smug that you sowed your courgettes weeks ago, sow again. Your originals will eventually run out of steam and these new ones can step into their shoes. Tomatoes, aubergines, peppersIt is definitely too late to sow all these seeds \u2013 they need a long season to come to fruition, but you\u00a0can plant out small plants and still hope for success in a sunny, sheltered spot or a greenhouse. Rocket Gardens will send out a small pack of mixed peppers and chilli plants now, and it also sells a &quot;Mediterranean Garden&quot; that contains plants of aubergines, tomatoes, borlotti beans, courgettes and herbs. Peas and beansThis is the last possible moment to sow maincrop peas, mangetout and sugar snap peas, so get them in the ground quick. Second sowings (or first, if you missed the boat earlier) of french beans can be made now, to pick up when earlier sowings run out of steam. There&apos;s still time to sow delicious borlottis, too. BrassicasSow summer calabrese now, in situ. This is the moment to start sowing brassicas for autumn and winter use. Plants such as brussels sprouts need a long old grow. They do best sown direct, because this allows them to put down an anchoring tap root that will serve them well come winter winds. Leeks and spring onionsIt is too late to sow leeks, but you can buy mini plants from Delfland Nurseries and plant them straight out. Make little holes in the ground and drop them in. No need to fill in the holes: just water them in. Spring onions are quick growers. Sow them direct and you will have them for late summer and autumn. Carrots, beetroot and fennelEarly summer is the perfect moment to sow beetroot to grow into big roots for winter storage. Sow some now, and another lot in a few weeks, and eat some as little, golf ball-size summer roots, leaving others to develop. Carrots can be treated much the same way, but choose earlies (such as &apos;Nantes&apos; and &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos;) for quick, sweet, young carrots to enjoy later in the summer, and maincrops (chantenay types and &apos;Autumn King&apos;, for example) for the storers. Fennel bolts if sown earlier in the year, so now is the time to do it. Salad leavesSalad leaves grow quickly, and you can still sow lettuces aplenty and get handfuls of leaves. However, you will get patchy germination of lettuces when temperatures are high. It prefers the cool. Get round this by sowing late in the day or in the evening, as the crucial time, temperature-wise, is about four hours after sowing. Alternatively, buy packs of small lettuce plants from Delfland or Rocket Gardens. Oriental leavesWe are fast approaching the perfect moment for sowing oriental leaves such as mustards, mizuna, mibuna and pak choi. They struggle if sown early in the year. They hate the extreme difference in temperatures between night and day, for one thing, and make every attempt to flower as days lengthen. This is no good for us, as we want leaves. Sow\u00a0them around midsummer and\u00a0they will bulk up beautifully, without a\u00a0thought of flowering. Sow\u00a0again in mid- to late-summer to\u00a0have leaves in winter. PotatoesTo grow potatoes this late in the year, you have to rely on technology. Potato merchants have whipped up a new market by selling cold-stored potatoes so that gardeners can plant in midsummer and harvest new potatoes for Christmas Day. Why anyone would forsake Crimbo roasties is beyond me, but this development does mean you can still get your hands on seed potatoes now. Grow in big pots, in a\u00a0greenhouse ideally, or close to the house, and throw a bit of horticultural fleece over the tops when the weather turns cold.

He had raced down all 72 steps with his heart pounding the day he picked up the phone to hear the words everyone dreaded: &quot;It&apos;s Cromwell&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ll never forget it,&quot; he says. &quot;I got down those steps faster than you would believe.&quot; Cromwell was the codeword for an imminent invasion by the Germans, whose fortifications on the French coast were within sight of his barrack windows on a clear day. It was one of many false alarms. This week, new displays opening to the public recreate those nerve-shredding days and sleepless nights due to the incessant background noise of planes, anti-aircraft fire and incoming artillery in the medieval castle that became the frontline in Britain&apos;s second world war defences. Visitors are invited back \u2013 by a gentler sloping ramp \u2013 into the centuries-old tunnels where Sheen worked, and where Admiral Sir Bertram Home Ramsay, a now-half-forgotten genius forced out of retirement, planned and executed one of the most famous episodes in British history: the evacuation from Dunkirk. From his &quot;cabin&quot;, recreated by English Heritage from photographs with its desk, narrow bed, and taped-up window, Ramsay had the same startling view as Sheen straight down into Dover harbour, and across the straits to France. Ramsay&apos;s organisational genius had led to him being By May 1940, as a German pincer movement penned the British Expeditionary Force and the French army in Dunkirk, Ramsay had one week to plan an evacuation. On 26 May, On 26 May, the two men witnessed the most extraordinary armada ever assembled: the harbour jammed with destroyers, French and British warships, merchant ships, freighters, gunboats, tugs, lifeboats, cabin cruisers, paddle steamers, pleasure boats, lifeboats from luxury liners, a whole shoal of the tall, brown-sailed Thames barges \u2013 even Dutch barges from Amsterdam and the London Fire Brigade&apos;s fire-float Massey Shaw. &quot;I&apos;ll never forget the scene as long as I live,&quot; says Shaw. Operation Dynamo&apos;s makeshift fleet set off to rescue as many soldiers as possible from Dunkirk&apos;s harbour, beaches and a long ramshackle breakwater never meant for mooring. Whitehall hoped Dynamo might save 45,000 troops. By the time Dunkirk fell, after days of unnaturally calm seas and countless crossings \u2013 many made by crews Sheen remembers as &quot;old men and boys&quot; \u2013 they had brought back 338,000. The government did not consider Dunkirk to be a success story \u2013 &quot;wars are not won by evacuations,&quot; said Churchill \u2013 yet was surprised to find the public adopt it as a symbol of unbreakable courage and refusal to accept defeat. Sheen, whose initials are scrawled amid the warren of tunnels, survived the Normandy landings and returned to life in London as a printer. &quot;It was a strange time of my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ll be very interested to see the old place again.&quot; Ramsay died in a plane crash in 1945 near his naval base in France, and was buried with full naval honours at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He is commemorated by a statue at Dover, which should attract new interest now visitors learn his extraordinary history at the site. &quot;The odd thing about Dunkirk is that although it is so famous, there has really been nowhere in Britain visitors could go to learn in detail what happened, why and how,&quot; says English Heritage&apos;s Paul Pattison, who has masterminded the new displays using newsreels, photographs, original furnishings and equipment salvaged from the military to make history come to life.

The move represents something of a coup in that the Dutchman has a reputation to match the size of his personality, after his positive work at Tottenham Hotspur, Hamburg and, most recently, Ajax. He arrives at Craven Cottage on a two-year contract, with the option of a third, and his capture is vindication for Fulham&apos;s persistence and foresight. The west London club moved for Jol in the wake of Roy Hodgson&apos;s departure for Liverpool last July and they were so close to a deal that they had agreed personal terms in principle with him on a three-year contract. Ajax, his employers at the time, had other ideas. To them, it felt like a humiliation to lose their manager to a club of which some people in Amsterdam had barely heard and they refused to allow Jol to walk away. Fulham turned their attentions to Mark Hughes and he led them to an encouraging eighth-placed Premier League finish and Europa League qualification via the fair play table before his shock resignation on Wednesday night. Fulham maintained a channel of communication with Jol, who resigned from Ajax in December, and the personal touch flattered him; it even startled him a little. When Hughes activated the break clause in his Fulham contract to chase what he hopes will be a bigger job, Alistair Mackintosh, the club&apos;s chief executive, knew where to turn. Jol arrived in London late on Monday night and concluded the negotiations with Mackintosh in the small hours of Tuesday. One of Jol&apos;s assistants at the club will be Michael Lindeman, who worked with him at Hamburg and Ajax, and another will be his brother Cock, who has acted as a personal adviser to him in the past. Chris Hughton, Jol&apos;s No2 at Tottenham, could join him at Craven Cottage but he would prefer a managerial post. The former Newcastle United manager had let it be known that he was interested in the Fulham vacancy. Ray Lewington will remain at the club as the development squad manager but Mark Bowen, Eddie Niedzwiecki, Kevin Hitchcock and Glyn Hodges, who comprised Hughes&apos;s back-room staff, will leave. Fulham may have to reach a settlement with the quartet, as each one has a year of their contract to run. Jol had been prominent on Aston Villa&apos;s shortlist, after the Midlands club parted company with G\u00e9rard Houllier on Wednesday night, which prefaced Hughes&apos;s resignation at Craven Cottage. But Jol has always favoured Fulham, with one of the attractions, on top of a lucrative personal contract, being the trust that the chairman, Mohamed Al\u00a0Fayed, traditionally places in his managers, specifically in terms of their transfer dealings. Fayed never allots a transfer budget; he merely works on a case-by-case basis and he has endeavoured to give his managers what they want. It feels inevitable that Robbie Keane, the Tottenham striker, with whom Jol enjoyed a strong relationship at White Hart Lane, will be linked to Fulham but the club did not want him last January or last summer, when he was available. &quot;Martin understands my vision for the club,&quot; Fayed said, &quot;and he believes in what we are striving to achieve. I know that he will dedicate himself to helping us move forward and he is with us for the long term. We have enjoyed three incredibly successful years, and my hopes and dreams for this club are for that journey to continue.&quot; Jol had been desperate to return to England, where he feels he has unfinished business. His three years at Tottenham were characterised by good football and significant strides yet they were pock-marked by near misses. Jol&apos;s team lost three domestic cup quarter-finals and one semi-final, together with a Uefa Cup quarter-final in 2007, and he was irked by the accusation that he could not beat the big teams when it mattered the most. It has always been in his mind to return to prove that he is a manager who can not only improve players and a club, but also take the final and most difficult steps forward. &quot;I am very happy to join Fulham,&quot; Jol said. &quot;I could have gone to other countries but I was waiting for the opportunity to come back to England. I know a lot about the squad I have inherited ... I enjoy watching players like Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who I have known for a while, and there are a few players here that I know from my time at Tottenham, like Simon Davies, Danny Murphy and Stephen Kelly. They are all very good professionals. We&apos;ve had a good conversation about players, and where we can try to strengthen and get one or two quality players.&quot; Jol will have little time to work with his new players before their season kicks off. Fulham play the first leg of their Europa League first qualifying round tie on 30 June, with the players scheduled to report for training on 23 June.

To date, it has been signed by over 140,000 individuals and organisations. The petition has been so popular, in fact, that the social action website Change.org, which hosts it, said its site has been the target of repeated cyber-attacks originating in China and which, the organisation believes, are aimed directly at taking down the Ai Weiwei petition. The attacks have been so disruptive to Change.org that they&apos;ve called on the FBI for assistance and a US lawmaker, championing their cause, is calling on Secretary of State Hilary Clinton to tell the Chinese government to stop the attacks. Ai Weiwei\u00a0and his associates \u2013\u00a0Wen Tao, his friend and assistant;\u00a0Zhang Jingsong, his cousin and driver;\u00a0Hu Mingfen, his accountant;\u00a0Liu Zhenggang, a designer \u2014 were rounded up by Chinese authorities on 3 April, when police arrested Ai as he was about to board a plane in Beijing. Although there has been chatter in Beijing-controlled media about crimes supposedly committed by Ai, no charges have been brought against the\u00a0man rated the world&apos;s\u00a0top artist. Despite the popularity of the Change.org petition and the international furore surrounding it, however, if you visit the websites of virtually any of the petition&apos;s major signatories, you would not know that Ai was incarcerated. Judging from these websites, all is well with the world. The\u00a0Guggenheim\u00a0is currently promoting an exhibition about Kandinsky at the Bauhaus; the\u00a0Los Angeles County Museum of Art\u00a0is talking up an exhibition about Elizabeth Taylor in Iran; and even the\u00a0Tate Modern in the UK, which until a few weeks ago hosted\u00a0Ai&apos;s Sunflower Seed installation, doesn&apos;t disturb its homepage to inform visitors that the artist has been criminally detained, hasn&apos;t been charged with any crime,\u00a0hasn&apos;t\u00a0been heard from for over eight weeks. These three institutions are not alone in their homepage silence. Numerous other headlining signatories of the Change.org petition also have nothing to say on the matter on their homepages, including:\u00a0MoMA;\u00a0Art Institute of Chicago;\u00a0Hammer Museum;\u00a0Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art;\u00a0Brooklyn Museum;\u00a0Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston;\u00a0Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Denmark;\u00a0Montreal Museum of Fine Arts;\u00a0San Francisco Museum of Modern Art;\u00a0Queensland Art Gallery, Australia;\u00a0Harvard Art Museums;\u00a0Museum of Arts and Design, New York; and\u00a0The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. On the other side of the ledger, the US city of Minneapolis deserves credit \u2013 as both the\u00a0Minneapolis Institute of Arts\u00a0and the\u00a0Walker Art Centre\u00a0have had some text on their sites about the Change.org petition, while the\u00a0Serpentine Gallery\u00a0in London also has text about the petition and a photo of Ai. For its part, the\u00a0Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, has a photo of Ai Weiwei at the Tate Modern tossing his sunflower seeds heavenward \u2013 and a reference to the Change.org petition \u2013 as part of a series of images that cycle through in a Flash slideshow. Finally, a tip of the cap goes to the\u00a0Taipei Contemporary Art Centre,\u00a0which has a brave message on its homepage calling on its mainland adversary to release all activists and to protect the creative freedom of artists, a freedom it says is a sign of any country&apos;s mature development. That&apos;s four institutions out of 20 publicly supporting Ai Weiwei on their websites \u2013 and not the biggest names in the art gallery and museum world, by any stretch of the imagination. This is surely a golden opportunity that sadly has been missed. Yet, as Hari Kunzru writes of the Montreal Museum (currently hosting a China show), it&apos;s also a golden opportunity that can still be taken. The Chinese government, having abducted Ai Weiwei, is making a concerted effort to make him invisible, including removing all references to him from public media, including the internet. They can do this in their land. They should not be allowed to do it in any other. Ai Weiwei was committed and creative in his use of the web when he was free to express himself.

It&apos;s that we pay attention, 21 May). But to take Bose&apos;s word for it would be an unfortunate misreading. The Bangladesh liberation war \u2013 the nine-month struggle in 1971 whereby East Pakistan broke away and became an independent nation \u2013 remains relatively unknown in the west. I am a social anthropologist who has undertaken a decade-long research on the memories of wartime rape from the Bangladesh war. I came into contact with contemporary post-nationalist readings which address the role of Bengali Muslims in the killing of Bihari/non-Bengali collaborators and communities. Yet none of these Bangladeshi works are referenced in Bose&apos;s book, which she claims to be the &quot;first critical, neutral&quot; study. Bose&apos;s book is methodologically inconsistent and appears to be informed by a disdain for Bangladeshis and their movement for political freedom. Her portrayal of East Pakistanis/Bangladeshis as either capable of showing &quot;bestial&quot; violence or being cowards calls into question her neutrality. According to her book, Bangladeshis are prone to melodrama and self-pity, with a blind hate and vindictiveness towards the West Pakistani army \u2013 not so surprising, given that the violence was perpetrated by the army. To her, Pakistani army personnel are gentle, quiet, kind, honest, &quot;fine men&quot; with a good humour and &quot;with no ethnic bias against the Bengalis&quot;. Accepting her account, Jack contends that &quot;it would be more accurate to accuse the Pakistani army of political killing&quot;, while the killing of non-Bengali collaborators and communities by Bengali Muslim civilians counts as genocide. The numbers killed and raped during the Bangladesh war, as noted by Jack, remains a contentious issue. There is no doubt that the figures bandied about \u2013 3\u00a0million or 300,000 \u2013 are difficult to prove or disprove. In an earlier article, Bose mistrusts Bangladeshi scholars and calls for research to be &quot;conducted by a credible team of international scholars in a systematic and verifiable manner&quot;. Yet, in instances in the book where foreign press reports provide documentation of the killings and rapes by the Pakistani army, Bose states: &quot;Foreign press reports are not uniformly reliable sources.&quot; Historian Prof Willem van Schendel of the University of Amsterdam, in criticising Bose&apos;s book, suggested: &quot;Debunking is an important, indeed necessary, historical genre in all war historiographies but ... it is only helpful and effective if it adheres to the highest professional and ethical standards.&quot; So in asking others that we pay attention, Jack should also find out about the living and dead who are unreckoned as a result of Bose&apos;s inconsistent documentation of Bangladesh&apos;s horrific losses.", "sentences": ["Yet, in instances in the book where foreign press reports provide documentation of the killings and rapes by the Pakistani army, Bose states: &quot;Foreign press reports are not uniformly reliable sources.&quot; Historian Prof Willem van Schendel of the University of Amsterdam, in criticising Bose&apos;s book, suggested: &quot;Debunking is an important, indeed necessary, historical genre in all war historiographies but ... it is only helpful and effective if it adheres to the highest professional and ethical standards.&quot; So in asking others that we pay attention, Jack should also find out about the living and dead who are unreckoned as a result of Bose&apos;s inconsistent documentation of Bangladesh&apos;s horrific losses."], "title": "Response: This account of the Bangladesh war should not be seen as unbiased", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/bangladesh-liberation-war-sarmila-bose", "tags": ["Bangladesh", "World news", "Law", "War crimes", "War reporting", "Pakistan", "South and Central Asia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-08T09:03:00Z", "article": "&quot;Too many suits \u2026 not enough hippies.&quot; That was the brief conclusion of the microfinance expert Paul Blyth, one of the panellists at the Socap Europe 2011 conference closing session. While the comment was meant half in jest, it was also intended to underline a serious point that social enterprise was now attracting major &quot;impact investors&quot; with access to significant sources of capital. Their heavy presence did give the event a more corporate tone, with an emphasis on how to build the financial infrastructure for impact investing, support social entrepreneurs to get &quot;investment ready&quot; and finance profitable social enterprises to scale. If anyone was expecting sessions dedicated to brainstorming new economic models or redefining profit, then they may have been disappointed. But then, that&apos;s not what Socap is about. Founded in San Francisco in 2008 during the darkest days of the global financial crisis, it seeks to redirect the power and efficiency of market systems toward social impact. It engages &quot;valuable strangers&quot;, in co-founder Kevin Jones&apos;s own words, from entrepreneurs and innovators to investors and foundations, united by desire to develop the social impact investment landscape. This conference in Amsterdam was Socap&apos;s first in Europe. Hosted at the Beurs van Berlage, site of the world&apos;s first stock exchange, it brought together many of the major players from the impact investment scene in North America with their peers from Europe and beyond. The conference opened with an address from HRH Princess M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands (a former investment banker herself) on the merits of access to capital for the poorest and the need for responsibility in investment. While the content of the princess&apos;s speech itself was not groundbreaking, the fact that she chose to give it was. Her endorsement was another mark in how far the impact investment scene has come in a relatively short period. Whether it was the princess&apos;s presence, the warm hospitality or a healthy dose of North American &quot;can do&quot; attitude, there was a definite feeling of optimism at this conference that I have rarely felt at other events. There was a real sense that impact investing was on steep upward curve and that the tools that would support its growth were making progress. Certainly there is some evidence to support this, with JP Morgan recently suggesting that impact investment funds could top a trillion dollars in the next decade. At the conference, it was announced that social impact measurement tools, including the Impact Reporting and Investing Standards and the Global Impact Investment Rating Service, were moving forward. Also, a new exchange for social enterprises being developed by both The Social Stock Exchange and Nexii is nearly ready for market. While these instruments provide grounds for encouragement, their value will largely be determined by their widespread adoption and since there are several players currently competing to deliver them, it will take some time before industry standards emerge. A recurring theme in the sessions I attended was that government&apos;s role is primarily to &quot;get out of the way&quot;, not an opinion I share. Albert Einstein famously said that &quot;you can&apos;t solve a problem with the same mind that created it&quot; so, despite the enthusiasm to move forward, it shouldn&apos;t be forgotten that the finance industry was directly responsible for the global financial crisis, not national governments! Government has an absolutely key role in orientating policy so that it is not, as Patrick Holden from the Sustainable Food Trust stated, &quot;hostile to doing the right thing&quot;, but instead rewards social enterprise through incentives. In addition, government needs to take the lead in stimulating the market for social enterprise through procurement and providing funds at the early start-up phase, as identified by Simon Tucker from the Young Foundation. This gap at the seed funding stage was apparent at Socap. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of impact investors, particularly the institutional investors, want to concentrate on scaling social enterprises that have already demonstrated profitability. The expected returns from these investments vary from fund to fund, but in general an impact investment VC will be expecting a percentage return somewhere in the teens. One panellist, Tony Fernandes, from Pyme Capital, indicated that some investors in the sector had an expectation of a 35% return, in line with returns demonstrated by the micro-finance industry. While Fernandes argued that such rates of return were clearly unrealistic, his observation called into question the motivations of such &quot;impact investors&quot;. Overall, Socap delivered on its formula of being an &quot;intersection between money and meaning&quot;, providing a very practical forum for the impact investment community to develop ideas, share experience and connect to social entrepreneurs. I learned that this intersection can be an uncomfortable place, and there are serious questions about the extent to which there are shared perspectives on how social enterprise is defined, where it is headed and what constitutes a fair return on investment. But it was refreshing to attend an event about social enterprise where the majority of attendees were not known to me. I recognise that these are the difficult conversations we, as social entrepreneurs, need to be having if we wish to see our enterprises grow. Socap may not have been the most innovative or thought-provoking conference I&apos;ve attended, but it was certainly one of the most challenging and has a crucial role to play in developing a common language between social investors and entrepreneurs that will ultimately unlock the capital required to scale the movement.

The lineup: Lewis Rainsbury, Alex Bailey and Matt Law. The background: Yesterday&apos;s new band were relentlessly upbeat. Today&apos;s act are terminally dour. Ideally, your record collection would comprise music from both emotional extremes, but which would you choose to listen to for all eternity: non-stop happy, or wall-to-wall sad? If it was all as sublimely sorrowful as Vondelpark&apos;s new EP, we&apos;d probably go for the latter. This is gorgeously dolorous, like Sade remixed by the xx, or a UK version of the Weeknd&apos;s enervated R&amp;B. We got them quite wrong. We assumed &quot;they&quot; were a &quot;he&quot;, and that he was American. There was the now customary lack of information on the calling card and no MySpace, just a few blog mentions that referred to him in the singular. And there was an EP called Sauna, one of whose titles, California Analog Dream, suggested Vondelpark \u2013 named after a patch of grass (yes, very funny) in Amsterdam \u2013 was one of those LA boys in love with 80s British dark stuff: the Cure, early New Order, that quasi-goth lineage. The songs on Sauna bore out this theory that Vondelpark was just another Interpol wannabe. California Analog Dream featured dry, Martin Hannett-ish production and vocals that were little more than wan drones. Hippodrome found the singer intoning from a lonely place that made you think of Cold Cave, the band as well as the theoretical space. It was as though New Order had never gone to Ibiza. And Jetlag Blue Version was like disco without any of the things that make disco disco, dance music rinsed of all joy. Then we heard the new EP, and we were forced to change our minds about Vondelpark, who, incidentally, are one shy boy from Surrey plus his two mates. Suddenly the hints at dubstep and post-xx/James Blake south London crepuscular nightbus atmospherica make sense. The opening track, TV, is midpaced, only now it&apos;s better produced and amid the staccato keyboard sample and static, the clicks and cuts and glitches \u2013 the whole experimental shebang \u2013 there is a dreaminess that makes this seem like slick R&amp;B put through an Ariel Pink filter. Second track Feat B, with its supperclub shimmer \u2013 the sax IS back \u2013 is an even bolder foray into dubstep soul, making us think of Sade singing Smooth Operator with Gayngs in a post-apocalyptic Soho bar. Camels is lovely, like Portishead with pop appeal, some of the most sweetly twisted soul we&apos;ve heard since early-noughties Bristol duo Alpha and their arrestingly beautiful Sometime Later and Wise. Hipbone features a disembodied voice crooning over finger snaps, a travesty of suavity: imagine D&apos;Angelo trapped with a lounge band in hell. Outro 4 NYC is 100 seconds of orgasmic oohs and aahs over a skeletal guitar figure and a skipping beat. Truly Vonderful. The buzz: &quot;Sounds like it could be remixed by the xx, with those dubstep-like beats, voice samples and minimal guitar chords&quot; \u2013 sevennoises.blogspot.com. The truth: They twilight up our life. Most likely to: Do a desolate, dubstep version of Your Love Is King. Least likely to: Do a dubstep version of King&apos;s Love and Pride. What to buy: The new EP, nyc stuff and nyc bags, is released on 25 July by R&amp;S. File next to: The Weeknd, New Order, Sade, the xx. Links: viceland.com.

A desperate scramble for a recording device later, we&apos;re in business] How are things? I suppose everything is being aimed at London 2012 right now? [On a very fuzzy line] Yeah, preparations are going quite well. I&apos;ve had a good start to the season and I&apos;m on track for next year. We&apos;ll take this year as a stepping stone, there&apos;s a couple of goals that I&apos;d like to hit this season, so I think it&apos;ll end up being a successful year. You&apos;ve been keeping pretty busy too, we noticed on your Twitter feed that you&apos;ve been to Amsterdam, Venice and London in the last week. Yeah, I&apos;ve had a busy time lately, setting up the season. After Manchester, I&apos;m in Ostrava, then Portland, then New York then I&apos;ll be back here in the UK and Europe so it&apos;s a busy couple of months. Where&apos;s your favourite place to be? I must admit I quite like Mozambique, it&apos;s pretty unspoiled, pretty rural. It&apos;s a beautiful place, really low-key and down-to-earth and the people are friendly. I really enjoy it there, apart from the fact that there&apos;s no cell phone signal, although I guess that might be a perk. There are a couple of places that have captured my heart for different reasons, and that&apos;s one of them. You&apos;re going to be based in Italy for the season? Yeah, we&apos;re going to be based in Gemona, which is not far from Venice and Trieste. It&apos;s a beautiful city, very quiet, only about 1,500 people, but the facilities there are nice and it&apos;s quite central to fly anywhere in Europe so it&apos;ll be a nice place to stay. Now you&apos;re a Lazio fan \u2013will you have chance to get to the Stadio Olimpico? Yeah I should get some time for a game or two. I think being a Lazio supporter in Italy is not always a good thing, but it&apos;s a team that I&apos;ve supported from a young age. A friend of mine&apos;s parents came from Rome and I used to go to their house at the weekend to watch the games and it became second nature for me to shout for them. So I&apos;ve stuck to my guns there, though I must admit there&apos;s been some [CRACKLE, CRACKLE, CRACKLE] but there have been some good moments too. Did you manage to get to any World Cup matches? [CRACKLE, CRACKLE, CRACKLE continues ominously] I didn&apos;t unfortunately. Half of Europe went to South Africa, I think I was the only South African to come to Europe. I didn&apos;t get chance to see any, which was quite depressing for me, but I&apos;ve made athletics my No1 priority so I have to make sacrifices. Speaking of sacrifices, you&apos;ve lost a bit of weight I believe? [Chuckle] Yeah, I&apos;ve been quite strong in the past but my power-to-weight threshold could have been better. I&apos;m just about as strong as I was before, but I&apos;ve lost a kilogram or two. It could make a real difference. What are your top dieting tips? My top [FUZZY CRACKLE] Yeah, if I was going to lose a few pounds [FUZZY CRACKLING ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE] what advice would you give me? [STATIC SILENCE] Can you repeat that? If I was going to lose a few pounds \u2026 Hello? Sorry the signal is very bad. I think [CRACKLEFUZZYSTATICSILENCE] Hello? [SILENCE] [He&apos;s gone. A few minutes later the phone rings] Hello? Unplanned tunnel. Sorry about that. Not a problem. Can&apos;t hold you responsible for the layout of the British railway system. You were about to tell me about your top dieting tips. Just lots of veggies and no carbs after seven at night. Sound advice. What would you cook us if we came round for dinner? If we weren&apos;t on a diet that is. Oooh. I&apos;d make a homemade bread with jalapenos, then we&apos;d have a lasagne and then molten [?] pudding with chocolate truffles for dessert. That sounds really good although I don&apos;t really remember what it tastes like. So are you a bit of a chef in the kitchen? Yeah, I lived by myself for a couple of years so I&apos;m quite used to cooking and I really do enjoy it. You&apos;ve got a racehorse as well. How did that happen? I&apos;ve got a couple at the moment. I grouped up with a family who were very big on racehorses and I used to go and watch some races. The horseracing culture in South Africa is quite big. I&apos;ve got a horse that won the Epsom Derby and the Dubai Duty Free \u2013 it&apos;s a really top-bred horse, so hopefully we&apos;re going to travel a bit with him I&apos;m hoping. And when you&apos;re at the races do you stick your mortgage on the outsider or keep your powder dry? I&apos;m not much of a punter, I just really enjoy the sport. It&apos;s a beautiful, beautiful sport. Horses aren&apos;t the only animals in your life. You&apos;ve got a couple of white tigers too. Hahahaha. You&apos;ve really done your research [this is the first time anyone has ever said this to Small Talk. Ever]. Yeah, I keep them in my house and they&apos;re getting a bit big now, the male is 200kg and the female 150 or 160, so I&apos;m going to have to find something to do with them and I hope everything&apos;s in one piece when I get home. One question we always ask is &apos;Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?&apos; and it seems you might be able to give us a definite answer. I think a tiger. They&apos;re both the same weight up front but not at the back and I think they&apos;re used to fighting by themselves, they don&apos;t fight in a pack. One-on-one they&apos;d be best equipped for a fight. Your autobiography is Blade Runner \u2013 have you ever seen the film? I actually haven&apos;t. I&apos;ve got it on my computer, so I need to watch it. I should, I really should. What&apos;s your favourite film then, if you haven&apos;t seen that one? I really like Guy Ritchie films, old Stanley Kubrick films, Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, those are the movies I really enjoy. Do you ever do karaoke? I did karaoke in a Chinese bar in [OMINOUS FUZZY DISTORTION] about three or four years ago but that was probably the first and last time, not because I didn&apos;t enjoy it but because the people in the bar didn&apos;t enjoy it. It was the one that goes [ADOPTS DEEP VOICE] &quot;You got me on my knees, baby. Doo doo do doo.&quot; Hey? Oh, we&apos;re going through a tunnel so if the phone cuts off. Ah, Eric Clapton \u2026 I don&apos;t know [FUZZY STATIC] pretty dodgy. [POP! CRACKLE! SILENCE \u2026] [Small Talk begins to wonder if he&apos;s just pretending about all these tunnels. Two minutes later, during which time Small Talk has been whistling Layla, the phone rings once more.] Hello, hello? [Very, very faint, and sounding slightly sad] Hi Small Talk, sorry about that. Not to worry. Let&apos;s get to the important stuff. Charlize Theron or Minky van der Westhuizen? Ooh, Minky van der Westhuizen. Yeah, she&apos;s [OBSCURED BY STATICFUZZ that ends with a happy cackle]. She&apos;s just got divorced recently, not that I follow all the social movements. Have you ever seen a UFO? I&apos;ve probably thought that I&apos;ve seen a UFO, but I don&apos;t think it would have been one. Might have been a bit late in the day or early in the morning. What would you put in Room 101? Room 101? Oof. Erm. Jeez. I don&apos;t think [FUZZYSTATIC] asked a question like that before. [STATICFUZZINESS] like a cocktail bar? Er, OK. This is becoming slightly impossible. Last of all then, can you tell us a joke? Yes. I should be able to tell you a joke. [FUZZ! FUZZ!] sure. I&apos;m really slow today, nothing is coming to mind. [CCRRRACKLE STATIC! FUZZ! FUZZYSTATIC! Small Talk can just about make out something about letting a barking dog in to your house]. Great stuff. Possibly. Oscar thanks for your time. Thanks very much, Small Talk.

In stark, cool contrast to the hectic, less-than-lovely corner of 10th Avenue and 42nd Street outside, the airy lobby feels like the Starship Enterprise. To my left, a bank of airport-style touch-screen check-in machines; to my right, the Yobot, 18m of hydraulic arm guarding a giant wall of left-luggage lockers. The baggage beast is at rest, but the smartly attired staff, six of them in Star Trek-issue grey and purple uniforms, bid me a cheery welcome, and Julio, &quot;my&quot; doorman, ushers me to the self-service screens. Too many unexpected items in the bagging areas at Sainsbury&apos;s have made me suspicious of unmanned automation, but Julio is on hand to help, and the machine digests my details and spits out a room key. I must admit to having had reservations about the place. Yotel is the brainwave of Yo! Sushi supremo Simon Woodroffe, and his business partner, CEO Gerard Greene. The idea came to Woodroffe in 2007 after he was bumped up to first class on a flight and decided to try combining the clever use of space in Japanese pod hotels with the luxury elements of first-class air travel. Three smaller airport Yotels have proved successful at Heathrow, Gatwick and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, but the $315m New York outpost, which opened last week, is the pair&apos;s first city venture, and with 669 &quot;cabin&quot; rooms over 27 floors of &quot;affordable luxury&quot;, it&apos;s no minor undertaking. It&apos;s in a plum spot in Midtown, two blocks from Port Authority bus station (handy for airport connections), three blocks from Times Square, and four blocks from the airy oasis of Bryant Park and the ringing tills of Fifth Avenue. Central Park, the galleries and museums are a 30-minute stroll (or a $7 cab ride) away; even SoHo is just a 10-minute subway trip. My premium cabin, the basic room, begins at $149 a night (plus tax), which is not to be sniffed at in a city where affordable accommodation is found only in far-flung boroughs or bed-bug-happy hostels. The boutique hotels generally begin at around $300 a night for a room built for a Borrower. For $149, I feared an airless, beach-hut-size hovel, but I&apos;m pleasantly surprised. If I had a cat, I could certainly swing it. Yes, it is compact, at 12 square metres, but it&apos;s white and bright, with soft purple backlighting and a cunning use of space. The similarity to a Virgin upper-class cabin should probably not be surprising, since Soho (London) architects Softroom worked on both. The queen-size motorised bed is stored upright, giving extra floor space in front of the wall-mounted flatscreen TV, and a tray-table is stowed away in the bed&apos;s armrest. There&apos;s a neat work desk, an office-style chair and small storage spots underneath the TV for keys, wallet, phone and other travel ephemera. The bathroom too \u2013 though a little reminiscent of a clap clinic \u2013 is well-designed, with a monsoon shower, square sink and sliding glass door to the toilet, to preserve modesty and mystique. I stand five foot four on a tall day, so a compact cabin isn&apos;t an issue for me. So in the interests of thorough research \u2013 and thorough research alone \u2013 I invited a gentleman friend of greater stature to stop by and give me the verdict from his rather more lofty perspective. Even he found no need to fold himself up; once we&apos;d located the button to get the bed into the flat position, he could happily stretch his full six foot four self out unfettered. If you&apos;re reading this, Mum, he kept one large foot on the floor at all times. The only spatial issue is really that of storage: there&apos;s no wardrobe, just six hangers on two open hooks. Suitcases can be stashed away under the bed, but those heading to NYC to help the ailing American economy would struggle to store armfuls of Bloomingdale&apos;s bags. Larger cabins are available, from the corner rooms (15 square metres and only $20 a night more), to the first-class cabins, some of which feature terraces, hot tubs and outdoor dining tables. Three VIP suites, starting at $1,500, are blingtastic shag-pads with fireplaces, pool tables and pumping sound systems.     Spacious public areas at Yotel    Designed with the ethos of airline seating in mind, Yotels operate to a philosophy of functionality, so you won&apos;t find fripperies such as bathrobes, slippers or minibars in any of the rooms. Instead, there&apos;s free fast-connection Wi-Fi, complimentary continental breakfast, and guest fridges in the galley kitchens on each floor. There&apos;s no shortage of spacious public areas on the fourth floor, and the Studiyo has a cinema screen and yoga space. At night, these morph into social spaces for drinking, dining and hanging out. Back down on the fourth floor terrace, the sun is setting over the Hudson river two blocks to the west, throwing a golden glow over the Gotham skyscrapers of Midtown. The Chrysler Building glitters to the east as we sink exceptionally good cocktails in New York&apos;s newest rooftop bar. My leggy companion and I mop up a few mango and ginger martinis at the hotel&apos;s restaurant, Dohyo, named after the Japanese sumo wrestling ring, and where, like the cabin beds, the central bench tables are motorised, sinking into the wooden floor after service ends to form a dancefloor. The Asian-fusion menu is made up of small sharing plates \u2013 pork belly tacos, spicy tuna sushi, seared scallops and salt-and-pepper calamari \u2013 most priced between $6 and $12. With the atmosphere of an upmarket Wagamama, Dohyo deserves to be a destination in itself, particularly in this culinary dead-zone that is called (appropriately) Hell&apos;s Kitchen. Sated from the sumo ring, I wander back upstairs to my lodgings, and draw the blackout blind. The six lanes of traffic outside are silent, thanks to the super-insulated windows. The thing that does disturb my dreams, unfortunately, is the incessant heavy slamming of other cabin doors along the corridor. So the Yotel ain&apos;t the Ritz, but it isn&apos;t aiming to be. Give me a good location, a relaxed vibe and a reasonable price over a white-gloved waiter and a $40 breakfast surcharge any day. And give me another scrumptious mango martini as the sun sets over New York City. \u2022 Virgin Atlantic (virgin-atlantic.com) flies from Heathrow to JFK from about \u00a3405 return", "sentences": ["Three smaller airport Yotels have proved successful at Heathrow, Gatwick and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, but the $315m New York outpost, which opened last week, is the pair&apos;s first city venture, and with 669 &quot;cabin&quot; rooms over 27 floors of &quot;affordable luxury&quot;, it&apos;s no minor undertaking."], "title": "Hotel review: Yotel, New York", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/11/yotel-new-york-hotel-review", "tags": ["New York holidays", "Hotels", "United States holidays", "City breaks", "Short breaks", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-12T21:45:52Z", "article": "Alex McLeish resigned as Birmingham City manager on Sunday , fuelling speculation that he is on the verge of making a controversial cross-city move by taking over at Aston Villa. Birmingham&apos;s acting chairman, Peter Pannu, received an email from McLeish in which the manager informed him of his desire to leave St Andrew&apos;s with immediate effect. While the 52-year-old&apos;s decision came as a surprise, it had been rumoured for some weeks that McLeish&apos;s already fractious relationship with the Birmingham board was close to disintegration. &quot;Birmingham City Football Club can confirm that Alex McLeish has resigned as manager,&quot; read a statement on the club&apos;s website. &quot;Acting chairman Peter Pannu received an email resignation from McLeish earlier today while away on business in Amsterdam. No further comment will be made at this moment in time and updates will be released in due course.&quot; Aston Villa would not comment and McLeish&apos;s phone was not accepting calls. Nor was his agent returning calls. McLeish pledged his loyalty to Birmingham after their relegation from the Premier League on the final day of last season but he received only lukewarm support from the board 24 hours later. A statement said the Scot &quot;was expected to lead the side back to the Premier League in the 2011-12 season&quot;. That would have had to be achieved under tight financial restraints and after the likely sale of key players this summer, most notably the centre-backs Scott Dann and Roger Johnson. Such conditions did not appeal to McLeish, who took over at Birmingham in November 2007. Following relegation to the Championship at the end of that season he took the club back to the Premier League at the first time of asking but down and up again in the next two seasons before they finished ninth in 2009-10 and then won the Carling Cup in February,\u00a0beating Arsenal 2-1 in the final at Wembley to secure a first major trophy for the club since 1963. As Birmingham supporters prepare to welcome only their third permanent manager in 15 years, they must also face the possibility of McLeish taking up the reigns of their most bitter rivals. He was linked with the managerial vacancy at Aston Villa yesterday morning and following his exit from St Andrew&apos;s has become the odds-on favourite to become the first man to move directly between the two Birmingham clubs since Ron Saunders went the other way in 1982. It seems inconceivable that McLeish would walk out on a contract which had two years left to run, and which would have earned him close to \u00a34m, without having another job lined up. Moving to Aston Villa would allow him an instant return to the Premier League. An appointment at Villa Park, however, would be a major surprise, given McLeish&apos;s links to Birmingham and the fact that he led the Blues to two relegations in three years. For those reasons McLeish is hardly likely to be a popular choice among Villa supporters as the replacement for the unpopular Frenchman G\u00e9rard Houllier. Furthermore, given that Randy Lerner, the club&apos;s owner, changed his mind about interviewing Steve McClaren for the manager&apos;s post last week, following protests from fans, the American&apos;s apparent desire to employ McLeish becomes even more curious. There is a feeling that Lerner has run out of options following the departure of Houllier at the start of the month. His first choice, Carlo Ancelotti, decided he wanted to take a 12-month sabbatical after being sacked by Chelsea, while Lerner&apos;s interest in Mark Hughes cooled significantly in reaction to the nature of the Welshman&apos;s departure from Fulham. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, another target, decided he did not want the job and Roberto Mart\u00ednez was interviewed for the post on Friday but chose to stay at Wigan. Villa have also sounded out the Everton manager, David Moyes, and Bolton&apos;s Owen Coyle but both have stated a desire to stay where they are.", "sentences": ["&quot;Acting chairman Peter Pannu received an email resignation from McLeish earlier today while away on business in Amsterdam."], "title": "Alex McLeish resigns from Birmingham and may move to Aston Villa", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/12/alex-mcleish-birmingham-aston-villa", "tags": ["Alex McLeish", "Birmingham City", "Aston Villa", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-13T19:43:26Z", "article": "Birmingham City are considering placing Alex McLeish on gardening leave and applying for an injunction to stop the manager from joining Aston Villa, as they seek up to \u00a35.4m compensation over his proposed cross-city defection. Peter Pannu, Birmingham&apos;s acting chairman, and senior management at the club held a series of meetings with lawyers on Monday as they came to terms with McLeish&apos;s decision to resign via email 24 hours earlier. Pannu, who described the former Scotland manager&apos;s actions as &quot;irresponsible&quot;, has refused to accept the resignation and is investigating whether McLeish has been &quot;tapped up&quot;. The Scot is the firm favourite to succeed G\u00e9rard Houllier at Villa Park, although Birmingham&apos;s arch rivals, who have sought clarification on the legal situation across the city, have yet to make an official approach. Pannu said on Monday night he would be &quot;getting an injunction preventing Villa from hiring him&quot; and said he would also be complaining to the Premier League. McLeish signed a new three-year contract in September and, although he was prepared to waive a lucrative payoff by quitting while on holiday in Italy, Birmingham want maximum compensation for the 52-year-old before they allow him to talk to another club. The prospect of putting McLeish on gardening leave until Villa, or any prospective employer, meet their severance demands has been considered at St Andrew&apos;s. &quot;He is still our contracted staff and Birmingham City FC does not grant him any right to speak to any outsiders until the matter is resolved,&quot; said Pannu. &quot;It&apos;s about time discipline is instilled into this game and I am not a person who gets pushed about.&quot; Birmingham&apos;s acting chairman, who was in Amsterdam when he received McLeish&apos;s email, said: &quot;Just as I am flying back, Alex emails me of his resignation. This is so irresponsible.&quot; McLeish has endured a strained relationship with the Birmingham hierarchy since Carson Yeung&apos;s takeover and was particularly aggrieved at the reaction to the club&apos;s recent relegation, when Pannu publicly announced the manager&apos;s job was safe &quot;but the board will expect him to lead the side back to the Premier League in the 2011-12 season&quot;. Villa&apos;s willingness to consider a manager who led their rivals to a first major trophy in 48 years, the Carling Cup in February, but also to relegation in the same season has stunned the second city and prompted a furious response on either side of the divide. More than 6,000 people have signed up to a Facebook page in protest at the prospect of McLeish joining Villa but, unlike with the decision to withdraw an interview offer to Steve McClaren following a negative public reaction, Randy Lerner is understood to be prepared to pursue this more controversial appointment. The former Villa and England manager Graham Taylor insisted McLeish had &quot;a hardness&quot; and strength of character to handle the vitriol that would accompany his proposed move, but claimed the Lerner regime have mishandled the issue of Houllier&apos;s replacement. Taylor said: &quot;It just doesn&apos;t appear to have been thought through and for the first time the ownership of the club is coming under severe criticism. &quot;When G\u00e9rard became ill it must have occurred to them that he may not come back, even if the signs were that he may have returned. This is not being disrespectful to Gerard in any way, but once he became unwell then you have to immediately start exploring what you might do if he does not come back.

Her father, Dr Otto Frank, was there to receive a gold statuette of the cloven-hoofed god Pan, the reason being that Anne&apos;s diary had sold a million copies as a Pan paperback. Dr Frank is a tall, gentle, dignified man of 82. He holds his head erect and speaks softly, almost shyly. He has lived through enough ugliness not to let a publicity reception dent his pride. While waitresses drifted about with trays of canapes, he stood in a corner and answered questions. How did he live with the memory of Anne? How did he survive the concentration camp? What did he think of young people today? Only once did he demur. &quot;You will have to forgive me,&quot; he said &quot;if I am sometimes a little emotional.&quot; Exactly 29 years ago Anne, hiding from the SS with her Dutch-Jewish family in an old building in Amsterdam, made the first entry in her diary at the age of 13. For two years, in spite of stifling privations, she recorded her growing up with increasing sensitivity and detachment. The diary survived a raid by the SS and has been published in 46 countries. Anne and her family \u2013 all except Dr Frank \u2013 died in concentration camps. There was applause as Dr Frank&apos;s hand was shaken by the managing director of Pan and the statuette was handed over. Dr Frank hesitated and then said: &quot;The gift I accept with great feeling. It is natural that I accept it in memory of Anna. I think back to the time we were in the building and everything which happened. Old as I am, it gives me a certain satisfaction \u2013 Anna&apos;s wish to live on in the hearts of many people is in a certain sense fulfilled.&quot; He said afterwards: &quot;I am a very optimistic man. I try not to think of it the way it was at the time. But I am remembered every day because I get letters every day. I live on and have a duty.&quot; Part of that duty is the Anne Frank Foundation which preserves the &quot;secret annexe&quot; in the old building in Amsterdam and runs adult education courses. The annexe is recovering from financial losses. Dr Frank has married again, but has\u00a0no more children. His wife Fritzi was also in Auschwitz and her daughter used to play with Anne. The Frank family now lives in Basle, Switzerland, where Anne&apos;s diary is kept in a bank vault.

I came back from New York in April feeling a bit like a girl in an Amsterdam window who&apos;d had a few good days: richer no doubt, but a bit shagged out. After a couple of months off, we dealers reunite in June, more in hope than economic expectation, at the London Antiquarian Book Fair at Olympia. I, of course, had a terrific time. I revelled in the company of my fellow dealers, adored and was instructed by my customers, met with the public in my usual spirit of curiosity and good fellowship. But, a few booths away, one of my dealing colleagues was in a state of obvious misery, and his sighs of discomfort and occasional groans of misery could be heard halfway across the Exhibition Hall. Concerned, I wandered over. He looked terrible, grey and sweaty, clearly in considerable psychological distress. &quot;I can&apos;t take any more,&quot; he moaned. &quot;More of what?&quot; I asked, in my most caring voice. &quot;Dealing with the bloody public. They drive me mad!&quot; I have never suffered from this affliction, and asked for some details. &quot;Categories,&quot; he said, &quot;they fall into different categories. I could compose a bloody taxonomy of the pathology of the book collector, but it would certainly be the last thing I&apos;d ever do. It would rupture my spleen, or my heart if I had one anymore.&quot; &quot;What categories?&quot; I asked, innocently intrigued. He paused, mopped his brow with an already sopping shirt cuff, and took (another) swig from his hip flask. He lowered his voice. &quot;There&apos;s one of them just leaving,&quot; he said, &quot;look at him, bloody time-waster!&quot; In the distance a portly man with wild grey hair was staggering under the weight of a plastic bag filled with reading matter. &quot;Bought a lot, did he?&quot; I asked. &quot;Looks a nice fellow. Good for him. Sell him anything?&quot; &quot;A catalogue collector,&quot; he said. &quot;He comes every year. He has never bought a book, just collects everybody&apos;s catalogues and goes home.&quot; &quot;Seems harmless,&quot; I said. &quot;Probably an academic.&quot; &quot;I hate them,&quot; he said, &quot;but not as much as I hate browsers.&quot; &quot;Browsers? What&apos;s wrong with that? That is what fairs are for.&quot; &quot;Yeah, they look at every book on the stand, and handle them without any care or attention. Sometimes they check all the prices, and if they find a book you have forgotten to price, they call it to your attention. And even if it was a first edition of Ulysses, which they had virtually torn the covers off, if you said &apos;that one is five pounds&apos;, they would nod smugly and put it back\u2026.&quot; &quot;Never mind,&quot; I said, &quot;at least they call your attention to your own negligence. Think of it as a helpful service!&quot; He snorted. &quot;Helpful? They are the worst, that lot, who want to help you. They come up to inform you that the copy you have on display is actually a fourth issue, second state, not a third issue, first state. Who gives a damn? But the very worst are the Abe-chappies.&quot; &quot;Never heard of them\u2026&quot; &quot;Of course you bloody have. They go round with their iPhones tuned in to Abebooks, checking the prices on the net against your stock. One bloke just told me I was a robber because he found a cheaper copy of my Maria Edgworth in New Zealand. And another idiot wanted to sell me a copy of Animal Farm for 10% less than they have it at in the front aisle&quot; \u2013 he gestured towards the only source of light, from the darkness in which his booth resided, to the expansive stand of a very expensive London dealer, whose obvious prosperity is a constant reminder to other dealers that they are no good at what they do. &quot;Well,&quot; I observed, &quot;the more information that is available\u2026&quot; &quot;\u2026 the worse the decisions that get made,&quot; he concluded sourly. &quot;And the more knowledgeable and enthusiastic the collector, the more time they soak up. I just had a lady here for 40 minutes telling me about how much she adored Doris Lessing. She gave me a potted biography of the damned woman, then a pr\u00e9cis of her works, then an account of which she owned and which she needed\u2026&quot; &quot;So did you sell her one then?&quot; I asked, noticing a couple of Lessing firsts on his shelves. &quot;Didn&apos;t show the slightest interest. They never do, they&apos;re just pathetic and have no friends. That&apos;s why they&apos;re here.&quot; &quot;At least she&apos;s keen,&quot; I said wisely. &quot;No, she is a bore. The whole Book Fair is full of bores\u2026&quot; &quot;Steady now,&quot; I said with some asperity, unwilling to have my many bibliofriends maligned. &quot;\u2026 and what&apos;s more they know they are bores, so they stand six inches in front of your face so you can&apos;t turn away, then grab hold of your sleeve to keep you in your place, listening. I had one this morning, and I tried to get away, so I moved my right foot back. He moved his left foot into the empty place. Then I moved to the side. He followed. I backed up, he moved forward. It went on like this for 10 minutes, and when he finally left, the dealer in the next booth asked why I had been waltzing in the aisle with him?&quot; He shuddered. &quot;One of them spits when he talks \u2026&quot; He wiped his cheek with a dirty handkerchief at the memory. I&apos;d had enough by now, and made a move back to my booth, but the poor chap was just starting, and it would have been cruel to leave him. &quot;The dealers,&quot; he said venomously, &quot;are even worse! They look at your stock as if it were covered in manure. Then they ask you how sales are going, before divulging that they have just sold a Sheik \u00a3200000-worth of fine bindings.&quot; &quot;Perhaps you&apos;re jealous?&quot; I observed shrewdly. &quot;Damn right I am, and they wipe your nose in it. And here I am, barely paying my costs, having to eat the disgusting food the so-called caterers provide at prices you could buy an early Martin Amis first for\u2026&quot; He grabbed hold of my shirt sleeve, and moved closer. Clearly he was still in a state of some mental disturbance, but talking had calmed him somewhat, and colour had returned to his cheeks. &quot;Thanks mate,&quot; he said, &quot;helps to get it off the old chest.&quot; &quot;Just part of the service,&quot; I said, relieved to be getting away, and gratified that my interest had helped him. Perhaps, I thought to myself, there is a genuine role to be played here, for this splenetic and desperate member of my trade was by no means unique. Too many were stewing away in the little booths, as I sat happily in my own, surrounded by my fellow lovers of rare books. Some sort of therapist? Perhaps there should be a biblio-encounter group, where they could swap stories and ventilate fears under the guidance of a more balanced and sanguine member of the trade? Surely that would help. I think I know just the right person.", "sentences": ["I came back from New York in April feeling a bit like a girl in an Amsterdam window who&apos;d had a few good days: richer no doubt, but a bit shagged out."], "title": "When custom stales for the bookseller | Rick Gekoski", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/15/custom-stales-bookseller-rick-gekoski", "tags": ["Booksellers", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-16T12:08:00Z", "article": "Each month, the Music Alliance Pact \u2013 a group of 36 music blogs from around the world, including this one \u2013 simultaneously post tracks chosen by each blog.

His instrumental Teenage Fantod, named after a &quot;an archaic phrase for quivery anxiety used a lot by David Foster Wallace&quot;, was described as &quot;effortlessly lovely and languid&quot; in a recent New Band of the Day column, adding that it was &quot;pop music with experimental urges and precious little retro intent&quot;. ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieMarcelo Ezquiaga - El Gaucho Vive y Muere En Su Ley       Although Hombre Golpe is his second album as a solo artist, Marcelo Ezquiaga&apos;s career started with a musical project called Mi Tortuga Montreaux, which gave us three amazing records between 2003 and 2006. El Gaucho Vive y Muere En Su Ley is one of our favorite songs from this new work, which comprises his acoustic-pop signature with strong melodies and fine arrangements. As he likes to say: rock without guitars. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Mildlife - Milk &amp; Wool       Milk &amp; Wool is a sweet jam and the first we&apos;ve heard from Mildlife - a new loose, electronic outfit from Melbourne. It&apos;s a good sign from a band that manages to mix light and dark with interesting production and a strong pop sensibility.  BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoEskimo - Cavalo De Fogo       It&apos;s hard to define Cavalo De Fogo, the first single from Eskimo&apos;s debut album. The breadth of genres covered, including pop and alternative, results in some intriguing music. One of the highlights of the current Brazilian indie scene. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicSocalled - Work With What You Got       Hip-hop? Klezmer? Folk? Pop? Gospel? Some insane, wonderful combination of all of that (and then some)? There&apos;s so much going on on Socalled&apos;s newest album, Sleepover, that I have no idea how I&apos;d classify it. Oh wait, I do: as a simply great album. Work With What You Got captures the album&apos;s sense of fun, but only shows a fraction of the wide range of genres it displays. CHILE       Super 45Adrianigual - Arde Santiago       After a four-year break, Adrianigual is back. Big time. Their new album, \u00c9xito Mundial (released on Sello Cazador), is a punk-hearted but dancefloor-driven collection of feverish songs. Arde Santiago is their second single. CHINA       WooozyAM444 - Eye Wonder       AM444 is the Shanghai-based project of singer ChaCha (Kode9, Clive Chin, Jimi Tenor, Desto, etc) and Dutch producer/DJ Jay.Soul (Mr. Windmill &amp; Jay.Soul, Sole Profit, Cecilia Stalin, etc). After years of thoughts, discussions and drunken promises, the pair have finally been in the studio for the past few months and the result is their eight-song debut release Eye Wonder. It&apos;s a jazzy, funked up, dubbed out Chinese language sonic assault and some of the most exciting music to come out of Shanghai in a while, already receiving radio play in London, LA, Europe and around Asia. Eye Wonder is a landmark release for Chinese underground music. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaMarita - Peque\u00f1a       Marita has been writing lyrics since she was a little girl, although she never knew where they would end up. The single Peque\u00f1a (&quot;Little Girl&quot;) is a resume of her own history and a good illustration of her electro-rock sound. DENMARK       All ScandinavianWhy Don&apos;t We Love Lucy - With You       In March, Danish/Norwegian quartet Why Don&apos;t We Love Lucy released their debut EP, CPH-OSL, which serves up foot-moving club-funk-pop (slap bass included) with a light ring of the 80s and 90s to the five catchy tracks. A new EP is in the works, with a release planned for this autumn, but here&apos;s the excellent With You from the debut for you to enjoy. ESTONIA       PopopBarthol Lo Mejor - Pick Up Track       You&apos;ve never partied this wild! Barthol Lo Mejor jumpstarts your night with trash electro. It sounds fresh, upbeat and raw like Justice, MSTRKRFT and Huoratron. His performance drives you further, guiding you with his signature sound and bouncing around in a flashy outfit to provide vanity, energy and edge. Don&apos;t just listen - enjoy it all. FINLAND       GlueSatellite Stories - Family       These four young lads from the Arctic city of Oulu play music to bring you nostalgia from events you never really experienced, like the 60s, the first kiss from your elementary school crush and the time you and your best friend bought that awesome 45 single and listened it on your parents&apos; record player. Satellite Stories bring all these feelings with cheerful and fast-paced indie music influenced by Vampire Weekend and The Wombats. FRANCE       Yet You&apos;re FiredMondrian - Or Unicorn       Mondrian are a young Parisian pop band formed in 2007. After releasing their first EP last year, Popshop, they dropped another one, Whippersnapper, just a month ago. Catchy beats, fresh voices and a talent for writing will surely bring them some success. They take everything that&apos;s good in pop to make the best out of it, creating addictive and lovely songs with a high-repeat listening potential. GERMANY       BlogparteiPetula - Wives       Where have they been all these years: playful electro-inspired German artists writing and reinterpreting great songs? Berlin-based Petula definitely is one of those with a wide and emphatic spectrum of styles. Wives is a wary, slightly more uptempo, more electronic cover of a Savoy Grand song. It has just been released on a split EP with all-girl band Candelilla. GREECE       MouxlalouloudaGravitysays_i - The Urge Of Identity / The Figures Of Enormous Grey    classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"350\" height=\"26\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\">    It&apos;s hard not to stare in open-mouthed amazement at the sheer brilliance of Gravitysays_i&apos;s superbly executed, intensely creative and nearly flawless sophomore album, The Figures Of Enormous Grey And The Patterns Of Fraud. They bring together experimental, dark, atmospheric elements along with Greek and Eastern traditional music and examine social values, institutions and morality as an extension of individual, as well as collective, conscience with an emotional clarity and narrative acuity that makes it an undeniable triumph. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaMorning After Youth - Lived    classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"350\" height=\"26\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\">    Morning After Youth is a four-piece band with a smooth and artsy sound to their music. They are working on their first album which will hopefully be ready this summer. Lived was recorded in the famous Studio S\u00fdrland with Adda 800 and B\u00f6rkur. INDIA       IndiecisionGoddess Gagged - Visionary       Goddess Gagged is a metal band from Mumbai. The band channel melodic post-hardcore in the vein of acts like Architects and Alexisonfire, a foundation given legs by frontman Siddharth Basrur&apos;s almost effervescent vocal delivery. Visionary is a new track, presumably from the band&apos;s upcoming debut album. We suggest you keep your eyes and ears open for that. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarPolyester Embassy - Space Travel Rock N Roll       Polyester Embassy have a deep affection for noises, sounds and a vintage synthesizer. After years of experimenting, they&apos;re bringing out a second album which sounds like Pink Floyd/Flaming Lips/Mogwai/Ride/Spiritualized mixed raw into their own style. IRELAND       Nialler9Ghost Estates - Paris       The members of the newly-formed Ghost Estates were previously of two pretty different bands SickBoy and 8Ball. Their new band may be named &quot;after the thousands of abandoned housing estates built in Ireland during the Celtic Tiger boom years&quot; but there&apos;s plenty going on in their music, from 80s guitar to processed beats to a spoken word interludes and, I kid you not, a treated saxophone solo.  ISRAEL       Metal IsraelSumo Elevator - Pedal Horse       Sumo Elevator is a group of five ex-metalheads with short hair mixing prog-rock/metal, electronica jazz and breakbeat into intense atmospheric electro-fusion pop-rock. Their eclectic line-up consists of traditional rock/jazz instruments (electric guitar, bass guitar and acoustic drums) and turntables, noise boxes, samplers and modern synthesizers. With two years of live performance and studio experience under their belts, Sumo Elevator is about to release a full-length album in 2011 called Breakfast, which Pedal Horse is taken from. ITALY       PolaroidKaribean - We Need The Sun       First day at the sea. The sun is shining, friends all around, Beach Boys playing on the jukebox, see The Housemartins on a surf, meet Vampire Weekend at the bar. It&apos;s all just perfect. One last thing: go here and download Karibean&apos;s free debut EP. It would be the icing on the cake. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaPellejos - Abuelita       Take some inspiration from Jack Kerouac&apos;s Mexico City Blues and recite it on a cantina filled with the country&apos;s intellectual cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, then leave them dumbfounded with the evocation of images of decay, corruption and nihilism. Pellejos started in 2005 when some refusing-to-age contemporary art-farts took a late chance to form a band led by visual artist (now bassist) Daniel Guzm\u00e1n. What seemed to be just some art-wank has endured six years of sporadic gigs that led to bear a (rotten) fruit with a debut LP - a fetid collection of ethylic spoken word from the hoarse mouth of vocalist Ignacio Perales, backed by what sounds like Tindersticks from the Third World. Abuelita is just a random nonsense collection of excuses to fall back into old patterns of drinking. Cheers! NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamSkip &amp; Die - La Cumbia Dictadura       Skip &amp; Die is a Netherlands-based outfit that began as a globally-infused collaboration between South African vocalist/visual artist Cata.Pirata and producer Jori Collignon (also of Dutch electronic experimentalists C-Mon &amp; Kypski and Nobody Beats The Drum), although these days they&apos;re a fully-fledged live band. Via their travels through the towns and cities of South Africa, they&apos;ve forged a contemporary and vibrant wall of sound that mixes electro, hip hop, Afrobeat and South American grooves. While specialising in sexy party bass hits that remind at times of Diplo&apos;s Major Lazer, there&apos;s always a more considered side to their art than simply noise and dance as Music Alliance Pact exclusive La Cumbia Dictadura shows. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalCool Cult - Skulls       New Zealand&apos;s best young exponents of shoegaze styled no-wave. Described by UK music blog Sonic Masala as &quot;beautifully formed nuggets of sound that are brimming with exuberance and ebullience&quot;, Cool Cult&apos;s noisy rhetoric is a mixture of early Deerhunter and discordant Canadian punk wizards Women. Their debut album Try Crunch is full of carcinogenic guitar hooks and elegant vocal melodies, with a refreshingly mature approach to constructing traditional pop music. Skulls is the band&apos;s first single, featuring an observantly sleepy vocal melody overwhelmed by a crushing wave of distorted guitar. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceIhab - \u00c6 M\u00e5 F\u00e6r       Who would have thought that Bod\u00f8, a small city in northern Norway, would harbor so much good indie. So far there&apos;s Cold Mailman, Kollwitz, Kr\u00e5kes\u00f8lv and now Gabriel and Ihab, both on newly started Beyond Records. Ihab make quirky indie-rock reminiscent of 90s heroes like Pavement and Built To Spill as well as newer bands like Cymbal Eat Guitars and Algernon Cadwallader. PERU       SoTBIv\u00e1n Fajardo - Calma       Iv\u00e1n Fajardo is a constant in the musical innovation of Lima. In the first edition of MAP in October 2008, we had ERA, his band at that time. More recently Ivan has been working alone. Calma is the first preview of his new direction. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Kubik - Shina-Kak       Victor Afonso, a musician, music teacher and cinephile, had his first release as Kubik in 1999. Since then he has had a steady flow of releases and collaborations. His great love for cinema and music for films shows in his work. His talent has been recognized by artists such as Mike Patton, who invited him to open for Fant\u00f4mas. Shina-Kak is an exclusive download for MAP, taken from Psicotic Jazz Hall, which has just been released. ROMANIA      Babylon NoiseToulouse Lautrec - Yesman       With a name that recalls the famous French painter, the Bucharest trio started in 2009 as an alternative rock band with post-punk flavours. Although their image in the Romanian media is promoted through neo-Dadaist elements, there is nothing absurd in their music. The prominent basslines and the upfront beats remind me of Editors but without those dark guitar riffs. Whimsical and witty, Toulouse Lautrec is what you need now to give your day a push. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopSong Of Return - Trajectory       Trajectory simmers menacingly in a premeditated assault to the senses for two minutes before the drums crash in like a lightning strike and you very quickly realise your Facebook &apos;like&apos; button just isn&apos;t going to suffice. The Glasgow-based alternative dance band (who will appeal to fans of Delphic) is fronted by Craig Grant, formerly of Union Of Knives, and also features Louis Abbott, singer of Admiral Fallow, one of this country&apos;s best new bands. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Humming Kitten - Monochrome       Little is known of Humming Kitten, and we get the impression they&apos;d like to keep it that way. It is a little disconcerting at first, approaching this musical project without any preconceived ideas of who or what the band members are, and appreciating their musical ideas purely at face value and on first impressions. However, once you soak it all in, you might feel that they&apos;ve been there all along, lurking at your blogs or gigs. Revealing the chief conspirator as an entity known as Keyboard Cat, and that they favour a lo-fi noise-pop approach to their pieces, Humming Kitten ultimately sound so lonely with solitude as their ally. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Simfonika Island - African Sunset       Simfonika Island is a project made up of two very talented individuals, Gianni Capri and Donny Halo. Both have diverse musical backgrounds, one from a very DJ-orientated world and one from a band. With African Sunset comes a song that crosses South African house with the influences of house music from New York City and Europe, all accompanied with some stirring piano and a dash of deep groove. It&apos;s magical.  SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKPigibit5 - Y.O.N.H.A       Sweet indie-pop act Pigibit5 claims kitsch to be the best description of its music, which is heavily based around a twee-pop and chamber-pop sound, also citing influences from folk and hard rock. The band is what remains of Pirigwa - where Ireland&apos;s So Cow on occasion could be found playing an instrument or two - and the members have returned to their former label, Beatball, with the release of first full-length album Cherryboy Revolution a few weeks ago. Y.O.N.H.A is a cheerful tune with a retro pop sound. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerFur Voice - Wimp       Fur Voice is the stage name of David Gracia, an actor and singer born in Murcia and living in Barcelona since 2006. Inspired by electronic and psychedelic acts such as Grizzly Bear and Animal Collective, Fur Voice builds a dark extraterrestrial atmosphere in his debut album, Onto Endo (self-produced and self-released). The first single off Onto Endo, Wimp, takes the best from noise, post-rock and psychedelia and turns it into a dreamy, catchy, epic tune with an ending that leaves you wanting more. SWEDEN      SwedespleaseSummer Heart - Please Stay       It&apos;s almost spring which means summer is still a while away. But we can dream, can&apos;t we? That&apos;s where this song from Malm\u00f6-based band Summer Heart comes in. It&apos;s called Please Stay, but with its Beach Boys harmonies, groovy beat and summer feeling, it may as well be the band&apos;s coup d&apos;\u00e9tat. SWITZERLAND       78sHuck Finn - Sofia       Huck Finn is the moniker of two singer-songwriters who teamed up for a project. Four years ago they won a few music prizes in Switzerland but they struggled to deliver a proper record. On the second attempt they succeeded. Breaking In, their debut album, is bombastic and emotional at the same time. Sofia, their first radio single, will make you weep like a dog. UNITED STATES     The flag of the United States of America     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingDale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. - Morning Thought       The Detroit duo released their full-length debut, It&apos;s A Corporate World, earlier this month, just in time for summer. It&apos;s the perfect season for this record too, full of catchy guitar riffs, melodious vocal harmonies and an added layer of production missing from their earlier works. Morning Thought hops along with glitchy effects, handclaps and enough thoughtful xylophone to keep wandering ears at bay. VENEZUELA     Flag of Venezuela     M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sElefreak feat.

It all sounds very secretive, but the vibe inside is remarkably laid-back and friendly.

Once inside, the ferocity of the sound system soon takes hold of the crowd as they lap up cheap bottled beer and enjoy the freedom to smoke anywhere in the building (often much to the annoyance of non-smokers).

While Supperclub has always prided itself on being an ambassador for freedom, art and expression, it unwillingly developed a reputation as being exclusively for &quot;beautiful people&quot;, and became overrun with rich tourists who had little sense of rhythm or fun. However, in recent months a few more gritty parties, hosted by some of Amsterdam&apos;s brightest young DJs, are re-establishing the club as a purveyor of cutting-edge music.

The crowd here is made up of mature arty types reliving their hedonistic youth, ogling one another and quite often playing air guitar on the tables. On paper, it sounds like a bit of a nightmare, but the anything-goes atmosphere and hormone-fueled flirtations between the clientele make this a thoroughly entertaining night out. The music is a fun mix of northern soul, surf rock and 1970s disco; basically every genre that has a tendency to make people electric slide their way to the bar.

These measurements tell us a lot about the strong nuclear force, which holds the atomic nucleus together and is one of the four known fundamental forces. We talk a lot about how the LHC may find &quot;new physics&quot;, by which we often mean new particles (such as the Higgs boson) or new forces, or even wilder stuff like extra dimensions of space-time. However we also have a lot of new physics to learn about the forces we already know of, especially the strong force. Strong forces in general are tricky, by which I mean they can lead to consequences which are impossible to predict with current techniques. Even something as well-known as the mass of the proton cannot yet be predicted properly from a &quot;first principles&quot; knowledge of the strong force, even though we have every reason to believe it is largely responsible. Anyway, I remembered a quote I used in a talk nearly ten years ago, from Martinus Veltman, who won the Nobel prize in 1999 with Gerardus T&apos;Hooft for work on fundamental forces. The quote was something like:  If the Large Hadron Collider finds a Higgs boson and Supersymmetry, nature will have missed a golden opportunity to force us to understand strongly-interacting quantum field theories   (Nobel Prize winner Martinus Veltman, possibly) What he meant was, if there is a Higgs boson and supersymmetry within reach of the LHC, our current techniques for solving quantum field theories will be &quot;good enough&quot; to understand them. But if there is no Higgs, a very likely outcome is that even the weak and electromagnetic forces become strong, and therefore badly understood, at LHC energies. In this scenario, if we want to understand anything, improving our understanding of strong forces in general would be essential. Of course, my point was we should do this anyway, since we know one of the fundamental forces is strong. I wanted to use the quote again, so I went searching for the source on the internet like you do. I knew the words might not be exact, so I tried the usual tricks of different combinations of words in google and so on. No joy.  In desperation, I went searching for my own talk, in which I knew I had used the quote. I had to dig out an old password to get into the site (the ZEUS experiment in Hamburg), but in the end I tracked my slides down. Only to find in there the approximate quote, with the words:  (paraphrased... couldn&apos;t find the exact quote this morning)  (Jon Butterworth, being sloppy ten years ago.) Damn.  I met Veltman at Nikhef, the Dutch national subatomic physics lab in Amsterdam. He was associated with the lab so they were celebrating his Nobel, and by coincidence I was giving a seminar there and got invited to the party. I drank quite a bit of champagne, and, a bit star-struck, got the great man to sign my Rough Guide to Amsterdam:       I suppose it is remotely possible that I actually got the quote direct from him at this party. If so, I hope the paraphrase is accurate. For completeness, the video of the CERN seminar is here, but it&apos;s really aimed at particle physicists so I&apos;m not recommending it for relaxed Sunday afternoon viewing. And I didn&apos;t use the quote in the end, since I couldn&apos;t attribute it properly. If anyone reading this can give me a source for it or something like it, I will be very grateful (and will probably use it again in the future).", "sentences": ["I met Veltman at Nikhef, the Dutch national subatomic physics lab in Amsterdam.", "I drank quite a bit of champagne, and, a bit star-struck, got the great man to sign my Rough Guide to Amsterdam:       I suppose it is remotely possible that I actually got the quote direct from him at this party."], "title": "Quantum fields and missing quotes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2011/jun/19/1", "tags": ["Science"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-20T12:16:00Z", "article": "Trieste is unlike any other Italian city, and has been part of La Repubblica for less than a century.

The study found that growing meat in the lab rather than slaughtering animals would generate only a tiny fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with conventional livestock production. The researchers believe their work suggests artificial meat could help feed the growing world population while reducing the impact on the environment. According to the analysis by scientists from Oxford University and Amsterdam University, lab-grown tissue would reduce greenhouse gases by up to 96% in comparison to raising animals. The process would require between 7% and 45% less energy than the same volume of conventionally produced meat such as pork, beef, or lamb, and could be engineered to use only 1% of the land and 4% of the water associated with conventional meat. &quot;The environmental impacts of cultured meat could be substantially lower than those of meat produced in the conventional way,&quot; said Hanna Tuomisto, the researcher at Oxford University who led the study. &quot;We are not saying that we could, or would necessarily want to, replace conventional meat with its cultured counterpart right now. &quot;However, our research shows that cultured meat could be part of the solution to feeding the world&apos;s growing population and at the same time cutting emissions and saving both energy and water. Simply put, cultured meat is potentially a much more efficient and environmentally friendly way of putting meat on the table.&quot; Aside from its predicted environmental benefits, lab-cultured meat should also provide cheap nutrition, and would help improve animal welfare as well as potentially taking huge pressure off farmland around the world. Animal protein is an increasing part of diets, as millions of people in rapidly emerging economies such as China and India are drawn out of poverty and become able to afford more meat in their diets. The pressure this creates has been an important factor in rapidly rising grain prices, deforestation in the Amazon, increasing water scarcity and rising pressure to find new farmland, leading to &quot;land grabs&quot; where countries such as China buy up farmland in poorer nations. Tuomisto predicts that if more resources are put into the research, the first commercially lab-grown meat could be available within five years. The first samples are likely to be like mincemeat in texture, while producing steaks could take at least five years longer. &quot;We can demonstrate that it is possible, but it is expensive. Getting to [commercial production] depends on more money being put into this research,&quot; she said. The anti-meat organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is already funding research into the technique. The Oxford-led research, to be published in Environmental Science &amp; Technology, was funded by New Harvest, a non-profit research organisation working to develop alternatives to conventionally produced meat. An earlier version of the study was presented at a conference last year. The study showed some of the complex implications of tissue engineering. For instance, it would take more energy to produce lab-grown chicken than it does for poultry, but would only use a fraction of the land area and water needed to rear chickens. But the research did not take into account other effects such as transport and refrigeration. The research team based their calculations on a process using the bacterium Cyanobacteria hydrolysate as a nutrient and energy source for growing muscle cells.", "sentences": ["According to the analysis by scientists from Oxford University and Amsterdam University, lab-grown tissue would reduce greenhouse gases by up to 96% in comparison to raising animals."], "title": "Artificial meat could slice emissions, say scientists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/20/artificial-meat-emissions", "tags": ["The meat industry", "Food", "Farming", "Environment", "Animals", "World news", "UK news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Food & drink", "Food security", "Vegetarianism", "Veganism", "Life and style", "Global development"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-21T08:47:00Z", "article": "Born in 1959, ceramicist Philip Eglin trained at Staffordshire Polytechnic and at the Royal College of Art.

Anyhow, we really like the story about how Bowie once tried to seduce Mick Jagger \u2013 now that&apos;s Amsterdam. Johnny Jordaan - Geef Mij Maar Amsterdam Johnny Jordaan was a singer for the people \u2026 this song is about a club of card players who go to Paris to spend some extra money. The club&apos;s president, who tried to learn French, has such a heavy Amsterdam accent that no one understands him. Everyone in the club ends up deciding they prefer Amsterdam (the title translates as Give Me Amsterdam). The song is all about the accent. Andr\u00e9 Hazes - Mijn Leidseplein Andr\u00e9 Hazes is a legend and a hero. He died years ago, but everyone in his old neighbourhood of De Pijp still has a personal story about him. The song is about Amsterdam&apos;s most famous square \u2013 it&apos;s actually not a square but more of an entertainment centre. But with Andr\u00e9 singing a song you can never go wrong. Manke Nelis - Oh Amsterdam Wat Ben je Mooi The song title means &quot;Oh Amsterdam, how beautiful you are&quot;. Meanwhile Manke means &quot;crooked ass&quot;. But he&apos;s also known as Mister Real Talk. Enough said. Willy Alberti - Oh Mooi Westertoren Willy was from the Jordaan neighbourhood (originally a working-class area) and loved Italian opera. In the old days, the Jordanezen used to get their salaries paid in the cafe, which is why they drank so much. And after drinking too much, they&apos;d start to sing. Herman Brood &amp; His Wild Romance - Doin&apos; It Brood was a musician and painter and enfant terrible who committed suicide. But when he was alive he was Mr Amsterdam: a big attraction. Back in the 1970s there were two big Dutch bands, Golden Earring and Herman Brood &amp; His Wild Romance, and they both wanted to make it in the US. It worked for Golden Earring thanks to their massive hit Radar Love, but when Brood and his band toured America, they totally messed up by taking too many drugs. But Brood is more real. Van Halen \u2013 Amsterdam In this song David Lee Roth sings &quot;Got a pocket full o&apos; money. Got me a long night ahead&quot;, which is really very stupid. But, hey, those Van Halen boys are actually Dutch. Aux Raus - The Fall Gabberpunks! They have very nice Amsterdam accents. And their music belongs to that typical Amsterdam genre called &quot;pretty goddam awesome&quot;. De Jeugd Van Tegenwoordig - Centje Centje (Damsko Centje Express) This is our Amsterdam song. &quot;Centje&quot; is short for Central Station and &quot;Damsko&quot; is street slang for Amsterdam. We always hung out at Central Station. It was Facebook before Facebook, the place to find out about what&apos;s coming up in fashion and culture. Le Le - Luxe Benen Le Le is side project of some of the members of De Jeugd Van Tegenwoordig, with illustrator Parra. You can find &quot;luxurious legs&quot; prancing around all over town.

De Piaggi considers the gallery an &quot;avant-garde monitor&quot; and uses his association with Amsterdam&apos;s underground music scenes as a conduit for what&apos;s happening. For example, in spring 2011 local tagging hero Laser 3.14 (equally loved and despised throughout town) brought his spray-painted poetry and vibrant, dystopian canvases to the gallery&apos;s cosy new space, which is situated (somewhat ironically) on the ground floor of a typically gabled Amsterdam house. Radar seeks to remain radical and urgent, as exemplified by the exhibition Street | Spirit, which features Polish painter Nisja&apos;s strangely calm cityscapes contrasting with the immediacy and frenzy of Marcel Ozymantra&apos;s large canvases. \u2022 Rozengracht 77A, no phone, radar-amsterdam.com, free admission. Open Fri-Sat 1pm-5pm and by appointment Aschenbach &amp; Hofland     Photograph: Sven-Ole Frahm    Like so many success stories of cultural Amsterdam, this gallery began as a squat in the 80s and is now recognised as one of the best in the city. Owner Gerhard Hofland focuses on emerging talent as well as mid-career artists and has featured Jochen M\u00fchlenbrink&apos;s memorable trompe l&apos;oeil paintings of the backs of paintings, complete with faux sticky tape, stapled edges and packing notes; a claustrophobic &quot;down the rabbit hole&quot; gallery installation incorporating vibrant canvases and urban tribal sculpture from Simon Hemmer, Lutz Driessen and Seb Koberst\u00e4dt; and the wonderful abstract musings of Sven-Ole Frahm, with their geometric strips set on \u2013 and cut away from \u2013 bold fields of primary colours. Once the appetite for art is sated, a wander around the marble foyer of this Jugendstil print foundry (built in 1901) is highly recommended. \u2022 Bilderdijkstraat 165c, +31 20 412 1772, gerhardhofland.com, free admission. Open Wed-Sat 1pm-5pm  Galerie Fons Welters     Photograph: Gert Jan van Rooij    Tucked away on a nondescript residential Jordaan street, just off bustling Rozengracht, Galerie Fons Welters is one of the city&apos;s most consistent providers of cutting-edge contemporary art. The gallery has been central in promoting and artistically supporting young artists from the Netherlands and beyond since 1988. The larger, more traditional high-ceilinged &quot;white cube&quot; space in the rear has accommodated a ghostly slide projector installation from English artist Claire Harvey&apos;s &quot;life in black and white&quot; miniature world, plus more conventional sculpture and painting exhibitions from established artists such as Folkert de Jong and Sven Kroner. In contrast, the smaller Playstation project area in the front of the gallery caters to up-and-coming talent, often fresh from the academies. From painting through sculpture and installation to multimedia and performance, this gallery is a must.  \u2022 Bloemstraat 140, +31 20 423 3046, fonswelters.nl, free admission. Open Tues-Sat 1pm-6pm KochxBos     Photograph: Ray Caesar/Bubbles    In the converted living room of a ground floor house in a typically claustrophobic Amsterdam street, Esther Koch and Hans Bos have taken their fascination for the surreal and avant garde and created a superb showcase for today&apos;s top international lowbrow and underground art. The offerings are always varied and hung with a designer&apos;s eye for detail. Previous exhibitions include Ray Caesar&apos;s engrossing digital prints, depicting his Victorian future-world denizens, the ink and acrylic carnivalesque creatures by Toulouse-born painter Ciou, and in spring 2011 the gallery hosted the first solo show in the Netherlands by Sarah Maple, England&apos;s &quot;heir to Emin&quot;. Featured works included her provocative Cock photo series and her self-portrait of a Muslim woman tenderly cradling a piglet. Nestled alongside cafes and fashion boutiques in the picturesque Jordaan, KochxBos is a colourful and strangely refreshing tonic to the quaint surroundings outside. \u2022 Eerste Anjeliersdwarsstraat 5, +31 20 681 4567, kochxbos.nl, free admission. Open Wed-Sat 1pm-6pm  Kulter     Kulter     This self-described &quot;tasting room&quot; (or proeflokaal in Dutch) is definitely worth the cycle or tram ride out to Amsterdam&apos;s newest art-buzz neighbourhood, Bos en Lommer. Based in the ground floor of a corner house in a purely residential street, it specialises in bridging art with performance, music and words and as a collective that organises events in collaboration with other artist-run initiatives. But perhaps Kulter&apos;s true accomplishment is the creation of a relaxed and homely atmosphere, right down to the servings of bread and homemade soup on the stove at openings. The art, and the artists, are extremely accessible and very international. Shows tend to involve recent academy graduates of all disciplines and nationalities, as exemplified by the site-specific installations, drawings, performances and paintings from the multicultural and nomadic Palatti collective.\u2022 Sanderijnstraat 21, +31 61 740 4955 (SMS in advance to check), kulter.nl, free admission.

Its exploits include the already-legendary interactive Arcade show, which traced the development of the gaming industry \u2013 from Pong through handhelds to motion-activated consoles \u2013 with plenty of playable examples; a fixed-gear biking exhibition replete with a race track through the gallery; and Pi\u00e8ce de R\u00e9sistance, which asked visitors to submit personal souvenirs that exemplify a revolutionary event, from the second world war up to the present day \u2013 think leaflets, photos, posters or, perhaps, the occasional brick. \u2022 Vijzelstraat 68, +31 20 427 4137, mediamatic.net, admission prices vary with event. Open Mon-Fri 1pm-7pm, Sat-Sun 1pm-6pm (times often vary by exhibition)  P/////akt     Photograph: Jean Bernard Koeman    Opened in 2003, this east-side gallery maintains an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude, encouraging site-specific work and stimulating the artists to incorporate the full scope of the space&apos;s whitewashed walls into their work. In 2010 the gallery completed the series Space Is A Word, a three-part examination of art as a mental space \u2013 rather than physical \u2013 that featured large canvases from Gino Saccone, Jean Bernard Koeman&apos;s architectural models and Frederik van Simaey&apos;s playfully existential installations, including a striking sculpture of folding beds, bikes and ladders. Debate, performance and book launches are also part of this gallery&apos;s mandate as it seeks to bridge the gap between the art, the artist and the public. \u2022 Zeeburgerpad 53, +31 20 468 8395, pakt.nu, free admission.

The film programming is impressive: multiple rooms screen a well-selected assortment of arthouse flicks from around the world, mostly subtitled in English. Dinner and drinks are on offer in Lab 111, which offers visitors the opportunity to dine on a converted dissection table under surgical lights \u2013 surprisingly, an experience that&apos;s not as strange as it sounds. Studios are provided for a fortunate few, who use this multi-disciplinary playground for work; and lastly, of course, there are the galleries \u2013 spacious, bright rooms that accommodate a varied programme featuring local as well as international young talent. In 2011 these galleries hosted the finalists of the Prix de Rome competition, won by Finnish new media artist Pilvi Takala. \u2022 Arie Biemondstraat 105-113, +31 20 427 5951, smartprojectspace.net, admission prices vary with event.

The general vibe is straightforward and in-your-face \u2013 and the gallery is aptly sited in the gentrified, but still cool, De Pijp neighbourhood. Past shows have featured the monolithic concrete and glass sculptures by Cristian Andersen; stop-motion nightmares from Crist\u00f3bal Le\u00f3n; and installation, video and photographs from Katrina Daschner such as the sexually charged Murderess series featuring hooded, axe-wielding women in bleak, wintry forests. A memorable recent installation from the ever-electrifying Marc Bijl displayed a mesmerising, life-sized black Christ standing upon a stack of white painted pallets, hands outstretched, epoxy dripping like melting wax from arms, hands and face. The work here is always at an intense level. \u2022 Van Ostadestraat 294, +31 20 428 4284, upstreamgallery.nl, free admission. Open Wed-Sat 1pm-6pm and by appointment W139     Photograph: Henni van Beek    Sex, drugs and art make familiar bedfellows, and they all contributed to the formation of this gallery in the heart of Amsterdam&apos;s infamous red light district. Originally a theatre, the space was squatted in 1979 by five young artists in need of a place to show their work. Painting, performances and punk rock were to be the beginning of one the city&apos;s most original hubs of artistic endeavour. More than 30 years later, it still maintains some of its worn industrial demeanour, while scrubbing up to carry a clean museum vibe whenever necessary. With room for gigs, exhibitions, book launches, parties, film and debates touching on hot topics such as the uneasy relationship between politics and art, W139 is perpetually in motion, frequented by skinny-trousered hipsters, bespectacled geeks and paint-spattered freaks alike. And who knows, the tattooed girl that&apos;s selling you a book at their kiosk one week might be exhibiting at one of the city&apos;s blockbuster museums the next. \u2022 Warmoesstraat 139, +31 20 622 9434, w139.nl, admission prices vary with event.

Don&apos;t be deceived by the small glasses, the windmill blades won&apos;t be the only thing spinning after you&apos;ve sampled two or three Columbus ales, the strongest of the five offerings. The locals have even coined a term for the state of newcomers who end up stumbling, or sometimes crawling, away from the establishment \u2013 spinmilled. \u2022 Funenkade 7, +31 20 622 8325, brouwerijhetij.nl. Open daily 3pm-8pm &apos;t Smalle     \u2019t Smalle Photograph: Sarah Moore    Time stands still within this building, which was originally built as a Hoppe distillery in 1780. Old oak casks remain stacked above the bar area, and vintage brass furnishings, gleaming chandeliers, dripping candles and the smack of fermented alcohol make it feel like a Dutch traders&apos; haunt from yesteryear. While they may not be from the 18th century, bearded Dutch locals still frequent the bar to gossip about the latest happenings in the neighbourhood. The building is also located on one of the prettiest canals in Amsterdam, meaning there tends to be a bit of a scrap for the waterside seats come summer. It&apos;s best to get there early, or soak up the atmosphere inside.\u2022 Egelantiersgracht 12, +31 20 623 9617, t-smalle.nl.

Luckily, the bar staff are enthusiastic whisky purists, who often provide samples and guide you through the extensive menu that&apos;s split into different regions of Scotland, and the rest of the world. The atmosphere is relaxed and genteel; there are usually a few solitary types sipping 40-year-old malts while reading \u2013 or at least pretending to read \u2013 a literary classic. But generally it is a very social place \u2013 the shared penchant for good whisky usually gets people talking long into the night. \u2022 Korte Leidsedwarsstraat 82-84, +31 20 625 2387, whiskyproeverijen.nl. Open Sun-Thurs 8pm-3am, Fri, Sat 8pm-4am Caf\u00e9 Brecht     Cafe Brecht Photograph: Sarah Moore    This Berlin-style living room cafe attracts students and literary types who discuss the merits of Brechtian drama while flicking through the plays that are scattered around. Inspired by Berlin&apos;s alternative bar scene, Sandra Houtman and her son decided to offer up their own piece of east German charm in the heart of Amsterdam. Berliner Pilsner, fritz-kola and a variety of German beers are on tap, and a selection of bratwurst is available. The atmosphere is casual and stylish; vintage furniture, and knitting needles, wool and threads on hand for crafty types. There&apos;s a literary open mic session on the last Sunday of each month, but you might want to brush up on your German.\u2022 Weteringschans 157, +31 20 627 2211, cafebrecht.nl. Open Sun-Thurs noon-1am, Fri, Sat noon-3am Vesper Bar     Vesper Bar Photograph: Sarah Moore    In a quiet corner just off bustling Haarlemmerstraat, this elegant cocktail bar feels like stepping into a happy hour scene from Mad Men. Expats and locals from the nearby advertising agencies enjoy their post-work tipple while discussing strategies and bashing away on smartphones. The decor is kitsch and sophisticated, with James Bond memorabilia sandwiched between fine liqueurs and pop art prints. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the bar offers &quot;high tea cocktails&quot;; a quirky alcoholic twist on traditional high tea. Cakes from neighbouring bakeries are served with teapots of cocktails. In a city not renowned for good cocktail bars, Vesper has raised the standards. \u2022 Vinkenstraat 57, +31 20 846 4458, vesperbar.nl.

Co-owner Diego Rattenni always states that he wants his customers to &quot;soak up the jazz and savour the wine&quot;. The bar used to feature large-scale jazz bands four nights a week, but they received noise complaints from neighbours and have since had to stick to solo musicians and duos on Fridays and Saturdays. The understated music still provides the perfect backdrop for an evening of wine and conversation. \u2022 Hazenstraat 19, +31 61 986 3190, chetsjazzcafe.com. Open Tues-Thurs, Sun 7pm-1am, Fri, Sat 7pm-3am Caf\u00e9 Sound Garden     Soundgarden Photograph: Sarah Moore    Not much has changed in Sound Garden since it opened in the early 90s. Kurt Cobain lookalikes converse shyly in corners of the room, old rockers play pool or pinball, and a few suits \u2013 who probably had mohicans and listened to Bad Brains back in the day \u2013 sit on the sunny terrace which overlooks a nearby canal. While grunge bars can sometimes feel cliquey and even a tad pretentious, Sound Garden is surprisingly friendly, and you&apos;ll inevitably find yourself in conversation with muso strangers at some point \u2013 probably talking about the best places to find Mudhoney B-sides or Jesus and Mary Chain T-Shirts.\u2022 Marnixstraat 164-166, +31 20 620 2853, cafesoundgarden.nl.

Located in the south of the city, the Okura Hotel offers high-end drinks at high-end prices. While visiting might hurt your wallet, the service \u2013 and sense of sophistication \u2013 is unparalleled. Immaculately dressed white-gloved waiters offer you table service, and cocktails are mixed to your personal preference. On the 23rd floor, the upscale bar also offers a panoramic view of Amsterdam that can rarely be seen from the traditional, smaller Dutch buildings. Japanese businessmen, wealthy tourists and Dutch locals all frequent the establishment, making for an interestingly diverse crowd.\u2022 Ferdinand Bolstraat 333, +31 20 678 7111, okura.nl.

A combination of her Derbyshire roots, Asian influences from living in Japan, and modern Dutch twists, make her food some of the most stylish and experimental in Amsterdam. Think seared tuna steak with a zingy horseradish, wasabi and soy concoction, served with mellow sweet potato mash. The restaurant itself is serene, despite the full view into the working kitchen, and it is tucked down a leafy side road away from tourist hubbub. Like most top quality restaurants, it attracts more business types than gastronomes, but Beddington and her team are never complacent when it comes to creativity.\u2022 Utrechtsedwarsstraat 141, +31 20 620 7393, beddington.nl, three courses \u20ac48, four courses \u20ac55.

If your food wasn&apos;t produced here, it will come from the surrounding garden or a nearby farm. You might be served edible begonia flowers or the leaves of the &quot;oyster plant&quot; that tastes (bizarrely) of its namesake. While its reputation means that De Kas has a more commercial feel than it used to, the food is undeniably excellent.

Bread is served with meat-flecked goose fat instead of butter, and potatoes are the carbohydrate of choice \u2013 generally mashed with seasonal vegetables to make a typically Dutch stamppot. The only element of this establishment that isn&apos;t Dutch is the service. Far from the indifference you&apos;ll encounter elsewhere, the waiting staff here are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about their menu. \u2022 Peperstraat 23-25, +31 20 779 7450, restaurantgreetje.nl, mains around \u20ac25. Open Tues-Fri, Sun 6pm-10pm, Sat 6pm-11pm Vis aan de Schelde     Vis aan de Schelde Photograph: WestEnd61 / Rex Features    Off the beaten track, this fish restaurant is something of an Amsterdam institution, despite its location by an out-of-town roundabout, next to the RAI convention centre. Seafood lovers will thrill at the fresh oysters, crayfish, turbot and monkfish. Recent dishes include milky haddock and scallops served with crispy-fried pata negra ham, black &quot;venus&quot; rice made with squid ink and a sea-tasting, foamy sauce. The atmosphere is a little more old-fashioned and formal than Amsterdam&apos;s usually relaxed restaurant scene, making it the kind of place to take your parents. There&apos;s an extensive wine list, with a bias towards bottles that will go with the fantastic fish. Worth going the extra mile for.\u2022 Scheldeplein 4, +31 20 675 1583, visaandeschelde.nl, mains \u20ac29-\u20ac62, three courses from \u20ac38.

In winter, you&apos;re looking at hearty lamb shanks, fillets of beef and magret de canard; in summer, expect Dutch asparagus with new potatoes, young peas in salads, and fragrant strawberries in sweet &quot;soup&quot;. Service is friendly, if a little slow, and the crowd is young and diverse \u2013 just like the Westerpark area the restaurant is in. Razmataz is one of only a few restaurants open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, not to mention morning coffee and after-dinner drinks.

It offers a simple three-course menu for under \u20ac30, with just a few choices for each course: meat, fish or vegetarian. The food is generous and tasty, with a leaning towards French bistro fare. Recent dishes include a whole poached artichoke with a buttery dressing, classic steak tartare, and spicy gazpacho with seafood. The menu changes fortnightly, making it the kind of place you want to return to again and again. It&apos;s also close to De Pijp&apos;s hip bar scene \u2013 after-dinner drinks are all too easy from here.\u2022 Van der Helstplein 17, +31 20 770 0884, district5.nl, mains around \u20ac19, three courses \u20ac29.50. Open Mon, Wed-Sun 6pm-10.30pm New King     New King    The queue regularly runs out the door of this Mandarin Chinese institution. Despite the venue&apos;s size, diners regularly wait 45 minutes for a table. But portions are generous, and you&apos;re bound to order more than you can eat, so building up an appetite is advised. Service can be brusque, and the wine list won&apos;t excite, but the food is worth the wait. New King&apos;s speciality is roasted duck: its skin is so crisp you could cut your finger on it, and it&apos;s served with broth with hints of aniseed. The dim sum are highly recommended, although some involve a half-hour wait. Also try the aubergine stuffed with peppery minced pork (but beware of the chilli kick).\u2022 Zeedijk 115-117, +31 20 625 2180, newking.nl, mains around \u20ac16.

The decor is all white orchids and serene neutral tones, while the staff are as elegant as the tableware. The menu includes Thai classics such as fishcakes fragrant with kaffir lime leaves, presented with concise attention to detail. A house speciality is the lamb massaman: the meat has been simmered in a rich, spicy, addictive sauce until it falls apart. Prices are as friendly as the service, despite the restaurant&apos;s prime Utrechtsestraat location. Just a stone&apos;s throw from the gaudy, fluorescent-lit tourist traps of the Rembrandtplein, Take Thai is a haven of sophistication and calm.\u2022 Utrechtsestraat 87, +31 20 622 0577, takethai.com, mains around \u20ac20.

But its trendy interior and cool crowd don&apos;t detract from the fact that the food is exquisite. Order the rijsttafel (literally: rice table) and prepare for an enormous selection of marinated meats, fragrant curries and crunchy salads. Skewers of juicy chicken and beef come with sweet-yet-savoury sauces of satay and molasses, while vegetable-based salads \u2013 both raw and cooked \u2013 are tossed with sweet, chilli, vinegary dressings and plenty of coriander and peanuts.

A pleasant refuge from the busy streets outside, it&apos;s worth a visit to just to bask in the atrium&apos;s brightness. With three floors of brand-name clothing (Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY, Polo) in a familiar store-in-store layout, the Bonneterie has served the preppier sections of Dutch society since 1911.

Though trendy and colourful in their dress, the Dutch aren&apos;t known for bold fashion choices \u2013 as they say, &quot;being normal is crazy enough&quot;. But now Amsterdam&apos;s international allure and growing fashion industry have created a pocket cosmopolitan enough to allow even the more outrageous designs of Rick Owens, Henrik Vibskov and Martin Margiela to find favour with the young graphic design and public relations sets.\u2022 Rozengracht 191-193, +31 20 330 5601, sprmrkt.nl.

Through their close contacts with art schools around the country, this longstanding institution (founded in 1985) and its proprietors, Cok de Rooy and Dick Dankers have built a collection that artfully balances the world of art and design, as evidenced by the contemporary photographers (like Inez van Lamsweerde) gracing the walls.

Still, all that quirky, pragmatic design can start to feel samey, and Dutch consumers have recently taken to Finnish glass and tableware masters iittala. With their modern lines and exceedingly high quality standards, the Fins are firmly entrenching themselves in the dishwashers of families or young professionals upgrading from their lighter, identikit HEMA or Ikea plates and glasses.

The main hall is ultimately flexible: every detail can be altered for specific seating, acoustic and lighting requirements. The venue also welcomes non-classical guests, so long as they bring a twist to proceedings.

Its programming is eclectic, playing host to the underground of the underground. Think queer punk nights, hardcore, glitchcore, new wave, experimental hip-hop, art rock and obscure jazz freak-out.

On quieter days, it still makes for a great perch, as the palace, the fancy Bijenkorf department store, and the Warmoesstraat sex shops all attract fascinatingly different crowds.\u2022 Dam 9, +31 20 554 9111, nh-hotels.com, doubles from \u20ac159 room only Hotel De Filosoof      Hotel De Filosoof     Just off the Vondelpark, Amsterdam&apos;s green heart, De Filosoof&apos;s 38 rooms and enclosed garden form cosy hideaways from the nearby tourist streams heading to the Van Gogh Museum or the Rijksmuseum. True to the hotel&apos;s name, the rooms and suites are dedicated to noted philosophers, from Wittgenstein (apparently an orange/grey/black kind of thinker) to Socrates and even Bataille, whose Tears of Eros inspired a red and gold scheme. Those not philosophically inclined are but minutes away from jogging the bendy Vondelpark paths, enjoying a cup of tea and slice of apple pie at the Blauwe Theehuis, or drinking an afternoon toast in the park at the Vertigo caf\u00e9.\u2022 Anna van den Vondelstraat 6, +31 20 683 3013, hoteldefilosoof.nl, doubles from \u20ac105 room only  Hotel Okura      Hotel Okura     Okura&apos;s was designed in 1971 as part hotel, part 23-storey barometer.

Down on the ground-floor, the Yamazato restaurant also has a Michelin star. The rooms, as one expects, are of the highest grade, offering subtle, unshowy luxuries galore (British sockets, for instance).

To start, try their house p\u00e2t\u00e9, which is coarse, gamey and full of rustic French flavour.

Non meat-eaters are also in for a treat: try De Zotte&apos;s hartige tart \u2013 essentially a deep-pan quiche. The filling changes, but generally involves some kind of cheese and green vegetables.

The food is served in giant sharing platters, the base of which is formed by a layer of the slightly sour, spongy pancakes that are typical of the region, with a further pile of the pancakes on the side to mop up the juices. Dishes are hot, sour, sweet and spicy all at the same time: marinated, juicy chicken drumsticks, slow-cooked lamb, and lentil-based sauces.

This house speciality involves Italian ham, rocket, parmesan and (most importantly) truffle sauce. The dough is thin, crisp and nutty with ever-so-slightly charred edges; the toppings are fresh, authentic and generous, and the truffle is plain addictive. There is an array of other pizzas, as well as bresaola, buffalo mozzarella, bruschetta and other classic Italian antipasti.

Thick and filling, with savoury or sweet toppings, they make perfect hangover food and are reasonably priced. At Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, you have to climb the most vertiginous staircase ever. At the top, the restaurant has just four or five tables, nestled amid hundreds of eclectic teapots, dangling from the ceiling and on any inch of available space. The pancakes are not the cheapest, but they&apos;re worth it for the location alone. Try the pancake with bacon and stroop \u2013 like maple syrup without the maple. Or switch the syrup for cheese.

The menu is long and features the usual Thai suspects, including curries, noodles, fish cakes and soups. Main dishes come in silver pots balanced on tiny candle-lit burners, while rice comes in large, silver urns.

At the time, most local medicines were made from spices and plants brought back from overseas, so the yawner was often depicted as a Moor.

In 1578, the Netherlands became protestant, and while Catholics were tolerated, they had to pray in private places.

Asian furniture nestles against religious art, vintage jewellery is laid out alongside silverware and old wooden toys sit eerily alongside war memorabilia from decades past. Whether you&apos;re hunting for something specific like antique grandfather clock from the 19th century or merely rummaging, there will undoubtedly be something eye-catching.\u2022 Elandsgracht 109, +31 20 624 9038, looier.nl. Open Mon-Thurs, Sat, Sun 11am-5pm Oudemanhuispoort Book Market     Photograph: Alamy    It&apos;s not uncommon to find beard-stroking scholarly types browsing through the Sartre section of this secondhand book market in a quaint little stone passage between two grand 18th-century university buildings. While there is an abundance of academic titles on offer, there&apos;s also a variety of fiction, non-fiction and art prints, with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity \u2013 you won&apos;t find any trashy paperbacks here. The distinguished sellers seem to take great pride in what they do, often looking slightly distressed when parting with their beloved works of literature at such low prices.\u2022 Oudemanhuispoort. Open Mon-Fri 11am-4pm Recycled Bicycles     Recycled Bicycles Photograph: recycledbicycles.org/http://www.recycledbicycles.org    Let&apos;s face it, the only way to experience shopping like a local is by weaving through the narrow streets on two wheels, shopping bags flailing in the wind. In a bid to curb the selling of stolen bikes to tourists, the team at Recycled Bicycles rescue, renovate and sell old, broken bikes at a bargain price. The passionate team, led by BMX enthusiast Vitor, make it their mission to provide newcomers to the city with sturdy, affordable and guilt-free bikes. They are also occasionally willing to rent out bikes for select periods of time, offering rates that are by far the best value in the city. Just ask nicely.\u2022 Spuistraat 84a, +31 65 468 1429, recycledbicycles.org. Open Mon, Sat 2pm-6pm, Tues-Fri 9.30am-6pm Wini Vintage     Wini Vintage    Though there&apos;s a wide selection of vintage stores scattered throughout the city, Wini offers the highest-quality garments at the lowest prices. Unlike some other vintage shops, the clothes don&apos;t smell like they were last washed by your great-grandmother in the 1930s, and are perfectly pressed and dry cleaned. Unused vintage fabrics are also sold by the metre at reasonable prices, providing budding designers and tailors with cheap and unique materials. While the shop specialises in vintage women&apos;s dresses, there&apos;s also an abundance of men&apos;s suits, retro kids&apos; clothing, jewellery and, rather amusingly, rainbow-coloured ski wear from the 1960s.\u2022 Haarlemmerstraat 29, +31 20 427 9393, winivintage.nl. Open Mon-Wed, Fri, Sat 10.30am-6pm, Thurs 10.30am-6.30pm, Sun noon-6pm Noordermarkt     Photograph: David Gee/Alamy    Situated in the quaint and cobbled Jordaan district, this open-air market will suit both foodies and lovers of vintage. Organic farmers from all over the Netherlands set up their stalls every Saturday to sell fresh organic produce for a fraction of the prices charged at &quot;organic&quot; supermarkets. Do your fruit and veg shopping with the locals or take a stroll and sample the typical Dutch treats such as freshly baked stroopwafels or salted raw herring. On Mondays, the market transforms into an antique-hunter&apos;s dream. Stalls are piled with vintage clothes from the last century, alongside antique books, coins and beautifully designed furniture.\u2022 Noordermarkt, boerenmarktamsterdam.nl. Open Mon 9am-2pm, Sat 9am-4pm Waterlooplein Markt     Photograph: Alamy    As the best-known and most central flea market in Amsterdam, Waterlooplein has clad generations of tourists in flares, Hawaiian shirts and occasionally amusing T-shirts bearing slogans about being &quot;high on life&quot;. These days, there&apos;s the added attraction of a selection of new clothes stands, where upcoming designers sell their creations before trying to make the big time. Given the high volume of tourists that visit the area, pushy sellers are keener to make a sale than in other markets, which results in some argumentative bargaining. Still, stand your ground and there&apos;s a high chance you will come away with a gem or two, if not an amusing T-shirt.\u2022 Waterlooplein, +31 20 552 4074, waterloopleinmarkt.nl. Open Mon-Sat 9am-5pm I Love Vintage     Photograph: Sarah Moore    Initially conceived as an online store five years ago, Ilovevintage.nl was so successful that owner Faranak Mirjalili decided innovatively to merge clicks with bricks and opened this shop. You can shop from the store&apos;s sample selection of cheap vintage dresses, shoes, bags and accessories, or head to a touchscreen monitor to browse the entire collection by style, size, and colour. As in a shoe shop, customers tell the assistants what they want, and out it comes from the stock rooms. You can also plan in advance and come with online item numbers ready to quickly try on your digital finds. \u2022 Prinsengracht 201, +31 20 330 1950, ilovevintage.nl. Open Mon-Sat 9.30am-6pm IJ Hallen     IJ Hallen    With more than 1,500 stands and 3,000 free parking spaces, the monthly IJ Hallen in the north of Amsterdam is the largest flea market in northern Holland. Shopping here involves a bit of an aquatic adventure \u2013 take the free ferry across the scenic IJ river and follow the hordes of bargain hunters. There is a \u20ac4 admission charge, but it&apos;s worth it if you have the patience to browse for most of the day. Anything and everything secondhand can be found here; battered old guitars are propped against antique chairs, art prints are scattered among military gear. In summer, the market moves outside, allowing for even more stalls and street vendors. \u2022 TT Neveritaweg 15, +31 22 958 1598, ijhallen.nl, entry \u20ac4.

Uptown you get the party-centric atmosphere with the detoxing properties of the Vondelpark next door \u2013 you can even borrow inline skates to explore. The bar is always full; likewise the kitchen, where visitors bond over the stove. Unsurprisingly, this breeds an active space with guests coming and going at all hours. Be warned: the hostel is strict on its under-35s only policy, but if you&apos;re beyond that limit, you&apos;re unlikely to want to share a room with a horde of rowdy 18-year-olds.\u2022 Vossiusstraat 46, +31 20 400 4187, flyingpig.nl, queen-size bunk in shared room from \u20ac25pp B&amp;B, private doubles from \u20ac85 B&amp;B Backstage Hotel     Backstage Hotel     You can guess that the Backstage&apos;s owners are big music lovers from the hotel&apos;s name alone, and the interior drives the theme home \u2013 guitars and memorabilia adorn the walls, and it&apos;s even sponsored by Jack Daniel&apos;s. Part of the concept comes from the location: minutes away from music venues Melkweg and Paradiso, the theatre district and a hearty selection of blues bars. The furniture is all inspired by flight cases, while light bulbs border mirrors to recreate that authentic dressing room vibe. There&apos;s even a four-person Guitar Hero room (yes, including the game) that&apos;s decked out in wall-to-wall original drawings by legendary Amsterdam tattooist Henk Schiffmacher.\u2022 Leidsegracht 114, +31 20 624 4044, backstagehotel.com, doubles \u20ac77.50-\u20ac115 room only Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Vondelpark     Rollerblading in Vondelpark Photograph: Alamy    Whether you&apos;ve been to Amsterdam before or are heading for your first visit, chances are you&apos;ll find your way into favourite hippy hangout Vondelpark \u2013 be it for lounging, picnicking, drinking, cycling or skating. This quirky schoolhouse-turned-hostel is virtually inside the park, located along a parallel lane, with many of the rooms looking down on to the grass. As hostels go, it&apos;s modern and refined, with hordes of uniformed staff ready to look after the hundreds of guests it can accommodate. Despite the high numbers coming through, it&apos;s extremely clean, making it a viable option for more than just backpackers.\u2022 Zandpad 5, +31 20 589 8996, stayokay.com, hostel beds from \u20ac20pp B&amp;B, private doubles from \u20ac60 B&amp;B Between Art and Kitsch B&amp;B     Between Art and Kitsch B&B     A cute alternative to the design and boutique hotels blossoming all over town, this quirky B&amp;B in De Pijp, just a short walk from dozens of museums, is lovingly decorated by its owners. Its three rooms embrace a mishmash of styles \u2013 filled with antiques, curiosities and other seemingly random items picked up on travels, ranging from colonial cabinets and Arab rugs to neoclassical chandeliers. All rooms are equipped with en suite bathrooms, and there&apos;s a shared kitchen for all guests. As is so common in Amsterdam&apos;s budget range, however, you&apos;ll have to beware of the climb. It can feel like a stairway to hell to reach the third-floor rooms, especially when dragging your luggage.\u2022 Ruysdaelkade 75-2, +31 20 679 0485, between-art-and-kitsch.com, doubles from \u20ac80 B&amp;B Chic&amp;Basic     Photograph: Luca Conti on Flickr/Some rights reserved    Budget stays around Central Station are notoriously shoddy, but take a five-minute walk west and you&apos;ll find this honest little gem which is suitably chic and, well, basic. Situated on one of the quietest segments of the Herengracht, this canal house hotel has been renovated from a classic Mediterranean feel to the crispness of bright white walls and bedding with black trims and minimal furniture. Admittedly, there&apos;s an Ikea feel to the furnishings at times, but it&apos;s a solid, value-for-money option. And key details such as location, cleanliness, service and free internet terminals should make up for having a generic art print above your bed.\u2022 Herengracht 13-19, +31 20 522 2345, chicandbasic.com, doubles from \u20ac90 B&amp;B  CitizenM     CitizenM    This new Dutch chain has been racking up praise, particularly since opening in Glasgow in 2010. It started in Amsterdam, first as an airport hotel at Schiphol, then in the south of the city. Although a boutique hotel at heart (the fancy Vitra furnishings are a giveaway), the quality service, luxury bedding and budget prices make this a haven for everyone from backpackers to business travellers. Every room is identical, with a wall-to-wall bed against the window, and futuristic glass toilet and shower off to the side. All tech features, including ambient coloured lighting, are controlled via the Philips MoodPad. Party people may feel out of sorts in this residential area, but the centre is only a short tram or train ride away.\u2022 Prinses Irenestraat 30, +31 20 811 7090, citizenm.com/amsterdam-city/, doubles from \u20ac79 room only CityCenter Bed and Breakfast     CityCenter Bed and Breakfast    Proving it&apos;s possible to find seclusion among the noise and action of the city centre, this delicate little B&amp;B sits above a small side street between the rumbling trams on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the bustle of the Nieuwendijk shopping street. As it&apos;s just five minutes from Central Station, you&apos;ll get a rare taste of central Amsterdam living with easy access to nearby attractions while avoiding the area&apos;s seedier hotels. The rooms have a clean, Swedish feel. The only minor downer is sharing the plush bathroom facilities with other guests, but given that there are only two rooms to rent, that isn&apos;t such a hardship. Besides, it&apos;s renowned for friendliness, comfort and cleanliness, and you&apos;ll feel waited on by owner Camillo.\u2022 Sint Jacobsstraat 21, +31 64 516 0078, citycenter-amsterdam.com, doubles from \u20ac90 B&amp;B Hans Brinker Budget Hotel     Hans Brinker Budget Hotel     This place is all about location and price: a quiet courtyard on the doorstep of nightlife-saturated Leidseplein. Brinker is as budget as budget gets, a fact famously exploited in the long-running marketing campaign which boasts that it&apos;s &quot;a cheap, dirty, cold, poorly-lit youth hostel&quot; with &quot;rusty beds in awkwardly-shaped dormitories&quot; and used paper flags stuck into dog excrement throughout the city exclaiming that more of the same could be found at the hostel&apos;s entrance. The sleeping quarters, with their closely arranged metal bunks and lockers, call to mind the set of Porridge, and the rooms are awkwardly shaped, but the place is surprisingly tidy. It&apos;s the perfect place for younger travellers who are likely to fall asleep in one of the surrounding bars anyway.\u2022 Kerkstraat 136-138, +31 20 622 0687, hans-brinker.com , hostel beds from \u20ac25pp B&amp;B, twin room \u20ac80 B&amp;B St Christopher&apos;s at the Winston      St Christopher\u2019s at the Winston    Like its adjoining pub and club, the Winston hotel/hostel is dripping with character. On the edge of the red light district, it&apos;s surrounded by S&amp;M clubs, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. But Dam Square and more cultural outings are only a short walk away. The cheapest options are the hostel rooms, but don&apos;t expect much sleep there. Instead, splash out on a private room for a unique stay in Amsterdam as each room has been customised by local artists. From bold street art murals and drug-inspired scribbles to debauched red light vibes that will haunt you even after you close your eyes, you&apos;re unlikely to forget the experience. \u2022 Warmoesstraat 129, +31 20 623 1380, winston.nl, hostel beds from \u20ac14.90pp B&amp;B, private doubles from \u20ac74 B&amp;B Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Zeeburg     Stayokay Hostel     This ultra-modern hostel opened in 2007 and offers spacious rooms (shared and private), attractive interior design that uses orange tones without the eye-watering issues of easyHotel, a large glistening dining area, and excellent toilets and showers. As in all Stayokay hostels, staff are well-trained professionals who look after the public spaces day and night. But where it differs from other hostel options is its location in the east of the city. Off the beaten tourist track, it gives a taste of the real multicultural city, for example at the nearby Dappermarkt. The building is shared with Studio K, a bar/restaurant/cinema/club, and a bike rental shop, so you can cycle to the centre in only minutes. \u2022 Timorplein 21, +31 20 551 3190, stayokay.com, hostel beds from \u20ac20pp B&amp;B, private doubles from \u20ac50 B&amp;B \u2022 Steven McCarron is an editor of Unfold Amsterdam, a poster publication and website about what&apos;s on in Amsterdam", "sentences": ["There&apos;s even a four-person Guitar Hero room (yes, including the game) that&apos;s decked out in wall-to-wall original drawings by legendary Amsterdam tattooist Henk Schiffmacher.\u2022 Leidsegracht 114, +31 20 624 4044, backstagehotel.com, doubles \u20ac77.50-\u20ac115 room only Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Vondelpark     Rollerblading in Vondelpark Photograph: Alamy    Whether you&apos;ve been to Amsterdam before or are heading for your first visit, chances are you&apos;ll find your way into favourite hippy hangout Vondelpark \u2013 be it for lounging, picnicking, drinking, cycling or skating.", "As is so common in Amsterdam&apos;s budget range, however, you&apos;ll have to beware of the climb.", "It started in Amsterdam, first as an airport hotel at Schiphol, then in the south of the city.", "As it&apos;s just five minutes from Central Station, you&apos;ll get a rare taste of central Amsterdam living with easy access to nearby attractions while avoiding the area&apos;s seedier hotels.", "Instead, splash out on a private room for a unique stay in Amsterdam as each room has been customised by local artists.", "\u2022 Warmoesstraat 129, +31 20 623 1380, winston.nl, hostel beds from \u20ac14.90pp B&amp;B, private doubles from \u20ac74 B&amp;B Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Zeeburg     Stayokay Hostel     This ultra-modern hostel opened in 2007 and offers spacious rooms (shared and private), attractive interior design that uses orange tones without the eye-watering issues of easyHotel, a large glistening dining area, and excellent toilets and showers.", "\u2022 Timorplein 21, +31 20 551 3190, stayokay.com, hostel beds from \u20ac20pp B&amp;B, private doubles from \u20ac50 B&amp;B \u2022 Steven McCarron is an editor of Unfold Amsterdam, a poster publication and website about what&apos;s on in Amsterdam"], "title": "10 of the best budget hotels and hostels in Amsterdam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/22/top-10-budget-hotels-amsterdam", "tags": ["Hotels", "Hostels", "Budget travel", "Amsterdam holidays", "Travel", "Short breaks", "City breaks", "Top 10s", "Netherlands holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-22T18:02:11Z", "article": "Ed Miliband&apos;s famous blank piece of paper, Labour&apos;s policy prospectus, will start to be coloured in this weekend when the party&apos;s policy forum meets on Saturday in Wrexham, north Wales.

Peter Snowdon&apos;s Back from the Brink is another guide to how slow parties can be to respond to crises in public perception. By contrast Labour has rushed to admit error. But Labour is also subtly reworking the policy review process. Figures such as the policy review co-ordinator, Liam Byrne, would probably admit that the hydra-headed reviews, set up November in a largely ad hoc way, lacked coherence. No fewer than 19 reviews were announced, on what seemed a random basis. The advantage was that it gave every shadow cabinet member something to do.

No exploration of Labour&apos;s increasingly questioned pro-Europeanism is being attempted. By contrast, Harriet Harman, the shadow international development secretary, has appointed six sub-reviews. There is as yet no separate economic policy review but instead previously announced reviews, on issues such as low pay and welfare, that will feed into an economic policy review co-ordinated by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls. To try to bring some order to the process the policy reviews have all now been rearranged under four sub-heads \u2013 rebuilding the economy to help the squeezed middle, keeping the promise for the next generation, renewing responsibility, and our place in the world.

Other policy groups seem not have gone beyond clearing the undergrowth. Byrne argues the starting point is understanding why the public rejected Labour. In a speech on Wednesday he said: &quot;If we want to win back the people&apos;s trust to lead again, we have to understand how the public see us and why. Therein starts the business of renewal. This is perhaps the first great lesson from oppositions which stay in opposition for a long time. Oppositions that stay in opposition are the parties that fail to confront and take on the weaknesses the public see in them.&quot; While this was true of the Tories after 1997, Labour after 1979 was not much better. &quot;It was an incredible eight years before Kinnock embarked on a major exercise of his own \u2013 talking to the public about the way they saw things. This is not a mistake we are going to repeat,&quot; Byrne says. The aim this weekend is to provide some signposts to something more specific at the autumn party conference, including something close to definitive on a replacement for tuition fees.

Miliband can offer optimism, with answers on education, transport and housing, ingredients he is convinced can win him the election \u2013 and something the Tories, with the emphasis on the deficit, cannot offer.

None of this answers the pressing question of the deficit, Labour&apos;s dire polling on economic competence, or Miliband&apos;s own personal ratings. Last week Balls alarmed some by almost admitting he had bet the whole farm on George Osborne&apos;s cuts seriously killing growth.

Carlyle fought off other private equity bidders for the recovery company three months after it was put up for sale by insurance group Aviva. The transaction brought back memories of Permira&apos;s acquisition of the AA in 2004, which was heavily criticised by unions for loading the company with debt, leading to 3,400 job losses. Permira and co-investor CVC were accused by Labour politicians of &quot;asset stripping&quot; before the two private equity groups merged the AA with Saga, the holiday company for the over-50s. On Thursday, the Unite union said Carlyle had given assurances that the sale of RAC would ensure &quot;the workforce is protected, terms and conditions will be maintained and, crucially, all the pensions arrangements will be preserved. &quot;It is vital that Carlyle stands by the guarantees given to the staff and works with the union to ensure the future success of the business.&quot; But Carlyle refused to say what proportion of the consideration for the RAC was being met via debt, or how much equity it was injecting. The company also refused to comment on job losses, although sources close to the firm said the takeover would not lead to redundancies. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: &quot;The private equity takeover of the RAC is another sign that it is back to business as usual in the City. &quot;The rest of us are still paying a heavy price for the damage done by this kind of irresponsible capitalism, which may make pots of money for those involved but contributes nothing to the wider economy.&quot; Officials at the GMB union were even more scathing, saying: &quot;The RAC need to heed what private equity did to the AA \u2013\u00a0when they sacked a third of the workforce, reduced levels of service for motorists and saddled the organisation with \u00a35.8bn of debt.&quot; The RAC is the second largest roadside assistance provider in Britain. Last year, it generated profit before tax of \u00a382m. Carlyle&apos;s managing director Andrew Burgess said in a statement that there was &quot;strong long-term potential to grow the business by investing in new and innovative financial services offerings such as motor and household insurance&quot;. He also saw opportunities to &quot;enhance the roadside business, with an emphasis on ensuring customer satisfaction&quot;. Supporters of Carlyle said that during its four year ownership of The Mill, a British-based visual effects firm, it increased the number of employees by 150%. Carlyle, which owns the Hertz car rentals group as well as health food chain Holland &amp; Barrett, will retain the current RAC management. Andrew Moss, Aviva&apos;s chief executive, denied that the decision to sell the RAC was linked to a need to meet tighter capital demands being imposed on insurers and banks by European directives. He said the proceeds from the transaction would be reinvested in the company&apos;s life and general insurance businesses. Aviva has been disposing of non-core businesses in recent years. Moss said: &quot;The sale of RAC is consistent with Aviva&apos;s UK strategy of maximising the benefits of operating life and general insurance together.&quot; Aviva is Britain&apos;s biggest insurer with 19 million customers. City analysts hailed the RAC deal as a &quot;great recovery&quot; for Aviva. &quot;The price represents 17 times 2010 earnings and compares extremely well to the \u00a31.1bn Aviva paid for it, having already sold parts of the business worth \u00a3500m and taken dividends along the way,&quot; said Barrie Cornes of Panmure Gordon. Marcus Barnard of Oriel Securities said: &quot;Would I pay 17 times [earnings] for a business? What it tells us is [Carlyle] see a lot of growth potential ... or they see cost-cutting opportunities.&quot; For Aviva, the RAC sale, along with the partial sale of its stake in Amsterdam-based financial services group Delta Lloyd, is a welcome boost after a series of high-profile departures raised questions over its leadership \u2013 in particular the surprise exit of its highly regarded UK chief executive Mark Hodges who left three weeks ago to lead Towergate Insurance. The RAC was founded in 1897 by Frederick Richard Simms. By 1902, it had introduced motorcycle patrols to reach broken-down vehicles amid soaring demand for its services at a time when motoring could be a hazardous pastime. In 1998, the RAC demutualised and was acquired by the Lex group. Communication breakdowns In the years leading up to the credit crunch, private equity was as popular as the baddie at a children&apos;s pantomime. Politicians and unions lined up to slate the industry for profiteering, secrecy, arrogance and for being the undeserved beneficiary of generous tax breaks. But it was the acquisition by Permira of the AA that stuck most in the public craw. Within months of the the 2004 takeover of the organisation, Permira was laying off hundreds of staff, as well as hiving off assets in what the GMB union described as &quot;crude financial engineering of a kind rarely seen in the modern era&quot;. Bound by a self-imposed code of refusing to engage with the media, private equity was reluctant to respond to the wave of negative publicity. But workers sacked by the AA queued up to be interviewed in the newspapers and on television. In true British fashion, a committee was appointed to look into the role of the firms, which by 2007 were employing one in five workers in the private sector. But the probe was sponsored by the industry itself, under the chairmanship of City grandee Sir David Walker. When Walker concluded that private equity should abide by a voluntary code, his findings were attacked by the unions as failing to address the real issues and &quot;not going nearly far enough&quot;. Private equity is accused of using too much debt to fund acquisitions, jeopardising jobs and the financial stability of the acquired companies. During the banking crisis, a number of private equity-owned firms failed because they were unable to refinance at a time when the money markets had dried up. Even though some deals have allowed companies to expand their operations, the industry&apos;s public image remains less than pristine.

Slowly the idea gained traction, turning into a logistical and financial nightmare for its supporters and finally a triumph as Buste de Femme (1943), valued at \u00a34.5m, goes on show in Ramallah today. Thousands of visitors are expected to see the work, the first masterpiece to be exhibited in the Palestinian territories, although only three people will be allowed in at a time to ensure the humidity in the purpose-built viewing room does not damage the 100 x 80 centimetre oil-on-canvas work \u2013 a cubist deconstruction of a woman&apos;s face, dominated by grey hues. The painting&apos;s journey from the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven this week, at a cost of \u00a350,000 in insurance and transport, began when Khaled Hourani, the director of the International Art Academy in Ramallah, visited the museum in 2008 and suggested a loan. &quot;This started off as a crazy idea to bring a European masterpiece to a war-zone but I was only half-joking, &quot; he said. According to Remco de Blaaij, a curator at the Van Abbemuseum, staff began to take the idea seriously and work out how they could lend one of their works to a Palestinian gallery. It is relatively easy for internationally recognised museums to lend each other works of art, but the occupied territory is not a state and does not have a recognised museum. &quot;Insurance was one of the first obstacles. One company declined but another responded with enthusiasm. The head of the company travelled to Ramallah to see how it would work and returned determined to help make it happen,&quot; said De Blaaij. The insurance company required the normal safeguards: three guards in close vicinity and other guards nearby, camera surveillance, and temperature and humidity-controlled room. The academy had to build a room within a room, with a glass sliding door. But insurance was only one problem. Normally, Israeli customs would require a deposit of around 15% of the value of an imported work into its territory to ensure that it was not sold illegally. Buste de Femme has an estimated value of \u00a34.5m. After negotiation, Israeli customs waived the deposit. Earlier this week the painting, weighing about 5kg, was loaded into a 200kg crate, which includes a glass case, layers of protection and shock absorbers. It travelled from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, from where it was flown to Tel Aviv. From there it was moved with a police escort to the Qalandia checkpoint, a regular scene of confrontation between Israeli forces and Palestinian demonstrators, then driven for three miles without an escort through an area where Israeli forces rarely venture and Palestinian police are not allowed to operate. In Ramallah it was placed under Palestinian police guard. Once at the academy it was left to acclimatise for a day before it was unpacked, framed and hung. Hourani said that the Picasso was chosen by the art students and his mother. &quot;I want this to appeal to people like my mother and art students. Picasso remains inspirational because his work is related to war, peace and freedom.&quot; Hourani hopes that Buste de Femme will not be the last masterpiece to be exhibited in the territory. &quot;We want this to become a normality but it is the last time I will do it. It has taken two years to bring one painting but the taboo has been broken and it will be easier for someone else to do it,&quot; he said. &quot;The journey here adds meaning to the painting. It highlights issues of the freedom of movement and political agreement.&quot; The painting will be on display for a month before returning to Eindhoven, but not everyone likes it. Fatima Abdul Karim, the project co-ordinator, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a nice painting but it is a dream come true to have it here. Everyone has a different opinion about what the painting means. &quot;I overheard the security guards discussing it and they came to the conclusion that it was a woman cradling her child in time of war as she has one eye on the child and one eye on the surrounding danger.&quot;", "sentences": ["It travelled from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, from where it was flown to Tel Aviv."], "title": "Picasso coup for tiny art school in occupied Palestinian territory", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/picasso-coup-for-palestine", "tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Pablo Picasso", "Art and design", "Culture", "Museums", "Netherlands", "Israel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-24T22:02:13Z", "article": "What would make you consider buying an electric car? They offer a green way to get around, with the chance to bypass petrol stations. The AA calculates they can be run for about 2p per mile, against around 14p per mile for a similar-sized petrol or diesel car. And they are exempt from road tax and London&apos;s congestion charge. Energy company npower this week revealed that 33% of UK drivers would think about buying an electric vehicle (EV) in the next five years, rising to 41% when the benefits were explained. But despite the introduction in January of a generous \u00a35,000 government purchase grant to encourage more people to take the plunge, it&apos;s fair to say that sales of electrically powered cars in the UK are yet to really take off. Just over 500 people took the government up on its offer in the first quarter of this year. Their high prices \u2013 typically about \u00a325,000 after the grant \u2013 plus a lack of models by major carmakers and a shortage of charging points, have held back sales. However, the last two points are about to change. Potential buyers now have a choice of seven models in the UK, with 13 more on the way, while EDF Energy, British Gas and npower have recently announced plans to start offering to install faster and cheaper charging points in customers&apos; homes, in a move they hope will help kick-start sales. The companies are banking on the fact that buyers of the latest, more consumer-friendly electric cars, such as the Nissan Leaf, are going to boost demand for electricity. The take-up of EVs \u2013 which run entirely on electricity stored in rechargeable batteries \u2013 is seen as central to the plan to cut the transport sector&apos;s carbon emissions, both here and across the European Union. It is predicted that we will be running a total of 800,000 EVs in Britain by 2020, and as a result the race to install a recharging infrastructure is well under way. Transport for London (TfL) recently announced it will have 1,300 EV charging points in London by 2013 \u2013 more than the current number of petrol stations in the capital. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, is on the record as saying he wants to make the city the electric car capital of Europe. Plans are also under way to increase the number of charging points at a variety of locations across the UK \u2013 and soon it will be possible for homeowners to upgrade their garages to allow faster, safer home charging. Until recently, most owners of plug-in-to-recharge electric cars have had to rely on the traditional three-point household plug, and wait about eight hours to fully recharge their vehicle at home. However, the power companies, sensing a good business opportunity, are now vying to sign up electric car-owning households with the offer of cheaper and faster off-peak home charging that will cut the time it takes to recharge the vehicle \u2013 freeing it to make more journeys, and making them more attractive to buyers. So far, EDF, British Gas, and most recently npower have said they will be targeting EV users with special home services as well as cheaper tariffs for recharging vehicles. Speaking in Berlin last week, npower&apos;s head of e-mobility, Phil Evans, told Guardian Money that the company sees EVs as a major opportunity, and as a result it is working on building an &quot;upgradable&quot; charging infrastructure that will develop as the cars&apos; power systems become more sophisticated. In August, npower will be launching the most sophisticated home-charging product yet: a new &quot;juice-e&quot; tariff specifically aimed at EV users anywhere in the country. For about \u00a31,000, npower will carry out a survey of the EV buyer&apos;s home, upgrade the electrics and provide a proper charging point on the premises that will deliver a faster recharge \u2013 bringing the time down from eight to about four hours. Crucially, the homeowner will be able to take advantage of significantly cheaper off-peak power \u2013 similar to the old Economy 7 tariff that would charge up storage heaters at night. The company says it will charge its juice-e customers around 6p/kWh to recharge their vehicles \u2013 about half the standard electricity price, typically saving about \u00a3150 a year in lower recharge costs. It will also supply 100% green energy on the tariff by matching the electricity used by car owners with that produced by its offshore North Hoyle wind farm. RWE, npower&apos;s parent company, has led the development of charging points in its native Germany, and is about to install 150 of them in Amsterdam, another city about to embrace EVs. Last month EDF said it would offer a similar service for \u00a3799, although it is charging a bit more for the off-peak power. It has a tie-up with Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot to be the preferred supplier to those buying an EV from either carmaker. Those signing up for its home-charging deal will be put on EDF&apos;s eco20:20 energy tariff, which provides 20% cheaper electricity during evenings and weekends. British Gas has done a similar deal with Nissan and Renault. It is conducting a trial with the first 150 EV buyers to sign up, and says it will have its EV tariff up and running next year. In the meantime, the race is on to provide charging points at workplaces, supermarkets and so on. In London the 150 charging points recently installed by TfL have been branded under the Source London logo. Users pay \u00a3100 a year for free unlimited recharging, and log on to the system by waving an Oyster-style card over the terminal. It is hoped the Source scheme will be rolled out nationwide, with EV users able to tap into a network of charging points across the country. In north-east England, npower is about to install 55 charging sites; in Milton Keynes there are plans to install 250 public EV charge points over the next three years; and further schemes are planned at other locations. In the long run, npower says all electric car owners will be able to pull into a supermarket or town centre, attach their car to the charging point, get an 80% recharge in about half an hour, and pay for it with a credit card or Oyster-style card. Unbelievably, there is still a VHS/Betamax-style dispute going on among car manufacturers over which charging plug should predominate \u2013 although it should be resolved in the next few months, say insiders. Pros and cons of the electric switch If you think electric cars are nothing more than updated milkfloats, you should take a spin in the Tesla Roadster. Last week Guardian Money drove the 100% electrically powered sports car that is capable of more than 125mph, and found it to be one of the fastest accelerating cars we have ever been in. RWE, npower&apos;s German parent company, uses a Tesla to show just what electric cars are capable of, and we were lucky enough to be let loose on the car at Berlin&apos;s famous Tempelhof airport. The Tesla will to go from 0 to 60mph in around 3.9 seconds, making it faster than many supercars that cost significantly more than its \u00a386,000 price tag. It will cover about 200 miles on a single charge, and the handling was excellent. Perhaps a little more practical was the Mitsubishi i-MiEV that we also tested. Driving it was very similar to any other automatic city car, except there was no exhaust system and no emissions. Potential buyers of an electric car have a choice of seven models in the UK, with more on the way. According to those in the know, the Nissan Leaf, launched earlier this year, took EVs to a whole new level. The Leaf has won plaudits for the fact it is very like other conventional cars of a similar size \u2013 a far cry from the G-Wiz, the vehicle most people probably think of when electric vehicles come to mind. Despite what you may have read about electric cars costing pennies to recharge, each recharge will actually set you back \u00a31 to \u00a33, depending on your electricity tariff. Each one should deliver about 90 miles&apos; driving. This means the &quot;typical&quot; driver (9,000 miles a year) will pay \u00a3250 to \u00a3300 a year in electricity \u2013 less if you use a Source London charging point. Compare that to your current petrol bill, and an EV soon starts to look attractive. Opt for the new Renault Zoe, out next year, and you&apos;ll pay about \u00a370 a month or \u00a3840 a year to lease the batteries. This might sound like a lot, but if there is a problem with them, the lease firm will have to pick up the tab. On other EVs, you own the batteries as part of the car. Electric cars enjoy free car tax each year \u2013 but so do some low-emission diesel cars and a few petrol models, so you won&apos;t save much there unless you are abandoning a gas-guzzler. Servicing should be a little cheaper for electric \u2013 there is no oil or filter to change. However, it looks as though it will cost more to insure. The cost of depreciation \u2013 the biggest cost of new car ownership \u2013 is, at this point, unknown. Money has concluded that drivers switching to an EV certainly won&apos;t lose money, and you could well make some financial gains. If you typically drive a series of shorter runs, you can make a strong financial case for going electric. When the asking prices come down \u2013 as they surely will \u2013 there will be a strong financial incentive for urban dwellers to drive an EV.", "sentences": ["RWE, npower&apos;s parent company, has led the development of charging points in its native Germany, and is about to install 150 of them in Amsterdam, another city about to embrace EVs."], "title": "Electric cars: kiss petrol stations goodbye", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jun/24/electric-cars-home-charging-services", "tags": ["Motoring", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Travel and transport", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Motoring", "Technology", "TfL"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-25T23:08:13Z", "article": "Over the past 20 years or so, Brighton has gained an enviable reputation for being cool. Its thriving centre plays host to a young population and the town is one of the most gay-friendly in Europe. But Brighton also has a drugs problem: there was an average of almost one drug-related death every week \u2013 50 in total \u2013 in 2009, and last year around 35 deaths were attributed to drugs. Brighton is the drug death capital of the UK, with the highest mortality rate from drugs per capita. The situation is not expected to improve soon. &quot;There was a bad crop in Afghanistan last year, which meant the heroin being taken recently was of very bad quality. A lot of the time it will have been dust&quot;, said Mike Pattinson, the director of operations for CRI, a charity rehabilitating drug users in the city. &quot;But we hear this year&apos;s crop is a bumper one, which means the quality will be much higher and people will overdose. They won&apos;t cope with the strength of what they are taking.&quot; Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, has called for a new approach, having identified an unlikely ally. She wants to exploit the localism agenda of communities secretary Eric Pickles, the no-nonsense cabinet bruiser from Bradford, to decriminalise drug use in the city. If Lucas, the first Green MP in England, gets her way, a town which has gained a reputation as one of the most tolerant in the country will become a pioneer in liberal drugs policy as well. She claims the government&apos;s localism strategy echoes, at least on the surface, the Global Commission on Drugs Policy&apos;s recent recommendation that local administrations be allowed to develop their own approaches, if there are grounds to believe these will deliver improved health or social outcomes. If her argument is accepted, Brighton will attempt to amend the laws on drugs and criminality for a trial period. Her plan, she insists, does not stem from a desire to foster the cannabis cafe culture of Amsterdam on the south coast, but because the death toll demands a rethink. &quot;The current free-for-all in which anyone can manufacture, sell or get hold of drugs needs to end \u2014 through proper regulation, strict controls on who can buy what and when, and ending the criminal control of drug markets,&quot; Lucas recently said in a speech to health workers. &quot;I think somewhere like Brighton should be able to say our experience shows that prohibition and abstinence don&apos;t work \u2014 and we want to try something different.&quot; Strikingly, Lucas has the measured support of the senior police officer in this most cosmopolitan of cities. Chief Inspector Graham Bartlett knows he is on perilous ground, but his 22 years working with drug users has persuaded him that now is the time for change. &quot;It is important to say first of all that what I am expressing is a personal view and my officers will enforce the law as it stands,&quot; Bartlett told the Observer. &quot;But we have drugs usage which is worse than Liverpool and parts of London, and though drug addiction is properly regarded in the country as a physiological addiction we deal with it as a crime. The people who manufacture drugs and supply them should be jailed, but the people that use them need treatment.&quot; Bartlett said people would feel less at risk of criminal records and criminal convictions \u2013 and therefore more willing to seek treatment. Ten years ago Portugal abolished criminal penalties for possession of drugs. Instead those caught with drugs for personal use are sent to so-called &quot;dissuasion boards&quot; consisting of social workers and psychologists who question users on their drug habit and have the power to impose fines or recommend treatment. Users caught with drugs more than once are ordered to appear at police stations or a doctor&apos;s surgery. The result, according to a study, is that drug use among teens in Portugal has declined, rates of new HIV infections caused by sharing of dirty needles have dropped, while the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction has more than doubled Such an approach would not be entirely alien to the south coast of England. While the death rate may be high in Brighton, Pattinson and his team at the CRI are proud of what they have achieved recently in preventing worse. The charity runs a needle exchange and drop-in centre a short stroll from the front by Victoria Gardens, one of the city&apos;s most popular parks. There is no sign on the navy blue shop front and the lightly frosted glass prevents those passing by from peering in. But inside it is bright and airy. And what they do here is to treat those coming for help \u2013 be it a clean needle, advice or therapy \u2013 as clients, not as criminals. &quot;We want to be a friendly face,&quot; said the centre&apos;s manager. &quot;We probably get 30 people coming through our door every day and we try to help. If it is a matter of swapping needles, then we are at least in contact and we can build relationships and offer advice.&quot; There are more than 700 registered needle exchange users and the service distributed 195,000 needles last year with a 99% return rate. But crucially there were also 1,140 people in treatment \u2013 of whom 383 were new, while 144 of them left the service drug free. Meanwhile, CRI works with Bartlett on Operation Reduction which has seen the charity focus on &quot;user dealers&quot; on the streets, while the police seek to cut off supply. It has had impressive results. Pattinson said: &quot;It is no good arresting street level dealers and putting them in prison for three or four weeks because it is such a lucrative market; there are so many vulnerable people you just get more taking their place. &quot;Caroline Lucas is pushing at an open door here. She wants evidence-based policy, and we simply say it would be madness to have anything other than policy based on evidence.&quot;", "sentences": ["Her plan, she insists, does not stem from a desire to foster the cannabis cafe culture of Amsterdam on the south coast, but because the death toll demands a rethink."], "title": "Drug death 'capital' Brighton to put treatment ahead of punishment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jun/26/drug-death-capital-brighton-treatment-punishment", "tags": ["Drugs", "Health", "Society", "Drugs policy", "Politics", "Crime", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-06-26T16:00:00Z", "article": "The woman in the tight white top and even tighter black trousers teeters out of an upmarket clothes shop on very high heels and glances balefully at a lowering grey sky.

She extricates it from a tight breast pocket, clicks and begins a conversation. The hand that holds the umbrella is doing the (wobbly) steering. You&apos;ve never seen so many road safety no-nos in your life. But hey! Welcome to Amsterdam! Cyclists rule in this city. Take a population of 780,000. Reckon that 75% of them over the age of 12 owns a bike, and that over half of them take a spin every day. Then look, in amazement, at the kit they wear (or rather, the kit they don&apos;t wear). No lurid jackets or flashing lights. No protective pads, gloves or twiddly bits. And no helmets, either. Nobody wears a helmet. The mums winding along Prinsengracht, one baby strapped into a chair on the handlebars, another squashed in behind, has no helmet (and no brakes either). The dad with the toddler squatting in a rickety wooden box up front eating a doughnut has no helmet. The hundreds of kids racing around Leidseplein wouldn&apos;t dream of wearing a helmet. But nobody cares. Why should they? Safety comes in less obvious ways. All those millions of rides a year involve only six or seven deaths. Amsterdam works hard at ensuring that, to be sure. Lots of investment in cycle lanes, special traffic lights, intensive education et al. And simple physical things \u2013 like streets that heavy goods vehicles and bendy buses can&apos;t reach \u2013 help, too. Yet still the lack of protective kit is amazing. If I go out in my London park this morning I&apos;ll see small children on small bikes wearing huge pink helmets whilst mum trots anxiously in their wake. If I raise the question in America, I&apos;ll be sonorously informed that 60% of cycling deaths stem from head injuries and that researchers say a properly fitted helmet saves a life in between 74% and 85% of cases. It&apos;s the most conventional problem and response going. See danger? Fear danger? Go out and buy something to make it seem less. But Amsterdam takes an exactly opposite stance. Who wants to lug heavy helmets between office and home? Who needs to put on modern body armour to take a bike ride? Helmets and the rest don&apos;t increase safety overall. In practical terms, they shrink cycle use \u2013 and the more it shrinks, the more people (walking, driving) get killed. In short, doing the safe thing is the stupid, unsafe thing. Far, far better to create an easy-going environment where ladies in tight trousers holding umbrellas can wobble down Hooftstraat unmolested. Far better to plonk all human life in a big picture frame. For statistics don&apos;t tell every story (indeed, statistics \u2013 like those ones about helmets saving lives \u2013 usually tell\u00a0a variety of conflicting stories). How\u00a0many street cameras equal safety from crime? You&apos;d be hard put to make sense of the correlations. When the western world embraces the whole concept of &quot;security&quot;, ringing airports with steel and glum bureaucracies ordering you to take your shoes off, is that prudence or the whole, costly promise of safety turned grotesque? If the most quoted reason why more Britons (and Americans) don&apos;t go out on a bike is fear\u00a0of getting knocked off it, then why\u00a0don&apos;t we tackle the spectre\u00a0of\u00a0fear\u00a0itself?

Seed sowing was over until next year. I was surprised by this because there is still time to grow quite a lot of produce from seed for eating in summer and early autumn. Some of the Japanese varieties of turnips sown in early July will be golf ball size within the month. Turnip &apos;Market Express&apos; is first past the post with a 30-day turnaround. The RHS Award winner &apos;Tokyo Cross&apos; will be ready five days later. Its additional attribute in that it won&apos;t get &apos;pithy&apos; or coarse if you leave it to grow on for winter eating.  Young mustardy turnip leaves are spicy thrown into salads or stir fried. Incidentally, remember that turnips come under the brassica group in the rotation scheme \u2013 not the root family as one might be forgiven to expect \u2013 so they should go in the cabbage patch. Young beetroots and turnips make good cooking partners. Among the best for a quick crop of beetroot is &apos;Burpees Golden&apos;, a mild flavoured, amber-fleshed cultivar which will be ready to eat in seven weeks. Blood red beetroot &apos;Pronto&apos; is just as quick. It is delicious at the ping pong stage and produces exceptionally tasty tops. \u00a0      Carrots can be eaten at any stage and don't need to mature    If you are happy to eat them young, carrots will grow neck and neck with beetroots and turnips. They come in a dazzling array of colours these days, however, for tried and tested speed, go for early varieties such as &apos;Early Nantes&apos; , &apos;Nantes 2&apos;, and &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos;. Carrots can be eaten at any stage of their growth and don&apos;t need to ripen or mature.  It is getting on the tight side now to sow summer squash. However, the &apos;Patty Pan&apos; \u2013 the scallop or flying saucer squash \u2013 is at its best when only an inch or two across. Eaten like this, it only takes 49 days from seed to plate.  Dwarf French beans are quicker than the climbing types. Good varieties for sowing now are the &apos;baby&apos; varieties that have been bred to be at their most delicious and nutritious when still small. &apos;Speedy&apos; is probably is the record breaker being ready in seven weeks. The RHS Award of Garden Merit &apos;Annabel&apos;, is another good choice and would pass the post about a week later.  Although they don&apos;t care for heat, you can get a crop of peas in just over three months providing you site them well and keep watered. Mangetout, being immature, are faster and a better bet. &apos;Oregon Sugar Pod&apos;, for example, takes 68 days on average. It is also worth growing a few for the young pea shoots, which are a delicacy in salads and can be ready to harvest in two weeks.      Radishes are ready to eat within four weeks    Baby leaf salads can be kept going throughout the year with a six week turnaround and varying the choice of leaves to the time of year. Planted under the beans or peas they will get some refreshing shade at midday. Racing greens \u2013 eg, leaf beet, rainbow chard, komatsuna, and chrysanthemum greens \u2013 can all be slotted in and enjoyed well before the first frosts. Pak choi can be eaten as baby leaf in as little as three weeks and as a headed crop in six.  Radishes will be ready to eat in four weeks. &apos;Cherrybelle&apos; and &apos;French Breakfast&apos; are two of the most popular and reliable types.  As the schools break up, your thoughts might turn to a bit of nature study. I was surprised to find I could keep some three year olds totally absorbed for a good half hour by providing magnifying glasses (\u00a31 each at the market) for an informal bug study.      Sunflowers are tailor-made  for kids    Butterflies are always particularly fascinating and, while you would need to doa little research into particular food plants if you were to be serious about it, you can rely upon lavender and \u2013 even more so \u2013 on buddleia, which will flower non-stop until next term, to draw in a good selection. Sunflower seeds are tailor-made for young children. They will grow almost as you watch them. Each visit will show progress. Depending on variety, you could grow a giant of up to 6m, a good talking point through the summer holidays.

I was sipping Afghan soup with an English-speaking Afghan student. She was sitting at a picnic table with her family. It could have been New York or Amsterdam. She explained that they had planned to go to the Kabul museum, but forgot to check the opening hours, and it was closed. &quot;Stupid huh?&quot; she laughed. So, she was just passing time in the park, looking at the magnificent view. Last night I was reporting from almost the same spot. Journalists from all over the world were calling me on my mobile phone, asking for the latest about the ongoing fighting in and around the hotel, which had been attacked by suicide bombers. I had to take cover from outgoing fire from the hotel, rocket-propelled grenades and so on. I couldn&apos;t help but say: &quot;Shit, what was that?&quot; during one of the interviews with \u2013 I think \u2013 ABC Australia (sorry for the use of that word, colleagues) when two huge explosions were heard. The question I got asked the most was: why did the Afghan forces not manage to secure the place properly? What does it say about the current status of the training of the police? In these &quot;phoners&quot; as they are called, you have no more then three minutes to explain what is going on. And you have to keep it simple. What I would have loved to explain is that the solution to the conflict here in Afghanistan lies not in more barbed wire in the park in front of the hotel or on any other places foreigners visit. I would have loved to explain that the conflict in Afghanistan is, in fact, a political one. While discussions are going on about fewer troops, the west refuses to talk seriously about solving the huge political crisis that creates the kind of outburst of violence we saw last night at the hotel. The government of Hamid Karzai is digging its own grave with enormous corruption and patronage. In the meantime excluded groups find each other, make deals with whoever has an interest in fighting and commit attacks. Of course, in an unstable situation like this the security forces \u2013 despite the training they get from the Nato \u2013 will be affected by this gameplay. They are instruments of commanders and ministers who are all trying to survive, to support their own group, and have lost any connection with normal Afghans. They are manipulated, used to facilitate attacks or sidelined by their boss&apos; private militias. While I was watching ISAF-helicopters coming to the scene, being shot at by the insurgents on the roof, I tried to explain that the planned transition is doomed to fail as long as this situation stays as it is. Another question was &quot;is this a Bombay-like attack&quot; in Kabul? Has the capital entered a new stage of violence? I tried to tell them: does this matter? As long as the political crisis is not addressed and Nato and the relatively small group of diplomats who are based here do not seek the political solution, there might be an attack even bigger than the one in Bombay. And rolling barbed wire over that lovely park where students and families try to have a normal life won&apos;t make any difference.", "sentences": ["It could have been New York or Amsterdam."], "title": "Kabul hotel attack is down to political gameplay | Bette Dam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/29/kabul-hotel-attack-political-gameplay", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "Hamid Karzai", "Taliban", "Nato", "World news", "South and Central Asia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-07-02T23:05:00Z", "article": "How to describe Antony Hegarty&apos;s voice? Since the release of his band Antony and the Johnsons&apos; 2005 album I Am A\u00a0Bird Now (which chronicled his experiences as a transgender person and was the surprise winner of the Mercury prize, selling upwards of 500,000 copies), there have been many attempts to categorise his sound, ranging from &quot;chamber pop&quot; to &quot;ethereal torch singing&quot;. One of his early mentors, Lou Reed (hardly the gushing type) said: &quot;When I heard Antony, I knew that I was in the presence of an angel.&quot; As a fan, and I&apos;m a huge fan of Hegarty&apos;s, it&apos;s hard not to descend into hyperbole when it comes to his most beautiful songs: &quot;Hope There&apos;s Someone&quot; from I Am A Bird; &quot;One Dove&quot; from 2009&apos;s The Crying Light; the exquisite &quot;My Lord, My Love&quot; from the deluxe edition of the latest album, Swanlights. At its best, his voice whispers to the listener about mortality and eternity. Indeed, only Hegarty seems prepared to be matter of fact about his voice. &quot;It honestly wasn&apos;t that special when I started \u2013 no one thought I had a nice voice as a kid,&quot; he says bluntly when we sit down to talk, at a table full of lit candles, in the dressing room for the Manchester International Festival (MIF). Hegarty says that, far from being some &quot;gift from God&quot;, his voice was all about persistence and application. &quot;I really think anyone can sing. It&apos;s a matter of rain or shine, not giving up, applying yourself. That&apos;s what I did: I copied my favourite singers and learned \u2013 singing for hours and hours, years and years. Eventually,&quot; says Hegarty, &quot;I got my voice.&quot; Ironically, Hegarty and I get off to a shaky start, owing to my turning up to interview him with my own croaking voice, a remnant from a virus. Hearing it he looks aghast, and angles himself away from me. It&apos;s understandable \u2013 he&apos;s in Manchester for the final stages of rehearsal for The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic, a staged biography of Serbian-born &quot;godmother of performance art&quot; Abramovic&apos;s life, to be performed at the MIF, directed by Robert Wilson, featuring music by Hegarty and avant-garde &quot;soundscape artist&quot; William Basinski. I spend the first few minutes of the interview trying to convince Hegarty that I&apos;m not infectious, and even (rather desperately) try to bond with him about the fact he once lost his voice mysteriously for a year and had to be treated with steroids. Hegarty listens to these croaking, rasping excuses with blank-faced politeness, before saying firmly at the end: &quot;No, yours definitely sounds like an infection,&quot; adding more kindly, with a tap to his throat: &quot;Perhaps a bit of asthma in there?&quot; It&apos;s a &quot;closed&quot; rehearsal for The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic, but I&apos;m briefly allowed to watch Antony and the cast. I won&apos;t pretend that I have the foggiest what&apos;s going on, but it all looks very interesting, even without the full set and props. People walk around in &quot;Marina&quot; masks, while Wilson&apos;s team directs via microphones. Actor Willem Dafoe (narrating and performing) dons first an army uniform and then a\u00a0bathrobe. At one point Abramovic perches on a makeshift bed, with coffins lined up at the side, while Hegarty sings with his back to the audience. A close friend of Hegarty&apos;s, Abramovic tells me that he was her only choice for the symphony. &quot;My life has been about so much pain, and Antony wrote the songs for this piece like he was making a costume, sewing directly on to my skin.&quot; Back in the dressing room Hegarty tells me that it&apos;s a far cry from his youth in Manhattan in the 1990s, studying experimental theatre at NYU and staging underground cabaret nights with his troupe Blacklips (their act variously involved throwing offal, and flailing around in piles of &quot;Aids corpses&quot;). &quot;That was much more anarchic,&quot; he says. &quot;Bob has such a particular structured aesthetic; it&apos;s all about exactitude. Everything has to be perfect to have the quality he&apos;s looking for, down to every hand movement being choreographed. I love it. It&apos;s an exciting and interesting way to work.&quot; Hegarty sips his drink on his side of the candles. He&apos;s sometimes described as if he&apos;s freakishly large, a Hagrid-style man-mountain, which he isn&apos;t \u2013 he&apos;s just solidly built and tall (6ft 4in). There&apos;s a delicacy, indeed femininity, about the way his dark hair hangs around his pale, intense face; in repose there are times when he resembles Leonardo Da Vinci&apos;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Conversationally, when he warms up, Hegarty can be spiky and engaging on the subjects he&apos;s interested in, which is quite a\u00a0list: gender, capitalism, the environmental concerns that infused his last two albums \u2013 he&apos;s disappointed that President Obama hasn&apos;t taken a stronger stand. It&apos;s probably to be expected that, as a transgender man, he muses a lot about &quot;the subjugation of the feminine aspect by the male&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s something we haven&apos;t tried as people yet \u2013 radically empowering our feminine aspect.&quot; When I ask if he has feminist sympathies, he looks surprised: &quot;Not just sympathies \u2013 I identify very strongly with feminists.&quot; He seems to makes no bones about being on the precious side of arty, though he can be disarming, saying of the 138-page book of his art that comes with the deluxe edition of Swanlights: &quot;Was I that good at art when I was younger? No, and I&apos;m still not now.&quot; However, while Hegarty can talk up a storm about theories and ideas, what he calls &quot;being an artist, participating&quot;, he&apos;s somewhat unforthcoming about his personal life or, as he puts it: &quot;the domestic details&quot;. However much I hint, there&apos;s no getting out of him whether he has a boyfriend. He&apos;s also tetchy to the point of rudeness about going over his back story. &quot;Do you really want to rehash it again?&quot; Well, yes. As a fan, I love the tales of the young Antony romping about the Lower East Side dressed in a woman&apos;s slip, shaven-headed, with &quot;Fuck Off&quot; written on his forehead. Surely, Antony, such a lengthy, unorthodox apprenticeship should be celebrated? Hegarty smiles: &quot;I suppose it did take a long time to get where I\u00a0was going. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m even there yet. I&apos;m amazed it keeps rolling forward, really.&quot; Born in Sussex in 1971 to an Anglo-Irish family, Hegarty moved with them to Amsterdam, then California, when he was 10. Already sensing his &quot;transgender difference&quot; but not knowing how to make sense of it, Hegarty was\u00a0drawn to British acts such as Kate Bush, Marc Almond, the Cocteau Twins, Yazoo and Culture Club, as well as practising singing to Nina Simone. He felt especially drawn to photographs of Boy George \u2013 &quot;pure femininity radiating from his face&quot; \u2013 and, later, the performance artist Leigh Bowery. Hegarty says that he was &quot;sociable and creative&quot; growing up, a habit he hasn&apos;t lost. He&apos;s a\u00a0seasoned collaborator, working with, among others, Reed, Bj\u00f6rk, Yoko Ono, Boy George and Rufus Wainwright, a multitude of fringe artists (some of whom featured when he took over the Guardian&apos;s music site last year) and various orchestras around the world, including the London Symphony Orchestra. &quot;I&apos;m always drawn to collaboration, working in community,&quot; says Hegarty. &quot;To me that&apos;s three-quarters of the joy \u2013 to be in dialogue with someone else. I think oftentimes as a kid I moved towards creative work as a means of breaking my own isolation.&quot; By 12 he was writing songs, progressing to whole musicals (based on the oeuvre of John Waters). He was rejected by the Royal College of Art but NYU accepted him, and he wasn&apos;t nervous about moving to New York. &quot;I was hardboiled, renegade, ready to move to the big city. I wanted to be in the centre of the storm.&quot; It was probably the best place for a transgender boy to be. Hegarty has sung and spoken about being transgender many times, most notably in &quot;For Today I Am A Boy&quot;, with its opening lyric: &quot;One day I&apos;ll grow up/I&apos;ll be a\u00a0beautiful woman&quot;. One wonders whether some people are still confusing transgender with gay or transsexual. &quot;The emergence of a transgender aspect is very different to the emergence of sexual orientation, though there are intersecting circles,&quot; explains Hegarty. He believes it&apos;s primarily a &quot;family issue&quot;, not, as he&apos;s colourfully put it in past interviews, &quot;all about his meat and potatoes&quot;. Does this kind of prurient interest irritate him? No, says Hegarty. &quot;People don&apos;t have as much experience thinking about it as I do. It&apos;s not as if they talk about it in school: &apos;OK, children, there&apos;s Jack, there&apos;s Jill, and there&apos;s Zane&apos; or whoever. We&apos;re raised to\u00a0believe that there are only two ways of raising children: a pink and a blue model. God forbid you transgress those boundaries.&quot; As one of the few prominent transgender people, does he feels it&apos;s his duty to speak out? &quot;I don&apos;t see it as a duty,&quot; says Hegarty, &quot;I see it as more of a pleasure.&quot; Hegarty says that he now feels grateful for being transgender: &quot;Expressively, emotionally, as an artist, as a singer.&quot; Still, there&apos;s a\u00a0difference between a celebrated transgender adult and a\u00a0transgender child \u2013 it must have been frightening growing up. &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;Because I\u00a0was never anything else. It was just my nature. It was frightening what other people were saying \u2013 that I was going to eternal hell just because of who I was.&quot; Perhaps this is why he seems increasingly drawn to subverting religious imagery in his work. Hegarty nods: &quot;I&apos;m interested in that mythology. I was raised as a Catholic, and I took it very seriously until around the age of 10, when I realised that it wasn&apos;t inclusive. I\u00a0figured that out pretty quick: &apos;There is no seat for me,&apos; not within that institution of religious thinking. There was only condemnation for people like me.&quot; Momentarily, Hegarty sounds sad. &quot;That&apos;s why I want to turn these things on their heads,&quot; he says, &quot;Talk about simple ideas like Jesus as a girl, Allah as a woman, Buddha as a mother. I\u00a0find the feminisation of spiritual deities, especially in the west, helpful. It restores a sense of balance.&quot; I wonder how all this would go down in, say, Middle America, but Hegarty seems unconcerned: &quot;I&apos;m so far removed from those circles; people don&apos;t notice me twittering on.&quot; Several albums down the line, Hegarty says that he hasn&apos;t changed his attitude towards fame. He was shocked to win the Mercury prize for I Am A Bird Now and grateful for the New York apartment he was subsequently able to buy. However, he&apos;s scathing about capitalism as the universal barometer of success: &quot;We don&apos;t go to a nun and say that her life has been a\u00a0failure because she didn&apos;t create world peace; instead, she prayed in a room for 50 years. There are plenty of artists creating art for 50 years \u2013 whether or not capitalism rewards that work can&apos;t be the full measure of its validity.&quot; How does he maintain a relationship with his fans? &quot;I don&apos;t have a relationship with my fans,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel I am in dialogue with culture generally. I have a relationship with the work; they have a relationship with the work. It doesn&apos;t mean that we have a relationship.&quot; Hegarty feels that there are a lot of illusions about fame generally. &quot;Fame doesn&apos;t change anything in your personal life. It&apos;s not like you&apos;re suddenly assigned five people who care more about you than they did before.&quot; For Hegarty, getting to work with the likes of Bj\u00f6rk, Ono and Boy George are the real perks. &quot;It&apos;s such a\u00a0privilege,&quot; he says, suddenly looking quite shy. &quot;That I would have the chance to collaborate with them \u2013 and they would see me as a\u00a0peer \u2013 is just shocking to me.&quot; Our conversation has come to a close. Quite apart from anything else, Abramovic is now wafting around the dressing room making fresh soup for lunch (she tells me later that she does this every day). Then Dafoe comes in and sits silently waiting for the soup. With them, Hegarty and I, and the candles, we&apos;re starting to resemble a performance piece by ourselves. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to have to break here,&quot; says Hegarty sweetly, though I suspect he&apos;s relieved to get away from my germ-laden croaking. Afterwards, the strongest impression I&apos;m left with about Hegarty is of someone determined to be true to himself, whatever the cost. Indeed, before he leaves, to sing, beautifully, angelically, with his back to the audience, we get into a discussion about the job of an artist. Hegarty tells me that he believes artists have different jobs at different times. &quot;Sometimes our job is to be contrary, sometimes it&apos;s our job to be whimsical. But sometimes\u2026&quot; He pauses thoughtfully. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s just our job to show up at a funeral and sing the funeral song, and express our joy at being alive.&quot; The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic is on at the Manchester International Festival, 9-16 July (mif.co.uk). Antony and the Johnsons are playing at the Wilderness Festival on 14 August (wildernessfestival.com) \u2022 This article was amended on 4 July 2011.

These are just a few reasons why I chose to pursue an MBA with The Open University. Arguably an MBA isn&apos;t an obvious essential for a public leader or someone who&apos;s first task was a mission to Madagascar, but after a year in the job I believe it helps. Diplomatic excellence nowadays is about much more than good foreign policy. Like most public service leadership roles, we need to be able to manage delivery and lead teams; it&apos;s important to get value for every pound of taxpayers&apos; money we spend. Our performance is judged on our ability to get the best out of our local staff around the world, to devise strategies and build alliances to solve the big security problems of the world. We also promote British business to achieve growth, employment and wealth creation at home. This is also a client-facing role so I strive to provide excellent customer service to our consular clients. My MBA has given me the confidence to deliver on all aspects of my job while address challenges strategically. It&apos;s certainly given me a profound understanding of the levers I can push to use my influence to achieve objectives. For any public leader with a diverse portfolio to manage I think the training I have been through would prove useful. A good example of my MBA in action is my monthly visit to Madagascar. The foreign secretary recently announced that the UK would open an embassy there once the political situation allows it. My job is to devise a business plan to make that vision a reality. I need all my skills to achieve that: negotiating, strategic thinking, crisis management \u2013 the tools and techniques I learnt studying for an MBA are extremely useful in my day-to-day job. Those tools help me better understand and plan an embassy opening in a country that hasn&apos;t had a recognised government for over two years. The country has unique and vital biodiversity, numerous commercial interests for UK companies and over 400 British residents. Madagascar is a complex landscape, there is desperate poverty but also an appetite and potential to grow it&apos;s economy through tourism. These factors determine how business plan develops. MBA&apos;s take commitment. To secure an MBA you need to work rigorously; you need resilience, determination and flexibility to adapt if things don&apos;t go to plan or if needs change. You need an open mind too \u2013 all traits that make a good diplomat. A good thing about some MBA&apos;s is the flexibility to study part-time, this was an essential part of me choosing where to study as my work also involves a lot of travelling. When I started the MBA I was in Bulgaria, by the end I was in Mauritius. During my three years of study and as my job and availability of low-cost flights allowed, I attended tutorials in Brussels, Dublin, Amsterdam, London, Munich, Vienna, Dusseldorf, Zurich and Bucharest. This for me is the beauty and flexibility of the global OU MBA. I&apos;m a self-confessed Myers Briggs extrovert so it was important for me to meet other students to discuss ideas and concepts. My course had such a diversity of international students \u2013 a bonus for a diplomat who needs the highest level of cultural understanding. The content and format of the course has helped me develop as a person and as a diplomat. What&apos;s more, studying for MBA while working has trained me to tackle a brief fast \u2013 Murphy&apos;s Law says that whenever I have a deadline, that is when a crisis hits in the office! I have had to plan my delivery carefully, absorb volumes of information, produce concise reports quickly and adapt at speed as situations arise \u2013 an MBA is fantastic training for that. The bottom-line, multitasking under pressure is what an MBA is all about and it&apos;s what my job is all about; that&apos;s why I am passionate about both.

The &apos;second chance&apos; ticket round The much anticipated &quot;second chance&quot; ticket round closed on Sunday, with a further 750,000 tickets sold to 150,000 applicants who had not obtained any tickets in the opening ballot. During the first two frantic hours of the second ballot, there was such a high demand for the 40,000 remaining athletics tickets on the official website that a minority were wrongly led to believe that they had been successful in their application. \u2022 Bookmark this page for all the latest Olympic tickets news 2. High praise The International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, praised London&apos;s &quot;faultless&quot; ticketing process and the &quot;amazing&quot; ticket sales. The three-times gold medallist Bradley Wiggins, by contrast, described the process as &quot;a shambles&quot;. 3. Insufficient interest in the beautiful game? It might be our national sport but it appears few people are desperate to see football at the Olympics next summer. There are still 1.5m tickets available for the men&apos;s and women&apos;s football \u2013 the third round of sales began on Friday morning at 6am \u2013 and it is one of only three events that has yet to sell out, the other two being volleyball and freestyle wrestling. That fact alone, however, is a little misleading: after all, football is played in larger venues and hence more tickets were available to start with. In fact, football accounts for more than 2.5m of the 8.8m Olympic tickets produced in total. \u2022 Richard Williams on why we shouldn&apos;t sneer at Olympic football 4. More controversy over the Olympic Stadium There is fresh controversy surrounding the Olympic Park Legacy Company&apos;s awarding of the Olympic Stadium to West Ham rather than Tottenham Hotspur, after it emerged that an employee, Dionne Knight, had been undertaking paid consultancy work for West Ham. The dispute between the two London clubs looks set to continue, with West Ham planning to take legal action against Spurs and the Sunday Times. 5. Equestrian site has the wow factor A competition featuring 40 riders got under way at Greenwich Park, south-east London on Monday. It is the first large-scale event in the test series preparing sites for the Games. Despite recent protests against using the world heritage site for the Olympics, the test event drew praise from William Fox-Pitt who said the site had the &quot;wow&quot; factor, adding: &quot;The surface was fantastic, better than anywhere we&apos;ve seen. It was fantastic to ride on.&quot; But other eventers criticised the arena as &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;nowhere near good enough&quot;. \u2022 Browse Tom Jenkins&apos;s gallery of the equestrian test event 6. Tweet away! The IOC has published guidelines for athletes wanting to blog and post on Twitter during the Games. Postings ought to be &quot;first-person, diary-type&quot; entries, &quot;dignified and in good taste&quot; and &quot;not contain vulgar or obscene words or images&quot;.

A new tune at the All England Club Locog, the 2012 Olympic organising committee, wants the tennis staged at SW19 to have a contrasting atmosphere to the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, which will have finished 20 days earlier. The organisers are eager to make the event a more rousing affair, with athletes coming on court to songs of their choice. Goodbye strawberries and cream. Hello Queen and Tina Turner. 8. Good week/bad week It was a good week for British rowing as four of the crews hoping to win gold at 2012 won against fierce opposition at the Henley Regatta. The highlight was a record-breaking victory for the men&apos;s four against the USA, beating them by two-and-a-half strokes. It was a bad week for Great Britain&apos;s women&apos;s hockey team, as they finished fifth in the Champions Trophy in Amsterdam. Great Britain had been hoping to build on their bronze medal in the competition last year, but were unable to replicate their achievements. 9.

During the off-season, the Newcastle midfielder has been gadding about having a rare old time, tweeting from Royal Ascot, Wimbledon and Glastonbury, where he&apos;s been rubbing shoulders with the great and the good in his down time. A keen student of bloodstock and breeding, Joey would probably be the first to admit that it&apos;s a step up from the degenerates with whom he was forced to mingle during his sent-down time. But now that it&apos;s time to return to the serious business of playing football, a stop has been put to Joey&apos;s gallop. With Newcastle set to embark on a pre-season tour to America on Sunday, he&apos;s been precluded from tweeting from the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore or the Golden Gate Bridge after the fusty old squares in immigration refused to issue him with a visa due to the violent &quot;previous&quot; that earned him a six-month spell in the Big House back in 2008. Since emerging from jail, Joey has sworn off the gargle and kept his bib clean, slowly rebuilding his reputation on the back of some sterling on-field performances, a refusal to blame anyone but himself for his shortcomings in the Rage department and a refreshingly sardonic sense of humour that ensures he isn&apos;t slow about pouring scorn on many of the idiots he is forced to play for, with, and against, whenever he feels they need to be taken down a peg or two. &quot;Visa story is correct, they told me am not allowed in until I have 5yrs without any trouble. 3yrs down, 2yrs to go,&quot; tweeted Barton today. &quot;Totally [sic] hypocrisy considering what they get up to but rules are rules. I cant be bothered dwelling on negative&apos;s [sic],&quot; he added, directing his followers to a statement he&apos;d issued that showed a typically commendable lack of self-pity. &quot;I regret not being able to travel with the club on this trip, but at the same time, I don&apos;t expect to be treated any differently or more favourably than anyone else in a similar situation. All I can do is continue to improve as a person, which is what I intend to do.&quot; While the Fiver wishes Joey all the best in his efforts at self-improvement, our happiness to write nice things about him is always tempered by the fact that his next &apos;legal lapse&apos; might not be too far away. But we&apos;re taking comfort from the fact that, instead of travelling to the US, he&apos;s off to Amsterdam with Newcastle&apos;s reserves instead. In such a haven of liberal and debauched bacchanalian excess, surely nothing whatsoever can possibly go wrong. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;You want to be playing at the best club - I&apos;m at that - and you want to be training with the best players and under the best manager - I am certainly doing that&quot; - Considering he was on the bench in Big Cup final last season, you&apos;d think Michael Owen would know he doesn&apos;t play for Barcelona. PERHAPS ARSENE DOES KNOW If the Fiver were to invite the chief marketing mandarin of Etihad Airways to its next birthday bash and stipulate very clearly that he should dress casually and only bring a small token present, we would not be surprised if he turned up in a brand new black velvet tuxedo with matching top hat and cape and bearing a gift-wrapped golden Ferrari with mohair interior and wheels of solid unobtainium. We&apos;re not saying that this is a man who regularly goes overboard, but nor would we advise against him wearing a life-jacket 24 hours a day and informing the coastguard of his every move. Arsene Wenger may or may not have been spending time in the sea recently but he certainly smells something fishy: the world-record fee that Etihad Airways have paid to have Manchester City&apos;s stadium named after their company has led the Arsenal manager to wonder whether the airline and the football club, whose Abu Dhabi owners are closely linked, might be sticking a &quot;Kick Me Please!&quot; sticker on the back of Uefa&apos;s financial fair play rules, which are supposed to prevent clubs from spending much more than they legitimately earn. Wenger wants Uefa big cheese Michel Platini to look into the City-Etihad deal, while the Fiver feels like a bit of a mug for having mentioned Etihad four times now but not having got a penny for it. &quot;It raises the real question about the credibility of the financial fair play,&quot; Wenger wibbled of the stadium naming rights deal. &quot;That is what this is all about. They give us the message that they can get around it by doing what they want. It means financial fair play will not come in \u2026 if the financial fair play is to have a chance, the sponsorship has to be at the market price. It cannot be doubled, tripled or quadrupled because that means it is better that we don&apos;t do it and we leave everybody free. That can be defended as well, but if they bring the rules in they have to be respected.&quot; City retorted by claiming that Wenger was more wide of the mark than a Denilson 30-yard chancer. &quot;The financial ... figures being speculated about are not accurate,&quot; thundered a City statement before insisting that the club couldn&apos;t be more committed to transparency if it stuck a wedding ring on its finger and sired its children: &quot;Manchester City is a proactive member of the European Clubs Association and is working actively and with transparency with regard to financial fair play. In light of these facts, recent comments about the partnership by some observers are unfounded and regrettable.&quot; Not according to Liverpool owner John W Henry, who this morning tweeted: &quot;Mr. Wenger says boldly what everyone thinks&quot;.

We were slightly disappointed with our fifth-place finish, having won the bronze medal in the same competition last year. It was frustrating to come third in our pool, as this meant that we were out of contention for the medals. However, if you analysed our performance in the tournament, we did not actually play that badly. Our fifth place means that we qualify for next year&apos;s Champions Trophy in Argentina, which will provide the crucial preparation leading up to the Olympic Games. As well as this, we only lost one match and that was against the world&apos;s highest-ranked nation in Argentina. That was our opening match of the competition, which meant that we were facing an uphill struggle to finish in the top two of our pool. We drew our next two matches and won our last three, including two victories over Australia. Following the tournament we have risen up the world rankings from fifth to fourth Training schedule We&apos;ve been on the current training regime since 2009 and we&apos;ve all moved down to the Bisham Abbey area so that we can train twice a day, every day.

We&apos;re Awake Tonight manages to condense 35 years of rock and pop into three glorious minutes. T Rex&apos;s iridescent boogie, ELO&apos;s Mr Blue Sky \u2013 it&apos;s all here.

They&apos;ve just released their self-titled debut album and we think it&apos;s great, with really funny lyrics written in an almost scientific poetry. Coraz\u00f3n is one of our favourite songs and it was included in the soundtrack of Plan V, a web sitcom about the lesbian scene of Buenos Aires that we also recommend.

If you&apos;ve not heard his ghostly take on lo-fi R&amp;B then now is the perfect time to get into it because his official debut EP, Darker My Love, and a remix companion are available for free on his label&apos;s Bandcamp page. A good point of comparison would be blog sensation How to Dress Well, although there&apos;s enough uniqueness and authenticity here to keep you hitting repeat (plus I actually heard of Guerre first, so points for that). Highly recommended. BRAZIL      Meio DesligadoCriolo \u2013 Mari\u00f4      Criolo is a rapper who released an acclaimed album this year, N\u00f3 Na Orelha. In this song he pushes African beats above his rhymes and shows why he&apos;s part of a new scene of creative MCs in Brazil, including Emicida, Renegado and RAPadura. CANADA      I(Heart)MusicPatrick Canning and the Suffering Mothers \u2013 The Howl      The first influences listed on Patrick Canning&apos;s MySpace are Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave, so it should come as no surprise that his music is dark and gloomy. Still, as a song like The Howl shows, just like his influences Canning has a way of making even dark and gloomy sound surprisingly engaging.  CHILE      Super 45MKRNI - Humedad      Hailing from completely different backgrounds, ranging from experimental folk music to visual arts, the three members of MKRNI (pronounced &quot;makaroni&quot;) come together to produce a distinctive sound that combines Latin American rhythms and post-punk influences, whose roots can be traced back to bands like ESG. Formed in 2008, the trio released an album through independent label Madhaus Records and are currently touring America, Europe and Brazil. Their latest single, Humedad, is a sample of their forthcoming and long-awaited second album. CHINA      WooozyFan Shiqi \u2013 Dreamland      Fan Shiqi is a talented emerging singer-songwriter. Professionally trained in classical piano and influenced by jazz, Fan exhibits the peaceful urban scene with her refreshing voice and showcases the delicacy and confidence of this modern woman with her smooth lyrics. Her debut album Dreamland, released on the Peaceful Music label, is a collection of jazz-flavoured songs spanning four years. DENMARK      All ScandinavianHighway Child \u2013 Love Love Love (I&apos;m Gonna Take It Out On You)      Fuelled by a combo of Fernet Branca and a profound love for rock as it was cut 40-50 years ago, Highway Child have been personal favourites since I first caught one of their always awesome live performances a few years back. Three albums in, they keep impressing with their ability to make the musical heritage their own instead of just robbing the historical treasure mound. Their 2011 album Highway Child, from which this track is taken, expertly fuses their classic hard rock debut On the Old Kings Road (2008) and 60s psychedelia sophomore effort Sanctuary Come (2009). ESTONIA      PopopLaulan Sinule \u2013 Masina Sees      Laulan Sinule is a tongue-in-cheek project by Taavi Tulev, who here leaves behind his usual deep electronics and makes pure Estonian electropop with analogue synths. For months he managed to stay anonymous with this new project, but is now gigging around Estonia; in concerts his music comes alive even more. FINLAND      GlueAstrid Swan \u2013 Box Elder (Pavement cover)      Astrid Swan was meant to be the princess of Finnish pop but she always seemed to be too stubborn to accept the impositions of the music biz. With her third album, Better Than Wages, she fully embraced the indie sounds with a full roster of straightforward guitar-pop. Astrid has taken another turn in her career and in August will release a Pavement covers album with the attractive title of Hits (Pavement for Girls). FRANCE      Yet You&apos;re FiredHold Your Horses! \u2013 We Dear Are a Desert      Hold Your Horses! come from Paris and, like many others acts from the capital, they&apos;re into acoustic folk-pop. They may already be known to you thanks to an original video in which they reinterpret the history of art. Their first EP, Sorry! Household (an anagram of Hold Your Horses!), released in May, can be bought on iTunes. GERMANY      Blogparteisoft.nerd \u2013 Always the Good Times      soft.nerd really are into analogue synths. In their 80s-driven tracks and remixes it&apos;s the driving force that makes room for the guitar sounds and Christian Bachmann&apos;s catchy vocals to float free in subtropical spheres. After rebuilding as a three-piece, soft.nerd recently released the album Sound Sound Sound, available via Bandcamp, from which Always the Good Times is taken. GREECE      MouxlalouloudaA Victim of Society \u2013 You&apos;re Gonna Hate Me      A Victim of Society delves into the darker side of human nature and delivers eerie, uncannily alluring melodies with raspy vocals buried beneath noise and distortion-drenched filters. His music is a plaintive, lo-fi mixture of nostalgia wrapped up in deeply ingrained noir sensibilities. You&apos;re Gonna Hate Me&apos;s rough and tumble groove, coated in sheets of echo and shadow, will leave you bewildered and enthralled in equal measures. ICELAND      Icelandic Music MaffiaValdimar  - Undraland      Valdimar is a fresh force within the Icelandic music scene. The band&apos;s music spans the whole emotional spectrum, from intimate ballads to powerful, energetic rock. Valdimar colours its music with heavy brass, guitar and keyboard textures. They were nominated in the brightest hope category at the Icelandic Music Awards. Undraland is the title track of their debut album, released at the end of 2010 on the Geimsteinn label. INDONESIA      DeathrockstarBurgerkill - House Of Greed      Burgerkill are one of the biggest and longest running metal bands in Indonesia. They have just released a new album, Venomous, which is heavy as hell. IRELAND      Nialler9Little Green Cars - My Love Took Me Down To The River (To Silence Me)      Having first been impressed by Little Green Cars in 2008, it&apos;s with great pleasure that a mere three years later, the band consisting of 18-year olds have come good on that spark of promise they initially showed. Now a tight, talented and focused unit, their sound falls between Local Natives-style folk and Arcade Fire-style rock. Their debut single The John Wayne is out this month through UK label Young And Lost Club, and this separate new track showcases another impressive side to them. ISRAEL      Metal IsraelHammercult - Stealer Of Souls      Hammercult is an extreme thrash metal band formed in late 2010 by alumni of Israel&apos;s finest metal bands. Following their debut show in December, Hammercult stormed stages all across Israel, smashing into the local scene and garnering a tremendous amount of fans in a minimal amount of time. They also won the right to represent Israel in the 2011 international Wacken Metal Battle competition to be held this August in Germany. Late July will mark the release of their debut EP, Rise Of The Hammer, and their first full-length release is in the works. ITALY      PolaroidGiorgio Tuma - New Fabled Stories      Sometimes, in the middle of the summer, a sweet melody that brings back memories of Brian Wilson, Stereolab and flamboyant Italian soundtracks from the 60s (think Piccioni, Rota, Umiliani) is really all you need. Add a touch of bossa nova and a smoke of jazz and you&apos;ll have In The Morning We&apos;ll Meet, the brilliant new album by Giorgio Tuma, out now on the legendary Spanish label Elefant Records. MEXICO      Red Bull PanameriKaCandy - El Entierro      Coffin kids, you know them. Gloomy faces, an obscure way to dress and a strange glow of life that strains to endure all their gray and decaying surroundings. But wait a minute? Are we describing a slow and pitiful goth band? Maybe this approach to Mexico City&apos;s Candy is erroneous and stereotypical. Candy have all the bittersweetness, frenzy and pomp that a power-goth trio could ask for. Produced by the experienced Joselo Rangel (from Mexican super-band Caf\u00e9 Tacvba), El Entierro (&quot;The Burial&quot;) is the ravenous radio-friendly single that heralds a great sophomore album for Candy. NETHERLANDS      Unfold AmsterdamThe Black Atlantic - Walked On Wood      The Black Atlantic is a folk-pop band based in Groningen, but they undeniably have international ambitions - no wonder given how easily their heavily melodic and lulling acoustic tracks fit in alongside the new Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes albums. The core of the project is singer-songwriter Geert van der Velde, who formed the band back in 2008 to record debut album Reverence For Fallen Trees. It has been freely available online for the past two years, although this spring it was also given a physical release in more European territories with added bonus tracks, one of which you can hear here. The band rarely takes itself off the road long enough to record new material, but a new single then EP are on the way. NEW ZEALAND      Einstein Music JournalSleepy Age - D\u00e9cor      In 2009, Christchurch&apos;s Sleepy Age began their life as a guitar band, reworking the finer points of Britpop and 90s American indie rock. But in 2011, they&apos;ve completely upended their sound, releasing the synth-heavy, European disco-inspired single D\u00e9cor (see video). It&apos;s a bold move, and at a time when they would be excused for making gloomy rock music, Sleepy Age has turned misery into delicious synth-pop. The band is currently escaping a string of crippling earthquakes in their home town and touring Europe and the UK - dates are available on their website. PERU      SoTBJos\u00e9 Arbul\u00fa - Salta      Jos\u00e9 Arbul\u00fa, a member of the well-known band Cementerio Club and considered by many people in his native country to be one of its most talented contemporary composers, returns to the music scene with his new solo production, Salta: Esp\u00edritu Azul, the first of a trilogy of records called SALTA. In this new stage, Arbul\u00fa tries to capture thoughts and feelings about all that happens to us and affects us in our tired routine of life. PORTUGAL      Posso Ouvir Um Disco?You Can&apos;t Win, Charlie Brown - Over The Sun, Under The Water      They are six, most of them from Lisbon, who have/had other projects, such as David Santos (Noiserv), a previous MAP pick. Their debut album, Chromatic, released in May, prompted influential French magazine Les Inrocks to call their music &quot;sublime&quot;. If you are a fan of Fleet Foxes and Animal Collective, you will love You Can&apos;t Win, Charlie Brown too. ROMANIA      Babylon NoiseAlgebra - Moloz      Algebra come from Bucharest and just released their first album - a mix of post-rock, post-punk, noise and influences from several other genres translated into short instrumental tracks. You can find their entire album as a free download on Bandcamp. RUSSIA          Big EchoThe Patience - Space Farewell      Novosibirsk-based trio The Patience have been searching for their proper sound since 2007. They released debut EP Sun Is Always Pt.1 this year, offering a massive wall of sound based on traditions of shoegaze and pop music. Space Farewell mixes the energy of live performance with the lead singer&apos;s beautiful voice to make it one of the best Russian tracks you&apos;ll hear these days. SCOTLAND      The Pop CopThe Barents Sea - O&apos; Brother Of Mine      Every once in a while you come across a band like The Barents Sea who have an indefinable essence that makes your ears prick up. One spin of O&apos; Brother Of Mine will confirm how capable the Perth band are when it comes to constructing punch-the-air, epic guitar riffs... but you&apos;ll probably play it over and over again just to make sure. Feel free to discover how they sounded before they developed into a harmonious blend of indie and post-rock by downloading their charming bedroom-recorded 2009 mini-album Bear Island for free here. SINGAPORE      I&apos;m Waking Up To...In Each Hand A Cutlass - A Universe Made Of Strings      Outlaws, stargazers and free riders - that&apos;s the sense of freedom apparent in the debut album of In Each Hand A Cutlass. The masterpiece is called A Universe Made Of Strings, and while allusions to string theory and parallel dimensions are in order, no-one can deny the sprawling ambition that the group have laboured to achieve. Swirling with different time signatures, musical styles and rapturous energy, In Each Hand A Cutlass prove that genres are for the common man and that genius lies in the outliers. SOUTH KOREA      Indieful ROKSiwaRainbow - We Are All Alone      Siwa is a female singer-songwriter, Rainbow99 is a guitarist and electronica producer. Together they have formed the unit SiwaRainbow, creating a mellow sound where Rainbow99 provides the atmosphere and Siwa adds melody and lyrics. The duo&apos;s second album, We Are All Alone, was released in June. The title track opens with an epic synth-heavy intro that extends into total bliss. SPAIN          MusikornerEdred\u00f3N - Bautismo      Edred\u00f3N is a five-piece formed in the working class district of Carabanchel, Madrid. Their unique sound can be described as a cosmic mixture of psychedelia and several other genres not so easily found in Spanish indie music, such as Kraut, ambient, house or pop noir. Bizarre as it seems, this risky blend is present throughout their self-titled debut album released in 2010. Bautismo, with lyrics in French, is their particular approach to Serge Gainsbourg&apos;s \u00e9l\u00e9gance. SWITZERLAND      78sDead Bunny - I Don&apos;t Know You      Dead Bunny don&apos;t invent the wheel anew, but from time to time that&apos;s bracing news, with hipster bands popping up all over the place. They play sweaty rock &apos;n&apos; roll right from the heart, without frills and straight to the point.  UNITED STATES      I Guess I&apos;m FloatingCSLSX - Keep Shining On      This band, by way of Philadelphia, are plenty young with plenty of talent. CSLSX have released a handful of tracks in the past few months, slowly showcasing their music abilities. Keep Shining On is the best yet, a perfect summer jam with stunning production value. VENEZUELA      M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sVel France - Galaxia      Vel France is one of the newest talents to come out of eastern Venezuela, a region characterized by alternative rock bands, but this time bringing a more melodious voice than has been heard in recent years. Since debuting at a festival called VirgenFest, Vel France has captivated audiences with syrupy lyrics and nice guitar riffs. Galaxia, her first single, contains a lot of that and has been played on radio nationwide.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS      Unfold AmsterdamThe Black Atlantic - Walked On Wood      The Black Atlantic is a folk-pop band based in Groningen, but they undeniably have international ambitions - no wonder given how easily their heavily melodic and lulling acoustic tracks fit in alongside the new Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes albums."], "title": "July's best new music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/18/july-new-music-map", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Electronic music", "Music", "Culture", "Blogging", "Media", "Indie"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-07-19T12:59:00Z", "article": "The first-ever Dada event took place in the Cabaret Voltaire, Zurich, on 5 February 1916. Among the protagonists were the poet Tristan Tzara, born Samuel Rosenstock in Moinesti, Romania (1895), and the artist Marcel Janco, born in Bucharest (1895). Also in contact with the Dada group were Arthur Segal, born in Jassy (1875), who, a few years later, would have a student in Berlin called Maximilian Herman, known as Maxy, born in Braila (1895). A little later, they would all meet Victor Brauner, born in Pietra-Neamt (1903), a major figure in surrealism, and then Jules Perahim, born in Bucharest (1914), one of the second-generation surrealists. All were Romanian Jews, and the catalogue of the From Dada to surrealism exhibition in Amsterdam&apos;s Jewish Historical Museum, opens with an article by Radu Stern, entitled Why so many Jews? The exhibition&apos;s subtitle sheds some light: the artistic Jewish avant-garde in Romania, 1918\u20111938, and the show deals brilliantly with issues that are usually avoided. Between the two world wars, antisemitic discourse linked avant-gardism to Judaism, claiming that those modern trends aimed to destroy the principles of classical beauty and eradicate national traditions. These artists expressed the &quot;nihilistic Jewish spirit&quot; (a common phrase at the time) if they weren&apos;t outright mad. Stern quotes the theoreticians of Romanian artistic nationalism. They include the philosopher Emil Cioran in his early days, also born in Romania. Similar calls for &quot;degenerate&quot; art to be banned were widely published in pre-Nazi and later in Nazi Germany, as well as in France. We&apos;ve known about this for a while, but far less about why Dadaism and these Romanian artists were a favourite target. One of the merits of the Amsterdam exhibition is that it reviews the facts through numerous quotations and photographs. The 100 or so works in the exhibition provide one of the most comprehensive overviews of these artists to date. Paintings from Romanian, Israeli and French museums, as well as from a private collection in Bucharest that survived both war and communism unscathed, reveal new aspects of these artists. We have seen many of Janco&apos;s lively cubist-futurist works from Dada-era Zurich and the grotesque masks he made for the Cabaret Voltaire shows, but we have rarely been treated to what followed: his polychrome reliefs enhanced by collages, part cubist-part-abstract, and his Beckmann-inspired canvases, which deserve equal attention. The same is true for Brauner, but in this case for his early works. His later, surrealists paintings are frequently on show in France, where he spent the second half of his life, but here we have his 1920s compositions, somewhere between C\u00e9zanne and symbolism, which help us to understand the cut-up drawings and fantasies that came later. As for Segal and Maxy, they finally emerge from the shadows. Segal&apos;s 1920 Woman Reading, both cubist and pointillist, is on display here along with works by Maxy, a master of modernist syncretism, who fused cubism, futurism, primitivism and suprematism. Vilified by Romanian critics in the period between the wars, these artist were then subjected to the antisemitism of the post-1938 Romanian regime. Tzara and Brauner hid in the South of France. Segal took refuge in Great Britain and died in an air raid. Maxy went underground and Perahim fled to the Soviet Union. Janco got to Palestine. His first painting, which opens the exhibition, shows two tightrope walkers high above a crowd. It&apos;s hard not to see that as an allegory for those artists in danger.

When she was told that the treatment for her cancer was no longer working, she asked: &quot;What&apos;s plan B then?&quot; Ellen always had a contingency plan and it was part of the reason for her success. She was born in south-east London, one of four children of George Brush, a docker, and his wife, Bridget. Her first job was at a printers in the East End and after a working holiday in Israel she landed a job at Time-Life Books in Mayfair in 1977. Being an American company, it had few hang-ups about class or gender. Ellen was soon promoted to be production editor. At the time London was a pivotal post between the parent company in America and the European translation offices in Hamburg, Amsterdam and Paris. It was Ellen&apos;s job to nag and cajole copy, photographs, designs and completed pages from five offices spanning various time zones and to deliver them all simultaneously to the printers. In 1984, Ellen moved to Redwood Publishing, where she became responsible for two of the company&apos;s most significant customer publications (for Marks &amp; Spencer and Woolworths) and launched BBC Good Food and BBC Holidays. When she left to start her own company in 1994, she was a board director. She and Paul Keers founded Axon Publishing on the basis of combining publishing and editorial skills. It soon paid off, with an award for their Conran magazine, for Terence Conran, and a string of clients including BAA, Cable and Wireless and, as time went on, Marks &amp; Spencer, Hildon, Lloyds pharmacy, Michelin and several educational establishments. For Ellen, the customer absolutely always came first, all queries must be answered quickly, all promises must be kept. On one occasion, a theatre magazine for Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s Really Useful Group almost didn&apos;t make it to the opening night when the printers in Wales rang Ellen to say the press had broken down and was now late. &quot;Google helicopters,&quot; yelled Ellen. Within an hour, a helicopter was on its way to Wales to collect the magazine and bring it back to Battersea heliport, where Ellen and her colleagues were waiting in a fleet of cars. They made it to the theatre just as the celebrities were arriving. Ellen was an active member of the Association of Publishing Agencies and the return of her cancer in May last year did not stop her becoming its chair in July. She is survived by her brother, George, her sister Catherine, and her stepchildren, Tom and Kirsty.

Shares in the budget carrier jumped by 17% to the top of the FTSE 250, up 54p to 367p, as it beat analysts&apos; expectations, thanks to rising demand from business passengers and an rise in add-on fees. Good news has been a rare commodity at easyJet in recent years following the eruption of hostilities over the carrier&apos;s expansion plans between the airline&apos;s board and Haji-Ioannou, its largest investor, whose family has 38% of the shares. EasyJet said third-quarter revenues rose by nearly a quarter to \u00a3935m in the three months to 30 June, with revenues from extras such as bag check-in fees rising by 17% to \u00a311.65 per seat and the amount of business passengers growing by 20%. Overall passenger numbers grew by 17% to 14.4m, although the comparison with last year&apos;s total was flattered by the effect of the Icelandic volcano in April 2010, which grounded more than 100,000 European flights. Analysts at Investec raised their full-year pre-tax profit forecasts from a consensus of \u00a3174m to between \u00a3200m-\u00a3230m. EasyJet said passengers appeared to have accepted new baggage charges that set luggage check-in tariffs according to distance travelled, running from \u00a39 per bag for domestic flights to \u00a314 for long-haul destinations such as Amman in Jordan. &quot;We have seen no impact [on demand],&quot; it said. Rising business bookings, which account for around two out of 10 easyJet travellers, were credited to a rise in daily services between key commercial destinations. &quot;Business passengers want to fly between the primary airports and they want to fly multiple times per day. Much of the capacity we added last winter was building up key city pairs like London to Amsterdam and Paris to Milan,&quot; easyJet said. Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the figures were the best possible response to Haji-Ioannou. He said: &quot;At the heart of the debate with Stelios is the issue of to what extent the company should grow by investing in aircraft and to what extent it should return cash to shareholders. &quot;Stelios is arguing that the company&apos;s historic return on capital has been below target. Showing that the company is climbing to its profitability targets is probably the best possible riposte to the argument that the company should not grow.&quot; EasyJet is targeting a return on capital employed of 12%, the equivalent of 12p for every \u00a31 invested in aircraft, an asset that easyJet is accruing at speed. EasyJet has 203 Airbus jets, set to rise to 220 by 2013.", "sentences": ["Much of the capacity we added last winter was building up key city pairs like London to Amsterdam and Paris to Milan,&quot; easyJet said."], "title": "Buoyant easyJet lands a blow on Stelios", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/22/easyjet-performance-riposte-to-stelios-haji-ioannnou", "tags": ["easyJet", "Airline industry", "Business", "Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-07-22T21:45:04Z", "article": "Just a chronometrically perfect second \u2013 I am still in Switzerland, right? It&apos;s 11am on a Sunday, and everyone&apos;s semi-naked. Since yesterday, the pleasant spring weather has made way for a 10C temperature hike and Caribbean-issue sunshine. And the locals could not be more ready. As I stroll into Z\u00fcrich&apos;s Arboretum Enge park, overlooked by the magisterial historic headquarters of some of the banks that have helped make this little city one of the world&apos;s wealthiest, a 360-degree panorama of prone, lotioned, swimwear-clad flesh wraps around me. I should own up. I&apos;ve never quite &quot;got&quot; Switzerland. Not that I&apos;m unimpressed by its thrilling landscapes, pristine streets, pathologically efficient transport system and the occasional, shockingly enlightened, sociocultural example it sets the world (Dada, strong record on gay rights, eminently sane drug addiction policy, the band Yello \u2026). But, given the recessive hedonism gene that makes me always want to discover a place with its hair down, I&apos;ve always found the land of Heidi a little overly well-behaved, unworldly, closed. And yet, all around me, perky young folk are flirting heroically and cracking open pre-lunch beers, couples cosy up on beach towels, and hamper-toting groups of friends stake out picnic spots. Where the park&apos;s flawless lawn rolls down to the edge of Lake Z\u00fcrich, sunbathers and kids cool off with ducks and swans in the clear, pale-green water, while smart yachts and launches pepper the horizon and the Alps offer up the last of their snow in the distance. For many of Z\u00fcrich&apos;s highly cosmopolitan populace, the way to enjoy such a day is at one of the city&apos;s 18 thriving lidos, so I hand over my 7\u00a0Swiss francs (\u00a35.50) to get into Seebad Enge, favourite of the well-groomed thirtysomething set. And quickly wonder why I bothered. There&apos;s barely a scrap of space to sit, let alone bask, on this modest pontoon on the lake. But I soon realise I&apos;ve missed the point. For the Seebad Enge crowd, their lido is for chatting, showing off their latest beachwear and tattoos, a simple Mediterranean-style brunch from the cafe, and checking each other out. As bathing culture goes, Z\u00fcrich has quite a pedigree \u2013 1837 saw the opening of its first lido, now a gorgeous, art nouveau wooden cloister on stilts over the Limmat, one of the city&apos;s two rivers. Now as then for women only, the Frauenbadi was followed by open-air swimming spots that cater to audiences from sports nuts to wellness aficionados to beach bums to party people looking for chilled-out beats and an afternoon cocktail or two. And still it grows. This morning, I&apos;ve already spent a couple of dreamy hours at the brand-new Thermalbad &amp; Spa (thermalbad-zuerich.ch), a sleek public oasis incorporating the 100-year-old stone arches of a stunningly converted former brewery, and fed by one of Z\u00fcrich&apos;s two hot springs. The journey it recommends through a series of pools, hot rooms and showers is relaxing, the Turkish bath-style hydro-massage invigorating, but it is the glorious rooftop infinity pool with its wraparound views of the city&apos;s whimsical spires and chichi hillside suburbs that makes the biggest impression. (The B2 boutique hotel will complement the spa from next spring.)     Barfussbar    By night, many of Z\u00fcrich&apos;s lidos take on new life, and together add up to the most distinctive and charming feature of the city&apos;s expansive and sophisticated after-dark offering. Come 8pm, the Frauenbadi reopens as the Barfussbar (barefoot bar), open to men and women, and hosts live music, dance nights and literature readings. At Oberer Letten, the Pier West bar takes over, entertaining a twentysomething crowd with relaxed dance music and dining from the neighbouring restaurant, Primitivo, while downriver Unterer Letten screens films for two weeks each summer. Then there&apos;s Rimini Bar, night-time alias of Flussbad Schanzengraben, the city&apos;s men-only lido, where I start my night out. Cocooned from the busy streets by ivy-trailed ancient city fortifications and tall trees whose shade turns the water a deep turquoise, it is given a nightly makeover with fairy lights, rugs and floor cushions, and is a seductive and convivial place to sip and snack away an evening. But I&apos;ve come to explore the city&apos;s new frontier, its wild west, and as Rimini Bar starts to hit its Saturday-night stride, I set off for the suburb of Langstrasse. Sent into spiralling decline by the death of local industry in the 1980s, and still very evidently the centre of a red-light industry that&apos;s bigger than either Hamburg&apos;s or Amsterdam&apos;s, this residential district built by and for migrant workers in the late 19th century is now home to some 140 nationalities. Right now it&apos;s cresting a wave of gentrification that makes it the liveliest and most eclectic neighbourhood in town. Langstrasse&apos;s slightly shabby but pleasant streets throng with restaurants serving cuisine from all over the world and bars that range from traditional to fashion-forward (arthouse cinemas Xenix and Riffraff both have buzzing bars), all charging significantly less toe-curling prices than in the city centre. Its hipster hub is Josefstrasse and the neighbouring streets \u2013 where pedestrianised blocks become informal piazzas by night \u2013 are lined with cool, quirky bars and stylish but unpretentious eateries. Alfresco dining and drinking, sometimes with live music, take over the area, subsiding after midnight when people head home or to a club, of which Z\u00fcrich boasts the largest number per capita in Europe. Beyond Langstrasse lies Z\u00fcrich West, a former industrial zone that&apos;s in the process of a bold transformation. In Z\u00fcrich&apos;s boom industrial years in the first half of the 20th century, turbine manufacturer Escher Wyss owned this 17-hectare plot, and so daunting is the scale of its broad thoroughfares, colossal railway bridges and monumental factory shells that only in the last few years has the city been ready to mount a concerted effort to reclaim, reinvent and integrate the area.     Rimini Bar    While the plan is for boho-luxe loft-style living and versatile creative workspaces to gradually build new residential and professional communities here, for the visitor the main draws are the site&apos;s imposing topography and the imaginative uses being made of its unique features. The Schiffbauhalle, a vast ship-building hall, has been handsomely converted into a theatre, jazz club and the highly regarded LaSalle restaurant. The Viadukt project has brought together 60 independent, design-skewed retailers in repurposed railway arches, while a nearby column of well-worn shipping containers is the flagship store of Freitag, a local brand which makes achingly hip bags and accessories from recycled industrial materials. Meanwhile, the move to Z\u00fcrich West of Eva Presenhuber&apos;s cutting-edge contemporary art gallery is seen by the art world as a significant seal of approval. But atmosphere? While the area positively reeks of exciting potential and there&apos;s no shortage of smart bistros and bars to visit of an evening, for now chances are you&apos;ll have the place pretty much to yourself. Lured by the sounds of an open-air indie-rock gig, I keep on walking, crossing the Limmat to Wipkinger Park, and decide to wind up my night at a free mini-festival where a couple of thousand people are dancing by the stage or sitting by the river, sipping caipirinhas from the pop-up bar and smoking unusually fragrant cigarettes. Wandering back towards town at 1am, I discover another niche community for whom Z\u00fcrich West is already very much up and running. Studiedly discreet, the entrances to this year&apos;s fiercest up-all-night clubs for devotees of Z\u00fcrich&apos;s beloved minimal techno \u2013 Cabaret, Zukunft and Hive \u2013 are starting to harbour queues of excited party kids resplendent in weekend finery. And although I&apos;m quite old enough to know better, my night out is back on. Heidi-nism \u2013 it&apos;s catching. \u2022 Swiss (0845 601 0956, swiss.com) has returns from Heathrow to Z\u00fcrich from \u00a3115, Manchester from \u00a3138 and Edinburgh from \u00a3168. Hotel Greulich (+41 43 243 4243, greulich.ch), has doubles from 306 Swiss francs (\u00a3240) room only, and the Helvetia (+41 44 297 9998, hotel-helvetia.ch) has doubles from \u00a3170 room only.

Every October, as the approach of winter turns our thoughts to the frozen north, the phones vibrate with calls from Swedish newspapers, anxious to get the foreign perspective on likely Nobel laureates. High summer brings the thrill of the Booker longlist, when books editors across the English-speaking world brace themselves to discover which unknown novels by unreviewed writers will suddenly require an expert opinion. So with 24 hours to go, it&apos;s time to stick our collective neck out and say who&apos;s going to be on the Booker dozen. After all, what is there to lose? We&apos;ve been wrong before.

As the athletes rounded the first bend in the 400m event at Lignano in Italy earlier this month, he was last. But down the back straight his powerful arms began to pump, his legs appeared to slice through the air and he maintained his speed through the final bend. Now he was leading the race and bombing down the finishing straight. He crossed the line and sneaked a look at the clock \u2013 45.04 seconds, eventually rounded up to 45.07 \u2013 before bear-hugging one of the other runners and falling to the track laughing. Pistorius, 24, who is South African, had not broken the world record \u2013 he was almost two seconds off Michael Johnson&apos;s 1999 mark \u2013 but he achieved something almost as significant on that balmy evening of 19 July. He had passed the qualifying standard that will allow him, if selected by his country, to race alongside the best able-bodied athletes at next month&apos;s world championships and at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. And he didn&apos;t just scrape through. If he had run that time in the 400m final in Beijing in 2008, he would have finished fifth; he would have done even better at the 2009 world championships, placing fourth.It had been coming, but no one expected it so soon. In January 2008, the International Association of Athletics Federations deemed that Pistorius \u2013 who was born without either fibula, the bone that runs from behind the knee to the ankle, and whose legs were amputated mid-calf when he was 11 months old \u2013 was ineligible to compete in its events, notably the Olympics. The concern was that his carbon-fibre prosthetics gave him a competitive advantage: made by the Icelandic company \u00d6ssur, the Flex-Foot Cheetah weighs approximately half of a typical sprinter&apos;s lower leg. Pistorius appealed, more professors and biomechanists were engaged, and in May 2008 the Swiss-based court of arbitration for sport overturned the decision. The &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (alias &quot;the fastest man on no legs&quot;) was free to compete in the Olympics after all. The only problem was that Pistorius was running mid-47 seconds for the 400m, a significant chunk of daylight behind the world&apos;s best. He consoled himself by winning three golds at the Paralympics (100m, 200m and 400m), all in record time. So while Pistorius was rolling around deliriously on a track in Italy, everyone else had a couple of minutes to make up their minds on one of the most intractable ethical conundrums in recent sporting history. The reliably erudite Roger Black, our greatest 400m runner, was one of the first to speak out. No scientific consensus, he pointed out, had been reached on whether the blades provided Pistorius with a benefit and until that was clear we did not have the faintest idea whether he was &quot;an amazing athlete or a very good athlete with an advantage&quot;. Black also placed himself in the spikes of an athlete beaten \u2013 maybe even to a medal \u2013 by Pistorius. Would they think, perhaps even justifiably, that it was unfair? There was concern, too, from the Paralympic community. Pistorius has always contended that he would like to compete at both the Olympics and the Paralympics, but some viewed the actions of the world&apos;s most famous disabled athlete as a defection. Tanni Grey-Thompson, who won 11 gold medals at five Paralympics, had already made her position clear. &quot;I just don&apos;t think it is about whether he has an advantage or disadvantage; he&apos;s just too different,&quot; she said. &quot;I can see why he wants to go to the Olympics, for the competition, fame and the money, but I&apos;d like to see him get that at the Paralympics and I think London will be able to deliver that.&quot; I put Black&apos;s concern to Great Britain&apos;s current king of the quarter-mile, Martyn Rooney, who finished sixth in the 400m final in Beijing. How would he feel if he were beaten by Pistorius in London? &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be too bothered,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;d be a lot angrier if, say, someone who had failed a drugs test beat me. Oscar has not gone out of his way to cheat. This is his situation: he needs to run with those blades. He can modify things in ways that we can&apos;t, but there&apos;s things we can do that he can&apos;t, so it balances out quite well. The athletes who complain are the ones who aren&apos;t running fast enough.&quot; Ade Adepitan, who competed in wheelchair basketball and now presents Channel 4&apos;s That Paralympic Show, has more conflicted views, but feels that Pistorius could be a radical role model for disabled athletes. &quot;If he gets into the final it&apos;s going to send shock waves round the world, and if he wins a medal, wow,&quot; he says, with a mischievous laugh. &quot;Picture a double-leg amputee on the podium at the Olympics. What doors would it open up? What implications does it have? None of us will know until it happens, but that&apos;s the great thing about what Oscar is doing: he&apos;s asking questions.&quot; What everyone does agree on is that you would be hard pushed to find a nicer guy or better ambassador for his sport. Pistorius is known for telling children that his legs were bitten off by a big shark, or that they fell off because he didn&apos;t eat his greens \u2013 depending on whether their parents are around \u2013 and he believes it is his responsibility to educate people positively about disability. He is heavily involved in the Mineseeker Foundation, which supplies prosthetic limbs to the victims of landmines in Mozambique. Pistorius was born in 1986 in Johannesburg to Sheila and Henke, who works in dolomite mining. After the amputation, Oscar was given a set of fibreglass legs and within six months he was taking his first faltering steps. He was a natural sportsman, playing rugby, tennis and water polo to a high level, but life away from games was less happy. His parents split when he was six and, when he was 15, his mother, to whom he was particularly close, died. He only started running in 2004, aged 17, but within a few months, using a set of prosthetics from \u00d6ssur, he was narrowly defeated in the 100m and won the 200m at the Athens Paralympics. His progress has never been exactly straightforward though. There remains considerable scientific doubt over whether his crescent-shaped legs give him an unfair advantage; one report, in the Journal of Applied Physiology in 2009, claimed that the Cheetahs might provide him with as much as a 10-second boost over 400m. The legs have also caused him to be detained and handcuffed at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam in 2008, when police suspected him of being a terrorist. Worst of all, he was involved in a boat accident on the Vaal river in South Africa in 2009 that left him with a broken jaw, crushed cheekbone and 170 stitches patching his face together. It was this last incident, however, that may be responsible for Pistorius&apos;s recent dramatic upturn in form. Having been convinced he was going to die, he now decided to lose weight, spend less time on his Yamaha superbike and not be &quot;that crazy kid I was when I was growing up&quot; (though he has kept the pair of pet white tigers named after underworld gods). He focused more than ever on his preparation. &quot;I train harder than other guys, eat better, sleep better and wake up thinking about athletics,&quot; he has said. &quot;That&apos;s probably why I&apos;m a bit of an exception.&quot; Rooney, who has raced and beaten Pistorius twice, most recently this month, agrees that there has been a dramatic change. &quot;I was taking the mick out of him the other day. A picture came up on his computer from Beijing and I said, &apos;You were a fat git back then&apos;,&quot; Rooney says. &quot;He was a big lad, he didn&apos;t look like an athlete and that&apos;s when people got annoyed with the blades because they just saw this fat guy who was running fast. But now he&apos;s lean, he&apos;s built like an athlete. He&apos;s come a long way and he&apos;s coming to his peak.&quot; Last week a billboard went up in Times Square, New York. It is for a new fragrance called A*Men from Thierry Mugler and shows a kind of Robo-Pistorius, his blades cast in chrome, looking like a superhero running to answer an emergency call \u2013 obviously someone needs a quick slap of aftershave, fast. The tagline reads: &quot;A modern hero, an exceptional athlete.&quot; It is hard to argue with either of those statements. Whatever you think about the ethics of Pistorius racing against able-bodied athletes, it sends out a stunning message of hope for people with disabilities. &quot;If you asked any sporting expert 15 years ago if Paralympians would be competing against Olympians, they would have laughed you out of the room,&quot; says Adepitan. &quot;Oscar is inspiring amputees all over the world to say: &apos;Look, you can compete on an even level with anyone if you work hard enough.&apos; And, for any sports fan, it&apos;s something you would want to see.&quot;", "sentences": ["The legs have also caused him to be detained and handcuffed at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam in 2008, when police suspected him of being a terrorist."], "title": "Is it fair for 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius to run in London Olympics?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/31/oscar-pistorius-should-he-compete", "tags": ["Oscar Pistorius", "Olympics 2012: athletics", "UK news", "Olympic Games 2012", "Athletics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-03T08:52:53Z", "article": "Three times since 1975, I have been left unconscious while cycling in London&apos;s streets, twice with broken ribs. The first time I was hit, in 1975, it was by an Indonesian man, his first day driving on British roads, and the third time, in 2006, it was by a Mongolian woman, her second day. Truly, London is a global city. And, while you may consider me mad, the 9 mile cycle to our office near the British Museum remains one of the highlights of my working week. All of which may have blinded me to top the obvious. Having grown up in the era of Amsterdam&apos;s White Bicycle Plan, an iconic experiment of the 1960s in which most of the bikes were promptly stolen or dumped in the city&apos;s canals, I had assumed that anything of the sort would be impossible in London. Another consideration, particularly given my own chequered career of accidents, was the sheer casualty rate on London streets. My third serious accident happened while I was in a cycle lane, a woman hit me at 30mph while turned almost fully around to catch her daughter who had escaped from her harness in the back seat. I passed the site of one cycle fatality near Hammersmith Bridge a few weeks ago, as the ambulance left, its siren silent, and saw another cyclist flung into the air by a sports car in Kensington a week later. For me, the Ghost Bikes that have periodically dotted the city \u2013 one just around the corner from our office \u2013 has been an inspired effort to call attention to the war going on in the streets. That initiative started out in St Louis, Missouri, in 2003, and has since spread to locations around the world. But now we have reinforcements, though sometimes I feel like a WWI veteran watching teenagers filing into the trenches. These days, my ride to and from work is slightly more complicated than it once might have been: the reason, the human waves mounted, often precariously, on Boris Bikes. The leg through Hyde Park can be particularly hazardous, with growing numbers trying out bikes for what looks like the first time. But, overall, the waves of cyclists have had a civilizing effect on London traffic. The more people that ride, the great the awareness of cyclists, and hence we each become safer. All this came to mind last Saturday, 30 July, when the scheme celebrated its first birthday. The occasion was marked by the news that Barclays would invest an additional \u00a325 million in sponsorship, despite the efforts of subvertisers to subvert the scheme. This will enable the bikes to colonise new territory, to east and west. It will be fun to watch the spread in the various visualisations, including this and, brilliantly, this. Having thought anything of this sort would be virtually impossible, I have been totally won around. Well done, Barclays, for sponsoring the scheme, even if some people say you got undue reputational bang for your buck \u2013 particularly when many people think bankers should be publicly displayed in the stocks. When I first began my career I spent the first few years working, among other things, on ways of improving the pedestrian&apos;s environment. And there is no question that this field is becoming more innovative. Witness, for example, the new format of the pedestrian crossings at Oxford Circus, it&apos;s genius (inspired by Tokyo). And there is sustainable business to be done in the midst of all this. It is hard not to love the British brands of cycle, among them Dawes (who date back to 1906 and made my aptly-named Mean Streets machine that has seen me through 21 years and survived two major crashes) and Brompton (which began full production in 1988). But there are more sophisticated areas of work and investment, too. I was fascinated to discover from the 2009 Guardian blog that a team from Atkins, the engineering and design group which managed the Oxford Circus project, &quot;used software of the type which created vast battle scenes in the Lord of the Rings films to create 3D animations showing how the throngs might interact. This appeared to prove that an X-shaped junction allowed the crowds, which can peak at around 40,000 people an hour, to cross far more efficiently.&quot; After decades of watching cities around the world becoming increasingly subservient to the needs of vehicles, I am feeling a bit more optimistic that we can turn the corner \u2013 and reclaim our cities for slower, more civilized forms of transport. I am particularly looking forward to seeing the back of those deadly articulated bendy-buses, to welcoming hydrogen-powered versions of the old Routemaster bus, to seeing the Boris Bike and electric car recharging network extending to the outer reaches of the city. But I sometimes wonder if I&apos;ll live to see it.

But in a top-floor workshop flooded with late-July sunshine, a team of eight women are hard at work cutting, pressing and stitching the last of the male performers&apos; costumes for the final production and forthcoming autumn tour. Perched on a high chair over her workbench, Phoebe Allies removes a pin from her mouth and says: &quot;I&apos;ve always been fascinated by men&apos;s tailoring. I love Mad Men \u2013 I just stare at the suits. I am particularly obsessed with men&apos;s suits.&quot; Making menswear, and tailoring in particular, is her speciality. Today she is hand-stitching a pair of knee-length shorts in a dark grey woollen fabric for Glyndebourne&apos;s revival of The Turn of The Screw which opens on 11 August. The dramatic new staging by Jonathan Kent has been updated to the 1950s \u2013 the decade when Benjamin Britten wrote the opera based on Henry James&apos;s ghost story. The shorts are part of a 1950s-style suit which will be worn by the boy character Miles, played by 12-year-old Thomas Parfitt. It may be a far cry from the traditional image of men&apos;s operatic costumes \u2013 18th-century-style frock coats, flounces, breeches and buckled shoes. But this is cutting edge Glyndebourne, where the 175-odd technical staff \u2013 including those in its costume department \u2013 continually face new challenges. In the tailoring workroom, modern technology in the form of industrial sewing machines, button-holers and steam irons sit alongside needles and cotton \u2013 tools of the trade of the traditional tailoring skills which are still done here by hand. A dummy swathed in layers of padding gives a hint of the more generous girths of the male &quot;principals&quot; \u2013 the cast&apos;s main singers. The workroom is not large and it is a hive of well-organised activity. Bunches of brown paper patterns are strung from the ceiling, and bales of fabric, in a rainbow of colours and textures, stack up alongside drawers neatly labelled &quot;Macbeth buckles (gold)&quot;, &quot;snap fasteners&quot; and &quot;trouser hooks&quot;. There is also a clear pecking order. Most, like Allies, are employed on a seasonal basis. The most senior \u2013 and on the permanent staff \u2013 are the cutters (although they actually do much more than that) while she is one of six &quot;second assistants&quot;. The staff here are makers only, working to the designers&apos; blueprints. They will typically create two or three principals&apos; outfits each \u2013 all made to measure in the best fabrics and to more elaborate designs and involving series of fittings \u2013 while the arguably less important costumes worn by the larger groups of singers in the chorus are often &quot;sent out&quot; to be made more quickly in large numbers by freelances. In the workshop, each person makes a costume from beginning to end, in some cases first making a &quot;toile&quot;, or copy, in a lighter and cheaper fabric. Allies started this, her first season at Glyndebourne, in January, and has had her contract extended to October to make costumes for its autumn touring season, Glyndebourne on Tour. As well as being an idyllic location in which to work, it is also a prestigious addition to the 26-year-old&apos;s fast-growing CV and portfolio, giving her some professional and financial stability in a sector suffering from funding cuts. There are fewer opportunities in workrooms since organisations like the English National Opera have scaled down and even closed their workshops. The rest of the time Allies is a freelance costume maker and tailor, juggling her diary with other offers of work which can be hugely varied \u2013 from mainstream fashion commissions to one-off designs for photoshoots. There is also routine bread-and-butter work such as costume and clothing alterations, and often the unexpected. Once, for example, she ended up making a dress and jacket for the singer Lady Gaga while on a project for a designer who was working with fashion designer Thierry Mugler. &quot;I turned up and thought I was going to be working on a new collection for London Fashion Week. But I was handed a pencil drawing of a very stylised dress and jacket with exaggerated rectangular sleeves. I did it in just three days, making it from some lovely stone-washed denim trousers.&quot; It was for the pop star&apos;s Born This Way video, but did not feature in it, although she was snapped wearing it by the paparazzi. It was a hugely satisfying project, Allies beams: &quot;When it was finished, on the stand, it looked exactly like the picture.&quot; She grew up in a hugely creative home and admits it was &quot;inevitable&quot; that she ended up doing something like this. Her father is an architect and her mother was a primary school teacher whose ambitions to study for a degree in art were thwarted. &quot;We had a very creative side to our upbringing and that was something I always enjoyed,&quot; she says. &quot;My mum taught us crafts such as puppet making and my dad made us a little theatre, so my two sisters and I used to put on shows.&quot; The three were brought up in County Clare, Ireland, and after a stint at a Steiner school, were home-educated. Allies chose not to sit GCSEs or A-levels and, instead, built up a portfolio and took art classes. Next was an art (fashion and textiles) foundation course at Portsmouth College of Art. Allies took time off to travel, mulling her options: &quot;At one stage I thought I would become a model animator making models. But I liked history, archaeology and the theatre and when a friend mentioned someone they knew who was making historical costumes from the most beautiful textiles, it seemed perfect for me.&quot; At London&apos;s Central School of Speech and Drama, she enrolled on a three-year BA course in theatre practice focusing on costume construction. During a third-year placement at the National Theatre&apos;s tailoring department, Allies worked on Burnt by the Sun, and Death and the King&apos;s Horseman, and picked up skills she has drawn on ever since. At the end of her course she landed some work at Kingston&apos;s Rose Theatre on Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream, where she made Bottom&apos;s breeches, but after a year was keen to get back into tailoring. She approached the Royal Opera House for some work experience. &quot;I didn&apos;t know anybody there. I was there for two weeks and they were really supportive, teaching me a lot and letting me work on some principals&apos; costumes.&quot; A few months later they asked her back for nine weeks. Her passion for her craft is clear and she is brushing up on her skills all the time. To gain further insight into tailoring, she spent a day at Savile Row suit makers Anderson &amp; Sheppard, noting the differences in practice: &quot;There they would stitch a sleeve in by hand while here at Glyndebourne we would do a lot more by machine.&quot; Workroom jobs are advertised, whereas freelance work tends to be through word of mouth, so it is essential to build up contacts in the business. Freelancing is now the main option for young people entering the profession, she says, and is a test of their other skills on the business, marketing and financial side. As a freelance, she often has to source materials \u2013 &quot;I like to choose samples in [London&apos;s] Berwick Street but will buy more cheaply in Goldhawk Road&quot; \u2013 as well as designing or interpreting other peoples&apos; designs and checking historical references. The scale and pressure of the job cannot be overestimated. This summer Glyndebourne has staged Wagner&apos;s Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg \u2013 the hottest ticket as well as its largest and most ambitious opera production of all time \u2013 which is like putting on two new productions at once featuring a cast of 130 on the stage, including 17 principals. For this production, Allies made costumes for three principals, including the coat for the Nightwatchman. Costumes are intrinsic to the importance of opera \u2013 enhancing its visual drama as well as the enjoyment of the audience, she insists. &quot;They are critical. It&apos;s almost better when you watch something and you don&apos;t really notice them. It is annoying when something is wrong and it jars.&quot; While a forensic knowledge of opera is not essential for the job, a strong and demonstrable interest is an advantage. Allies&apos;s ambitions know no bounds and in her quest for more experience while she is young and flexible she has applied for a job in Amsterdam \u2013 and would also love to work in ballet, dance and even film. But she admits she has &quot;really grown to love opera. I didn&apos;t have a great knowledge of it and before I worked in it I wasn&apos;t sure if I was that interested. But with each new show I appreciate opera more and more. It&apos;s great being part of a team when you are all working towards the same goal.&quot; Curriculum vitae", "sentences": ["Allies&apos;s ambitions know no bounds and in her quest for more experience while she is young and flexible she has applied for a job in Amsterdam \u2013 and would also love to work in ballet, dance and even film."], "title": "A working life: The theatre costume maker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/aug/05/working-life-theatre-costume-maker", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Theatre", "Stage"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-08T08:43:00Z", "article": "A burst of 18 apps for your consideration FBI Child ID Even the FBI are making apps nowadays, although iPhone app FBI Child ID is aimed at US users \u2013\u00a0although it&apos;s available in the UK App Store too.

It&apos;s the brainchild of a pair of cycle couriers in Rotterdam, Sven Prince and Jorrit Spoelstra, who started taking pictures of their city from their bikes and posting them online. About six months ago, they decided that something more ambitious was in order and now plan to visit five cities around the world and talk to people intimately involved with city planning about how urban spaces are changing. &quot;The idea is to have people tell their stories by talking about bikes and their relationship to the cities,&quot; says Spoelstra on the phone from his home city. The pair&apos;s premise, that the view of a city from any sort of bike is unique, isn&apos;t a new one, as Moretti&apos;s film shows. But which cities are they planning to feature, and why? Top of the list is Copenhagen. &quot;It&apos;s the bicycle city of the world,&quot; says Prince. &quot;Amsterdam, by contrast, has had a bicycle culture for a long time. But the interesting thing about Copenhagen is that it&apos;s a very recent phenomenon.&quot; Other cities on their itinerary include New York \u2013 intriguing, they say, because it&apos;s a cycling city in a country that normally has, at best, an ambivalent attitude to bikes \u2013 and they also have their eye on Barcelona &quot;because the climate is nice but for some reason there isn&apos;t much interest in cycling&quot;. Istanbul is on the hit list too but for a different reason. &quot;They&apos;re promoting themselves as a world city but making no effort whatsoever with bikes.

Yet the company fulfil all their much-hyped promise in this gorgeous, gaudy musical that considers the frontier mentality and the lust for expansion that gave birth to America&apos;s rabid capitalism and the &quot;shining city&quot; in the desert that is Las Vegas. It is, of course, the place where Sammy, Dean and Frank sang, where Elvis rocked, and atomic testing rocked the desert, too.

A friendly with Holland is no longer to be staged at Wembley Stadium. To those of a certain age it remains perplexing that nearly all football grounds are so calm and well-ordered now that an accusation of blandness is the main charge to be levelled against them. This is not necessarily because the sport is the preserve of the meek and well-intentioned or an expanded middle class that do not take matches too seriously. The sharper intelligence-gathering of the police had its effect and so, too, did the restriction on alcohol consumption that ensued after the publication of the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. His findings also led to all-seater stadiums at the higher levels of the game. People can succumb to nostalgia for the grime of former days but the sport is better for its modern facilities. Women, generally shorter, make up a higher proportion of the audience than they once did because there is now a better chance that they will see clearly what is taking place on the pitch. There was a time of disgrace when English clubs were banned from European competition for five seasons, with Liverpool serving an additional year following the attack by some of their supporters that led in 1985 to the death of 39 Juventus fans who were crushed in the shabby and dangerous Heysel Stadium. Circumstances have been turned inside out. Had the match with Holland gone ahead, Wembley would most likely have been a place of calm in the midst of London&apos;s turmoil over what has taken place and what may yet happen there. Stephen Kavanagh, deputy assistant commissioner of the Met, has said that plastic bullets could be used by the police for the first time in England. The Football Association can have been only relieved not to be caught up in mayhem and anxiety. Postponing the match with Holland was a minor sacrifice for the ruling body. With cheap tickets on offer, the income might have been less than \u00a32m. Nor has the game vanished from England&apos;s schedule. It is a return fixture that was stipulated in the deal that saw the countries play one another two years ago, when the game in Amsterdam ended in a 2-2 draw. There will be a meeting at Wembley in due course, with the revenue from TV coverage secure. If the FA had a priority on Tuesday, it was to detach itself from any debate about the state of society. The topic is better left to David Cameron and policy-makers at all levels. There was also some astuteness from the FA when it declined to dwell on the potential danger of, say, 70,000 people making their way through north London at a time of uncertainty and, for some, of fear. Attention was directed elsewhere, with reference made to a busload of millionaires heading to Wembley so that they could turn out for the country. Little more needed to be said. One then imagined the agitation of club owners and managers who suddenly visualised their stars, sorely needed for the beginning of the Premier League programme at the weekend \u2013 itself now in doubt \u2013 lingering with the national team for no good reason. If the FA has regrets, it will be because there was no alternative to deferring to the clubs when it would have been valuable to assert the importance of the national team before the domestic season could even begin. But this is not simply a matter of status. Fabio Capello has been deprived of a game that would have carried value for him. There were reasonably fresh talents to be studied, even if Jack Wilshere had withdrawn through injury, and Capello, in addition, is left with a competitive game with which to open the programme. England now look to a Euro 2012 qualifer in Bulgaria next month at a moment when they lead their group solely on goal difference. Friendlies are scorned and often with good cause yet, if anyone sees them as integral, it will be an international manager who must prize the rare days when he can work with the players. Capello would also be doing that before minds are clouded by the Premier League and Champions League.

O2 is a leading communications company which has developed a strong commitment to supporting social enterprises, including sponsorship of Voice11, the UK&apos;s largest social enterprise event. How did you get to where you are now? I&apos;ve always been interested in culture and what stimulates our brain and imagination. I studied art history and worked in cultural institutions for a few years. At MoMA PS1 in New York, I was in charge of corporate partnerships. I found the relationship between culture and brands fascinating so I decided to study marketing management. I started off as an international trend consultant in Paris: the perfect blend of strategic and creative thinking. I subsequently moved to Amsterdam where I was a planner, and London where I worked as a strategist. I joined Telefonica UK [02] two and a half years ago, to head up future and trends insights: an interesting opportunity to challenge mindsets and help stimulate innovation. I am now moving to our head office in Madrid to become Telefonica&apos;s global trends expert. Why is being a socially responsible business important to you and your organisation? Large organisations such as Telefonica have the opportunity to create systemic social change on a macro scale. I believe our company wants to positively impact on the world. The fact that our workplaces are energy efficient, that we are encouraged to reduce our transportation and that we have initiatives such as EcoRating, Proni\u00f1o or Think BIG are crucial for me to feel proud of the company I work for. Because of the nature of my role, I actually get to influence to some degree our vision and from this I get a sense of purpose and achievement. What does your job involve? My job is about developing a future vision for our company based on people&apos;s emerging behaviours and to identify opportunities for our organisation. I map consumer trends (five years ahead) and draw out the implications for all the areas of our business: from HR to financial services, sustainability or mobile technology. I am here to inspire people and help align them behind one common future vision. To achieve this I publish a trend book for Telefonica every year as well as organise talks and workshops across our markets to help our teams innovate with bold products and services. What is the most difficult / rewarding thing in your job? The most difficult thing is to ensure I create and bring out the most relevant trend information to the organisation. Sometimes, I come across really interesting trends that are not useful for Telefonica so I have to park them. Information overload is a real curse so I need to make sure my content is relevant and impactful. The most rewarding thing is the feedback I get from my colleagues. When they come to me and tell me they feel inspired, that I changed the way they look at an issue or that I&apos;ve managed to &quot;spark&quot; an idea for a new innovation. What do you see the social enterprise movement being in five years time? I hope that every business will be a socially responsible one in the future. As part of my role, I spend a lot of time interacting with young people and I find the fact that most of them feel a sense of duty and responsibility towards their community and the environment very inspiring. In many ways, young people are a lot more entrepreneurial, ready to take risks and to challenge the order than previous generations. Technology has made all this possible because it has democratised information and knowledge. Together young people and technology will be the biggest enablers of the social enterprise future. And where do you see yourself at that point? I see myself doing exactly the same thing I do now. I have the chance to work for a company that enables me to fully develop my creativity and my thinking to help inspire a global workforce to innovate in a way that is meaningful for people and has a positive impact on society. Currently I am working on a project in Latin America to help empower women. I hope I can keep being involved with such initiatives, contributing in my own small way to make the world a better place. Ariane van de Ven was interviewed by Stephanie Denamps, a 2011 On Purpose associate who joined O2 in July. During her six-month placement, Stephanie will be looking at how O2 can best support young enterprises and particularly those with a social purpose. Stephanie is currently working on projects including the sponsorship of the Smarta100 competition and a recycling programme for business clients. On Purpose is a leadership programme that helps high-calibre professionals kick-start a career in social enterprise; it combines paid work experience with intensive training and support.

Or rather the men and women were back in town. The &quot;youth orchestra&quot; is no more. All grown up (the average age is now a wizened 24), their first visit to the Proms since 2007&apos;s original, triumphant encounter  was awaited with eager anticipation \u2013 many, including myself, sceptical about whether the concert could possibly live up to the hype that has rampaged constantly around the orchestra and, in rather Messianic terms, its conductor. &quot;Expectations: colossal. Achievement: beyond that&quot;, wrote David Fanning in the Daily Telegraph. My own initial scepticism was also blown swiftly away by this emotional rollercoaster of a performance, delivered with extraordinary skill and a clever ear for the opportunities afforded by the Albert Hall&apos;s challenging acoustic space. &quot;Tosh&quot;, wrote OldFriar, pointing the reader to Geoff Brown&apos;s witty dismembering of the event for the ArtsDesk as being &quot;nearer the truth,&quot; leading an onslaught of nay-saying, which ranged from the graceful understatement of nick9000 (&quot;I don&apos;t think it was a very good performance, actually&quot;) to the more vehemently expressed &quot;total disappointment&quot; of Andrewsaunders, for whom &quot;Mahler&apos;s powerful yet joyful work was made to sound like army manoeuvres squelching through a Venezualan swamp.&quot; Such strongly divergent views are often interesting less for the individual preferences and prejudices expressed, than for the light shed on wider issues. One of these is that the difference between listening in the actual hall and listening to a broadcast is particularly marked when the atmosphere plays a role in orienting an audience&apos;s expectations: no one would trouble about this in a rock concert, but classical listening is governed by different ideas. Another issue here is of course the role of PR hype, which led the aptly named Classical Iconoclast to question whether &quot;good solid musicianship&quot; underpins Dudamel&apos;s flamboyant display: &quot;It feels like tragedy, to hear what media frenzy can do to a musician.&quot; Gidon Kremer, who also thinks that classical music should keep off the stardust, would probably agree. Another is the meaning of the &quot;youth&quot; label, the loss of which for the Times&apos;s Richard Morrison has meant the Bol\u00edvar &quot;story is old hat&quot;. Unconvinced by Dudamel&apos;s pacing and worried by &quot;how average the orchestra sounded&quot;, Morrison argued that &quot;the competition in this repertoire \u2013 from Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam and London \u2013 is in a different league.&quot; Much higher praise was reserved for the younger players of the UK&apos;s own National Youth Orchestra, who got together with Vlad Jurowski and DJ Switch for a performance of Gabriel Prokofiev&apos;s Concerto for Turntables and Orchestra. Worried that the title might entail something rather gimmicky, Erica Jeal found the reality &quot;more rewarding&quot;, arguing that what the material lacked in originality (&quot;the second movement sounds like the Rite of Spring squeezed into a slow hip-hop beat&quot;) it made up for by Prokofiev&apos;s &quot;serious yet just witty enough&quot; handling of it. Commenting on the review, Akka was also pleasantly surprised, disputing the Stravinsky likeness (&quot;Could no one else nowadays have the same idea of a vigorous dance with a strong beat?&quot;) and revealing how much he prefers Gabriel Prokoviev&apos;s music to that of his (still) more famous grandfather. Akka, a regular and knowledgeable contributor to the below-the-line life of the Guardian&apos;s classical reviews, also turned up on Andrew Clements&apos; review of Donald Runnicles&apos;s (mis)handling of Strauss&apos;s Four Last Songs, which the reviewer thought &quot;distinctly unradiant&quot; (and Akka &quot;a car crash&quot;). Clements&apos; main focus, however, was on the earlier premiere of Robin Holloway&apos;s fifth Concerto for Orchestra, praising the &quot;sumptuous and vividly evocative territory&quot; traversed in the work&apos;s passage from &quot;complexity to clarity&quot;, and finding some affinity with Schoenberg&apos;s early works. Elsewhere, on the Where&apos;s Runnicles blog, to whose titular question many tweeted the answer &quot;he&apos;s here&quot; during the composer&apos;s two consecutive Proms last week, Finn Pollard was reminded of Shostakovich and found himself unsure whether the piece &quot;completely hung together&quot;. 5:4, meanwhile, who for some reason reneged on his promise to tweet his reviews using the #gdnproms hashtag, thought the piece verged on the unmemorable: &quot;one is caught up with it while it&apos;s happening, but as soon as the last notes die away, nothing remains apart from feelings growing vaguer with each passing second.&quot; There was more than one classical iconoclast in town this week. Nigel Kennedy, always on hand to thumb his nose at the establishment, proceeded to do so at the entire modern tradition of solo Bach playing. That was in the programme note. On stage, his thumbs were more decorously employed in supporting and bowing the 1732 Bergonzi instrument on which he performed the D minor Partita and various other snatches of Bach&apos;s timeless oeuvre for unaccompanied solo violin. While impressed by Kennedy&apos;s feeling for Bach&apos;s &quot;grand harmonic architecture&quot;, the Telegraph&apos;s Ivan Hewett felt that the dance momentum and subtle ornamentation associated with period-influence could have added much to Kennedy&apos;s performance. Erica Jeal was more swayed by the evident power of Kennedy&apos;s interpretation (which &quot;conjured a magical sense of airy stillness in the fastest arpeggios&quot;), as was Richard Morrison, who thought it &quot;superb&quot;, and concluded: &quot;People talk about our dumbed-down culture. But when 5,000 people pay to hear Bach played on a solo violin, there&apos;s hope for western civilisation.&quot; In a festival that survived the destruction of its original home during the blitz, has endured eight visits from Nigel Kennedy, and whose audiences were undeterred by western civilisation&apos;s most recent turmoil, one can assume that hope, and glory, will issue from the Albert Hall for some time yet. Don&apos;t forget you can listen to all the concerts again for up to a week after live broadcast on the BBC iPlayer. * The first week in review* Week two roundup", "sentences": ["Unconvinced by Dudamel&apos;s pacing and worried by &quot;how average the orchestra sounded&quot;, Morrison argued that &quot;the competition in this repertoire \u2013 from Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam and London \u2013 is in a different league.&quot; Much higher praise was reserved for the younger players of the UK&apos;s own National Youth Orchestra, who got together with Vlad Jurowski and DJ Switch for a performance of Gabriel Prokofiev&apos;s Concerto for Turntables and Orchestra."], "title": "The Proms 2011: week three in review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/10/proms-week-three-in-review", "tags": ["Proms 2011", "Gustavo Dudamel", "Proms", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Nigel Kennedy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-11T18:05:00Z", "article": "Twenty pitches is a lot to sit through, but it&apos;s a great way of taking the pulse of some of the most promising ideas trends and talent in the startup community. As ever, a good pitch doesn&apos;t mean a good product, and vice versa. There were presentations today that were slick and funny but failed to succinctly explain the product, while otherwise were softly spoken and modest but quietly impressive at the same time. These three sites, plus 17 others, are buried in intensive mentoring sessions all afternoon. Some, like Croatian Farmeron, were both. The team, most of whom have grown up with families involved in agriculture, have achieved the increasingly hard task of identifying an as-year undisrupted market with massive potential for what I hesitate to call a Web 2.0 interface - light, easy to use and consumer focused service. Farmeron provides an adaptable data management tool for farmers with a delightful, fun interface a world away form dull, agro-industry rivals - of which there are only two. Very impressive. Anything that tries to solve the burden of email is worth watching, and ReplyDone is trying to help by learning how you respond to common emails and intervene to automate those replies. Simple, and brilliant. It&apos;s starting life as a Gmail plug in but there&apos;s potential here, at least until email is usurped by something that was actually designed to handle our communications, rather than something that just ended up doing it. Italian site iubenda is a customisable, embeddable tool for the small print on your website. Great idea, bypassing costly lawyers. For most smaller websites, that will be a real benefit. Photo by c3o on Flickr. Some rights reserved Mini Seedcamp, London \u2022 CityMapper (London, UK) Travel tool. CityMapper combines buses, tubes, bikes, taxis and walking to suggest the best routes through the city. How is it different to otters apps on this space? By focusing on design and usability, claims co-founder Azmat Yusuf, a VC turned entrepreneur. With partner Mattias Linnap, who is studying at Cambridge for a PhD in location tracking, CityMapper claims to have a better routing algorithm than the competition, creating use cases around navigation. There&apos;s potential for building an ad network around movement in cities, using navigation is a platform. Expanding in the US would be boring; CityMapper wants to pursue growing markets in megacities like Istanbul and Jakarta. \u2022 ComodIT (Liege, Belgium) IT management tool. ComodIT co-founder Laurent Eschenauer believes IT should be comoditised, greatly simplifying management of corporate IT systems through a web user interface. &quot;The idea is to formalise, integrate and orchestrate your company&apos;s IT system,&quot; said Eschenauer, who says ComodIT has started direct sales and is targeting mid-sized firms. A software-as-a-service version is due out next year and ComodIT is hoping to stake out a chunk of the $14bn IT management market. \u2022 ContactUsPlus (London, UK) Customer service tool. Ever contacted an e-commerce website but had no response? ContactUsPlus estimates that 27% of consumers have had that experience and 45% have abandoned their shopping carts. In the context of a market that has lost \u00a312.8bn in sales, there&apos;s a big opportunity to help firms provide the customer support to complete those sales. ContactUsPlus provides a toolbar that can be added to the top of site, explained co-founder Adi Ben-Ari, inviting consumers to email, live chat or speak to a customer service rep. Response rates are shown to the customer, along with average response time. &quot;We think this adds a new dynamic, a game dynamic, to sites to make them more responsive,&quot; said Ben-Ari.  \u2022 Crowd (Paris, France) Photo-sharing service. &quot;Crowd is the closest thing to ubiquity until we sort out teleportation,&quot; begins Gabriel Hubert, with no shortage of gusto. Crowd lets users experience and share locations through real-time, geo-tagged photo sharing. There&apos;s potential for geo-targeted ads, and to bring in online newspapers who could offer a live feed from professional photographers at news events. Crowd currently has 80 beta testers. Strapline: The World. Live. Now. \u2022 CubeSocial (Basingstoke, UK) Professional relationship management for social networks. CubeSocial&apos;s pitch is about new ways for professionals to win new businesses, and they think the way to do that is through social media. CubeSocial filters the most relevant content from networks, filters out the noise, &quot;join the right conversations&quot; and form the right relationships. Financial services, lawyers, accountants, consultants - these professionals are the target group. There&apos;s a focus on Twitter and LinkedIn and co-founder Linda Cheung (former Morgan Stanley executive director) and Mark Bower (former lead program manager at Microsoft) think there&apos;s far more potential in social networks than pushing daily deals to Facebook fans. \u2022 EarningsCast (London, UK) Shareable, interactive media tool for earnings calls. Earnings calls are the most valuable interaction between investors and a business, but calls are not very accessible, recordable or personalisable. EarningsCast&apos;s attempt to solve this is a management system that lets investors organise a portfolio of earnings calls with private chartroom, integrated live commentary from social networks, and shareable and embeddable files. Co-founder Madhusudana Ramakrishna said the plan is to make money by running advertising around these calls with a freemium model, and the private beta has engaged 3,000 companies so far. Public beta starts next month. \u2022 EnergyBob (Munich, Germany) Smart heating meter. This is a smart domestic energy control system, adjusting your heating through The EnergyBob server which talks to Google&apos;s Latitude&apos;s API to determine when you&apos;re on your way home, and when the heating needs to come on. The price is \u20ac99 installation and then \u20ac9 per month. There are rivals, but a rich potential market of 300m European homes and partnerships with European telcos and utility firms. \u2022 Farmeron (Osijek, Croatia) Agricultural data management tool. The Croatian team behind Farmeron want to help farmers struggling with boring data management, putting a useable, simple interface on a business management tool. The team come from families with agricultural backgrounds but are trained programmers and have already raised \u20ac12,000 funding. In an industry where there are only two major competitors there&apos;s the opportunity to exploit a huge market worth $3.34bn a year in agriculture and food advertising alone. Farmeron will offer animal and grain management (down to a field that lets users assign names to each animal. Nice) and production planning and performance. The tea is planning to launch the site latter this month. \u2022 Fractal (London, UK) Email design tool. Fractal wants to make it easier to build and distribute email newsletters that work across multiple email clients. Co-founder Abs Farah said it&apos;s a massive problem that isn&apos;t addressed by current solutions, and is providing the service to marketing clients who can package Fractal as one benefit to their clients, as well as direct to designers. Fractal&apos;s beta version launched eight weeks ago and version two is due out in two weeks. Farah quoted LinkedIn Reid Hoffman: &quot;If you&apos;re embarrassed by your first version, you&apos;ve launched too late.&quot; &quot;And we&apos;re terribly embarrassed,&quot; said Farah. Fractal has finally settled for a cost of a $300 base fee, plus $100 per 1,000 API requests and a subscription model for regular users. \u2022 Gnergy (Sofia, Bulgaria) Energy efficiency service. &quot;Our vision is to enable people to make better energy efficiency decisions,&quot; said Gnergy co-founder Martin Gogov. Current solutions demand expensive smart meters or geeky engineering apps. Gnergy, however, asks questions to build a profile of your home and suggests steps for energy efficiency. There&apos;s a gameification element where customers are motivated to create the most efficient home possible. Gnergy is freemium: free for consumers, and paid for industry professionals. \u2022 iubenda (Bologna, Italy) Small print for websites. Any website in the world has a legal obligation to respect privacy, but most companies have the choice of either paying an expensive lawyer or copying and pasting privacy terms from another site that might not be relevant. iubenda offers a customisable, easy to embed tool to frame legal T&amp;Cs for websites, and charges a small subscription fee. &quot;We make lots of money!&quot; co-founder Andrea Giannangelo gleefully exclaims. Six weeks since launch iubenda has already delivered to thousands of sites. And the goal: Conquer the footer of every website in the world. \u2022 Myows (Singapore) Copyright management. Both founders Max Guedy and Chris Human have experienced their deisgn work and photography being reappropriated, but found it expensive and time-consuming to resolve infringement the traditional way. Myows - my original works - lets users store their copyrighted material (photos, artwork, music, videos) in one place, prove ownership of those, organise contracts that prove ownerships, manage rights and pursue infringements. In beta test until now, Myows is already storing 18,000 registered works and has solved 72 infringement cases. \u2022 OpenSignalMaps (London, UK) Real-world maps of mobile signal coverage. Coverage is unpredictable yet vital for mobile users, but coverage maps from operators are useless. OpenSignalMaps is crowd-sourcing coverage information instead - in real time, and for free, explains co-founder Sina Khanifar. OpenSignalMaps&apos;s Android app has had 800,000 downloads, and the site 40,000 site visitors per month so far. But the team of four Oxford physics graduates wants to do more with this data. For B2B, data could be sold back to the networks, who typically outsource this kind of data research. iPhone and Blackberry apps are coming soon. \u2022 ReplyDone (Vienna, Austria) Email efficiency tool. Ben Freundorfer thinks replying to emails is a waste of time, because humans are good at creating new content, and computers are good at finding old text. So ReplyDone intelligently suggests your reply. Starting as a Gmail extension, ReplyDone will learn how you reply to common emails and suggest replies. The long-term vision is more ambitious, and doesn&apos;t represent current email systems at all but is an intelligent, auto-responding email client of the future. Amen to that. \u2022 RolePoint (London, UK) Employee referral platform that uses social networks. HR managers can encourage staff to refer candidates they know, including the 85% of workers who are &apos;passive candidates&apos;- the ones who don&apos;t know they are secretly open to new job offers . Co-founder Chris Le Breton said RolePoint will charge set fees to its target medium-large consultancies depending on organisation size. The target is initially the US. Talent, the strapline goes, knows talent. \u2022 Sntmnt (Amsterdam, Netherlands) Market information service. Dutch startup Sntmnt helps pick stock to invest in by picking through market and online activity around companies and trends. Machine learning and predictive analysis tools are used to give a prediction of the &quot;bullishness&quot; of a particular market, accurate to 61% so far for the next 7 days. The Sntmnt team has been working on this for three months, but co-founder Vincent van Leeuwen says there&apos;s huge potential in a market where many of the rivals are academics who have tried unconvincingly to commercialise research tools. \u2022 StorkUp (Troon, UK) Shopping tool for parents. Shopping for baby products for first-time mums is expensive, time-consuming and expensive. StorkUp lets new mums create shopping lists and recommendations for other new mums, with personalised responses, price comparison and then allows them to buy online. Beyond birth, StorkUp wants to create lists for birthdays, school and beyond. The market is huge, with 4 million babies born in the US every year alone and an average $9,000 spend in the first 12 months. Big parenting sites like Mumsnet and BabyCenter aren&apos;t product focused and price comparison sites aren&apos;t focused on specific communities. \u2022 TransferWise (London, UK) Money transfer service. Taavet Hinrikus was the first employee at Skype, but his latest project is a money transfer solution that avoids expensive currency exchange fees. He said he knows of a North American bank that makes $100m profits per year from currency exchange alone. TransferWise is a P2P currency exchange; users say how much they want to send and to whom, transfer the money to a UK holding account, and TransferWise transfers the equivalent amount - based on market rates - to your friend for a flat fee of \u00a31. Most clients are ex-pats, foreign students - and there&apos;s one guy who uses the service to send his alimony payments. This time next year, TransferWise wants to be enabling \u00a3300m in transfers and will be adding support for US dollars and Swiss francs. \u2022 Travelstormer (London, UK) Travel organisation tool. There&apos;s an ugly truth about organising travel for your friends - it&apos;s a big burden, and they are often ungrateful, say founders Colin Armstrong and George Coltart. Travelstormer wants to make the process much smoother, helping organise the research, discussion, purchase of tickets, itinerary building and departure for travel groups of more than three. It&apos;s a very Facebook-like interface with maps for locations of hotels, voting tools to help decide on options and booking incentives that show deals available for various options. A nice touch is that the organiser gets a small commission if the group decides on the option he or she suggested - gameifying the decision making process. There&apos;s a lot of noise in the travel sector but the biggest competitor is email where most research and decision takes place. \u2022 UntapTV (London, UK) Mobile ad tool for TV. Why isn&apos;t TV more engaging? When we don&apos;t like ads, we find something to do for a few minutes. UntapTV wants to make ads more engaging by giving users incentives to keep watching the TV ads and interact more using their mobile, whether by entreating a competition, playing a game or giving feedback. It&apos;s fast, scalable and brand-specific, says co-founder Tee Vachiramon. Brands can customise the ad experience by using the app, tap social networks and build relationships with consumers. UptapTV has an iPhone app in alpha, is in discussion with various brands over trials and plans to make money through fixed fees or pay per interaction. \u2022 Read: Seedcamp&apos;s Saul Klein on four years of tapping startup trends", "sentences": ["\u2022 Sntmnt (Amsterdam, Netherlands) Market information service."], "title": "Seedcamp: 20 top ideas from Europe's talented dev pool", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/aug/11/startups-seedcamp", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Media", "Digital media", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-12T21:45:00Z", "article": "Steampunks While William Gibson and Bruce Sterling&apos;s The Difference Engine is often credited with coining this small subculture, steampunk stems from science-fiction set in the Jules Verne era.

A Chap will visit Vintage at the South Bank or Goodwood Revival, rather than Glastonbury. Some Chaps like to dance, but only if the band is a full swing orchestra.

As his alter ego, Captain Jack Vincent, Rotherham leads a pirate crew, the Sea Thieves. They make paid appearances at public events, putting on displays of piratical shenanigans, and tour the UK educating people about the golden age of piracy. Rotherham is an actor, but the Sea Thieves, formed in 1998 (and not all of them men), come from all walks of life, and sometimes get together just to &quot;chill out and be pirates&quot;. They find a beach, light a huge fire and brush up on their pirate skills. The Sea Thieves welcome new members, but woe betide anyone whose interest runs no deeper than the Pirates of the Caribbean films: &quot;There&apos;s a lot more to it than wearing eye make-up and beads in your hair,&quot; says Captain Jack.\u2022 The Sea Thieves&apos; next appearance is at the Ipswich Maritime Festival, 20-21 August, maritimeipswich.co.uk; sea-thieves.com/seathieves_mainpage.htmRachel Williams Vintage obsessives My name is Fleur, and I am a vintage addict.

I&apos;ve dressed this way for more than six years now, and have watched as the popularity of all things old-fashioned has surged. Vintage is very trendy now; these days, you can hardly traverse the street without passing retro cupcakeries filled with chintzy china and shops stuffed with anachronistic floral frocks. You can take a vintage vacation in a kitsch caravan (vintagevacations.co.uk), or book a vintage hen party (vintagepatisserie.co.uk), while reproduction clothing companies like Heyday! and Rocket Originals are numerous, and events for vintage enthusiasts abound \u2013 from intimate club nights like Black Cotton to the huge Goodwood Revival. All very well, but those of us who have been dressing this way for years will be glad when popularity wanes and prices come back down.Fleur de Guerre is a vintage style blogger, diaryofavintagegirl.com Dorkbots &quot;People doing strange things with electricity&quot; is the tagline to the international Dorkbot movement. This monthly gathering of artists showcasing electronic work in the broadest sense started 10 years ago in New York and has spread to more than 100 cities worldwide. Alex McLean (yaxu.org), an artist/musician working with live coding and programming, says the only conditions for showing work at Dorkbot are that it involve electricity in some way, and be a little odd. He is part of Dorkbotsheffield (dorkbot.org/dorkbotsheffield), which holds events open to all. There are also Dorkbots in Bristol, Newcastle and Cardiff. MadLab (madlab.org.uk) in Manchester is another such hub, and home to Manchester&apos;s very own Girl Geeks (manchestergirlgeeks.com). The MGG&apos;s tea parties are not to be missed, though if you&apos;re a boy, you will miss out unless you find a girl to go with. Lady geeks meet on Sunday afternoons for tea and cake and a spot of particle physics/mathematical origami. They have events lined up throughout August, September and October, and during the Manchester Science Festival (22-30 October). Dale Berning Ultra runners Everyone has run a marathon these days. To set yourself apart, you need to start running ultras: officially that&apos;s anything over the standard 26.2 miles, but for real kudos, it has to be 31m (50km) and above. Mimi Anderson (marvellousmimi.com) is a veteran ultra runner as well as the female world recordholder for the longest treadmill run (403.81m, since you ask). She says: &quot;I&apos;ve run over mountains, on frozen rivers, sand, canyons and snow. I love the freedom it gives me. Over the past few years Ultra running has grown enormously, and new races are springing up all the time. Whether you are new to the scene or a veteran there is a race out there to suit your abilities. The camaraderie is fantastic \u2013 living in a tent for seven days with strangers, or running with someone you have never met before builds a bond that will never be broken.&quot; Future races include the Glenmore 24 in Scotland, a 24 hour race on 3 September where you do as many laps of a four-mile course as you can in 24 hours. Or Extreme Energy (xnrg.co.uk) arranges ultra runs, such as the Druid Challenge, 84 miles over three days on 11-13 November following the ridgeway from Buckinghamshire (\u00a3135pp incl. food and accommodation). Or might you fancy the Enduroman series? One Enduroman UK event is a 2.4-mile swim, 116-mile cycle then a 26-mile run, but on the Deca Enduroman UK you do one of those every day for 10 days. Or try the gruesome Enduroman 100 \u2013 97 laps of a 1.04-mile course. Rachel Dixon Hipster swingers      Kinky Salon London. Photograph: Ben Hopper    If you thought swinging was just for seedy couples bored after several decades of marriage, think again. Hipsters can reinvent anything, even swinging, it seems. &quot;Kinky Salon London is the arty sexy party run by volunteers for fun, not profit. Imagine a cross between the movie Shortbus and the festival Burning Man and you&apos;ll have the right idea,&quot; says Tobias Slater, who has imported the concept from the US and Amsterdam. Also on the menu is After Pandora (afterpandora.com) a members&apos; club that describes itself as &quot;the thinking pervert&apos;s playground&quot;. These clubs have a different policy from outfits such as Manchester&apos;s Fever (feverparties.com), which is for slim and goodlooking young couples and women under 40 only \u2013 and Killing Kittens (killingkittens.com), whose tagline is &quot;for the sexual elite&quot;. Kinky Salon and After Pandora are for all body types, all sexualities and all degrees of experience. If you do want to swot up on your bedroom skills beforehand though, there&apos;s no better place to do it than at one of luxury London sex shop Coco de Mer&apos;s Salons (Covent Garden and Brompton Cross, coco-de-mer.com). With beginners&apos; classes in spanking,massage and bondage, there&apos;s something for every sexual appetite.Katie Antoniou, editor of Run Riot (run-riot.com) New-wave nudists Naked events specially for under-30s are arranged through a group called YBN (british-naturism.org.uk/youth). &quot;I got into naturism after seeing a documentary about a naturist beach not far from me,&quot; says David, who is 22 and got into it with his girlfriend when they were students, and now works for nakedhub.co.uk. &quot;What attracted me was the feeling of liberation and being able to relax free of clothing.&quot; There are many naturist events in the UK, such as beach days, swims and camping weekends. RD Intellectual clubbers The notion that learning ends when we finish full-time education has never been further from the truth, and an increasing number of young hedonists are turning from music and clubbing towards more cerebral entertainment. At events such as the Wilderness Festival (wildernessfestival.com) in Oxfordshire this weekend, brainy speakers from organisations like Intelligence Squared and The Idler are as much an attraction as the headline music acts. For something more active, London Chessboxing (londonchessboxing.com) adds the excitement of live boxing rounds to the suspense of a game of chess; while Bright Clubs (brightclub.org) in many British cities bill themselves as &quot;the thinking person&apos;s variety night&quot;, inviting comedians, musicians and academics to discuss themes from dark matter to grey matter. There&apos;s even something for the kids from We Colonised The Moon (run-riot.com/think), who are hosting 101 harmless experiments online, such as inventing solutions for anti-gravity and time machines, and auditions for astronauts. The Idler Academy, a &quot;bookseller, coffeehouse and school&quot; (idler.co.uk/academy), promotes freedom through cultivated leisure, with events such as The Way of the Dude with Oliver Benjamin, the &quot;world&apos;s most thorough Big Lebowski fan and founder of the Church of the Latter-Day Dude&quot;; upcoming courses include beginner&apos;s Latin and urban birding. Gavin Pretor-Pinney, author of The Cloudspotter&apos;s Guide and The Wavewatcher&apos;s Companion, is also a co-founder of the Idler, the magazine for the creatively indolent. He will be giving a talk, entitled From Cloudspotting to Wavewatching, at the Royal Meteorological Society in Reading on 28 September (email marcia.spencer@RMetS.org). KA.

He&apos;s billed as &quot;the most ferociously inventive Scottish writer of his generation&quot;, but he&apos;s also a prolific visual artist, and the first event (&quot;A Life in Words and Pictures&quot;) will partly celebrate his marvellous compendium A Life in Pictures. Mind you, I&apos;ll believe it&apos;s really happening when I see him walk in. A few years ago, at the Crossing Border festival in Amsterdam, I presented an all-Scottish extravaganza which I&apos;d built around Gray, but he never arrived \u2013 he&apos;d left his passport in the taxi to Glasgow airport. Then last year, I went to see him at a Word Power gig in Edinburgh where, again, he failed to materialise. I trust that the EIBF staff are armed with lassos and tracker dogs. The other event I&apos;m hoping to see is Fleck, a public recital of Gray&apos;s revamp of the Faust myth. The play will be narrated by Liz Lochhead, with performances from Gray himself, Ian Rankin, Janice Galloway, Will Self, Gerda Stevenson, AL Kennedy, Alan Bissett and half a dozen other stars of the Scottish literary and theatrical scene. As unique opportunities go, it&apos;s comparable to a rock gig featuring Bob Dylan, Madonna, Bj\u00f6rk, Morrissey, the Wainwright family, Bonnie Prince Billy and a bonus bunch of other luminaries, all performing in a tent on a small patch of public lawn. For \u00a315. A reminder, if any were needed, of how little literature matters in the grand commercial scheme of things \u2013 and how much.Alasdair Gray: A Life in Words and Pictures, Saturday 13 August \u2022 Alasdair Gray&apos;s Fleck: Monday 29 August \u2022 Michel Faber: Adapting the Crimson Petal for TV, Wednesday 24 August Colin Thubron on Ali\u00a0Smith There are a few writers whose gifts make you curious about their public persona, and Ali Smith is one of these. Her stories are at once so serious and so playful. They throw off the usual constraints of language to achieve something teasingly individual. Although politically engaged, Smith strikes me as rather private, yet bold, and nicely mischievous. So it will be intriguing to hear her.Ali Smith: Who Is Miles, and Why Has He Locked Himself In?, Sunday 14 August \u2022 Colin Thubron: A Monumental Journey of Self-discovery, Wednesday 24 August Edna O&apos;Brien on Simon Sebag Montefiore At the moment, I am reading Simon Sebag Montefiore&apos;s Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar and I am enthralled by its scope, its detail, its galloping narrative. So I would like to sit with him and talk about Russian literature and Russian history; to be given a historical and imaginative tour of the continent I have only visited in fiction.Simon Sebag Montefiore: A History of Jerusalem Is a History of the World, Monday 15 August \u2022 Edna O&apos;Brien with Andrew O&apos;Hagan: The Doyenne of Irish Fiction, Friday 19 August Joan Bakewell on Sebastian Barry Sebastian Barry continues to mine the rich seam of his Irish background in his latest novel, On Canaan&apos;s Side. This time he sends his family beyond the Atlantic to America, driven there by the troubles that came with the end of the first world war. He favours the stories of old, old ladies, so of course this endears him to me. He catches the wonder and pain of looking back at a full life. But above and beyond the tales of Irish sadness is the musical lilt of his prose. Hearing his voice talking will bring it even closer. Another highly idiosyncratic voice is that of the Ukrainian writer Andrey Kurkov: I still smile when I recall the treat it was to discover Death and the Penguin. His humour is a mix of irony, satire and farce: sometimes it&apos;s hard to tell which is which. So it will be good having him explain.Sebastian Barry: A Heartbreaking Epic that Spans Seven Decades, Tuesday 16 August \u2022 Andrey Kurkov and AD Miller, Friday 26 August \u2022 Joan Bakewell is a guest selector for the festival Sebastian Barry on Michael\u00a0Longley At the back of my mind I am sure I wish I had seen Dickens, Conrad, or Tennyson, reading . . . One hundred years and more on, they are still mighty &quot;draws&quot;, if only in the imagination. A hundred years from now I feel people will envy us for being able to go and see Michael Longley, one of the most perfect poets alive. There is something in his work both ancient and modern. I read him like I might check the sky for stars. In person he embodies his poetry, grave and humorous both, the democratic ambassador of a landscape of wonders and fidelities.Michael Longley: Long-awaited Return from a Poetic Master, Thursday 18 August John Gray on Alberto Manguel In what is by far the best book on the Argentine writer, With Borges, Alberto Manguel writes of his friend: &quot;For Borges, the core of reality lay in books; reading books, writing books, talking about books&quot;. Whether Manguel also thinks of books as &quot;the core of reality&quot; I do not know. But no one conveys as Manguel does the sheer thrill of reading. A connoisseur of fantastic fiction, Manguel has shown how reading can enable us to elude consensual reality, itself always partly fictitious. Books may not be reality, but they give us access to realities other than the one in which we find ourselves confined. Understanding humans as reading animals, Manguel has written that the defining social institution is the library. It is a magnificent affirmation, and not only because libraries are currently under threat. First and foremost, reading gives pleasure to the reader, which is an end in itself. But reading also liberates us from living at a time when nothing is valued for its own sake, only as a means to something else that is consumed \u2013 a fantasy of progress in which value is itself consumed. By the simple act of opening a book and becoming a reader, each of us can become a freer human being. Manguel&apos;s short fable in the &quot;Elsewhere, Far from Here&quot; series of new writings that have been commissioned by the festival shows the freedom and delight that reading can give. From a writer who has come to embody the cause of reading, it is hard to think of a more fitting celebration of the festival.Elsewhere, Far From Here by Alberto Manguel www.edbookfest.co.uk \u2022 John Gray: How Human Ideas Changed the World, Thursday 18 August Tom McCarthy on Robert Coover I remember a long, sultry afternoon in Prague almost 20 years ago when four or five of us were sitting around hungover and I suggested we read each other a Robert Coover story called &quot;A Pedestrian Accident&quot;. Two or so hours later, when we&apos;d finished, the world seemed a different place. It starts: &quot;Paul stepped off the kerb and got hit by a truck.&quot; Can&apos;t get much clearer than that. He lies there for the rest of the story as things go from bad to really bad, then worse. A fat prostitute denounces him as a lousy former lover; a doctor orders the truck driver to reverse back over him; a dog tears a lump of flesh from him; a priest keeping vigil beside him turns out to be a tramp patiently waiting for his clothes. When Paul looks up, the sky&apos;s blue deepens and skyscrapers turn grey, &quot;as though withdrawing information&quot;. With its immobilised protagonist who can&apos;t make himself comprehensible to those around him, Coover&apos;s story is a tribute to, almost a rewrite of, Kafka&apos;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (there&apos;s even a big &quot;K&quot; on the truck&apos;s side). Paul, though, would have changed places with Gregor Samsa at the drop of a hat: where Gregor&apos;s just a beetle (fate of millions of creatures \u2013 can&apos;t be that bad), he&apos;s a squashed one. That, Coover seems to say, is our condition \u2013 stick a happy ending on that. It&apos;s one of the best pieces of short fiction I&apos;ve ever read.Masterclass with Robert Coover: Iconoclastic American Fiction, Friday 19 August \u2022 Robert Coover: The American Master of Myth and Metafiction, Saturday 20 August \u2022 Tom McCarthy: Noise, Signal and Word: How Writing Works, Saturday 13 August Audrey Niffenegger on Simon Garfield I am happy to be talking to three of my favourite writers on stage (Kelly Link, Chris Adrian and Neil Gaiman) but the event I most long to attend (but can&apos;t) is Simon Garfield&apos;s &quot;The Font of All Knowledge&quot;. I am a typophile, and Garfield has written a very amusing book of typographic anecdotes and homages to the designers who subtly shape all the words we read. Type designers have all the attractions of superheroes or particle physicists. They often seem dweebish but they have mastered a skillset that most of us only vaguely comprehend, though we use their handiwork every day. As readers, it behoves us to be aware of typography, and Garfield has written a delightful introduction to the art of type.Simon Garfield: The Font of All Knowledge, Friday 19 August \u2022 Chris Adrian with Audrey Niffenegger &amp; Kelly Link with Audrey Niffenegger, Tuesday 16 August \u2022 Neil Gaiman with Audrey Niffenegger, Wednesday 17 August Geoff Dyer on Alan Hollinghurst I&apos;m looking forward to seeing Alan Hollinghurst. Not just because I&apos;ve never heard him read before. And not simply because his new novel \u2013 like the last one, and the one before last and the one before that \u2013 is great. No, I&apos;ll be going because I know Hollinghurst very slightly and have decided that this is a safe way to see him! In the midst of The Stranger&apos;s Child I felt again the disconcerting sensation that I&apos;d had while reading The Line of Beauty, The Spell and The Folding Star: that the author is someone who notices, senses and understands things about people that they don&apos;t want anyone to see, that they make efforts to conceal, that they might not even be aware of themselves. It&apos;s the opposite of X-ray vision: more like an instinctive and highly cultivated understanding that the smallest gesture, if viewed and articulated with sufficient precision, can convey a truth that is unique to a given individual and, simultaneously, freighted with universal significance. This ability has deepened with each book but in the new one he seems to have historicised it. Was it Thelonious Monk who said that whenever he was on the brink of making some complaint about white folks a white person came along and proved him wrong? Hollinghurst&apos;s writing does something similar when I&apos;m about to make \u2013 or have just made \u2013 some crass generalisation about the state of the English novel. He makes one believe absolutely in the inexhaustible vitality of the form. And he does this so comfortably (so Englishly?), within the established procedures of fiction, that it never occurs to one to use a word like genius.Alan Hollinghurst: An Epic History of Two Families in the 20th Century, Saturday 20 August \u2022 Geoff Dyer: The Art of the Essay, Monday 29 August Julia Donaldson on Nick Sharratt As one of the &quot;guest selectors&quot; for the children&apos;s festival programme, I had the enjoyable challenge of devising five events with different speakers whom I admired. One of the results will be an hour spent quizzing three men who have all illustrated my books. I am dying to find out how they go about it! It may sound odd that I have only a vague idea, but picture-book collaborations often consist of an author in one place writing, untrammelled, and the illustrator elsewhere, equally untrammelled (except maybe by the editor). One of the three illustrators is Nick Sharratt, who is also the book festival&apos;s artist in residence. Nick is a master of design. His bold, cheerful style and use of pattern and strong, clean colours make his pictures especially appealing to younger children. Most of the texts I&apos;ve supplied him with are very simple, basically just vehicles for a humorous creative artist, and I couldn&apos;t have asked for more. For example, in Hippo Has a Hat, a story about animals trying on clothes, one line was just, &quot;&apos;This can&apos;t be right,&apos; says Duck.&quot; Nick was free to choose what Duck was wearing and what had gone wrong, and the resulting picture, with Duck&apos;s head and tail emerging from the two sleeves of a T-shirt, is hilarious. At our Edinburgh event, Nick is going to talk about his line drawings for my book of poems, Crazy Mayonnaisy Mum, so I hope to find out how he imparted characters to cliffs (the Seven Sisters), how he approached another poem full of questions about the universe, and how he managed to illustrate riddles without making the answers too obvious. Nick also illustrates Jacqueline Wilson&apos;s novels and writes his own witty texts (which I&apos;m very jealous of), including Elephant Wellyphant.Drawing Julia with David Roberts, Axel Scheffler and Nick Sharratt, age 8-12, Sunday 21 August \u2022 Julia Donaldson is a guest selector for the festival Michael Holroyd on Karin Altenberg In 2009 I was invited to take part in a Swedish cultural programme at the Edinburgh international book festival (my mother being Swedish). Except for Henning Menkell getting stuck in the hotel lift when he arrived and having to use his mobile to contact friends back in Sweden to help rescue him, the enjoyable series of events went ahead without a hitch. They had been arranged by a tall, blonde Swede called Karin Altenberg. I was not surprised by their success, since several years earlier I had been at a spectacular book launch she organised in Stockholm. But I was surprised this year to see she had left the British Council and Swedish embassy to write her first novel, Island of Wings, now published by Quercus. Karin was awarded a PhD at the University of Reading and published some monographs and academic papers on mediaeval landscape and archaeology \u2013 but this gave me little idea of what her novel would contain. In the first chapter I was appalled to find myself cast back into the summer of 1830 and placed on board a topsy-turvy boat heading for the bleak island of St Kilda in company with a stern, unbending minister of the church. But after a few pages I found the story so compelling, the atmosphere so strange yet authentic, that I never wanted to leave this island where a lost way of life is recreated. This is a remarkable achievement by a writer with a future. She, who arranged so many festivals and conferences for other writers, must now blow the trumpet and beat the drum before her own book. I would like to hear that.Karin Altenberg and Alon Hilu: Belief, Love and Portents of Doom, Monday 22 August \u2022 Michael Holroyd: The Secrets of an Elusive Biographer, Thursday 18 August John Burnside on Per Petterson Nobody handles quiet or unspoken emotion better than Per Petterson, few equal him in their treatment of mixed or confused feelings, especially in family situations. Whether he is writing about one man&apos;s painful divorce or the loss of an entire family in a shipping accident, Petterson&apos;s investigations of human grief are tender, powerful and, paradoxically, uplifting. His best-known book, Out Stealing Horses, won the International Impac award, Richard Ford has called him &quot;a profoundly gifted novelist&quot;, and critics often remark on the beauty of his prose. But for me what stands out are the moments in his narratives when human beings, usually working against terrible odds, fortify one another with unexpected kindnesses, insights or surprised love. In the relationship between Jesper and his sister in To Siberia, for example, or the strangely catalytic acquaintanceship that Arvid, the narrator of In the Wake, forges with his Kurdish neighbour, Naim Hajo, Petterson offers us deeply moving, yet utterly unsentimental portraits of people coming to terms with grief, alienation and confusion. This is not the whole story, however; Petterson is also a humorist, an observer of daily existence who is gifted not only with a subtle wit but with a real fondness for humanity. He is also a master of language, a writer of extraordinary economy and beauty. Among other things, his most recent novel, I Curse the River of Time, shows what riches can be gleaned from a plate of Napoleon cakes and a shared memory of the film Grand Prix; it also confirms Petterson as one of the best writers working today, anywhere in the world.Judith Hermann and Per Petterson: The Literature of Loss, Wednesday 24 August \u2022 John Burnside: Unsettling Poetry and Unforgettable Fiction, Wednesday 17 August Jennifer Egan on Michel Faber I&apos;m curious about Michael Faber, having hugely enjoyed The Crimson Petal and the White when it came out. I&apos;ve found myself thinking about that novel lately, as I&apos;ve edged toward beginning a historical novel of my own (New York, 1940s). Partly what stays with me is the lush authority of Faber&apos;s historical detail; at times it seemed sumptuous almost to the point of camp, and that intrigued me. I also admired the litheness of his approach to writing &quot;historical fiction&quot;. This is something I&apos;ve been thinking about a lot: how to do more than just place readers in the past and pretend it&apos;s the present. Faber&apos;s approach was more sly in Crimson Petal; imagining ourselves in 19th-century London felt like a collusion between narrator and reader to engage in the artifice of suspended disbelief for narrative purposes. I&apos;ve been thinking that I&apos;d like to re-read that novel, to learn from what he did. I&apos;m also interested in Faber&apos;s eclectic biography \u2013 he&apos;s Dutch, lived for years in Australia and now in Scotland \u2013 as well as his oeuvre, which suggests the big, wild range of someone whose curiosity continues to lead him in many strong directions.Michel Faber: Adapting The Crimson Petal for TV, Wednesday 24 August \u2022 Jennifer Egan and Karen Russell: New Classics of American Fiction, Monday 15 August China Mi\u00e9ville on Jackie Kay I once stood near Jackie Kay on a station platform and I chickened out of fanboying and telling her how awesome I thought she was and her book was, so this would be an opportunity to redress that Epic Fail. It&apos;s above all for her novel Trumpet that I want to offer fealty. I found it so intensely moving \u2013 I felt as if I was reading with something sitting on my chest. And there on page 186 is the description of an angry, confused man, relenting enough to nod and wink at the little boy watching him, fascinated, on the tube. He is rewarded with &quot;a smile to die for&quot;. &quot;Doesn&apos;t cost much, Colman thinks. Doesn&apos;t cost much to nod at a little geezer and make his fucking day.&quot; In an era when slanders about the supposed odiousness of human nature are routine, the kindness and love in that observation don&apos;t just make it beautiful; they make it important.Jackie Kay:From Poignant Autobiography to Powerful Poetry, Thursday 25 August \u2022 China Mi\u00e9ville: Brave New Adventures with a Master of Weird Fiction, Sunday 21 August Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn on L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai Readers in the English language will know the work of the great contemporary Hungarian novelist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai through two novels, The Melancholy of Resistance and War &amp; War, both translated by the poet George Szirtes and published by New Directions, the first in 1998, the second in 2006, and from a short book, Animalinside, produced in the Cahiers series by the American University in Paris. It is clear from these translations that Krasznahorkai is a remarkable novelist. For him, the sentence is an act of pure performance \u2013 a tense high-wire act, a piece of grave and ambitious vaudeville performed with energy both comic and ironic. He makes demands on his readers as much as he does on the language he engages with. The Melancholy of Resistance has no paragraph breaks, for example; War &amp; War is written in a set of short single-sentence sections. Readers will also know Krasznahorkai&apos;s work through his collaborations with the film director B\u00e9la Tarr, especially Damnation, S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 and Werckmeister Harmonies. The English translation of the novel S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 will be published in Britain next year. Just as B\u00e9la Tarr allows the camera to wander, meander and then capture, demanding the audience&apos;s very close attention, Krasznahorkai allows the meandering cadence of his prose to mirror the inquiring mind at work, thinking, analysing, noticing, remembering, sensing, contradicting, reflecting. As with Beckett, there is a deep and searing tenderness at the heart of Krasznahorkai&apos;s universe, made all the more true and real by the mixture of sheer comedy and pure gloom that he lets into his pages. Krasznahorkai is concerned with limits, with what can happen if language is pushed further than its own decorous rules might suggest. Or what can happen if consciousness itself is rendered as infinite in its systems and capable of doubling back and feeding on itself before it edges forward again. Or what can happen if knowledge, or action, or memory, or voice, are incapable of being easily tamed by narrative. For this reason, he is, as a storyteller, fascinated by extremes, by the cosmos itself, by the possibility of apocalypse. His work is full of menace, but it would be a mistake to read the menace as either political or coming from nowhere. His imagination feeds on real fear and real violence; he has a way of making fear and violence seem all the more real and present, however, by removing them from a familiar context. He places them in a dark context of his own choosing. In this way, he stands closer to Kafka than to Beckett, but he is close to neither in his interest and delight in verbal pyrotechnics, in allowing the sheer energy of his long, exciting sentences full sway. He is alone among European novelists now in the intensity and originality of his exploration of the dim line that divides nature from culture, destiny from history.L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai with Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn: The Melancholy of Resistance? , Friday 26 August \u2022 Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn: Stories of Lust and Longing, Thursday 25 August Lisa Appignanesi on Hisham Matar Back in 1981, when bookfests had yet to proliferate and writers rarely stepped out to talk\u00a0about their work, I launched a series called &quot;writers in conversation&quot; at London&apos;s Institute of Contemporary Arts. The events proved riveting. The most tentative performers on stage \u2013 I\u00a0think of Angela Carter \u2013 could invent the most exorbitant and exotic of characters. Or, like John Updike, they\u00a0might be as droll and witty as their fictions. There was a mystery here the reading public was eager to probe: what bodies, gestures, voices did these creators of worlds and ideas, inhabit? How did they understand their own books? What did they think of our everyday world? There was risk, too: what if these &quot;stage&quot; writers were abhorrent characters who traduced the books you loved? I could happily attend all the events\u00a0at this year&apos;s bookfest and gorge on writers&apos; spoken words and those occasional revelations. But since I have to choose just one, I&apos;ll go for Hisham Matar, whose novels I adore. He&apos;s a brilliant observer of the inner world, and writes about the intricacies of love in the family like no one else. He&apos;s also Libyan and grew up in Egypt, so the insider&apos;s news he brings of those countries in the throes of change has a particular fascination.

The film is purportedly based on the true story of Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi army captain forced to work as a body double for the eldest son of Saddam Hussein, Uday. But in all the hype surrounding its release, one important point is in danger of being lost: the story depicted in this film almost certainly never happened. On the surface, Latif Yahia&apos;s is a compelling tale. While on active service during the Iran-Iraq war, he was summoned to Baghdad to serve as Uday&apos;s &quot;fidi&quot; (or body double). When he refused, he was tortured and forced to undergo cosmetic surgery, so that he might more closely resemble Saddam&apos;s psychotic son. Miraculously, Yahia escaped Iraq in 1991, eventually settling in Daingean, Co Offaly, where he married an Irish woman and raised a family. In the runup to the 2003 Iraq war, he appeared on most of the major news networks in the US and UK, offering personal insights into life inside the Hussein regime. Later, he campaigned unsuccessfully for Irish citizenship, becoming an outspoken critic of Ireland&apos;s then minister for justice, Michael McDowell. In 2007, he was the subject of a fawning episode of RTE&apos;s Ryan Confidential programme. At the time, I emailed series producer David Blake Knox to ask if programme makers had attempted to independently verify the truth of any of Yahia&apos;s claims. He replied: &quot;Our goal in this interview is to allow our viewers the opportunity to form their own opinions about his credibility.&quot; I took that as a no. The late Gerry Ryan wasn&apos;t alone. Ed Bradley of CBS, David Frost of al-Jazeera and John Simpson of the BBC all interviewed Yahia and all took him at his word. This was remarkable. Because from outset, there were holes in his story so wide they might have been visible from outer space. I am not an investigative reporter. All it took for me to realise that there were question marks over Yahia&apos;s credibility was actually bothering to read his books: The Devil&apos;s Double and The Black Hole. His tales of life as Uday&apos;s body double seemed, to put it mildly, far-fetched. But those were only the beginning. Since fleeing Iraq, he claimed to have taken an Austrian policeman hostage at gunpoint, punched a judge, doused a refugee camp in petrol, enjoyed a love affair with a Saudi Arabian princess (who was later beheaded), become a North Sea ship&apos;s captain and masterminded a diamond smuggling business out of Amsterdam. Each of these claims was as sensational as it was unverifiable. In March 2007, I visited Yahia at his modest two-up, two-down home in Co Offaly. He sat behind an enormous desk, with an Iraqi flag and ceremonial sword behind him. I put it to him that large portions seemed highly implausible to me. He was not offended. Concern for his family&apos;s safety was the justification he used for any amount of illegal, illogical and/or bizarre behaviour. He claimed that a squad of Iranian-backed suicide bombers called al-Naki had infiltrated Ireland and were plotting to kill him. Why then, I asked, did he give so many interviews? Why was there a poster advertising his latest book hanging in the window of his local pub? &quot;Since I came here,&quot; he replied, &quot;I don&apos;t want to hide who I am.&quot; I found his answers evasive and often contradictory. In my article, I wrote that I found it difficult to believe a single word he said. Following publication of that article, I was contacted by an Irish woman named Joanna Cunningham. She first met Yahia in a Dublin nightclub in 1997, when he introduced himself as Khalid al-Kubaisi, an Iraqi air force pilot. It was only after their wedding that she heard about his claim to have worked as Uday&apos;s body double, a claim she says she always found dubious. Cunningham took out a barring order against Yahia in 2000 and still lives in fear of him today. &quot;It has been very hard for me over the years to see newspapers, TV and radio fawning over him,&quot; she told me. &quot;Nobody ever thought to investigate his claims.&quot; More recently, Yahia has been investigated by the British journalist Ed Caesar. In nine months, Caesar failed to uncover a single piece of evidence to support Yahia&apos;s claims to have worked as a body double for Uday. Among many other, he spoke to Haytham Ajmaya, a former member of Uday&apos;s inner circle, and Raad al-Sheikh, a private guard at Saddam&apos;s presidential palace during the period in question. Both men categorically denied that Yahia had ever worked as a body double for Uday, or indeed that Uday had even used body doubles. Caesar&apos;s report was published in the Sunday Times on 23 January. At the very least, it should have raised serious doubts over whether any of the events depicted in The Devil&apos;s Double actually happened. Yet with the film about to open at the box office, Yahia is being rolled out once again for another round of interviews, and the British press are once again lapping up this &quot;true story&quot;. My quarrel here is not with the producers of The Devil&apos;s Double. Their job is to produce an entertaining film that people will enjoy and, by all accounts, they have succeeded. My gripe is with the media, who have a duty to report the truth as best they can, but in this instance have failed abjectly to do so.", "sentences": ["Since fleeing Iraq, he claimed to have taken an Austrian policeman hostage at gunpoint, punched a judge, doused a refugee camp in petrol, enjoyed a love affair with a Saudi Arabian princess (who was later beheaded), become a North Sea ship&apos;s captain and masterminded a diamond smuggling business out of Amsterdam."], "title": "The tangled tale behind The Devil's Double | Eoin Butler", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/aug/13/devils-double-tangled-tale", "tags": ["Film", "Saddam Hussein", "World news", "Culture", "Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-14T19:29:01Z", "article": "Almost every sentence in Interrail Tales (Radio 4, Saturday) teemed with recognition and nostalgia for anyone who has ever been InterRailing.

Yet, all those differences pale in comparison with the challenges that await us on the horizon. These challenges are not just the current policy hot topics \u2013 welfare reform and regional growth, though these are important \u2013 but the fundamental issues that will drive prosperity over the coming decades. Headlines show us these challenges include the potential doubling of global food prices by 2030 and price hikes for fuel and electricity, which will affect transport and household budgets. There is also the increasing recognition that the very structure of the UK economy, heavily reliant on a few core sectors, is fundamentally vulnerable. More than the government policies of the next years, it is those structural issues that will inevitably shape the context in which housing associations operate. So what does this mean for social landlords? It is my view that any housing association which takes its duties seriously should look far beyond its role as a landlord and engage with these long-term risks and trends. For some housing associations this may mean stepping back and thinking about whether their current balance of activity (and indeed their organisational structure and skills profile) is the right one for the new environment.\u00a0 Housing must consider whether new homes should be prioritised above all else, or whether a more balanced investment in communities might be more appropriate. If chief executives are increasingly drawn from development and finance teams, might there now be a need to invest in growing the community development side of the businesses? And would this help to grow leaders capable of delivering social innovation as much as financial engineering and mixed use development? In the wake of the financial crash, banks underwent &quot;stress tests&quot; to how their assets and liabilities would fare under different economic, political and environmental scenarios. If, as a sector, we did something similar to analyse the neighbourhoods in which we operate and the assets we own in them, we would have to reflect hard on our liabilities and risks. First and foremost we should invest in order to grow the resilience of communities. Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen argues that it is the conditions for independent human flourishing that policy in general should focus on. That is a shared task, but housing associations need to play their part. This does take us quite beyond the role of landlord. This is a space in which many housing associations already operate: combating fuel poverty, investing in skills, aspirations and self confidence, focusing on health and wellbeing. But I believe we can go further. Housing associations need to play a role in unleashing residents&apos; creativity, energy and drive, beginning with their strengths, not just their needs. We need to go further because, as delegates as the SoCap social investment conference in Amsterdam revealed, countries such as Britain are now getting less impact investment than the developing world. This is not because their need is greater but because we have no pipeline of civic impact propositions that are suitable for investment. Put simply: only if we actually innovate more will there be investment. Is there less thirst here to make a difference in our most deprived neighbourhoods, less confidence to address the challenges and the solutions? Or do we have an ill-informed idea that making money out of good and deeply valuable propositions is somehow wrong? I don&apos;t know, but if the neighbourhoods where we operate are going to be sustainable and worth living in, we need entrepreneurialism and inventiveness, and the self-confidence to think big. Our role is changing. For a long time perhaps it was not necessary for housing associations to have an economic theory as it was a question of redistributing wealth generated elsewhere, but today our model cannot be left the economists. As housing associations we need a model that activates people, taps into passions and aspirations, and focuses both on the mavericks and those who will take time to find purpose. At Asram we are to build an investment fund to grow the entrepreneurialism of our neighbourhoods for true civic impact, whether economically, socially or environmentally. This fund will focus on building the capabilities, aspirations, financial literacy and entrepreneurial spirit of young people. We aim to work with colleges, social ventures, and others as we build a local neighbourhood seed fund to support ideas. It&apos;s early days, but we feel that this is the right track, as we move from a notion of regeneration that was too often obsessed with physical makeovers to one that unleashes the capabilities of our tenants. This is not about saying that everyone needs to become a business entrepreneur, it is about liberating people&apos;s strengths to enable them to make an impact where they choose. Some would argue that people and communities can only empower themselves, and that seeking to empower others sends out contradictory message; housing associations should stick to what they do best \u2013 being landlords. But our business should be to increase people&apos;s freedom and capabilities so that they can choose whether to be our tenants or not. Unfortunately most of\u00a0our tenants do not have this choice. We need to put our money where our mouth is: invest, take risk and build a new purpose together.

The Brazilian government listed 52 charges against Inditex, Zara&apos;s parent company, after it &quot;rescued&quot; 15 workers from a factory sub-contracted by AHA, the company responsible for 90% of Zara&apos;s Brazilian production. Fourteen of the workers were Bolivians and one was from Peru. One was 14. Inditex said in a statement that it could not be held responsible for &quot;unauthorised outsourcing&quot; but would compensate the workers because AHA had violated Inditex&apos;s code of conduct. Zara has 1,540 stores worldwide, including 64 in the UK. The response has not satisfied the Brazilian authorities. &quot;AHA is a logistical extension of its main client, Zara Brasil,&quot; said the prosecutor, Giuliana Cassiano Orlandi. &quot;The company is responsible for its employees. Its raison d&apos;\u00eatre is making clothes and it follows that it must know who is producing its garments.&quot; Inditex said its 50 suppliers last year produced 7m garments, with only 0.03% made in unlicensed workshops. It was working closely with the ministry of labour to eradicate sweatshop conditions. Renato Bignami, who led the investigation, said the workers \u2013 who lived on the premises \u2013 worked 12-hour shifts in dangerous and unhealthy conditions. One Bolivian told the TV show A Liga that the labour component of a pair of Zara jeans selling at $126 (\u00a376) was $1.14, which was divided between the seven people involved in the process. The workers earned between $156 and $290 a month. The minimum wage in Brazil is $344. The investigation began after unions reported last June that sweatshops in Sao Paulo were producing garments for Zara. &quot;Before then, no accusations had been made against Zara,&quot; said Maria Susiclea Assis of the local garment-makers&apos; union. Bignami said the economic crisis in Spain was driving impoverished migrant workers from places such as Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru back to Brazil, which is in a boom. The high exchange rate for the Brazilian real means that, even at these wages, workers can send money home. &quot;They work 16 or even 18 hours a day,&quot; he said. &quot;It is extremely exhausting work, from Monday to Saturday, sometimes even Sunday depending on demand. I&apos;ve seen workers who have taken home R$150-250 (\u00a357-94) at the end of the month \u2013 after paying off housing debt, food debt, telephone card debt, debt [to people traffickers] for the journey here.&quot; Many have to work for three or four months to pay off the &quot;coyotes&quot; who have smuggled them into the country. &quot;These are classic cases of immigrant sweatshops,&quot; Bignami said, adding that he had no doubt that such labour conditions characterised modern-day slavery. Workers often face &quot;threats, coercion, physical violence. All this to increase productivity,&quot; he added. Ineke Zeldenrust of the Clean Clothes Campaign, in Amsterdam, said such sub-contracting was common in the industry. &quot;It is Zara&apos;s responsibility to know who is making their clothes,&quot; she said. &quot;According to the code of conduct that they have signed up to, they are responsible for everyone involved in the supply chain. It is up to them to do the monitoring.&quot; Zara is a family business founded in 1975 in La Coru\u00f1a, north-west Spain by Amancio Ortega, who has become Spain&apos;s richest man and the seventh richest in the world. According to Forbes magazine, half of production remains in Spain, with 26% per cent in Europe and the remainder spread around the world. In July, 300 Zara employees staged a demonstration in Madrid, complaining that 80% of the mainly female workforce were on temporary contracts.

Of all the intense sensory impressions of M\u00e1rquez&apos;s Love in the Time of Cholera, the one that has always stuck with me is Dr Juvenal Urbino&apos;s insistence on spraying his asparagus-scented urine on his garden. That might be partly because M\u00e1rquez&apos;s South America was (at least half) a world away from from the cathedrals of Florence and canals of Amsterdam where I was spending the summer of my gap year inter-railing between 20 years ago. But the perfect holiday read is not necessarily a worthy tome that will enrich your experience or understanding of the culture you&apos;re visiting. It can be a vivid evocation of a place so different and exotic \u2013 in this case, a fragrant yet slightly dissolute Caribbean island \u2013 that it transports you from the discomfort of a 12-hour train journey to somewhere else entirely. The books my friend and I brought shared our travails along the way \u2013 used to bash in tent pegs, left sodden after a sudden storm, borrowed and swapped. My other standout book of the trip, Carson McCullers&apos;s sparse, sad Member of the Wedding, came back with a hole gouged through its middle. And friends I later saw off on a similar trip with the same battered tome berated me for trying to put a dampener on their holiday mood (due to its content, rather than its condition). A lesson that not everyone will share your idea of a good holiday read. Love in the Time of Cholera was probably one of the first books I read that introduced me to a South American sensibility, having been immersed in a traditional English A-level. That sense of reality slightly altered, not quite magical realism but not life as we know it, despite the faded grandeur and trappings of a post-colonial state. Re-reading it a few years ago, unsurprisingly I struggled to recapture the same sense of wonder, in busy working life, reading snatches in 10-minute tube journeys and trying to keep up with the interweaving narratives from across the generations. But perhaps what my jaded adult mind appreciated more was the wry humour in the narrative voices, a sense of the fun M\u00e1rquez is poking at the pretensions of his characters and their little world.", "sentences": ["That might be partly because M\u00e1rquez&apos;s South America was (at least half) a world away from from the cathedrals of Florence and canals of Amsterdam where I was spending the summer of my gap year inter-railing between 20 years ago."], "title": "Summer readings: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/19/summer-readings-love-time-of-cholera", "tags": ["Summer reading", "Books", "Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez", "Fiction", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-23T13:02:44Z", "article": "What might Paul Klee (1879-1940) and Asger Jorn (1914-1973) have in common? Klee was German, born in Switzerland, and founded the Blaue Reiter movement in 1911 with Kandinsky, Marc and Macke. Jorn was Danish, and founded the Cobra group in 1948 (or CoBrA, being an acronym for Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam), with the Dutch painters Appel, Corneille and Constant and the Belgian poets Dotremont and Noiret. The answer might be that they were both painters and made significant contributions to two of the 20th century&apos;s major avant garde artistic movements. But that&apos;s not it. What Klee and Jorn have in common is a snake goddess. In 1940, Klee drew a black pictogram called The Snake Goddess and her Foe. The snake goddess winds herself voluptuously across the page, while a geometrical hedgehog bristles at her. Given the date, it signalled the death of all beauty and pleasure, since the evil destroying Europe was advancing as fast as the disease that killed Klee a few months later. Klee&apos;s pictograms are personal and historic symbols. In 1947, a year before founding the Cobra group, Jorn published a manifesto in a Copenhagen review, which he illustrated with a reproduction of Klee&apos;s Snake Goddess. He promoted a revival of a radical art form that returned painting, drawing and sculpture to its original state, the one that existed before the history of art and culture \u2013 the art of cave men, or young children. Little wonder that he felt such empathy with the Klee of snake goddesses, prehistoric drawings, and the graffiti of exile or prison. The Paul Klee Centre in Berne has put on a remarkable exhibition (until 4 September), that analyses this in detail and illustrates it with a marvellous selection of works. The focal point lies in the two rooms proving that, from the end of the 1930s, all the future Cobra group artists knew about Klee. They viewed him as an artist whose sense of simplicity, grasp of fantasy and propensity to dream, together with his imagination and natural disrespect, transformed him into a marvellous child, preserved from the affectation of knowledge. Those Danish and Dutch artists were fascinated by Klee. Mir\u00f3 and Picasso might just as easily have been decisive references for them, but they were not, perhaps because they found Klee&apos;s writings more accessible or because they were wary of Parisian surrealism. To prove this, the works in the exhibition fan out in juxtaposed chapters: animals, games, masks and fantastical creatures. The same rule applies to all the artists, and Klee&apos;s works are jumbled up with those by Appel, Constant and Jorn, as well as other, less well-known Cobra members. To achieve this, the Centre has brought together a vast number of works. It is one of the best endowed galleries in the world for Klee, and is able to draw on its resources and knowledge of private and public collections. But considerable effort was also put into to Cobra, and the exhibition may well be one of the best retrospectives ever devoted to the group. Several representative masterpieces are displayed here, first and foremost being Karel Appel&apos;s polychrome relief, Begging Children (1949), the result of a journey across war-ravaged Germany, and Constant&apos;s Scorched Earth, another painting about the tragedy of history. Despite the exhibition&apos;s title, it is not entirely composed of playful and mythical works, comic animals and clowns. They are there. But for both Klee and the Cobra group, simplifying art was not an end in itself. The purpose of straightening lines and bringing colours back to primary brightness, of stark symbols, was to amplify the expressiveness of their art. It is no coincidence that most of the Klee works in the exhibition were composed in the last few years of his life. Extreme economy of means was integral to the political and social satire of the time. Forced to flee Germany in 1933, Klee knew what the Third Reich was about. The devouring creatures, killer birds, idiot men and monsters in his drawings clearly show that he understood what was to come. Ten years later, the Cobra artists had seen it happen. They sought refuge from the present in ideal childhoods, but wanted their art to recover its original purity to express their ideas and fears. And to announce that the snake goddess would never dance in the same way again.

So muted was the reaction to Moody&apos;s message of riskier times ahead that the ratings agency&apos;s cut to AA3 barely registered on world markets. Japan is strangely disconnected from the world financial system given its size, mainly because the Japanese themselves own so much of their own debt (about 95%) and many of the shares in Tokyo-listed corporations. This wraps the country in a soft insulation blanket that in turn absorbs the impact of attacks by foreign investors. What cannot be disguised is the unhealthy state of Japan&apos;s economy. As in much of Europe, welfare demands are growing as sources of income are drying up. Big firms refuse to pay high wages and are moving jobs abroad. Lower profits over the last three years have also cut corporate tax receipts. With a post-tsunami reconstruction plan to pay for and an ageing middle class reluctant to pick up the tab, the government plans to borrow even more cash, despite debt as a proportion of GDP already standing at about 200%. Moody&apos;s singled out the inability of politicians to make decisions as the main reason for the downgrade. Japan will soon elect its sixth leader in five years to replace the unpopular prime minister, Naoto Kan, who is under fire for his handling of the response to the tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. A poll found Kan&apos;s approval ratings slipping to a new low of 15.8% at the weekend. Kan is undoubtedly a novel character in Japanese politics. A product of civic grassroots movements rather than party machines, he came to prominence as health minister during 1996 when he took sides against the government bureaucracy when it denied responsibility for HIV-tainted blood. However, his suspicion of civil servants was his undoing when he tried to bypass them following the tsunami and pull together a rescue operation almost single-handed. Kan&apos;s frustration during 14 months in the top job has only increased as the yen has strengthened, making exports more expensive and tax increases, which he favours, a distant prospect. The end result is that Japan remains one of the biggest losers from the financial crisis with GDP still 5% below its 2007 level. Some Japanese pundits believe the dysfunctional nature of the country&apos;s democracy has reached a new low and the parliament is unlikely to get a grip on government finances until the markets refuse to lend any more money. With ordinary households unlikely to use their savings to buy more debt, foreign investors will play a greater role. Digging for gold  Which brings us neatly to the European debt crisis, which took a new twist yesterday when the Austrians said they wanted a cash deposit from the Greeks before agreeing to further EU loans. To be fair, the Austrian message was a little more nuanced. The argument ran that a deal last week between Athens and Finland that will oblige the Greeks to deposit cash in a Helsinki bank account should be scrapped or Austria be given the same terms. Austria set out its argument a day after the vice-chairman of Angela Merkel&apos;s CDU party argued the Germans should go further and demand Athens stump up gold as an insurance policy against the prospect of a default. Officially, the Netherlands, Germany and other rich eurozone countries oppose the deal, since it would be financed through Greece&apos;s \u20ac109bn bailout. However, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia have indicated behind the scenes that they would like a similar side deal with Athens (without specifying a preference for gold or cash). This manoeuvring shows the burghers of Amsterdam, Ljubljana and Bratislava fear that a second bailout for Greece will fail. No wonder Greek borrowing costs went back to record levels on Wednesday night. Ireland, on the other hand, is quietly growing its way out of trouble. A \u20ac4bn trade surplus in June was its highest on record, and something to make Portugal and Greece salivate. Exports were up 5.6% on 2010. Sales to the US jumped 11.8% to \u20ac9bn. But there can be only one Ireland; not everyone can cut corporation taxes to 12.5% (or less if the company is Google). If they did, Ireland&apos;s attraction would evaporate.", "sentences": ["This manoeuvring shows the burghers of Amsterdam, Ljubljana and Bratislava fear that a second bailout for Greece will fail."], "title": "Japan's politics begin to hurt the economy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/24/viewpoint-japan-european-debt-crisis", "tags": ["Euro", "Global economy", "Eurozone crisis", "Europe", "Japan", "Economics", "Business", "Ireland", "Ireland bailout", "Austria", "Finland", "Greece", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-26T13:09:00Z", "article": "    Name:  David Gates Current location:  Amsterdam In 30 words or less tell us who you work for and what you do: I head up Diageo&apos;s whisky business, which includes brands like Johnnie Walker, Bell&apos;s, J&amp;B, Talisker, Lagavulin and Bushmills.

What are the watershed moments that have given you inspiration this year?  Industry highlight would be the very strong results that we announced in August. To grow a brand as big as Johnnie Walker by 11% was fantastic. Watershed moment: The opening of the new Johnnie Walker home in Shanghai \u2013 our first venture into permanent brand experiences. We like to think of it as Louis Vuitton meets Nike ID. A hugely exciting way to engage with Chinese consumers in a way that we believe will create deep brand loyalty.  How has the role of the brand changed? Is there a fresh approach to the era of two-way conversation or do some of the old rules still apply? To quote the market sellers in South East Asia, I think it&apos;s a case of &quot;same, same but different&quot;. Integrity and honesty for me are all important \u2013 telling your brand truths in ways that are compelling, creative and entertaining. That has always been the case for strong sustainable campaigns, I think. What&apos;s new is the depth and intimacy that you can create with consumers where the relationships can become so much more powerful. How have you found the experience of marketing products in new territories? What would you say is the key to success overseas? Johnnie Walker is sold in over 180 countries around the world and was in over 100 by 1920 \u2013 so I wouldn&apos;t really call them new territories. For example, Johnnie Walker was first shipped to China in 1910. Key to success overseas is about consumer understanding and losing any form of cultural arrogance. I frequently hear and see people judging creative work against UK advertising norms, often dismissing work from elsewhere as less sophisticated \u2013 drives me nuts. Lose better/worse and understand different. The advertising industry has one constant at the moment, that being change. How do you contend with an industry in flux?  Embrace it.

The noise of rain was so loud at lunch that you could hardly hear the Supersymmetry theorists weeping into their curries after the results reported by LHCb this morning.      Sadly my boat had no flag, so I couldn't complete the set. But it did have the Gateway of India, so that's ok.    Actually they weren&apos;t quite doing that, despite the fact that the LHCb talk from this morning by Gerhard Raven from Amsterdam dealt their favourite theory a blow. He reported a beautiful measurement of a specific decay of the Bs meson (a hadron containing a beauty quark and a strange quark). This agreed very well with the Standard Model, which despite the confidence of some theorists does not include supersymmetry. Less precise measurements had been a bit away from the standard model, and the difference could have been supersymmetry. More hopes dashed. SUSY is even more slippery than the Higgs though, and rumours of her death are exaggerated. I already talked about the Higgs search, and fuzzballs. This was a really good conference, with a very good selection of talks and excellent hospitality from our hosts. I&apos;m sitting in the BA lounge in Mumbai now, thanks to a friend who has many more BA airmiles than me. I can&apos;t compete with or reproduce the great summary talk by Michael Peskin of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC), but there&apos;s been a lot to think about here and some of it will probably pop up in future blogs. One thing I will mention is the talk by another friend, and UCL colleague, of mine, Jenny Thomas. She reported on recent and future &quot;long baseline&quot; neutrino experiments. These are experiments which fire beams of neutrinos many kilometres and measure how they change as they go. One thing Jenny reported was that yet another &quot;hint of new physics&quot;, this time from her experiment, MINOS, had gone away. I discussed these hints last year when they were reported in Paris. The measurement was interesting but not very precise, and (as with LHCb) more precision has again vindicated the Standard Model, to the disappointment of many. Jenny made the point that we often start taking such anomalies too seriously too soon. People talk about 90% exclusions, or probabilities. But 10% is not a small number. You will have many 10% chances coming up if you do a lot of science. And as we saw in Mumbai, results are flooding in, from the LHC but also from elsewhere. It&apos;s fine to be interested, excited even, but we have to keep a realistic attitude. For the Higgs search at least we talk about 95% exclusions. But, as Peskin reminded us, &quot;3 sigma&quot;, which is the conventional standard for real evidence, is 99.7% probability. And 5 sigma, conventionally a discovery, is 99.99994%. And there are good reasons for these conventions. Even with those levels of certainty, odd things happen and mistakes get made. I am getting on the plane soon. I wrote a piece about flying a while ago, and the blank spaces between, and afterwards the Royal Geographical Society contacted me about a project they have to fill in those blanks. They don&apos;t have Mumbai to London as a route, but they do have Delhi to London, which overlaps it quite a bit. If, like me, you ever wondered about the mysteries 10,000 metres below, I recommend it. Here&apos;s the Delhi-London link.", "sentences": ["But it did have the Gateway of India, so that's ok.

We were all quite shy girls and not that popular at home, so we thought that abroad we could get tanned and kiss boys. We had loads of planning meetings and I put our travel documents in a folder with &quot;Five Go Mad in Marbella&quot; in bubble writing on the front. Unfortunately, the villa wasn&apos;t actually in Marbella, it was miles outside, up a steep hill. Thanks to my staff discount at Ravel, we&apos;d all bought new plastic sandals. We walked into town once and were crippled. After that, we stayed put and tried to sunbathe, but the place was riddled with flies and the retired British policeman next door kept asking if we were lesbians. For evening entertainment there was one novel that had been left in the villa \u2013 James Clavell&apos;s Shogun. I can still recite passages of it today. Eventually, we decided to have a night out, but because we&apos;d spent all our planning meetings talking about boys, we hadn&apos;t worked out our budget. B y the time we&apos;d taken a taxi into Marbella and eaten chicken and chips, nearly all our money was blown. We went to a bar, shared one Bacardi and Coke and got chatted up by some lads from Preston. The boys said they would walk us home, but they accidentally smashed a patio door, the repair bill for which we were still paying months after we got back. I did snog one of them, though, so overall I considered it a very successful holiday. SHAZIA MIRZA I had a very sheltered upbringing. The most exciting thing we ever did was go on holiday with my parents to Wales, when I was six years old, to stay in a caravan for four days. I had always planned and dreamed that the minute I got any freedom I would go somewhere really exciting, somewhere Judith Chalmers had been. I used to work in an ice-cream parlour as a student and two guys I worked with looked like John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They were hippies, into world peace, had beards and guitars and would go to Amsterdam every few months. They would tell me stories and show me photos of how great it was. I became intrigued and desperate to go. None of my friends was available, so I went by myself, for five days. I didn&apos;t know the city at all, hadn&apos;t a clue where I was going to stay,couldn&apos;t speak Dutch and didn&apos;t know what was legal and what wasn&apos;t. I stayed in a youth hostel which, looking back, was like a prison cell, but at the time I thought it was really exciting, as I&apos;d never shared a bunk bed with a stranger in a red-light area before. I was fascinated by everything I saw. Every night, I walked round the red-light area, staring at the women in the windows. They got to know me and I thought I knew them. So one night I got my camera out and started taking pictures, so I could show my friends back home. All of a sudden, this woman jumped out from her window and ran after me through the red-light area; all of her friends also came running. There were about 20 women in underwear running after me across a canal, shouting and screaming. Then a huge man with gold teeth and a rottweiler came out of nowhere. They all surrounded me and shouted: &quot;Camera!&quot; I handed over the camera and they took the film out and threw it in the water. I was so shaken I went to a coffee shop to have some tea and calm down. I bought a piece of cake to have with my tea, but didn&apos;t realise this was &quot;Space Cake&quot; and had grass in. It tasted nice but I felt really strange, so I decided to go on a boat ride to get some fresh air. On the boat, my head started spinning, and I tried to get off, while the boat was in mid-flow; the driver pulled me back by my Afghan coat to stop me falling in and I was carried to the nearest pavement. Looking back, I can&apos;t believe how brave I was. Brave, fearless, independent or just stupid? I don&apos;t know which. But I&apos;d never do that now. I had a sense of adventure and curiosity which deteriorates with age \u2013 it&apos;s a shame, but also life-saving. ISY SUTTIE It was the summer after my first year at Guildford School of Acting and I went to stay with my Slovenian friend, Majita, and her mum in a place called Nova Gorica for two weeks. One of the worst moments was when we went down to the river and she and her friends just took all their clothes off \u2013 men and women \u2013 and got in. They&apos;d been talking about doing this, but because I hadn&apos;t understood them it came as a shock. I thought: &quot;There is no way I&apos;m doing that.&quot; I went as far as rolling my trousers up. All of my luggage was sent to Vienna instead of to Slovenia, so for the first few days I had to wear this extra-large T-shirt with the Slovenian airline logo on it and some shorts that Majita gave me.At one point I was walking down the road, wearing my big airline T-shirt and shorts, cigarette in hand. Later on, Majita said to me that it had gone all around the town that I was a prostitute, because no women in Nova Gorica smoked on the streets unless they were prostitutes. I said to her: &quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me before I came?&quot; I was really annoyed about it. We had another argument when we were talking about beauty. &quot;Your face\u2026&quot; she said and then she looked at my face for ages. &quot;It&apos;s like your eyes are from one face, your nose from another face and your mouth is from another face.&quot; I got really upset. She felt that English people were too sensitive, because in Slovenia they say what they think. One day, we went to the top of a castle in the village and I got so drunk I started talking to the moon. I lay down on a wall, looking at the moon, and nearly fell off. I could have died. Majita and her friends just wanted to introduce me to their way of life, but I suppose it was really difficult being so drunk and then not being able to be understood by anyone, so I&apos;d end up feeling quite alone. I spent a lot of time daydreaming and I planned out a new image for myself, which involved plaiting lots of thread into my hair. These daydreams were a &quot;special place&quot; I would go to whenever people were talking and I couldn&apos;t really understand anything that was going on. Majita and I are still friends, but it was just that feeling of being stranded at times, when you couldn&apos;t make sense of anything. STEPHEN K AMOS Hoover was doing this amazing deal where if you bought one of its vaccuum cleaners you got two free return tickets to New York. I was one of the many hundreds of thousands of people who went out and bought a Hoover for that reason. I think it cost around \u00a3150 and two return flights to New York were probably about \u00a3500 each back then. It was a PR stunt that really backfired. It nearly bankrupted the company. It was my first time going to New York and I took my younger brother. I was 19 and he was 16. It was everything I could have dreamed New York would have been \u2013 yellow cabs, people coming out of the subway, the big lights of Broadway and the seedy characters hanging around drinking beer out of brown paper bags. It was just like being on a movie set. A very good friend of mine had emigrated to New York from England and was living on 34th Street, just up from the Empire State Building. So we stayed in his flat on the living-room floor. By coincidence, a woman called Delphine Manfield was staying at the same time. She&apos;s the person who first said to me: &quot;Oh my God, you&apos;re really funny! Have you ever thought of doing standup comedy?&quot; She was opening a comedy club in Putney, south-west London, called Big Fish and told me to come. That&apos;s how I got my first standup comedy gig. We did all the touristy things \u2013 shopping for Levi&apos;s, wandering round Macy&apos;s, eating humungous pizzas and visiting Staten Island on the ferry. I was used to travelling on the underground but nothing prepared me for the New York subway. It was a big maze. I remember one day I lost my brother after an argument and panic ensued. But 45 minutes later I found him, to his relief! Chinatown was huge and I inevitably got lost because all the street names were in Chinese. I went into a shop and asked for Coke and got the most disgusted look ever, because they call it soda there. The shopkeeper thought I was after something else. I sampled the clubs, too. It was in the days before the former mayor cleaned it up, so there was a lot of seediness going on. We stayed for 10 days and the trip made me feel like a bona fide grown-up. It was the whole process of making your own decisions, staying out late and not worrying what anyone was going to say.

Then a few days in, my friend Katie, who lives next door, texted to tell us about the view from our windows \u2013 riot vans parking up, police leaping among our local prostitutes who were half dressed but not in the usual way \u2013 they were wearing pyjama bottoms. At the end of our road she saw a swelling group of worshippers protecting their mosque, and rioters trying to mingle among them to avoid arrest. At home, she implied, everything was breaking a bit.

So the feeling that came with seeing my marvellous city wobble from a distance was a little like, I imagine, how it feels to spontaneously lactate at the sound of a crying baby. I found myself gazing in the direction of the airport, picturing the route home. We hunched around our phones, updating, updating, calling out news from our neighbourhood, addicted to the rush from Twitter&apos;s ticker tape. It wasn&apos;t until returning home on a Terravision coach, seeing the police patrolling meaningfully, that I realised that I&apos;d seen nothing \u2013 I&apos;d read about the fires and broken glass, and Turkish shop-owners guarding their high street like sexy Beefeaters (BILFs?), but my experience of the riots was all in words. All in badly spelled Tweeted yells, postcards sent the wrong way \u2013 to a holiday, rather than from. Did this inflate our anxiety? Fuel our excitement? The lack of pictures having the effect of an unseen monster in a horror film. The language, the tropes, the &quot;community&quot;s, the &quot;society&quot;s \u2013 the repetition of phrases acting like sinister drum rolls, reeling you in. Were the echoes heard from our holiday home amplified by the way we heard them? And if so, would we have had the same experience if we&apos;d been in the suburbs, or somewhere similarly un-looted? We came home last week, a plane, that coach. There&apos;s still a smashed car outside my flat, a &quot;police aware&quot; note fluttering on the passenger seat, weighed down with broken glass, but I&apos;m having trouble really understanding what happened. Because I missed it. I had tonsillitis one day when I was 12, and missed the maths lesson where I should have been taught long division. To this day I have no clue. Not one. And I fear the same will happen with the riots \u2013 I&apos;ll never be able to fully comprehend that week because I was absent. It&apos;s a thought that disturbs me. I missed a conversation my friends had with an older girl 17 years ago about &quot;cool jeans&quot;, hence my reliance ever since on a single pair from Gap. These lost moments add up \u2013 I&apos;m only now learning to enjoy coffee, having missed the crucial moment in my youth. I don&apos;t know how to fold shirts. There will always be a gap in my relationship with London, and I don&apos;t like it. I don&apos;t like it at all.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam?"], "title": "London's burning", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/aug/28/london-riots-twitter-eva-wiseman", "tags": ["London", "Travel", "UK riots 2011"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-27T23:07:00Z", "article": "As holidaymakers fold up the sunloungers and head back to Milan and Rome , they are rolling out the red carpet on the Venice Lido and dusting off the gold leaf lion statues that line the processionary route. The Venice film festival not only extends the travel industry&apos;s summer season, it kickstarts the film industry&apos;s awards season frenzy. For some, that first red carpet of the season may stretch from Italy all the way to the Oscars in Los Angeles next February. Three days from now, the Lido will be graced by George Clooney, Madonna, Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet and Monica Bellucci. Such glamour is, of course, just the shiny surface \u2013 also attending will be some of the biggest directing talents in film: Roman Polanski, David Cronenberg, Steven Soderbergh, Andrea Arnold, Steve McQueen, Lou Ye. And, I guess, Madonna. For its 68th manifestation, Venice has wrested back some much-needed stardust and artistic heft. However long-established the eleven-day event has been (it is the world&apos;s oldest film festival, founded at the behest of Benito Mussolini \u2013 understandably, they don&apos;t make too much of this connection any more), it has been in danger of losing lustre to the upstart Toronto festival, which begins only nine days after Venice starts. Venice is often accused of &quot;front loading&quot; its programmes, with all the big-name movies screening over the first four or five days. You can feel the life being sucked out of the Lido when Toronto begins. Like the last men out of Saigon, stars are whisked off for appearances in Canada, from where Oscar campaigns are launched and mighty box-office receipts can be calculated. What point does all this deal-making and fanfare serve? &quot;Venice and Toronto represent the first opportunity for producers to gauge audience reaction,&quot; says Sandra Hebron, director of the London film festival. &quot;Until they play out on big screens in front of the world&apos;s press and an admittedly cinephile yet still public audience, they can&apos;t get a firm idea of the direction the film will go. A positive reaction naturally kicks an awards campaign into gear.&quot; Black Swan is a prime example. The ballet psychodrama opened Venice last year and critics drooled over the sight of Natalie Portman in a tutu. The wave of acclaim carried her to an Oscar and the film to a best picture nomination. &quot;Without doubt, festivals are make-or-break,&quot; says Jeremy Thomas, the Oscar-winning producer of The Last Emperor, who is involved in three films premiering at Venice: Andrea Arnold&apos;s Wuthering Heights, Steve McQueen&apos;s Shame and David Cronenberg&apos;s A Dangerous Method. &quot;The first vibe on a film is so influential and Venice has a lovely vibe. It&apos;s decadent and beautiful, but understanding the makeup of each festival&apos;s character and audiences is a vital skill for a producer. It&apos;s something I look at even before the film goes into pre-production \u2013 I&apos;ve known since last February that these three would launch in Venice next week, and I&apos;m very excited.&quot; Thomas has experienced triumph and disaster at festivals. Crash, his controversial film with Cronenberg, received a boost from its reception at Cannes (if calls for its banning by the Daily Mail can be termed a boost); Stealing Beauty, his film with Bernardo Bertolucci, was booed at Cannes. &quot;The critical antennae at Cannes are sharper and more judgmental, looking for a certain type of film from a certain type of film-maker, and they didn&apos;t want to see Bernardo make Stealing Beauty. I still think it&apos;s a lovely film, but Cannes nearly killed its reputation in one night.&quot; There is a hierarchy in the world&apos;s film festivals. Cannes, with its combination of sunshine, lunches, huge film market and impeccable artistic history, has long been seen as king. Venice and Berlin are its persistent rivals, though in film-maker top trumps the Golden Palm (Cannes) still beats a Golden Lion (Venice) or a Golden Bear (Berlin). But the landscape has been shifting recently. Toronto&apos;s timing and location has skewed the whole picture. Oscar winners now begin their journey in Canada \u2013 Slumdog Millionaire and The King&apos;s Speech both won the audience award at Toronto. While both are British films, their sensibilities were judged to be better served by North American audiences than by snooty critics at Cannes or Venice. The strategy clearly proved correct, so much so that last year, the UK Film Council (remember it?) took all 13 of its &quot;products&quot; to Toronto and avoided the expense of hotels, boats and the euro at Venice. Never Let Me Go, 127 Hours, The King&apos;s Speech, Brighton Rock, Made in Dagenham, Neds \u2013 it was deemed more important for these titles to gain exposure on the North American scene than in Venice, and in Canada they might grab that lifeline of a US distribution deal. So has Toronto become the most important film festival in the world, thus cementing the American factor as more important than winning a prize at some arty, old European shindig? &quot;Since the Baftas and the Oscars have become so important to studios, I&apos;ve definitely noticed that awards campaigns have intensified and ratcheted up around Toronto,&quot; says Hebron. &quot;Of course, the Oscars are an American concept, so it&apos;s natural that American films will dominate during that awards season.&quot; However, with actresses such as Marion Cotillard winning best actress for the French film La Vie en Rose, even the traditionally inward-looking Oscars have gained a more global outlook. Timing, says Hebron, is everything. When the Baftas moved dates to come before the Oscars, they received an injection of Hollywood glamour and interest and Hebron&apos;s London festival immediately felt the knock-on effect. &quot;There has been a tangible difference in the last five or so years,&quot; she says. &quot;Films such as Frost/Nixon, The Constant Gardener and Good Night And Good Luck suddenly proved London was rich ground for Baftas and Oscars. When I began curating the festival, we had to beg studios for their films \u2013 now they come to us, fighting for gala slots.&quot; Mark Adams, the chief critic for the trade bible Screen International, visits 20 film festivals a year, often ensuring he can file the first reviews of a film that might be expected to go on to awards success. &quot;Hollywood studios are wary of festivals,&quot; he admits. &quot;Often their big films will be there, with stars in tow, but screening out of competition. A Hollywood film worth millions cannot be seen to not win.&quot; It will be interesting to see how the Cannes-winner The Tree of Life, a non-mainstream film but starring major hitter Brad Pitt, will fare. As Adams says, with the sigh of someone zipping up yet another suitcase: &quot;Gems do come from B-list festivals too. Right after Venice and Toronto there are San Sebasti\u00e1n, Rio, Abu Dhabi and Tokyo, while the new year brings Sundance, Rotterdam and Berlin. Don&apos;t forget the increasingly vital subset of documentary festivals either, such as IDFA [in Amsterdam], Hot Docs [in Toronto] and Sheffield. The cycle never stops.&quot; Most festivals are a sort of level playing field where arthouse, foreign-language or &quot;non-industrialised&quot; films, as Jeremy Thomas likes to call his works, breathe oxygen and gain prominence, however briefly. Venice, Cannes and Berlin are curated firmly, the titles selected by festival directors with discerning and distinctive tastes; with occasional concessions and deals made to secure big stars \u2014 I suspect Venice showing Madonna&apos;s W.E. is an example of that. Toronto, it seems, will happily spotlight most films a studio gives it, relegating the non-Hollywood movies to an impenetrable mass of screenings. With the multiplexes clogged with Hollywood blockbusters, the festival circuit is crucial exposure for films without the might of a studio marketing department behind them. Winning audience awards at Sundance, Berlin and various docfests was instrumental, for example, in gaining the British film-maker Lucy Walker an Oscar nomination for her film Waste Land last year. &quot;The momentum from festivals is crucial,&quot; she says. &quot;Waste Land was at the very back of the Sundance catalogue and sounded very unentertaining (a doc about an artist working in a garbage dump? In Portuguese?) So everyone is rushing past you to the more Hollywoody options, but then people who see it admire it and the festival buzz machine whirrs into action. Suddenly you&apos;re a hot ticket and your film is being invited to attend a whole year&apos;s worth of progressively smaller \u2013 but still very prestigious and exotically located \u2013 film festivals and awards ceremonies.&quot; Jason Solomons is an Observer film writer and chairman of the Critics&apos; Circle film section.", "sentences": ["Don&apos;t forget the increasingly vital subset of documentary festivals either, such as IDFA [in Amsterdam], Hot Docs [in Toronto] and Sheffield."], "title": "If it's September it must be Venice: but Europe's film festivals face a new threat", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/28/toronto-film-festival-rival-venice", "tags": ["Oscars 2012", "Golden Globes 2012", "Toronto film festival", "Venice film festival 2011", "Venice film festival", "Keira Knightley", "Madonna", "Kate Winslet", "George Clooney", "Steven Soderbergh", "David Cronenberg", "Colin Firth", "Oscars", "World news", "Roman Polanski", "Andrea Arnold", "Toronto film festival 2011", "London film festival 2011"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-08-29T20:30:01Z", "article": "At the Turner prize ceremony in 1997, Gillian Wearing drank a bottle and a half of champagne before the main announcement. She was on the shortlist, but assumed she wouldn&apos;t win. The whole scene was pretty overwhelming back then, she says. Interest in young British artists was at its height, the ceremony was televised, and the fascination around the prize kept building. Two years later, there would be frenzied debate over Tracey Emin&apos;s unmade bed, and two years after that would come the screaming celebrity zenith, when Madonna turned up to hand over the award. After Wearing&apos;s name was read out that night, she made it to the stage, thanked her family, then drew a blank. &quot;One of my friends lives in Amsterdam,&quot; she says, &quot;and he told me that the next day, in a Dutch newspaper, they wrote that: &apos;A very inarticulate person won the Turner prize.&apos;&quot; Wearing laughs uproariously. She has an abiding fascination with articulation, with the ability to communicate clearly, honestly, succinctly; much of her work, which will be collected in a retrospective at the Whitechapel gallery next year, has involved drawing out people&apos;s most private thoughts, eliciting confessions about the events and ideas that hulk darkly around our subconscious. After finishing her art degree at Goldsmith&apos;s in 1990, for instance, she began the project Signs That Say What You Want Them to Say and Not Signs That Say What Someone Else Wants You to Say, in which she approached people in the\u00a0street and asked them to write something on a piece of paper and then be photographed. The work involved breaking down inhibitions; both hers and theirs. &quot;You just feel like an idiot stopping people in the street,&quot; she says. &quot;You think: why am I actually doing it?&quot; Her answer came when a man she approached, the very image of a well-groomed, self-satisfied banker, scrawled &quot;I&apos;m desperate&quot;, and held it up for the camera. In her first film for the cinema, Self Made, released on Friday, Wearing encourages seven people to explore the hidden sides of their nature, the alter egos and fantasy figures they keep private; it&apos;s an extension and progression of some of her earlier video projects. In 1994, for example, she placed a small ad that read: &quot;Confess all on video. Don&apos;t worry, you will be in disguise. Intrigued? Call Gillian.&quot; The ad copy became the title of the piece. From behind masks, and beneath wigs, individuals confessed to putting scabs on their boss&apos;s pizza, having sex with prostitutes, making dirty phone calls, stealing a school&apos;s computer. The video is by turns fascinating and chilling. She\u00a0returned to similar territory with Trauma, in 2000, and Secrets and Lies, in 2009, in which nine masked people confessed to everything from drinking menstrual blood to murder. &apos;Suddenly, people were crying&apos; Self Made started with another advert, reading: &quot;Would you like to be in a film? You can play yourself or a fictional character. Call Gillian.&quot; Two thousand people replied, and Wearing whittled them down through a series of auditions. The final seven took part in a three-week Method acting workshop, a process that would open them up and strip them bare, leading to the moment when they each performed a short, scripted drama based on their own idea \u2013 what Wearing calls their &quot;end scene&quot;, five of which are in the film. There has been a mixed reception since the film started screening at festivals last year; not surprising, since it is an emotionally wrenching, uncompromising, sometimes horrifying piece of work. It is also incredibly powerful. In one early scene, the group is simply doing breathing exercises \u2013 sounding long, constant notes, and then huffing hard \u2013 and it seems so primal it&apos;s no surprise when some eventually burst into tears. It was a scene like this that Wearing encountered when she attended her first ever Method workshop with Sam Rumbelow, the acting coach who appears in Self Made. He started talking to the group about drinking a cup of coffee, trying to stir up their memories, &quot;and all of a sudden I saw people shaking,&quot; says Wearing, &quot;and their backs shuddering, and they were actually crying. There was an emotional outpouring, which is really just about people relaxing and admitting, &apos;OK, let&apos;s not pretend I feel happy. I feel sad.&apos; It&apos;s a kind of emotional truth.&quot; In Self Made, these sessions lead the participants in vastly different directions. The two women&apos;s end scenes explore their feelings of being unloved; the three men&apos;s are violent \u2013 one a moment of grotesque, elemental aggression against a pregnant woman. As the filming of this last scene came closer, Wearing grew more and more worried, &quot;because it was a very extreme idea, and I was having cold feet. I said to him myself, &apos;You can change your idea&apos;, but he was really keen, and as soon as I knew that it was important to him, and that he really wanted to do the piece, I was completely behind it.&quot; Wearing is clearly brilliant at opening people up to this very deep level of communication, yet over the course of our interview in her studio she describes herself as &quot;totally inarticulate&quot; three times, as well as &quot;completely&quot;, &quot;really&quot; and &quot;very&quot; inarticulate. She&apos;s referring mostly to her earlier days, to growing up in Birmingham, the middle child of\u00a0a butcher mother and TV salesman father. She &quot;hated senior school with a\u00a0vengeance&quot;, she says, losing interest in books after starting at a comprehensive that pioneered large class sizes. Wearing didn&apos;t really read between the\u00a0ages of 11 and 28, and so her ability to construct sentences suffered arrested development. When Arbus met Greer She left school with no CSEs, having been demoted from O-level classes six months before the exams. In her early 20s she started secretarial work at an animation studio, decided she liked the look of what her bosses were doing, and went to study for a BTEC at Chelsea College of Art and Design. (Her lack of O-levels was overlooked by an administrator who asked for her star sign, and nodded approval at the fact she&apos;s a Sagittarius.) She made a friend at Chelsea who felt her inarticulacy was &quot;a sign of intelligence. He couldn&apos;t understand what I said, because I had a Birmingham accent and I mumbled a bit, so he thought I was saying something far more interesting than I actually was. When I got more articulate, he found me less interesting.&quot; She laughs again, hard. &quot;The subliminal messages had disappeared.&quot; She says all this swinging back and forth on her chair, legs corkscrewing around one another, long hair secured with a sparkly clip. She is in her late 40s, but only her salt and pepper eyebrows speak against her girlishness. Her inarticulacy seems consigned to the past. We have a great conversation, engaged and engaging, and it&apos;s only when I play back the tape I see her point. She tells me she talks too fast \u2013 she once walked out of a question-and- answer session, hurt after an audience member shouted &quot;We can&apos;t hear you&quot; \u2013 but this is only half the story. Her words slow down and speed up, her Birmingham accent segues in and out, she talks clearly one moment, mumbles the next. At one point her voice becomes childlike, recalling her 1997 work, 2 into 1, in which she had a mother mouth a tape recording of her young twin boys describing her, and the boys mouth a tape of their mother describing them. I realise there&apos;s something faintly clamorous about Wearing \u2013 as if a whole group of people\u00a0were struggling to break through her skin. Over the last decade, Wearing has been working on a series in which she recreates photographs, using prosthetic masks to exactly reproduce old, often formal, family portraits. Her eyes stare hauntingly from within the image of her mother, father and brother. She has also taken photographs of what she\u00a0calls her &quot;spiritual family&quot;, masked up to resemble Diane Arbus, Robert Mapplethorpe, Andy Warhol. When I ask what scene she would have acted out herself in Self Made, Wearing says she would have appeared as Arbus, and tried to recreate a scene from the early 1970s, when the photo-grapher took a portrait of Germaine Greer. She notes that Greer didn&apos;t enjoy the session, &quot;and I just thought that would be interesting, that relationship, two very powerful, strong women, in the same room together&quot;. She should write to Greer and ask her, I say. &quot;That is what I&apos;d like to do. I&apos;ve always been tempted to write that letter.&quot; It&apos;s just a\u00a0question of finding the words.", "sentences": ["&quot;One of my friends lives in Amsterdam,&quot; she says, &quot;and he told me that the next day, in a Dutch newspaper, they wrote that: &apos;A very inarticulate person won the Turner prize.&apos;&quot; Wearing laughs uproariously."], "title": "Gillian Wearing: A nose for the truth", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/aug/29/gillian-wearing-self-made", "tags": ["Art", "Turner prize", "Film", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-01T19:00:00Z", "article": "At first glance, Tony Bates is a typical member of California&apos;s techno-aristocracy. The 44-year-old chief executive of internet phonebox Skype lives in Los Altos near San Francisco, goes to the same gym as Apple&apos;s new boss, Tim Cook, and his firm has just been sold to Microsoft for $8.5bn (\u00a35.26bn). Except that for Bates, the journey to the heart of Silicon Valley&apos;s elite did not begin at one of America&apos;s Ivy League universities: it started on the Piccadilly line of the London Underground. At 19, having quit his mechanical engineering course at South Bank Polytechnic, he taught himself code by reading programming manuals on the way to work. Like the best American dream-spinners, Bates enjoys telling his story. He was born in Isleworth, west London, and raised in Teddington by his mother, a hairdresser, and his stepfather, a builder. &quot;I do come from fairly humble beginnings.&quot; After two decades in the US, the accent is mid-Atlantic, but there are glimpses of the London boy in the odd dropped consonant and the ready grin. Pausing during a quick tour of Skype&apos;s European operations, Bates has arrived at the Guardian&apos;s offices to set down a marker. Skype has 170 million active monthly users. With Microsoft&apos;s backing, he wants to get to 1 billion, though he has not said by when. &quot;Our goal and mission is to become a global communications service provider and reach billions, not hundreds of millions, and we won&apos;t stop until we get there,&quot; he says. Bates has revealed that when he was an executive at electronics firm Cisco, he and his wife wrote down their goals. It was 2007, he was 40, and he wrote that he wanted to become a chief executive before the age of 45. He listed four companies. One of them was Skype. So what were the others? &quot;That I&apos;m keeping quite personal \u2013 because you never know!&quot; The freckled face cracks into a smile. &quot;When you set a goal it&apos;s a personal thing and that goal should be very big, hairy and audacious.&quot; Bates knows the internet from the inside, and from its very beginnings as an academic resource. His first job was at the University of London computer centre as a network operator. Gateway to the future At the interview, he didn&apos;t know what a network was. &quot;It was a life-defining moment for me. I went into this room and there were just these racks of equipment with flashing lights.&quot; He was looking at banks of low-speed modems, located in what was to become one of the gateways where the US internet, developed for research purposes by the military, government and academics, plugged into its European cousin. He stayed at the University of London for six years, then came a couple of years in Amsterdam, working on a European Union project to agree standards for web addresses. The chance of a job in the US came with an offer to join MCI, later bought by telecoms group WorldCom. With commercial traffic now piling on to the internet, MCI had won a contract to build a beefed-up network for the US government&apos;s national science foundation, which funded university research. &quot;It was the biggest, baddest thing on the planet. It was so big that we would carry everyone else&apos;s traffic. We were defining size and scale in a way that had never been done before.&quot; Two years later he went from the east to the west coast and joined Cisco, on the chief technology officer&apos;s team. He caught the eye of Cisco&apos;s boss, John Chambers, and was groomed for management, staying for 15 years. Chambers taught him about setting stretching goals and taking calculated risks. &quot;I didn&apos;t have a formal background in programming or hardware, yet I was charged to build the single largest router that has ever been built, even today, from scratch with a $500m budget.&quot; Bates clearly likes big things. To the uninitiated, routers are the pieces of kit which chop up web pages and emails into thousands of tiny packets of information and choose the route by which they will travel through the web to their destination. It was a five-year project from start to finish, and to motivate his team Bates told them that the router should be commercially available before his then newborn son was old enough to click a mouse. Every once in a while, he would bring in a photo of his child \u2013 sitting, crawling, learning to walk. &quot;We made it, but it was touch and go,&quot; he says. By the time he left in October 2010, Bates was running Cisco&apos;s enterprise, commercial and small business group, with a team of 15,000 and $20bn of revenue. He had joined the board of YouTube as its first outside director, and during the remaining few months before it was bought by Google had been drawn to the social media scene, where names like Facebook complete decades of a real-world company life cycle in a few months or years. The move to Skype was a risk. It was an entry into the top of the internet&apos;s hottest business area, but one in which names like Myspace and Bebo can burst into the public consciousness, only to disappear just as quickly. Skype is a little different. Bates classes it as social media, part of what he calls the online &quot;town square&quot; phenomenon, but it is also an internet utility. It has been through many ups and downs and changes of ownership, but is still growing and celebrated its eighth birthday this August. The technology is simple enough for grandparents to use it to communicate with grandchildren, and sophisticated enough to conduct virtual US army weddings between soldiers on the battlefields and wives back home. Founded in 2003 by a Swede and a Dane, Skype was bought two years later by eBay in 2005 for $2.6bn. There it languished, until, in 2009, eBay sold a 70% stake to private equity and the new owners cast about for a chief executive. Bates was asked to prepare a stock market listing. But his dream of becoming a chief executive was to be short-lived, because Microsoft came calling with a bulging pocket book. He believes he now has a mandate from Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer to expand the company as he sees fit. The $8.5bn takeover deal has yet to be completed, yet Skype has already completed the $85m acquisition of a messaging technology company, GroupMe. &quot;Steve Ballmer and I were really aligned on how they would run Skype, and the fact that we were to be an independent division \u2013 they had never done that before with an acquisition.&quot; Bates is walking a tightrope. To survive, Skype must be on mobile phones, not just home computers. To do that, it must be neutral, with friends among the best carriers and handset makers. Since Google&apos;s acquisition of Motorola this summer, the three major operating platforms are now closely tied to one handset maker. Apple has always made both the iPhone&apos;s software and hardware, but Google is buying Motorola to strengthen Android, and Microsoft has allied itself to Nokia. Skype is caught somewhere in the middle. Telecoms challenge &quot;There is a constant tension between the handset vendors, the operating system makers and the carriers. We think we are there to help them differentiate.&quot; His other challenge is to make money. Although 35% of customers claim to use Skype for business, just 6% pay. In 2010, revenues were $860m, with $264m in operating profits, but the company still reported a loss of $7m. Bates is based near Microsoft&apos;s head office in Palo Alto, but Skype is a genuinely international company. Its registered headquarters are in Luxembourg, its largest engineering hub is in Estonia, and there are significant operations in London and Stockholm. &quot;I believe we have one of the only global companies. Most that say they are, are run out of the US.&quot; Bates says this means he uses Skype video-calling every day. &quot;It&apos;s not because we want to eat our own dogfood, it&apos;s how we work.&quot; The trick will be to persuade more people to work that way, and to pay for the convenience.

Eight days after residents were told the council had voted to stop the trams two miles short of the city centre, it agreed by a majority to reinstate the longer route at an emergency meeting on Friday. The city&apos;s ruling Liberal Democrat and Scottish National parties voted together to save the line after the Scottish government threatened this week to pull \u00a376m in essential funding. The vote, which was supported grudgingly by the Labour councillors who last week voted to stop the line, came less than four hours before a deadline from the city&apos;s main contractors, the engineering firms Bilfinger Berger and Siemens. After last week&apos;s decision to stop the project at Haymarket, the council was warned it had until 5pm on Friday to agree a route or end the contract and pay \u00a3161m in cancellation charges. Jenny Dawe, leader of the city&apos;s ruling coalition, ignored calls that she should resign for mishandling the scheme, but acknowledged that last week&apos;s vote had &quot;trashed&quot; the city&apos;s reputation. She said: &quot;What we have now is a decision to go to St Andrew&apos;s Square, which I believe is the right decision for the city.&quot; Bungled decisions and setbacks have increased the project&apos;s official costs from \u00a3520m in 2008 to the latest figure of \u00a3776m. The new line to St Andrew&apos;s Square in the New Town will cost the city about \u00a386m per mile, but that figure too is expected to rise. Although officials hope to strike a more competitive deal with the contractors or get more government funding, the city will have to borrow up to \u00a3231m to build the extra section of line. The costs of that loan over the next 30 years would push the total figure beyond \u00a31bn. That money will be spent on building a line that will still end eight stops short of the destination agreed in 2008 \u2013 a terminus near the old fishing port of Newhaven on Edinburgh&apos;s seafront. Proposals for Edinburgh to have a tram network began in 2000, under the then Labour-run council. By 2008, the aspiration was to have a full network of at least three lines, taking the trams from Edinburgh airport some 11.5 miles away through the western suburbs of the city, its famous Georgian New Town, and then on through Leith to serve an ambitious but now recession-hit new docklands housing project along the city&apos;s shoreline.Within months of the works beginning, costs began to balloon out of control. Digging work to clear 28 miles of known water, gas, electricity and telecoms pipes revealed further unrecorded utility pipes. The council also discovered that their construction contracts left the city carrying all the extra costs. Councillor Gordon Mackenzie, the city&apos;s transport convenor, said that increased the costs of relocating utilities by 85%. As a result, tram officials confirmed last week the city has already spent \u00a3430m but has only laid 1\u00bd miles of track. This has infuriated the tram project&apos;s many prominent supporters, including Graham Birse, chief executive of Edinburgh chamber of commerce. He denounced last week&apos;s Haymarket vote as &quot;bonkers&quot;, and said: &quot;There&apos;s plenty of evidence out there about the contribution that trams make to the prosperity of a city, the connectivity of cities and the image of cities as open for business and attractive to inward investment. &quot;In the time it has taken the Edinburgh tram scheme to develop, there have been 32 other schemes developed or delivered elsewhere in Europe.&quot; Dawe believes the line to the city centre can be built for less than \u00a3776m and insisted that figure followed &quot;very extensive risk analysis&quot;. He is hopeful that the first test runs of the city&apos;s trams will start early next year, and estimates the first commercial services could start in 2014.Critics of the project, including Edinburgh&apos;s Labour and Tory councillors, fear the \u00a3776m bill will quickly increase, hence their vote last week to stop the line at Haymarket. Andrew Burns, the Labour leader, said: &quot;We must not be under any illusion that this project will remain at \u00a3776m. It will not.&quot; Their predictions are supported by John Carson, an engineer who was involved in rescuing Railtrack and extending France&apos;s high-speed TGV to Amsterdam. He believes Edinburgh&apos;s tram project could cost \u00a31bn by 2013. &quot;The current scheme is unworkable. The figures are highly suspect and they will be back asking for more money in a year&apos;s time,&quot; he said. &quot;They will be asking for another \u00a3200m in a year, 18 months.&quot;He says part of the problem is the trams themselves, which weigh 57 tonnes and are 43 metres long. &quot;They&apos;re the most expensive, the longest and the heaviest trams in the world. They&apos;re not designed for Edinburgh,&quot; he said. &quot;They should&apos;ve bought what every other country and every other municipality has, the standard tram from 10 to 20 metres long.&quot; Some polls suggest a majority of the city&apos;s 480,000 residents want the project entirely scrapped, disgusted by the rapid escalation in costs, the upheaval to their daily lives and the repeated errors made in its costings. Late last month, the council&apos;s lawyers found a \u00a3100m mistake: officials had overestimated the costs of cancelling the project by double-counting. A straw poll this week by the city&apos;s commercial radio station, Radio Forth, found that 63% of more than 2,900 residents want the project scrapped, while 35% favour taking it to St Andrew&apos;s Square. Only 1.7% backed last week&apos;s vote by Labour and the Tories to stop it at Haymarket.

The annual QS World University Rankings remains dominated by US institutions, which took 13 of the top 20 places. There are five British universities in the top 20 \u2013 Oxford ranks fifth, Imperial sixth, UCL seventh and Edinburgh 20th. The only university in the top 20 which is not from the English speaking world is the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich, at 18. The highest ranking Asian universities are Hong Kong at 22, Tokyo at 25, and the National University of Singapore at 28. King Saud University, in Saudi Arabia, made the top 200 for the first time. At 200, it was the highest rated institution in the Arab world. It is the second year running that Cambridge University has taken the top spot. Ben Sowter, QS head of research, said: &quot;The gap between Cambridge and Harvard is very small, but Cambridge&apos;s superior student/faculty ratio helped tip the balance. Individual attention is one of the key attractions of the Oxbridge tutorial system.&quot; Government and private funding for technology-focused research is eroding the dominance of traditional comprehensive universities, compilers of the rankings said. The average age of the top 100 institutions has dropped by seven years since 2010, reflecting the emergence of newer specialist institutions, QS said. Nine UK universities were in the top 50, and 17 in the top 100. Sowter said: &quot;This year&apos;s QS rankings show that the worst effects of the funding cuts have yet to be felt by UK universities. &quot;However, pre-emptive redundancies and increased student intake have led to worse student to faculty ratios relative to their international peers. &quot;Of the 37 UK universities in the top 300, 34 fared worse in this measure than in 2010.&quot; Tuition fee information has been published for the first time alongside the 2011 world rankings. It suggests that UK higher education is still cheaper compared to many US universities, but other international institutions may offer better value for money. Universities in the Netherlands, including Amsterdam University (63rd place) Utrecht (80) and Leiden (88), are all in the top 100 and offer English-language courses for less than \u00a32,000 per year, QS said. The university rankings are based on a mix of factors including academic reputation, employability of graduates, citations, and the staff-student ratio.", "sentences": ["Universities in the Netherlands, including Amsterdam University (63rd place) Utrecht (80) and Leiden (88), are all in the top 100 and offer English-language courses for less than \u00a32,000 per year, QS said."], "title": "Cambridge tops league table of world's best universities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/sep/05/cambridge-tops-league-table-universities", "tags": ["University of Cambridge", "Higher education", "Education", "US news", "World news", "UK news", "Harvard University", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-05T18:30:00Z", "article": "Students looking for any way to avoid \u00a39,000 tuition fees and still attend a top-flight university could do worse than look at Trinity College, Dublin. The 400-year-old institution, ideally located to enjoy the &quot;craic&quot; of the fair city&apos;s nightlife, is ranked 65th in the world \u2013 just behind the London School of Economics \u2013 in the latest league table of the world&apos;s top universities, published yesterday. But it does not charge tuition fees to students from the UK. QS, the international career and education network that compiled the latest world rankings, has for the first time compared tuition costs for all 600 universities. And in the top 200, many have fees below England&apos;s top whack of \u00a39,000 a year. So what are the realistic options for UK students willing to pack their trunk to save on the debts? Dutch institutions are worth a look. Amsterdam university (ranked 63rd), offers numerous undergraduate degrees taught in English, and charges EU students just \u20ac1,713 (\u00a31,516) a year in tuition fees. Also among the top 100 universities in the world are Utrecht (80th) and Leiden (88th). According to the Student Loans Company, UK undergraduates wishing to study at EU universities would be eligible for a loan from that country to cover their tuition fees. If the countries also offered loans to cover living expenses, they would be able to apply for those. But if students are looking elsewhere in the world, they will have to apply for a scholarship or make their own financial arrangements. For those happy to go further afield, Hong Kong has three universities in the top 50, all offering a good range of degrees taught in English. The University of Hong Kong is impressively ranked at number 22, with the Chinese University of Hong Kong at 37 and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology at number 40. Fees at the University of Hong Kong are \u00a35,480 a year and \u00a37,829 at the other two, and all three offer a variety of scholarships. Outdoor types may find Nordic institutions attractive. But although the universities of Copenhagen (52nd), Helsinki (89th), Uppsala (83rd) and Lund (86th) charge no fees to EU students, they do not offer degrees taught in English. Though any would-be undergraduate who happens to be bilingual in Danish, Finnish or Swedish could be laughing in both their languages. ETH Zurich (18th) and Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne (35th), overlooking Lake Geneva, are among the cheapest fee-charging institutions in the league table and are a good option for those interested in studying for an English degree (other subjects are taught in German and French respectively). Fees are just 580 Swiss Francs (\u00a3435) a semester for both bachelor and masters degrees \u2013 foreign students pay the same as domestic undergraduates. In contrast, US universities, which dominate the top 20, are likely to be beyond the reach of most UK students, unless they&apos;re lucky enough to get a scholarship. Most of the US universities listed charge $38,000-$40,000 (\u00a323,400-\u00a324,600) a year, which does put the \u00a39,000 fees of many UK institutions in a different light. &quot;At undergraduate level, all of the UK institutions listed are comparatively good value,&quot; says Ben Sowter, head of research at QS. UK universities fare well in this year&apos;s QS rankings, with 54 in the top 600. Of these, over half are ranked in the top 200 and there are nine in the top 50. The rankings are based on research quality, graduate employability, teaching and how international the faculties and students are. Cambridge this year pips Harvard to the top spot for the second year in a row, while Oxford, Imperial and University College London come fifth, sixth and seventh respectively. US institutions continue to dominate, with six universities in the top 10 and 20 in the top 50. But whereas UK institutions, including Cambridge, tend to do well in terms of how international their students and faculties are, Harvard, like most US universities, &quot;struggles to compete&quot; in this respect, Sowter says. However, the tables show that if the listings were ranked according to employers&apos; preferences, Harvard would come top, Oxford second and Cambridge third. In fourth place, according to employers, come Manchester (29th in the overall table), Warwick (50th) and the LSE (64th), in equal place with Melbourne and the American Ivy League institutions MIT, Yale, Stanford and Berkeley. But the UK lags behind many other developed countries in terms of public investment in higher education. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), higher education spending accounts for 0.7% of GDP, below the US, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Poland and Slovenia.

Cardiff, at that time in the Second Division but regulars in European competition thanks to their successes in the Welsh Cup, faced a very different proposition to the one that now stands before Birmingham. While Blues joined 75 other teams in the Europa League play-offs and 47 other clubs in the group stage, and face the prospect of 14 matches simply to reach the semi-finals, the Bluebirds were one of only 32 sides in the 1967-68 tournament, who, in the best-case scenario, could have been Cup Winners&apos; Cup champions after nine matches. Shamrock Rovers were beaten 3-1 on aggregate in the first round and NAC Breda of Holland were hammered 5-2 thanks to a 4-1 win at Ninian Park. The quarter-finals brought Torpedo Moscow, a far tougher task, and after 1-0 wins for each side in their home legs, Cardiff triumphed in a play-off in the Bavarian town of Augsburg. Another trip to Germany, this time to Hamburg, awaited in the semi-finals, and a 1-1 draw in the first leg was followed by a dramatic tie at Ninian Park in front of over 43,000 fans. Cardiff took the lead through Norman Dean, Gert Dorfel equalised then Uwe Seeler put the Germans ahead early in the second half. Brian Harris headed Cardiff level with just over 10 minutes to play and another play-off seemed to be on the cards before Franz-Josef Honig scored the winner for the visitors with the last kick of the game. Atalanta qualified for the Cup Winners&apos; Cup in 1987-88 despite defeat to Napoli in the 1986-87 Copa Italia final. The Naples club had won Serie A leaving the way clear for Atalanta, who were relegated from Serie A in 1986-87, to take on the rest of Europe from their position in Serie B. Merthr Tydfil, of the Southern League Division One (Midland), were beaten in the first round (although Merthr won the first leg in Wales), the mighty OFI Crete, again after a defeat in the first leg, were also well beaten in Bergamo, putting Atalanta in the quarter-finals, where Sporting Lisbon were impressively beaten 3-1 on aggregate. The adventure came to an end, though, in the semi-finals when KV Mechelen, the eventual winners (beating the Ajax side of Blind, Wouters, Witschge, Bosman, Winter and Muhren in the final), won 4-2 over two legs. An honourable mention should go to Third Division Newport County, who as Welsh Cup winners in 1979-80 carried the flag for Wales in the 1980-81 Cup Winners&apos; Cup and reached the quarter-finals before losing to Carl Zeiss Jena of Germany. JUPP HEYNCKES: RECORD BREAKER? &quot;Jupp Heynckes is making his first managerial appearance in the Champions League since he won the competition with Real Madrid in 1998, 13 years ago,&quot; noted Mark Ashley Thomas last week. &quot;Is this the longest gap a winning manager has had until he next managed in the competition?&quot; We do believe it is. Heynckes, who left the Bernab\u00e9u after the 1997-98 campaign despite his success in the Champions League (he guided Real to only fourth in La Liga) returns to Europe&apos;s premier competition with Bayern Munich this season. When his Bayern side take on Villarreal on 14 September, it will be Heynckes first appearance on a Champions League touchline since he stood in the technical area at the Amsterdam Arena as his Real side beat Juventus 1-0 on 20 May 1998 \u2013 13 years and nearly four months ago. Victory for Bayern in the competition this year, though unlikely, would see the German manager eclipse the record set by the great Ernst Happel, who won the tournament 13 years apart with Feyenoord in 1970 and Hamburg in 1983. There have been a fair few coaches to win the title then never again grace the competition, but the longest previous gap was the seven years between Emerich Jenei winning the European Cup with Steaua Bucharest in 1986 and returning in the 1993-94 season. But one man still active in the game who could eclipse Heynckes is Ljupko Petrovic, who won the tournament with Red Star Belgrade in 1991 and has not managed in the competition since, though he is still coaching and was manager of Croatian top division side Lokomotiva Zagreb until March this year. FOOTBALLERS ON TV (2) Last week we looked at the players who have cropped up \u2013 in name at least \u2013 on the small and silver screen. And the Knowledge inbox has been bulging with more answers, indeed the world and his wife, their families, their families&apos; servants, their families&apos; servants&apos; tennis partners and some chap I bumped into the other day called Bernard have pointed out Dennis &apos;Cutty&apos; Wise of The Wire. First the coincidental \u2013 Fernando Torres crops up in the US Sitcom My Wife and Kids, there&apos;s a Michael Dawson in Lost, a John O&apos;Shea in the film Mystic River, a Pirlo and a Gattuso in the BBC drama Zen, Bruce Willis starred (somewhat ironically given the player&apos;s injury record) as David Dunn in the film Unbreakable and Wesley Sneijder will appear in the new series of Chuck. More interesting, though, are the screenwriters and directors who have shoehorned players from their favourite teams into their productions. Andrew Sunter points us towards the 2003 episode of Taggert containing most of the 1968 Scottish Cup-winning Dunfermline Athletic side. &quot;As a writer, one never wants something to detract from the story, but I couldn&apos;t resist slipping in a few names from that heroic side,&quot; said the writer Stuart Hepburn. &quot;I changed some of the sexes and slightly altered some of the names, but one eagle-eyed Dunfermline fan sussed me out. I&apos;m just pleased someone else was able to remember the glory days.&quot; &quot;There is a famous case of a footballer&apos;s name used in a Belgian movie,&quot; writes Gerd De Keyser. &quot;The movie is called De Zaak Alzheimer (The Alzheimer Case). It&apos;s about a hitman who suffers Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Director Erik Van Looy is a big Antwerp fan and wanted to give his hitman the name of a Marseille player that sounded &quot;maffi-esque&quot;. He made a telephone call to the sports desk of a Belgian television station and asked journalist Filip Joos if he could provide a name that would suit, preferably the name of an Olympique Marseille player. &quot;Joos searched for the Marseille team that won the Champions League in 1993 and came up with two suitable names: Eric Di Meco and Bernard Casoni. Van Looy went for Casoni, hence the name of the hitman in the film is Bernard Casoni (played by Jan Decleir). The real Bernard Casoni is coach of newly promoted Ligue 1 team Evian-Thonon.&quot; And when the writers don&apos;t do it, the actors sometimes help out. &quot;Roy Cropper (played by Loughborough-born David Neilson) in Coronation Street has been known to drop a few Leicester City references,&quot; writes Tim Burke. &quot;After our glorious Carling Cup win in 1997 he gave the serial number of a kitchen appliance in his cafe as &apos;LCFC97&apos;, then in a discussion about inspirational teachers he lauded a certain &apos;Mr O&apos;Neill&apos;, and when our much loved striker headed off to Wolves he bade farewell to a customer with the words &apos;Goodbye Mr Claridge&apos;.&quot; And, as Mark Taylor proves, you don&apos;t always have to shoehorn in the name of a star striker to get your point across. &quot;I directed the animated CBeebies show &apos;Boo!&apos;&quot; writes Mark, &quot;and in the episode where the little stripey blighter becomes &apos;Footballer Boo&apos; I managed to get him into the strip of the mighty Bristol City and, better still, in the episode the Reds score against a team wearing the blue and white quarters of the old enemy (Bristol Rovers). &quot;Despite the efforts of the educationalists who wanted both teams to score and everything to end equally (as usually happens in the world of pre-school) I refused and so the animated Reds won the game.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;You said that Liverpool were the first British club to have a shirt sponsor (Hitachi in 1979), but while Liverpool are doubtless the first professional club to be sponsored, I&apos;m pretty sure Kettering beat them to it by a few years. This is not a wind-up. Maybe you can confirm it?&quot; asked Jon Cudby back in 2000. Having spoken to the Kettering club historian Mel Hopkins, Jon, we can indeed. When the Wolves striker Derek Dougan retired from football in the summer of 1975, he joined Kettering Town, then of the Southern League, as chief executive. Within a month of his appointment, he had brokered a &quot;four-figure&quot; deal with local firm Kettering Tyres, and in a league game against Bath City on 24 January 1976, Kettering became the first British club to run out with a company&apos;s name emblazoned on their shirts. Sadly, the groundbreaking new strip would not get another run-out. Four days later, the FA predictably ordered the club to remove the new slogan, despite Dougan&apos;s claim that the ruling body&apos;s 1972 ban on sponsorship had not been put in writing. Characteristically, Dougan did not take this body blow lying down. He cheekily changed the wording on the shirts to Kettering T, which he claimed stood for Town and had nothing whatsoever to do with Tyres. For a couple of heady months, the team played on under the new slogan. Sure enough, however, Kettering were soon up before the FA, which ordered them to &quot;remove the words Kettering T from their strip&quot;. The threat of a \u00a31,000 fine was too much for such a small club, and the words were reluctantly removed. There would be one final irony. Kettering did not let the matter lie \u2013 after all, clubs such as Bayern Munich had been coining it in on the continent for years \u2013 and so, with Derby and Bolton, they put forward a proposal to the FA regarding shirt sponsorship. But although the proposal was accepted on 3 June 1977, Kettering could not find a sponsor for the upcoming season. Meanwhile, Derby players began that season running around in Saab shirts and Saab cars. Where&apos;s the justice?

It&apos;s not a question usually asked: the received wisdom, supported by research and backed by campaigning groups, is that the more cyclists there are, the safer the roads become for everyone. But in Copenhagen \u2013 one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world in which 36% of its inhabitants cycle to work or school, and which has committed to increasing that figure to 50% by 2015 \u2013 there are controversial voices coming from unexpected places. According to the Danish Cyclists&apos; Federation and Wonderful Copenhagen, the official tourism organisation for Denmark, the sheer success of the drive to get more locals and tourists on bikes is creating a dangerous, intimidating and unpleasant climate for cyclists in the city. &quot;In Copenhagen, we have quite extraordinary problems around cycling congestion,&quot; said Aneh Hajdu, of Wonderful Copenhagen. &quot;I don&apos;t take my children on their bikes into Copenhagen at rush hour any more. It&apos;s too dangerous and scary. I just wouldn&apos;t risk it.&quot; It is not just the locals who are, according to Hajdu, finding the sheer crush of cyclists in Copenhagen an ordeal. &quot;I went on a cycling trip around Copenhagen with a friend visiting from London recently, and she was terrified by the mass of cyclists and the aggressive way they behaved,&quot; said Hadju. &quot;She found them so overwhelming that she burst into tears. She was too scared to get back on her bike. We had to put it in a taxi and drive back home.&quot; As numbers increase in the cycle lanes, says Hadju, so behaviour deteriorates, with jostling and cutting-up becoming more frequent. &quot;The locals rush past the foreigners, who are often uncertain on their bikes and going slowly,&quot; she said. &quot;The locals get impatient and therefore become more threatening.&quot; Even to an untrained eye, it is immediately obvious that the city is struggling to cater for its growing number of cyclists. It is already near-impossible to find cycling parking places near main stations, while cycling lanes that seem gargantuan to British eyes \u2013 three to four meters wide compared to our 1.5 meters \u2013 are buried at certain times of day beneath the scrum of cyclists traversing the city. So what happens when the critical mass of cyclists grows faster than the government can improve their uban environment? Frits Bredal, of the Danish Cyclists&apos; Federation acknowledges that the number of serious traffic accidents involving cyclists in Copenhagen has reduced dramatically in the last few years and that the numbers of cyclists killed is at a historic low. But he fears a turnaround in the statistics: &quot;In rush hour, there are enormous numbers of cyclists fighting for space on Copenhagen&apos;s bike paths, which become cramped and packed.  &quot;As numbers grow and they fight for space, cyclists are becoming more aggressive and reckless in traffic. I increasingly see people bringing themselves and others into dangerous situations,&quot; he adds. &quot;They break the laws and use their bikes in completely reckless ways.&quot; The knock-on effect of such behaviour is, Bredal says, damaging the cause of campaigners trying to persuade the government to increase the width and number of cycle paths, and introduce multi-storey bike parking facilities. &quot;Their behaviour means that the politicians say, which is fair enough, that before they give the city more bike paths, we have a job for ourselves to get the cyclists we already have, to behave,&quot; he says. Others, however, are frustrated by such claims. MikaelColville-Andersen, Denmark&apos;s unofficial ambassador for cycling thanks to his Copenhagenize and Copenhagen Cycle Chic blogs) even fears they could undermine the pro-cycling atmosphere in Copenhagen that he and so many others have worked hard to create. &quot;It&apos;s true that cycling in Copenhagen in the rush hour is not for the faint-hearted: it requires concentration and it&apos;s true that we do need wider lanes,&quot; he says.&quot;But it&apos;s not as dangerous as the DCF like to say. Statistics provethat it&apos;s safer than Amsterdam.&quot;. &quot;The Danish Cyclists&apos; Federation are trying to advocate for more and better bike lanes by saying it&apos;s dangerous to cycle with the situation as it now is,&quot; he adds. &quot;But by telling people that cycling is dangerous, they&apos;re shooting themselves in the foot. They need to think about encouraging urban cycling as being a product, like any other, that you want to sell. That means you need to emphasise its positive aspects.  &quot;We should make urban cycling positive like we do every other product we want to encourage people to buy,&quot; he says, pointing towards research by the European Cyclists&apos; Federation. This says:  There are a number of examples of cities, where a substantial increase in bicycle use has been associated with a decrease in the number of cycling accidents. In the positive health impact from the physical exercise is taken into account, cycling will in any case be beneficial for the user.

Not only her groceries, but DVDs, games and anything else she can get through the supermarket. She&apos;s made her husband take out a Lloyds credit card, and buys all her petrol at Shell. The reason? So she can collect the Airmiles for a once-in-a-lifetime family holiday in Florida planned for 2013. Gabrielle is similar. So far she&apos;s collected 7,000 miles and is not far short of the total needed to take her 18-year-old daughter to New York. But both are now furious that their plans have been left on the runway after Airmiles this week said it was stopping its current scheme, relaunching as Avios. It will charge Carolynne and Gabrielle \u00a3300 a head or more for what used to be free flights across the Atlantic. &quot;I am sooooo upset \u2013 it&apos;s taken away our dream,&quot; says Gabrielle. She&apos;s joined a growing backlash that has already sparked a Facebook campaign and a protest website called Fight the Airmiles Change. Scores of disappointed Airmiles customers have vented their rage on Facebook, with Carolynne&apos;s response typical. &quot;Because I will now have to pay the taxes, it will cost me at least the same as buying flights directly with [another] airline. Surely we should be given at least a year to collect the Airmiles we need at the present rate. I really feel cheated and would never have bothered if I knew this was going to happen,&quot; she says. Airmiles relaunches as Avios on 16\u00a0November, and will merge with the separate loyalty programmes run by British Airways Executive Club (BA Miles) and Iberia (Iberia Plus). Emails and letters currently going out to the 2.2m members of the Airmiles scheme talk of &quot;exciting new benefits&quot;. Customers will enjoy new flexibility when booking, while flyers from UK regional airports will no longer be charged extra miles if they have to connect through London. A new &quot;zone&quot; map will make destinations such as Berlin and Prague more accessible to those who have saved a limited number of points. But the change that has enraged many customers is that they will now have pay in cash for the &quot;taxes, fees and charges&quot; that airlines add on to the basic cost of a flight, and which in some cases is equal to three-quarters of the total cost. For example, the cheapest flight from London to New York on BA in mid-November is around \u00a3400. Under Airmiles, customers needed to save up 5,000 miles for a free return flight. Under Avios, they will have to save up slightly fewer \u2013 but will have to pay the \u00a3301 a head that BA levies in taxes, fees and charges. Overnight, the value of Airmiles used on a New York flight has fallen from \u00a3400 to \u00a3100 \u2013 prompting many customers to complain they have been &quot;robbed&quot;. Airmiles managing director Andrew Swaffield says it had no choice but to start charging. &quot;I do understand fully that this increase is unwelcome, and in a perfect world we would not want to do it. But taxes, fees and charges have risen by as much as 50% -112% over the last two years alone. For example, the UK government now charges air passenger duty of \u00a3340 for a family of four travelling to Australia. France charges \u00a315. We are not in control of these sorts of costs, and are unable to continue to subsidise that level of taxes, fees and charges.&quot; Within Europe, Airmiles has capped the maximum fee passengers will pay at \u00a327 per return flight. Swaffield adds that only a small percentage of Airmiles customers buy long-haul flights with their miles, with 87% going to Europe. Paris is the top destination, followed by Rome. From November, existing Airmiles will be swapped for new Avios rewards on a 10-to-one basis. So if you have saved up, say, 1,500 Airmiles, they will be exchanged for 15,000 Avios points. Generally speaking, the amount of points you need to redeem to get to your destination has gone up 10 times as well, although some cities have become &quot;cheaper&quot; to get to, others more expensive. The old &quot;zone 1&quot;, which needed 750 miles for a flight, extended only to the UK and Ireland, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. Under Avios, it widens to include Berlin and Prague. But the catch is that on top of the \u00a327 fee, customers will have to collect 9,000 Avios miles \u2013 equal to 900 Airmiles. What&apos;s more, if the flight is not on BA or Iberia, the customer has to pay in full the taxes, fees and charges, which could add up to \u00a3100 or more. Brian Caruana from Perthshire is one of the campaigners who helped launch the fighttheairmileschange.co.uk website. He collects around 7,000-8,000 Airmiles a year, and is incensed that as recently as this month he has been sent promotional material by Airmiles encouraging him to pay cash to top up his total. &quot;I feel robbed,&quot; he says. &quot;Can&apos;t they just freeze the entitlements that people have saved up? Or offer a better rate of exchange to Avios points? Or extend the period in which we can redeem flights without having to pay taxes, fees and charges? You can see why so many people will be saying Adios to Avios.&quot; On the site, angry customers allege that Airmiles is in breach of contract for selling miles for cash that will now be devalued. Others believe the change falls foul of the unfair terms in contracts regulations. This week Caruana emailed the head of every company that partners Airmiles, including Tesco, Shell, Lloyds, John Lewis, Avis, eBay and Play.com \u2013 to urge them to put pressure on Airmiles to reconsider. Lloyds told Money it was aware that some of its credit card customers are disgruntled by aspects of the change, but that it stands by the\u00a0deal. Airmiles customers will now have until 14 November (booking online) or 15 December (booking by phone) to redeem their Airmiles without having to pay taxes, fees and charges. So long as customers book by then, they will be able to choose a free flight up to December 2012. Expect many of the best seats and destinations to book up fast as customers flock to unload their miles. If you have 1,500 Airmiles, a couple can still get free flights for a spring weekend in Paris next year. But after November that will cost the equivalent of 1,800 miles plus \u00a354. Book now before the rush \u2026 Pros and cons of the new scheme Cons \u2022 Previously free long-haul flights will cost as much as \u00a3500 in taxes, fees and charges \u2022 Previously free BA and Iberia European flights will carry a \u00a327 fee \u2022 Passengers of all flights not operated by IAG (BA and Iberia) will pay full taxes, fees and charges \u2022 Some popular routes, such as Paris, will require more Airmiles Pros \u2022 70% of routes will require fewer miles \u2022 Flyers will be able to buy one-way flights for first time \u2022 No more supplements for flyers from UK regional airports And what Facebook protesters are saying Ann Bradshaw: I have been collecting Airmiles for years and years. I have a Tesco credit card on which I collect Airmiles and use it to pay for absolutely everything I can. I also shop at Tesco when I can and have it all converted automatically into Airmiles. In July 2011 I had enough miles to fly to Trinidad (6,500 Airmiles) for a holiday so the holiday was completely free after years and years of collecting. I am now told that I will need 50,000 Avios and \u00a3301 to pay in taxes if I want to do the same journey again! I was gob smacked! Goodbye Airmiles \u2013 it is no longer worth my while. I shall collect Nectar points and go to Alton Towers for my holidays instead! Olaf Searson, 28, from Chudleigh, Devon:  I have been collecting Airmiles for a few years. I&apos;m not a big spender, but I managed to save up enough Airmiles by November 2010 to go to Belfast for a long weekend as a birthday treat. I used a little over 2,000 Airmiles for the flight and part payment towards a hotel \u2013 750 of those miles were for the flight from Exeter, which was totally free. Since November 2009 I have converted around \u00a3110 in Tesco Clubcard vouchers alone (by my calculations that&apos;s 11,000 Clubcard points, or at the x2 rate, \u00a35,500 spent in Tesco). I even used Tesco to get four new tyres through Tesco Tyres. The cost was \u00a340 more than the cheapest quote I got, but I thought the benefit of having the extra Clubcard points outweighed the cost saving using the other supplier. I feel cheated by the change. Airmiles have told be it&apos;s &quot;exciting&quot; but I fail to see how. Sure, regional supplements have been reduced. Until you read the small print and see that this is only for flights on BA or Iberia.\u00a0 If I want to take the same flight to Belfast from Exeter, I would have to use more miles (9,000 under the new scheme) and to stump up about \u00a3100 for taxes, surcharges and other charges as Flybe is not a member of IAG group. That&apos;s a flight that previously was free, using fewer miles.\u00a0 I feel that my loyalty and custom to these brands has been for nothing.\u00a0", "sentences": ["The old &quot;zone 1&quot;, which needed 750 miles for a flight, extended only to the UK and Ireland, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels."], "title": "Angry flyers says adios to Airmiles", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/09/angry-flyers-airmiles-avios", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Money", "Travel", "Airline industry", "Travel & leisure", "British Airways", "Iberia", "Business", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-09T23:07:00Z", "article": "The World We Live In, Leigh The Turnpike Gallery celebrates its 40th anniversary with a show of works on loan from the Arts Council Collection, many by artists who have shown at the gallery and most on a theme of urban landscape seemingly relevant to the provincial ambience. Contributions of urban imagery by the likes of George Shaw and Cornelia Parker bring the story up to date, but it&apos;s the old hands who make magic out of the mundane, with Frank Auerbach&apos;s Euston Steps a coagulated mass of painterly impasto and the local all-time master LS Lowry represented by a gem of a painting, depicting a park surrounded like a cultural oasis by the looming chimneys of factories. Turnpike Gallery, to 5 Nov Robert Clark Yang Fudong, London Yang Fudong is a supreme stylist. It makes sense that he first learned about cinema, not from movies \u2013 which were restricted in China in the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 but from books. What his film installations forsake in narrative pep, they make up for in perfectly composed imagery and a heady atmosphere of yearning. The people in his work typically attempt to navigate changing urban and rural worlds, while taking romantic false steps through jarring scenarios. This show premieres a new work alongside his recent Fifth Night from 2010. Here, a stagey street scene is experienced from seven different angles with seven screen projections simultaneously closing in on its players&apos; emotional nuances. Parasol Unit, N1, Tue to 6 Nov Skye Sherwin Mike Kelley, London Mike Kelley&apos;s latest show is sure to tap your inner nerd. The LA-based artist is obsessed with Superman mythology, specifically the bit where our hero discovers that an entire city, Kandor, from his home planet, Krypton, has been miniaturised and preserved in a bell jar, which he then stores in his Arctic hideout, The Fortress Of Solitude. Kelley&apos;s celebrated 3D realisations of the various Kandors depicted by DC Comics&apos; illustrators, are like intricate jellies beneath their hand-blown bell jars. For his latest work he turns to the Fortress itself, realising Superman&apos;s hideaway as a rocky bunker. His grim, dark cave, concealing a tiny, rose-hued metropolis, speaks of memory&apos;s distortions and the past&apos;s grip. Gagosian Britannia Street, WC1, to 22 Oct Skye Sherwin Roni Horn, London Roni Horn&apos;s work is famous for its austerity. Her interests, though, are more poetic and personal than her crisply minimalist creations might suggest. It&apos;s all about identity, but even her photographs of people are not portraits in the obvious sense. Take her famed You Are The Weather, 100 head shots of a woman bathing in Icelandic pools where the weather is written in her face. Horn has now recreated this work with the same model posed in those hot springs some 15 years on. You might say that it&apos;s as much about us as her: what we see in her expressions and her eyes. New, gem-like glass sculptures and large-scale abstract drawings complete the show. Hauser &amp; Wirth Savile Row, W1, to 22 Oct Skye Sherwin Gary Rough, Glasgow Gary Rough&apos;s mixed-media art is deceptively spontaneous. His cut-out texts and scrawled intimacies resemble less the tired mannerisms of urban tagging than the erotic reveries once etched into toilet walls or the heartfelt romanticisms carved into tree bark. His art is one of collaged and doodled mischief, as disarmingly honest as it tends to be apparently irreverent, but it&apos;s all painstakingly presented. Rough draws us in with his aesthetic daftness, then twists the emotional screw. It&apos;s funny, touching stuff. Sorcha Dallas, to 7 Oct Robert Clark Concept As Concrete Form, Derby A modest yet wide-ranging survey of concrete poetry, celebrating the role over the last 60 years of Eugen Gomringer. Concerned with the physical presence of texts and how typographical structure can play with or against the content of words, concrete poetry is as much visual art as it is a literary tradition. The concrete poets here, including big names such as Henri Chopin and Dom Sylvester Houedard as well as Gomringer, have reduced texts to an almost primal minimalism. So does the deceptive simplicity displayed add up to innocence or indulgence? Come see. University of Derby School Of Arts, Design And Technology, Tue to 14 Oct Robert Clark Normal Dilworth, Huddersfield The sculptor Norman Dilworth moved to Amsterdam in the early 1980s, anticipating that the abstract formalism of his work would be marginalised by the British arts scene; in Europe his almost playful sculptural aesthetic could be more warmly embraced. So it&apos;s good to see the Wigan-born artist back on home ground. Dilworth&apos;s art holds its own through the finely tuned tension between his use of steel and wood and a spirit of improvisation that allows for unforeseen sculptural twists and turns. Huddersfield Library And Art Gallery, to 27 Nov Robert Clark Richard Woods, Bristol When it comes to skewering design culture mores, Richard Woods is as adept as any Laurence Llewelyn Bowen. His point, however, is that bit sharper than the average home makeover show. Unpicking the wider cultural fantasies and delusions that fuel our taste in wallpaper and bathroom tiles, his latest project tackles the current mania for vintage or retro-styled British decor and the cosy nostalgia of nationalism. Paintings are inspired by mock-Tudor suburbia, with Woods refiguring monochrome timbering as geometric abstractions in union flag patterns. Meanwhile, woodblock prints depict Boy&apos;s Own-types hard at carpentry. As far as the fetish for handicraft and vintage odds and ends goes, Hand Painted Table Leg Sculptures say it all. Meanwhile, his dry stone wall looks decidedly precise and industrially made, ready to be wheeled out of the factory and into a contemporary dream-world of bygone days.

It was an utterly chilling moment. I realised that the amazing, dazzling future that we&apos;d thought we&apos;d been building not only for us but our two little girls, Polly and Sophie, had become very dark and extremely uncertain. I don&apos;t know if this urge to take chances whatever the possible cost is common to all of us, or if we were unusually reckless. It was part of the spirit of the age \u2013 this was the late 60s, the age of opportunity, when everything was possible \u2013 and we had always agreed that it was better to regret doing something than regret not doing it. Suddenly I would have given anything to have not grabbed at the opportunity, to be working away peacefully at our nice, safe and actually far from boring jobs.  It had seemed such a good idea, a flash of inspiration over breakfast leading to the chance of a lifetime: to launch a fashion and beauty magazine that would sell in Boots the Chemist, rather like Family Circle sold in supermarkets. I happened to know the Boots top brass (I was working as a fashion and beauty journalist); Paul, my husband, was an ad man, not too much like Don Draper, but pretty successful. We were both restless, both very ambitious; we became transformed in our imaginations (before we&apos;d even finished washing up) into publishing tycoons, rich, famous and influential. The fact that we had no money whatsoever or business know-how did not deter us. And so began a great adventure. We won, against all the odds, a contract with Boots; they would put no money into it (hey, that didn&apos;t matter!) but they would distribute it and display and promote it; that alone was worth zillions. We sold our nice Victorian house and bought a modern box on a\u00a095% mortgage (you could do that sort of thing in those days) to finance the operation. We put two reconditioned electric typewriters into the spare room and hired a secretary.  We had a launch date: September 1972. For someone used to the pampered, privileged life of the fashion magazine journalist, having to sell advertising space was a brutal baptism \u2013 I would be kept waiting for hours then shown the door in minutes. One day I lost my voice, but refused to cancel the appointment and conducted my sales pitch in a hoarse whisper, hissing into the media-buyer&apos;s ear. The rest of his office sniggered, clearly thinking I\u00a0was trying to impress him with my feminine wiles. I wish. I came home and cried quite often. But once I sold a page to Revlon, everything changed. I had only to say: &quot;Revlon has taken space&quot; and the big names followed suit, an avalanche of glossy full-colour cosmetic ads. (I still can&apos;t see the name Revlon without a rush of gratitude.)  We got a lot of publicity; we were high on excitement, working 18-hour days \u2013 nothing, we felt, could stop us. But we still didn&apos;t have the money we needed to actually get the magazine printed and on sale; various investors were nibbling, but there was always some stumbling block, mostly about the share in the action they wanted. Arrogant, over-confident, we refused to give much of it away. We took out another charge on our house and tried not to think about it. It would be all paid off, we told ourselves; when the magazine was selling in its hundreds of thousands, they&apos;d all be sorry.  With the launch just weeks away, we finally found some people who agreed to give us what we needed for a 20% share; we cracked open the champagne. We&apos;d known it would happen; someone would see the amazing opportunity we could offer them. They were based in Amsterdam; they flew us over for meetings and we felt important: tycoony, successors to William Randolph Hearst.  There were two big bills to be paid; Boots had stipulated at least one burst of television advertising, and the magazine was due to be printed the next weekend. The cost was going to be \u00a3200,000, a massive amount of money now, unimaginable then. (To put it in context, our over-borrowed-on house was worth \u00a320,000.) That\u00a0was fine, we said carelessly, the backers would look after it.  And then \u2013 with the commercial in the can and 200,000 copies lying in the warehouse, the backers reneged on everything. They wanted 60%, they wanted complete editorial control, they wanted blood. Clearly they&apos;d seen us coming and had waited until they could close the trap. I can still hear our solicitor saying: &quot;That&apos;s ransomous, Mr X&quot; and see Mr X shrugging. The stairway to paradise we&apos;d been building was crumbling fast. You think you don&apos;t have much in life \u2013 an ordinary little house, two very standard cars, some assorted bits of furniture \u2013 and then you imagine having none of it, and no money to replace it, and the gaping hole is vast indeed. Our lawyers were insistent: &quot;You can&apos;t give up now.&quot; They knew some merchant bankers who were interested; they&apos;d get back to us.  But time was running out; we had a\u00a0week, maximum, to close the deal. An impossible task. Board meetings were set up and cancelled and then set up again; phone calls were not returned; a key figure got flu \u2013 I\u00a0would have nursed him myself if it would have helped. A cousin who was a high-street bank manager risked his entire career and loaned us the money for one week. I signed the piece of paper knowing full well we probably wouldn&apos;t be able to pay it back.  I&apos;ll never know how we got through that appalling week. We went through the motions of ordinary life, went to\u00a0bed (and didn&apos;t sleep), got up (and didn&apos;t eat breakfast \u2013 I\u00a0lost almost a\u00a0stone); we tore to the phone when it rang (it was never the bankers), assured everyone who inquired that the magazine would be on the bookstalls that weekend, told my parents \u2013 who remain convinced that I\u00a0am an incompetent, small child \u2013 that everything was fine. When I took the children to school I wondered if we would soon be holding playdates on the pavement. As I smiled and nodded to the other mothers I would have given all I had (a typewriter and a bed at best) to be one of them, concerned only with entry exams and coaching and the casting of the nativity play. I even agreed to run the book stall at the autumn fayre (but was a\u00a0bankrupt a fitting person for such a\u00a0task; might I be running off with the profits?) And through it all, a\u00a0stifling, claustrophobic panic.  At the end of that week, still without finance, Looking Good was rolled out across the country. On Saturday morning I said we had to go into Kingston, our nearest town, and see how it was doing; the children and I put half a dozen marked-down economy items into a Sainsbury&apos;s trolley while Paul went into Boots. He came back, his face greyish green. It wasn&apos;t on display; he couldn&apos;t see it anywhere. He hadn&apos;t even asked the manager, hadn&apos;t had the heart.&quot;You must,&quot; I said. We put even the economy items back. &quot;Daddy&apos;s crying, look,&quot; Polly said when he returned. I put my arms round him, in the middle of Sainsbury&apos;s. &quot;Never mind,&quot; I said, &quot;we&apos;ll manage\u2026&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;it&apos;s all right. They&apos;ve all gone. It&apos;s a sell-out.&quot; It was, and not just in Kingston. We piled the trolley high with steak and champagne and favourite biscuits and out-of-season fruit. Paul was right, and the money men were fighting over us. We had three offers in a week. For a year or so we continued to do very well. But I never got over it, the terror and the shock, and it has left me terminally cautious; when sales dropped off, I was relieved when the backers said enough was enough and Looking Good folded. It was an amazing achievement, and I&apos;m glad we did it. But tycoonery was not for me. I returned gratefully to the freelance life and had two more babies instead.

Hundreds of Iranians in and outside the country have joined a Facebook page, called &quot;we are everywhere&quot;, which encourages members to share their personal stories online.

By 2014, governments around the EU will be expected to amend their copyright laws to put the modifed directive 2006/116/EC into effect, along with provisions designed to improve the lot of musicians that include a fund for session musicians who signed away their rights when a recording was made to be paid for by record labels. Performers will also be allowed to renegotiate contracts with record labels after 50 years or to ask for rights to be returned to them if the recording is not available. Which copyright are you after? Under current EU laws recorded musical performances are protected for a maximum of 50 years, during which period the performers can control the distribution of their work and may receive an income. The composer also gets copyright in the work, and the record company usually has a &quot;recording right&quot; that stops anyone else making a recording of the performance. The sound recording copyright has been extended to 70 years. The original proposal was to make it 95 years to harmonise with the situation in the US, making the new deal a &quot;compromise&quot;. Will it do any good? Many well-known musicians and the heavyweight lobbyists for the new law claim it will benefit musicians, the industry and the wider economy by allowing them to earn money from their work, providing session musicians and others with a pension in their old age. However, the potential economic impact is far from certain, and in 2009 the European commission ignored two studies carried out by the University of Amsterdam&apos;s Institute for Information Law that argued against extension, prompting Professor Bernt Hugenholtz to accuse it of &quot;wilfully ignoring scientific analysis and evidence&quot; in its policy-making. What happens next? Nobody really knows what will happen. The problem with changing laws in response to lobbying from famous musicians instead of evaluating the evidence is that the outcome is completely uncertain. What we can be sure of is that many recordings of no real economic value but potential historic significance will be locked away for another 20 years and those who might have been inspired to make it available non-commercially will be deterred; those who might have used it to inspire their own creative expression will find themselves blocked, and the public domain will be further diminished.

It&apos;s a fixture that evokes the faded glamour of the old European Cup, thanks to a couple of meetings in the 1960s. In the first, George Best brought Beatlemania to football with a performance of stunning audacity; in the second, at Wembley in 1968, United reached the promised land by becoming the first English team to win the European Cup. There will be no such excitement tonight, not even if the game ends 14-14 and Sir Alex Ferguson comes out for the second half dressed in a jaunty lycra all-in-one, although it is still the heavyweight clash of a fairly weak group that also includes Basle and Galati. Not that these two sides come together as equals. Benfica have only reached the Champions League knockout stages once since 1994-95; United have only been eliminated in the group stages once since 1994-95. Both instances occurred in 2005-06, when Benfica put United out with a 2-1 win in the final group game, with Phil Brown&apos;s Geovanni scoring one of the goals. Many people felt that Ferguson was finished. In fact he was just starting on his third great United side, the first to achieve sustained success in Europe. In five seasons since that Benfica defeat they have reached three finals, a semi-final and a quarter-final. The road to Munich, where next May&apos;s final will be played, starts here.  Team news United make eight changes from the team that defenestrated Bolton on Saturday. David De Gea is omitted amid fears that he can&apos;t handle a dry, still night in Lisbon. Rumours that Dimitar Berbatov accidentally stubbed a pencil-thin cigarette in the eye of Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s favourite cat, killing him instantly, are unconfirmed. Benfica (4-3-3) Artur; Maxi Pereira, Luisao, Garay, Emerson; Ruben Amorim, Javi Garcia, Witsel; Aimar, Cardozo, Gaitan.Substitutes Eduardo, Bruno Cesar, Nolito, Rodrigo, Matic, Saviola, Jardel. Manchester United (4-3-3) Lindegaard; Fabio, Smalling, Evans, Evra; Fletcher, Carrick, Giggs; Valencia, Rooney, Park.Substitutes De Gea, Jones, Owen, Anderson, Berbatov, Hernandez, Nani.  Nobody effs with the Jesus Benfica&apos;s manager is called Jorge Jesus, which is as good a reason as any to link to this.  You don&apos;t have to be Father Jack Hackett to appreciate the value of ladies playing football. Especially when they are doing it for a good cause. Eleanor Ward is part The Sonics, who are doing just that next Tuesday. If you&apos;re feeling generous/pervy you can donate here.  A question Last night, while having one of my five-a-day, I found out that Hoegaarden is actually pronounced Who-gar-den. So now, when I order it, do I ask for Hoegaarden or Whogarden? The former is incorrect, the latter makes you sound like a diabolical snob. What&apos;s a pedantic alcoholic to do?  Prediction Benfica 2-1 United.  1 min There is a storming atmosphere in the Stadium of Light. Benfica kick off from left to right. They are in red; United are in blue-and-black hoops.  2 min &quot;I can totally sympathise with your predicament: since living in Germany and learning the language I have a similar problem in the UK with L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,&quot; says Adam Lord. &quot;Do I say Low-en-brow, which is just wrong, or the proper word Loer-ven-broi - which as you said sounds snobbish!?! Would also be grateful for any tips that other OBOers can come up with!&quot; Watch those exclamation marks, kid.  3 min United&apos;s formation is more of a 4-2-3-1 than a 4-3-3, with Giggs playing behind Rooney. Benfica looks more like a 4-2-3-1 as well, with Aimar behind Cardozo. So apart from getting both formations wrong, I&apos;m flying.  4 min A quiet start. United are good at silencing a home crowd in Europe, although it will take them a while to do that tonight. Valencia skins Emerson thrillingly down the right before chipping over a cross that is claimed by the diving Artur.  5 min &quot;Go for the correct pronunciation,&quot; says Rai Skrupskis. &quot;At least you&apos;ll sound like a sophisticated, educated alcoholic.&quot;  8 min A neat one-two between Gaitan and Cardozo ends with Smalling conceding the first corner of the game, on the left-hand side. It&apos;s taken by whatever happened to Pablo Aimar, and claimed by Lindegaard.  9 min Valencia spanks high and wide at the near post from a prohibitive angle. His absolute shocker in last year&apos;s final was one of the more inexplicable occurrences of the 2010-11 season.  10 min &quot;Not touched a drop myself in four years (after a trip to The Priory) but: surely &quot;pedantic alcoholic&quot; is an oxymoron?&quot; hics Ryan Dunne. &quot;Someone so fastidious that they care about the correct pronunciation of their booze is surely a long way off the Own Brand Vodka with Windowlene Chaser indignities of genuine alcoholism (although, for the record, I pronounced it &quot;Ho Garden&quot;, which sounds like something an outdoorsy gangsta rapper might have).&quot;  12 min Nothing much has happened so far. United generally like to play cagily away from home in Europe and it&apos;s the same tonight. Giggs and Park have swapped, so now Park is playing behind Rooney.  13 min &quot;RE pronunciation,&quot; begins Stuart Steel. &quot;Get a Carling instead, pronounced Car-ling.&quot; A foolproof plan apart from one very, very, very minor detail: it necessitates drinking a pint of Car-ling.  15 min Aimar is starting to influence the game. He sparks an attack that eventually ends with Gaitan thrashing over the bar from 25 yards.  16 min Rooney has been a little isolated. It&apos;s rare these days for him to play as a No9 rather than a No10, and it doesn&apos;t look quite right.  17 min &quot;To be even more potably pedantic, The &quot;G&quot; in Hoegaarden is pronounced as if one is clearing one&apos;s throat after chain smoking a pack of Capstan Full Strength,&quot; says Paul McCormick. &quot;I got this news from a barmaid in Amsterdam, who should know. By the way, do they still make Capstan Full Strength?&quot;  18 min Maxi Pereira&apos;s bobbling cross from the right is miscontrolled by Cardozo, but it falls nicely for Gaitan, charging onto the ball at the edge of the box. He thrashes a first-time half volley that flies just wide of the far post.  20 min This game is pretty boring.  21 min Evans does well to cut out a sly through ball from Aimar, and the ball runs loose to Cardozo, 20 yards from goal. He sweeps it towards goal with his right foot, and Lindegaard plunges to his right to make an ultimately comfortable save.  22 min United&apos;s lack of match fitness (more than half the team have not started a league game this season) could be a factor. Benfica do look a little sharper.  23 min &quot;Surely its the Moet thing again,&quot; says Michael Hunt. &quot;You wait till someone else has ordered it for you (always wait till your drink has been ordered), then correct the orderer loudly and watch as the ladies in the bar migrate adoringly towards you, amazed by your education. It hasn&apos;t really worked for me yet, but its quite difficult to mispronounce Fosters.&quot;  GOAL! Benfica 1-0 Manchester United (Cardozo 24) This is a magnificent goal. Gaitan, on the left wing near the halfway line, curved a long angled pass with the outside of his left foot, a glorious pass. Cardozo took it on his chest by the D, dragged the ball past the last defender Evans and then slapped a right-footed shot across Lindegaard and into the far corner. That was such an emphatic goal.  26 min &quot;I was told the correct pronunciation of Hoegaarden involved a throat-clearing noise in the first syllable that should have barstaff ducking for cover to avoid the incoming phlegm-ball, followed by the &apos;g&apos; being pronounced &apos;h&apos;, leading to &apos;I&apos;d like a throaty cough hardon please&apos;, which is unlikely to endear anyone to people behind the counter,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;Or maybe that was a practical joke by those Dutch speakers...&quot;  27 min Rooney is booked for challenging the goalkeeper after the whistle had gone. I&apos;m not sure he heard the whistle, and that seems a bit harsh.  28 min United haven&apos;t got going in attack. They are, in approach and effectiveness, unrecognisable from the side that has charmed the pants off English football in the last month. It&apos;s all very laboured and cautious. In fact, they look like the 2010-11 United.  29 min &quot;Surely it&apos;d be simpler to use hooliganese and simply point and grunt at a beer tap within your field of vision?&quot; says James Tyler. &quot;Failing that, headbutt the barkeep and steal a bottle of Peach Schnapps.&quot;  30 min Rooney heads Fabio&apos;s flat cross over the bar from 15 yards. It was no sort of chance.  31 min Aimar clips an overambitious shot high and wide from 25 yards. Benfica are much the beter side.  32 min Evans gets away with a handball on the edge of his own area.  33 min &quot;Surely the only proper course of action open to you would be to change tipple altogether,&quot; says David Horn. &quot;The twin horns of your dilemma effectively blunted by a simple switch to gin. Nothing says uncomplicated alcoholism like neat gin.&quot;  34 min &quot;You can see now what the new signings + Cleverley have have brought to United watching this game,&quot; says Andy Butler. &quot;This is lethargic team of last year, reckon we&apos;ll see at least two subs at half time.&quot; I think it&apos;s partly that, but also it&apos;s just an intractable mindset United have away from home in Europe \u2013 and one, you have to say, that has been incredibly successful. I&apos;m not a big fan of Rooney up top on his own, though.  36 min Giggs faffs about in midfield, allowing Garcia to break towards the United defence. He has Gaitan in space to the left side of the box, but underhits his pass to such an extent that Valencia can clear for a corner. Eventually Luisao&apos;s volley is blocked for another corner, and that comes to nothing. United have had 62 per cent of the possession, surprisingly, but Benfica have done more with their 38 per cent.  38 min Hernandez for Giggs or Fletcher is the obvious substitution to make at half-time, although I suspect Sir Alex Ferguson will leave it until the hour.  40 min Aimar is booked for a cynical foul on Rooney.  41 min Aimar, booked a minute earlier, has a naive hack at Fletcher from behind. Some referees would have sent him off for that, although in truth there wasn&apos;t that much in it.  GOAL! Benfica 1-1 Manchester United (Giggs 42) Where did that come from? United have been largely hopeless, but Ryan Giggs has equalised with a storming goal. He collected a pass from Valencia, ran into the D and then blasted a beautiful rising drive past Artur with his left foot. Pick that out. Giggs has now scored in 22 consecutive seasons.  44 min Luisao does very well to head an excellent cross from Giggs behind for a corner. Had he not done so, Park would have had a straightforward headed chance.  Half time: Benfica 1-1 Manchester United Two classy goals have embellished a fairly underwhelming game. See you in 10 minutes.  46 min United kick off the second half from left to right.  47 min Nicolas Gaitan was the most eye-catching player of the first half. I had never heard of him before tonight, but you can read more, if not quite all, about him here.  48 min Valencia, put clear on the right side of the box by Rooney, blasts a low cross through the hand of Artur at the near post, and the ball whistles right across the face of goal.  49 min &quot;I don&apos;t believe anyone over the age of 14 would steal a bottle of Peach Schnapps,&quot; says Michael Bertin. &quot;And even then, only from their grandmother&apos;s liquor cabinet.&quot;  50 min United have started the second half with a bit more urgency. They were very sluggish in the first half, particularly in the centre of midfield. Fletcher is nowhere near his best, although that&apos;s to be expected after so long out.  54 min Benfica&apos;s first decent spell of the second half ends with the offside Maxi Pereira smashing a shot that deflects off one post onto the other. Not that it would have counted.  56 min Aimar gets between the lines and rattles a lovely shot just wide from 25 yards. Lindegaard may have had it covered. Benfica make their first substitution, with Nolito replacing Ruben Amorim. Nolito, who came from Barcelona&apos;s B side in the summer, scored in his first five games for the club. He has gone to the left wing, with Gaitan moving to the right.  60 min United are dominating possession, even if they don&apos;t look especially menacing. That said, Evra wins a corner off Luisao. It&apos;s swung away by Giggs and comes to nothing.  61 min Pereira is booked for a cynical pull on Park, who had intercepted an awful pass from Nolito and was moving down the left wing.  63 min A fine one-two between Evra and Park down the left allows the latter to slip a dangerous ball across the face of goal. It&apos;s eventually half cleared to Fletcher, whose shot is smothered.  64 min Giggs almost gets his second. He was found by Rooney on the edge of the box, slither past a couple of defenders and into the box, but then his drilled shot was deflected wide by the legs of the keeper Artur. A good if slightly unwitting save.  65 min Carrick is booked for a cynical foul on Gaitan, with Benfica breaking after a United corner.  66 min A crucial save from Lindegaard keeps the score at 1-1. Benfica broke dangerously through the excellent Gaitan, who got to the edge of the box and then passed the ball firmly across the area, right to left, towards the onrushing Nolito. He tried to pass a first-time effort back whence it came, and Lindegaard got down very smartly to his left to push the ball wide.  68 min Nolito plays a nice through pass for the marauding left-back Emerson, who toebungs an extravagant effort across goal and wide from a tight angle.  69 min An attacking double change from United: Hernandez and Nani on for Fletcher and Valencia. So Giggs will drop into midfield in a 4-4-2 formation.  70 min Gaitan is booked for a scything foul on Evra.  71 min Benfica are playing like the away side, sitting very deep and then bursting out on the counter. Nolito has been dangerous since coming on, and a dangerous through ball towards Cardozo is put behind for a corner by Lindegaard. Nothing comes of it.  74 min A well-struck shot from Gaitan, 25 yards out, is comfortably saved by Lindegaard.  75 min Another Benfica change. Nemanja Matic replaces Pablo Aimar.  77 min Another good save from Lindegaard, who leaps to palm over a nice 20-yard curler from Gaitan. Before the corner, Phil Jones replaces Fabio.  81 min Nani and Hernandez haven&apos;t got into the game yet.  82 min A very deep, booming cross from Jones finds Park, who heads it onto Pereira and away for a corner.  85 min A long period of United possession ends with an endearingly diabolical pass from Nani.  86 min A clever header from Nani allows Jones to surge at the Benfica defence, but he takes one touch too many and that allows Garay to block his shot at the expense of a corner.  87 min Nolito should have won the game for Benfica. He ran infield from the left, into a body of United players. Nani&apos;s sliding tackle inadvertently gave the ball to Matic, who quickly slipped it on for Nolito, and he screwed a tame left-footed shot into the side netting from eight yards before slapping the turf in disgust.  89 min Cardozo tries to chip Lindegaard from just inside the United half. He overhit it wildly, but it was a good idea because Lindegaard was miles off his line.  90 min There will be two minutes of added time.  Full time: Benfica 1-1 Manchester United That&apos;s a good result for United, especially with so many changes to the side. It was a nice enough game, with two very good goals from Oscar Cardozo and Ryan Giggs.

They vowed to &quot;occupy Wall Street&quot; and to &quot;bring justice to the bankers&quot;, but the New York police thwarted their efforts temporarily, locking down the symbolic street with barricades and checkpoints. Undeterred, protesters walked laps around the area before holding a people&apos;s assembly and setting up a semi-permanent protest encampment in a park on Liberty Street, a stone&apos;s throw from Wall Street and a block from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Three hundred spent the night, several hundred reinforcements arrived the next day and as we write this article, the encampment is rolling out sleeping bags once again. When they tweeted to the world that they were hungry, a nearby pizzeria received $2,800 in orders for delivery in a single hour. Emboldened by an outpouring of international solidarity, these American indignados said they&apos;d be there to greet the bankers when the stock market opened on Monday. It looks like, for now, the police don&apos;t think they can stop them.

It all started when Adbusters asked its network of culture jammers to flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens and peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months. The idea caught on immediately on social networks and unaffiliated activists seized the meme and built an open-source organising site. A few days later, a general assembly was held in New York City and 150 people showed up. These activists became the core organisers of the occupation. The mystique of Anonymous pushed the meme into the mainstream media. Their video communique endorsing the action garnered 100,000 views and a warning from the Department of Homeland Security addressed to the nation&apos;s bankers. When, in August, the indignados of Spain sent word that they would be holding a solidarity event in Madrid&apos;s financial district, activists in Milan, Valencia, London, Lisbon, Athens, San Francisco, Madison, Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Israel and beyond vowed to do the same. There is a shared feeling on the streets around the world that the global economy is a Ponzi scheme run by and for Big Finance. People everywhere are waking up to the realisation that there is something fundamentally wrong with a system in which speculative financial transactions add up, each day, to $1.3tn (50 times more than the sum of all the commercial transactions). Meanwhile, according to a United Nations report, &quot;in the 35 countries for which data exist, nearly 40% of jobseekers have been without work for more than one year&quot;. &quot;CEOs, the biggest corporations, and the wealthy are taking too much from our country and I think it&apos;s time for us to take back,&quot; said one activist who joined the protests last Saturday. Jason Ahmadi, who travelled in from Oakland, California explained that &quot;a lot of us feel there is a large crisis in our economy and a lot of it is caused by the folks who do business here&quot;. Bill Steyerd, a Vietnam veteran from Queens, said &quot;it&apos;s a worthy cause because people on Wall Street are blood-sucking warmongers&quot;. There is not just anger. There is also a sense that the standard solutions to the economic crisis proposed by our politicians and mainstream economists \u2013 stimulus, cuts, debt, low interest rates, encouraging consumption \u2013 are false options that will not work. Deeper changes are needed, such as a &quot;Robin Hood&quot; tax on financial transactions; reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act in the US; implementing a ban on high-frequency &quot;flash&quot; trading. The &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks must be broken up, downsized and made to serve the people, the economy and society again. The financial fraudsters responsible for the 2008 meltdown must be brought to justice. Then there is the long-term mother of all solutions: a total rethinking of western consumerism that throws into question how we measure progress. If the current economic woes in Europe and the US spiral into a prolonged global recession, people&apos;s encampments will become a permanent fixtures at financial districts and outside stock markets around the world. Until our demands are met and the global economic regime is fundamentally reformed, our tent cities will keep popping up. Bravo to those courageous souls in the encampment on New York&apos;s Liberty Street.

New technology has brought the image to light for the first time since Goya painted over it, apparently for political reasons. Curators were aware of something beneath the surface of Goya&apos;s powerful 1823 portrait of Don Ram\u00f3n Satu\u00e9, a judge in the supreme court in Madrid, but it was so faint they could not decipher details, let alone the composition. High-intensity x-ray technology developed by Joris Dik of Delft University and Koen Janssens of Antwerp University means that the painting can be seen for the first time in great detail. It is thought to be of a French general or even Joseph Bonaparte, who was briefly king of Spain and brother of Napoleon. Everything from the brushwork to the precise medals worn on the sitter&apos;s uniform can be seen. Dik told the Guardian the technology allowed his team &quot;to visualise&quot; a Goya painting that had not been seen before: &quot;It is exciting.&quot; Scanning macro x-ray fluorescence spectrometry technology \u2013 in which fluorescent x-rays map the picture&apos;s pigments to create a colour image of it \u2013 was first tried out two years ago on a Van Gogh painting. It revealed his previously unknown portrait of a peasant woman, which the artist painted over with the 1887 work Patch of Grass. This time, however, thetechnology has been developed further in a mobile version that can be used in museums on paintings that are too delicate to be moved. The potential for uncovering unknown works of art is enormous as so many artists reused canvases, usually to save money or to conceal an earlier work with which they were dissatisfied. Dik said the medals worn by the sitter can be identified as linked to an order created by Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon&apos;s brother, during his short reign as king of Spain, from 1808 to 1813. The portrait probably dates from between 1809 and 1813. However, having a painting associated with Bonaparte after the Napoleonic forces had withdrawn from Spain would not have gone down well. Dik said: &quot;Goya, we know, managed to survive both political situations \u2013 the transfer of Spain to the French and back to Spain \u2026 After 1820, [such a portrait] could have been dangerous. That&apos;s when we believe the portrait was overpainted with the figure we can see now, as that painting dates from 1823.&quot; It was during the Napoleonic wars that Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) created masterpieces such as his Disasters of War etchings, in which he responded to the occupying French army&apos;s atrocities.", "sentences": ["Beneath a Goya masterpiece, a second, hidden painting by the Spanish painter has been discovered, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has announced."], "title": "X-rays uncover secret painting beneath Goya masterpiece", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/20/xrays-uncover-painting-goya-masterpiece", "tags": ["Francisco de Goya", "Painting", "Art and design", "World news", "Culture", "Art", "Science", "Netherlands", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-20T14:53:04Z", "article": "FOR THE LOVE OF HATE Some things in football should not be judged by their cover. A game with a deceptive scoreline, for example, or one of Gazza&apos;s famous mince pies, which contained a malodorous, freshly produced meat substitute and were devoured by a drunk Jimmy Five Bellies. Other things can be judged by their cover, like a Dirty Leeds v Manchester United match. It doesn&apos;t matter that both teams are likely to rest players for tonight&apos;s Milk Cup match. It wouldn&apos;t matter if Dirty Leeds had a back four of Weird Uncle Fiver, Shergar, JR Hartley and JR Ewing, or if Manchester United had Roy Race, Billy Dane, Eddie Dane and Dane Bowers up front. This is Dirty Leeds v Manchester United, and that means two sets of fans (and, if they get carried along with the mood, players) who are doing it all for the love of hate. It&apos;s arguably the most vicious rivalry in English football, a sanitisation-defier that belongs in the 1970s. The Fiver can&apos;t wait for the vicarious thrill of watching grown men 200 miles away asserting their masculinity through repeated testosterone spillages. &quot;The win at Old Trafford [in the FA Cup in 2010] was obviously up there as a fantastic achievement for everybody concerned,&quot; said Dirty Leeds boss Simon Grayson. &quot;That sight of 9,000 [Dirty] Leeds fans celebrating is something that will stay with me forever. It was a great feeling. Tuesday will be a great occasion too.&quot; Since 1994, the Milk Cup has been a way for Manchester United to introduce the next generation of medal-botherers. But while the obscenely gifted Paul Pogba should make his United debut tonight, for the most part their team will comprise the most expensive set of ageing stand-ins since the Fiver took a wrong turn in Amsterdam. &quot;The manager might roll out the old boys,&quot; said Michael Carrick, as shocked hacks laughed sycophantically, only for one to inadvertently cough up a moist mound of sausage meat into a PR flunky&apos;s phizog, with the poor flunky&apos;s not inconsiderable misery exacerbated further when a rumour went round that Gazza was guesting as the club chef. &quot;We&apos;re looking forward to going there,&quot; added Carrick. &quot;I&apos;m guessing it will be a full house. It will be a nice hot atmosphere.&quot; Ryan Giggs is expected to play, 20 years to the week since he made his first Milk Cup appearance, scoring against Cambridge. That was the season Dirty Leeds pipped United to the title. Tonight won&apos;t quite reach that intensity, but you still can guarantee a proper grudge match. QUOTE OF THE DAY 19 September: &quot;We have a game against Stuttgart on Friday and Michael Oenning will be sitting with me and the team in the plane on the way to Stuttgart and on the way back again&quot; \u2013 Hamburg director of sport Frank Arnesen responds to speculation over the manager&apos;s job. 20 September: &quot;As of today we will start the search for his replacement&quot; \u2013 Arnesen reveals he won&apos;t be flying with Oenning after all. CRISIS? Len Shackleton&apos;s autobiography famously contained a chapter entitled &apos;What the Average Director knows about Football&apos; followed by a blank page. Were he around today, however, Shackleton would surely praise the savviness of the Arsenal suits. Not simply because the people&apos;s game is obviously foremost in the minds of Sir Chips Keswick and Lord Harris of Peckham, but because the club&apos;s chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, today gave a textbook demonstration of how to tackle issues head-on, presumably in the hope that Johan Djourou and Laurent Koscielny will take note. Responding to suggestions that the club should react to a dismal run of performances by sacking manager Arsene Wenger, Gazidis showed the qualities for which great Arsenal defenders of the past were renowned, and firmly hoofed the matter to touch. &quot;[The criticism of Wenger] is part of this black and white perception: that you&apos;re either flying high or a broken failure,&quot; declared Gazidis, possibly with one arm in the air in an appeal for offside. &quot;He didn&apos;t suddenly become a bad manager. To have him portrayed as some kind of idiot who is out of touch is profoundly damaging, not simply for Arsenal nor particularly for Arsene, but for football. It&apos;s nonsense based on the need to always create a mini-crisis \u2026 we are incredibly fortunate to have a manager who has a vision of what the game can be. To have a manager that thinks about the future is relatively rare.&quot; Gazidis decried the &quot;short-termism&quot; that often leads clubs to change manager and pooh-poohed claims that Wenger is so disenchanted by the criticism that he is contemplating quitting, explaining the manager is working on ways to overcome the blip. &quot;He remains passionately engaged \u2026 the potential is very high at the club but self-inflicted problems have prevented us from achieving that potential. We have to correct that \u2013 that is the frustration that Arsene is wrestling with.&quot; Gazidis was adamant that the club will not attempt to spend its way out of trouble but will instead continue trying to build teams on the basis of youngsters. The recent purchases of Mikel Arteta, Per Mertesacker and Yossi Benayoun were mere &quot;tactical adjustments \u2026 not a change of strategy&quot;. Gazidis said that even though Arsenal are in a &quot;very healthy&quot; financial position, the club wants to continue running a &quot;sustainable&quot; financial policy and, as such, it would be folly to attempt to compete for players with the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea. &quot;The idea that Arsenal could get involved in that competition without other clubs jumping in and pushing the prices up is a little bit naive. Beyond that, if we go in and spend an increased amount of players, we&apos;re becoming part of the problem rather than part of the solution.&quot; Most sensible people have to agree that operating within your means is a sound policy. What few people understand, however, is why running a tight financial ship has to mean having a shambolic defence. \u2022 Follow Dirty Leeds 1-2 Manchester United with our live MBM from 7.45pm.

BITS AND BOBS The Turkish Football Federation has imposed harsh and draconian punishments on teams whose fans misbehave in a severe effort to clamp down on crowd disturbances: the clubs now face the horrifying prospect of playing games solely in front of women and children. &quot;After this decision, which is a first in world football, there will be no silent and unexciting games played without spectators. That change will make teams remember the beauty and values of football,&quot; barked the enlightened TFF. Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has complained to referees&apos; chief Mike Riley about the linesman&apos;s performance during his side&apos;s defeat to Manchester United. &quot;Very, very unhappy with a poor performance from the referees and I don&apos;t take it very, very lightly. We all feel very, very down,&quot; he said very, very repetitively. Bayern Munich defender Breno is recovering from smoke inhalation in hospital after his house burned down. &quot;He was shocked, but he is well again,&quot; said sporting director Christian Nerlinger. Scans have shown Javier Hernandez has escaped with little more than a bump after he assaulted Ashley Cole&apos;s studs with his shin. After manager Mick McCarthy employed a variation of the &apos;not that kind of player&apos; defence following Joey Barton&apos;s comments that Karl Henry is always &quot;trying to hurt people&quot;, the Wolves midfielder has called for his team to &quot;make it ugly&quot; against Millwall in the Rumbelows Cup tonight. And AFC Wimbledon have blamed a trespasser for setting off a sprinkler which caused a 12-inch hole in the centre of the Kingsmeadow pitch they share with Kingstonian. A hole in the ground? With Wimbledon? The Fiver&apos;s money is on Uncle Bulgaria. STILL WANT MORE? After he failed to read a column written in the 3 October 1925 edition of the Southampton Echo, Jonathan Wilson&apos;s tactics manual Inverting The Pyramid has been blown out of the water by the discovery that the W-M formation may not have been invented by Herbert Chapman.

But in the latest in a long line of increasingly controversial storylines, Carla has been raped by the curiously expressionless Frank after calling off their engagement. Carla has had a rough time of it since joining the Street: following her husband&apos;s death, her beloved Liam was murdered, she was held hostage by evil Tony Gordon and, just the other week, she drunkenly crashed her car into the bookies. But Corrie&apos;s attempts to do &quot;gritty&quot; have met with some concern from fans \u2013 and producer Phil Collinson recently vowed to reduce crime levels (this hasn&apos;t been entirely successful). But Carla&apos;s is not the first controversial storyline Hayley, the first transsexual person in a British soap In 1998, the Street introduced the first transsexual person in British soap history, when Hayley and her red anorak joined Corrie prior to her op in Amsterdam. Initially, she got a rough ride from the transsexual community, who felt that a transsexual actress should have been given the role. But she won them over, highlighting transgender issues \u2013 for tax purposes she remained registered as a man called &quot;Harold&quot;, for instance, leading to ridicule from her boss, Mike Baldwin. &quot;When you look at me, do you see a woman?&quot; she would ask Roy, putting him on the spot somewhat. But they were married in a ceremony in Roy&apos;s Rolls in 1999 and have proved one of the more stable Street couples, living in their bubble of Horlicks, dressing gowns and trainspotting. Deirdre Rachid jailed The Barlows have never been strangers to prison food. On the 29 March 1998, Deirdre was sent to prison after former lover Jon Lindsay implicated her in a bank-fraud scheme. She had fallen for the bogus airline pilot, who really worked at Tie Rack and was already married. The nation was appalled that Deirdre had to share a cell with horrible old lag Jackie Dobbs, played by Margi Clarke. A campaign with the slogan &quot;Free the Weatherfield One!&quot;, led by the tabloids, petitioned the home secretary to intervene on Deirdre&apos;s behalf. Tony Blair, demonstrating his hunger for publicity called for Deirdre to be freed. William Hague, not to be left out, declared: &quot;The nation is deeply concerned about Deirdre \u2013 Conservatives as much as anyone else.&quot; . After three weeks, Deirdre was released from prison and four different newspapers claimed victory. Amusingly, Invicta radio launched a campaign to keep Deirdre in jail for at least 18 months. Illegal immigration and cheap labour In Spring 2007, Coronation Street began broadcasting one of its most politically sensitive plots, with a storyline about illegal immigration. The Connors were running Underworld, cutting every corner they could to make a profit, and decided to hire Polish workers for the night shift. When Kasia collapsed while loading dungarees into Carla&apos;s car, fellow Polish worker Vicki attempted to resuscitate her. Carla, meanwhile called Paul (and not an ambulance). His response? Ring the emergency services after 8am, when Kasia could have been clocked in and working legally. A cunning plan \u2013 but they weren&apos;t reckoning on keen investigative minds such as Sally Webster&apos;s. To keep her quiet, Paul appoints her as his PA. Genius. Tony Gordon&apos;s escape from prison and the gun siege in Underworld In early June last year, Coronation Street bosses scheduled an episode of the soap each night for a week, following Tony Gordon&apos;s escape from prison with the help of his former cellmate Robbie. There would be guns, car chases and explosions as Carla, Hayley and (by accident) Maria were held hostage at gunpoint in Underworld. The storyline ended with Tony shooting dead Robbie \u2013 part trainspotter, part psychopath \u2013 before letting Hayley and Maria go and then setting fire to Underworld. Sadly, only Tony perished in the blaze, disappointing viewers who were hoping for a more fruitful purge. Midway through the storyline, real-life gunman Derrick Bird killed 12 people before shooting himself. As a mark of respect to the victims, the remaining episodes were pulled from the rest of the week and rescheduled. Teenage pregnancy Tina O&apos;Brien&apos;s Coronation Street character Sarah Louise Platt shocked her screen family by getting pregnant at 13 \u2013 Gail had put her weight gain down to an eating disorder. Described as a wild child (She sulks! She smokes!), Tina and her burgeoning belly prompted a barrage of &quot;street of shame&quot; headlines and accusations of glamourising gym-slip mothers. Fear not. After Bethany was born, her young mother eked out a lousy existence, watching her schoolmates going out at weekends while she stayed at home with the baby. Then Bethany&apos;s father died in a car crash. A few years later, Sarah gave birth to Billy, who died soon after. His dad, Todd, declared he was gay and they split. Happy days! Ken, Deirdre and Mike In late 1982, bored of her humdrum existence with Ken Barlow, who was busy running a newspaper, Dierdre embarked on an affair with Mike Baldwin, the factory boss. In the ratings-busting episode in which Deirdre confessed all to Ken, she told him that she felt like &quot;the wallpaper, or a piece of furniture that&apos;s been around forever \u2026&quot; In an unscripted move, Ken grabbed Deirdre by the throat and started to strangle her, and actress Anne Kirkbride reacted with genuine shock. Understandably, Deirdre began to have doubts about staying with Mike Baldwin. The writers scheduled the episode in which she ended the relationship and reconciled with Ken for the same night that Manchester United played Arsenal at Old Trafford. At the end of the episode, which aired on February 23, 1983, Deirdre slammed the door in Mike&apos;s face. At half time, the scoreboard at Old Trafford read &quot;Deirdre and Ken United Again!&quot; and &quot;Ken 1, Mike 0&quot; in big letters, to the cheering of fans. The episode was one of the highest rated in Corrie&apos;s history.", "sentences": ["But Carla&apos;s is not the first controversial storyline Hayley, the first transsexual person in a British soap In 1998, the Street introduced the first transsexual person in British soap history, when Hayley and her red anorak joined Corrie prior to her op in Amsterdam."], "title": "Coronation Street's most controversial storylines", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/21/carla-rape-controversial-coronation-street-storyline", "tags": ["Coronation Street", "Television", "Soap opera", "Rape and sexual assault", "Media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-22T08:00:00Z", "article": "It&apos;s nearly 30 years since the word &quot;cyberspace&quot; first appeared in print, in a short story by William Gibson for the July 1982 edition of the now-defunct science fiction magazine Omni. In an interview in this summer&apos;s Paris Review, Gibson describes, not for the first time, how he came up with the word: &quot;The first thing I did was to sit down with a yellow pad and a Sharpie and start scribbling \u2013 infospace, dataspace. I think I got cyberspace on the third try, and I thought, oh, that&apos;s a really weird word. I liked the way it felt in the mouth \u2013 I thought it sounded like it meant something while still being essentially hollow.&quot; The trajectory from Omni to the Paris Review says less about the way Gibson has changed in the intervening years than about the way science fiction has, both in itself and in terms of its status in the wider culture \u2013 in large part thanks to Gibson&apos;s nine novels. The last six of them \u2013 Virtual Light (1993), Idoru (1996), All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties (1999), collectively known as the Bridge trilogy, Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) \u2013 have recently been reissued by Penguin in a new uniform edition. Gibson&apos;s influence is evident in everything from the Matrix movies to Jennifer Egan&apos;s A Visit from the Goon Squad, which won this year&apos;s Pulitzer prize for fiction. Gibson is widely credited with having predicted the rise of the internet, but doesn&apos;t himself have any delusions about his prophetic powers. &quot;The record of futurism in science fiction is actually quite shabby,&quot; he says in the Paris Review. &quot;Novels set in imaginary futures are necessarily about the moment in which they are written. As soon as a work is complete, it will begin to acquire a patina of anachronism.&quot; Cyberspace, as Gibson imagined it nearly 30 years ago, was \u2013 or would be \u2013 a realm of total-immersion virtual reality: when Case, the hero of Neuromancer (1984), applies the dermatrodes of his cyberspace deck to his forehead, powers it up and jacks in to the matrix, his &quot;inner eye&quot; sees a &quot;transparent 3D chessboard extending to infinity&quot;, on which, or in which, is &quot;a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system&quot;. The idea came to him from watching kids playing arcade games \u2013 &quot;it seemed to me that what they wanted was to be inside the games, within the notional space of the machine&quot; \u2013 and an advertisement at a bus stop for Apple computers. &quot;Everyone is going to have one of these, I thought, and everyone is going to want to live inside them. And somehow I knew that the notional space behind all of the computer screens would be one single universe.&quot; In Gibson&apos;s most recent novel, Zero History, a thriller set in the here and now, there&apos;s a scene in which one of the main characters, Milgrim, is sitting in a hotel lobby in London, &quot;trying to grasp Twitter&quot;, which he is supposed to use as a covert and anonymous way of communicating with a US federal agent. &quot;He was registered, now, as GAYDOLPHIN2. No followers, following no one. Whatever that meant. And his updates, whatever those were, were protected.&quot; Milgrim&apos;s confusion is partly down to his being in recovery from a 10-year addiction to prescription tranquillisers, but everyone \u2013 at least, everyone over the age of 12 \u2013 who&apos;s joined Twitter must have had similar feelings the first time they logged on. The confusion aside, the banality of it all is a very long way from jacking in to the matrix through an Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7 deck. &quot;The strongest impacts of an emergent technology are always unanticipated,&quot; Gibson says in the interview. &quot;You can&apos;t know what people are going to do until they get their hands on it and start using it on a daily basis, using it to make a buck and using it for criminal purposes and all the different things that people do.&quot; (Gibson, who tweets as @GreatDismal, came 37th on Time magazine&apos;s list of the 140 best Twitter feeds.) The most striking feature of cyberspace in Neuromancer, however, the most radical way in which it differs from the modern internet, is its textlessness. Case is, or may as well be, illiterate: his skills as a cyberspace &quot;cowboy&quot; don&apos;t depend on being able to read. He wouldn&apos;t get very far as a hacker these days. The internet, as we now know it, even in the era of YouTube and podcasts, is still heavily text-based and text-dependent. Tweeting not only looks about as low-tech as you can get, it&apos;s also all about language. Yet in another sense, Neuromancer&apos;s cyberspace is text-based, or text-generated, because Neuromancer is a novel. One of the attractive contradictions of good science fiction is that its speculations about the technology of the future are recorded and transmitted in a medium that&apos;s been around for centuries, the old technology looking to the new without either deference or condescension. Gibson is as interested in old technology \u2013 the ways it persists, the ways it becomes obsolete, the ways objects outlast their functions \u2013 as he is in the latest gizmo. Zero History&apos;s point of view alternates between Milgrim&apos;s and Hollis Henry&apos;s. Hollis used to be the singer in a band called the Curfew; she&apos;s now a freelance writer. She, like Milgrim, first appeared in Gibson&apos;s previous novel, Spook Country (2007), in which it&apos;s pointed out to her by a Belgian advertising tycoon called Hubertus Bigend that &quot;in the early 1920s \u2026 there were still some people in this country who hadn&apos;t yet heard recorded music \u2026 Your career as a &apos;recording artist&apos; \u2026 took place toward the end of a technological window that lasted less than a hundred years.&quot; It finished, Bigend says, once consumers of recorded music were able to produce it themselves. In Zero History, Hollis and Milgrim visit Paris on assignment for Bigend. He wants to know who&apos;s behind an achingly cool, incredibly hard-to-come-by line of clothing. &quot;Gabriel Hounds&quot; is a &quot;secret brand&quot;: it has no advertising, no marketing, not even a regular supply chain. Every so often there&apos;ll be a small sale at a market in Melbourne or a boutique in Soho, jealously guarded knowledge of which is spread beforehand by word of mouth. It&apos;s hardly surprising that Bigend, as an advertising man, should be curious about a brand that&apos;s simultaneously so invisible and so sought after. But his interest in Gabriel Hounds may also have something to do with another of his projects: he&apos;s thinking about getting involved in supplying the US military with clothing and other kit. And the people whose turf he&apos;s muscling in on aren&apos;t happy about it. Bigend&apos;s firm, Blue Ant (&quot;We aren&apos;t just an advertising agency \u2026 We do brand vision transmission, trend forecasting, vendor management, youth market recon, strategic planning in general&quot;), has bought Hollis a Gabriel Hounds denim jacket, for an exorbitant price, from a dealer in Amsterdam. But bribery isn&apos;t the reason, or not the main reason, that she&apos;s working for him. She also needs the cash, having lost pretty much everything in the credit crunch. Milgrim, too, works for Bigend because he feels he has no choice. He&apos;s been cured of his addiction at an experimental Swiss clinic and given a new set of teeth, all at Bigend&apos;s expense but none of it out of the goodness of his heart: for one thing, he was curious to know if the Swiss clinic&apos;s methods were effective; for another, Milgrim has a remarkable eye for detail, which Bigend finds useful. In return, Bigend looks after Milgrim and keeps him supplied with his rehab medication. Bigend makes a habit of recruiting anyone more than half-interesting who crosses his path. In Pattern Recognition, Cayce has been brought to London to give her opinion on a new logo for the world&apos;s second best-selling brand of running shoes. She has an unusual gift: she is, for want of a better word, allergic to branding; the stronger the brand, the worse her reaction \u2013 the first time she saw the Michelin Man, as a child, she was nearly sick. This makes her invaluable as a marketing consultant. After she gives the new trainer logo the thumbs down, Bigend makes her another, less conventional proposition. Cayce is a fan of &quot;the footage&quot;, an abstract film that&apos;s being uploaded to the internet in short segments, which appear unannounced and at unpredictable intervals in various quiet corners of the web, &quot;somewhere where it&apos;s possible to upload a video file and simply leave it there&quot;. (The novel, set in the late summer of 2002, was published in February 2003, more than two years before the first video was uploaded to YouTube.) Bigend wants Cayce to track down the maker of the footage. Cayce agrees, not least because she&apos;d like to know who&apos;s behind it herself, and sees that with Bigend&apos;s resources she may be able to find out. It&apos;s also, in Cayce&apos;s head at least, complicatedly bound up with the disappearance of her father, a retired spook last seen heading towards downtown Manhattan on 11 September 2001 (the Los Angeles Times recently called Pattern Recognition &quot;the first \u2013 and still, in many ways, the best \u2013 book of fiction to emerge from the tragedy&quot;). But one of the things that Cayce and Bigend both value about the footage, though for very different reasons, is that it has (so far) defied commercial exploitation; Bigend&apos;s involvement will necessarily change that \u2013 he&apos;s late capitalism&apos;s answer to King Midas, though unlike the mythical Phrygian tyrant he&apos;s more than happy with his status. &quot;We&apos;ve arrived at a level of commodification that may have negated the concept of counterculture,&quot; Gibson says in the Paris Review. &quot;Consumers don&apos;t buy products so much as narratives,&quot; Bigend says to Hollis, elaborating on what he means when he talks about &quot;brand vision transmission&quot;. She tells him the idea&apos;s old (which it is, though the rise of the ebook gives it a literal new twist), and he concedes the point. &quot;Once you have a way in which things are done,&quot; he continues, as if this were the line he&apos;d wanted to take all along, &quot;the edge migrates&quot;. In an interview last year, Gibson described Bigend as someone &quot;who presents himself as though he knows what&apos;s going on, but who in fact doesn&apos;t \u2026 he&apos;s bullshitting himself&quot;. Which is clearly true, and the way he talks is a finely judged send-up of vacuous marketing-speak. But at the same time there&apos;s no denying that Bigend is very successful, very rich and very powerful. The &quot;edge&quot; that he&apos;s most interested in is the edge of his own sphere of influence. He seeks out whatever lies just beyond it and finds a way to incorporate it, and in that way his sphere of influence expands. Strictly speaking, Pattern Recognition, Spook Country and Zero History aren&apos;t science fiction: the technology in the novels isn&apos;t speculative but already exists; the world they&apos;re set in is recognisably the world that we live in. Gibson explains that they are &quot;attempts to disprove the distinction or attempts to dissolve the boundary. They are set in a world that meets virtually every criterion of being science fiction, but it happens to be our world \u2026 It has, to my mind, the effect of science fiction.&quot; And, in common with science fiction, the books explore what happens when a trend \u2013 technological, sociological, environmental, political \u2013 is taken to its logical conclusion. If the Sprawl in Neuromancer and its sequels is a fantastical extrapolation of late 20th-century urban development, so Bigend is a fantastical manifestation of some of the mechanisms of late capitalism. He isn&apos;t merely a very successful brand marketing consultant; he&apos;s brand marketing personified. When Cayce first meets him in Pattern Recognition his smile is described as &quot;a version of Tom Cruise with too many teeth, and longer, but still very white&quot;. As supervillains go, he&apos;s disturbingly lacking in malevolence, and chillingly banal. Then there&apos;s the matter of his ridiculous name, which as well as making him sound like a remnant of the 1970s porn industry carries more than a hint of apocalypse. One of his current enthusiasms is the &quot;order flow&quot;: &quot;the aggregate of all the orders in the market. Everything anyone is about to buy or sell, all of it. Stocks, bonds, gold, anything \u2026 If someone were able to aggregate that, the market would cease to be real.&quot; And Bigend, last seen on a giant hovercraft heading for Iceland, may be about to crack it.

The easyGroup tycoon has been at loggerheads with the easyJet board in a row over the carrier&apos;s expansion plans and the rate of return for investors. EasyJet appeared to quell those concerns with the announcement of a \u00a3190m shareholder payout, with Stelios the biggest beneficiary due to the near-38% stake owned by the entrepreneur and his family. The announcement comes weeks before easyJet shareholders, corralled by Stelios, vote at an emergency general meeting on whether to remove Professor Rigas Doganis, an easyJet non-executive director, from the company board. The resolution was brought by Stelios in his battle with easyJet&apos;s board, which centres on the merits of a $4bn (\u00a32.6bn) order signed with Airbus in 2002. Analysts said the dividend payout could rally support among the 62% of the investor base not represented by the airline&apos;s founder and largest shareholder. &quot;We will watch with interest to see if Stelios remains set on forcing an EGM,&quot; said Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. &quot;We think these results and shareholder payments would give management a good platform in any vote of confidence, which such an EGM would effectively be.&quot; However, a shareholder bloc representing about 40% of a company&apos;s equity can have a strong chance in any vote, because small investors and index funds frequently do not vote in AGMs and EGMs, lowering easyJet&apos;s chances of seeing off its founder. Other analysts were less optimistic. &quot;It is a sensible decision by the board and Stelios will be happy. But I am not sure if it will change the rest of the situation,&quot; said Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Panmure. EasyJet&apos;s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said the announcement of a shareholder payout of \u00a3190m early next year was not due to pressure from just one investor. McCall said mounting concerns over the state of the eurozone economy have whetted the investment community&apos;s appetite for dividends, amid an increasingly gloomy outlook for 2012. &quot;Market sentiment has definitely shifted. There is no question that since things got harder in the eurozone shareholders have definitely shifted their emphasis to capital returns,&quot; McCall said. Haji-Ioannou and his family own about 38% of the airline that he founded. The payout comprises an ordinary dividend of \u00a340m, first announced last year, alongside a special dividend of \u00a3150m to make a total return of 44p per share. A lucrative deal over the use of the easyGroup brand, dividend announcements, a paring of winter capacity and strong sales have so far failed to placate Haji-Ioannou. The EGM will be held before the end of next month unless Haji-Ioannou abandons the confrontation. McCall said: &quot;The board did not take the decision lightly to fight the EGM resolution but it believes completely that it can win that.&quot; EasyJet announced the payout as it upgraded profit expectations for the current financial year, ending 30 September, from a pre-tax profit of \u00a3200m-\u00a3230m to between \u00a3240m and \u00a3250m, more than five times the return in 2009. The carrier attributed the profit rise to a &quot;robust&quot; performance on city-to-city routes used by business and short-break travellers, led by London to Amsterdam and Paris to Milan. McCall added that, despite the ongoing uncertainty over the European economy, people still viewed their summer holidays as sacrosanct. &quot;We have found this year that people across Europe protect their summer holiday. It seems a very important thing for people, that they work hard all year and feel they deserve a holiday.&quot; EasyJet&apos;s base is at Luton airport, where the carrier launched in the 1990s, but it is now firmly established as a major European airline with strong positions in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. Nonetheless, its expansion into a powerful player in the short-haul market has angered Stelios, who is concerned that growing to more than 200 aircraft will leave the carrier exposed if the financial crisis causes a collapse in demand.", "sentences": ["The carrier attributed the profit rise to a &quot;robust&quot; performance on city-to-city routes used by business and short-break travellers, led by London to Amsterdam and Paris to Milan."], "title": "Sir Stelios to net windfall from easyJet special dividend", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/22/stelios-windfall-easyjet-special-dividend", "tags": ["easyJet", "Airline industry", "Business", "Investing", "Shares", "UK news", "Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-23T14:11:00Z", "article": "Author The winner of the Man Booker prize for Amsterdam in 1998, McEwan has been shortlisted five other times and is the most successful British-born literary novelist of his generation; his accomplished work since the 90s has a reputation for combining classiness with accessible storytelling, ensuring reliably strong sales, film adaptations \u2013 the kudos won by the Atonement movie looks likely to add to producers&apos; enthusiasm \u2013 and a regular spot on A-level syllabuses.

And then they parted, Kenny Dalglish to the home dressing room, Ian Rush to the directors&apos; box. There will come a time, perhaps a decade and a half from now, when Luis Su\u00e1rez will be around the Legends Lounge, passing the time with whoever happens to be managing Liverpool \u2013 whether it be Jamie Carragher, J\u00fcrgen Klopp or \u2013 and imagination can take you a long way \u2013 Darren Ferguson. When asked to describe the Uruguayan&apos;s performance, which included perhaps the best goal at Anfield this year, where he bamboozled Christophe Berra before finding the slight gap between Wayne Hennessy and the near post, Dalglish remarked: &quot;He has been here before he has been here.&quot; What the Liverpool manager meant was that Su\u00e1rez came to Merseyside with a CV that included scoring more than 100 goals for Ajax, a feat achieved by Johan Cruyff, Marco van\u00a0Basten and Dennis Bergkamp, who are as assured of their welcome at the Dutch club&apos;s Amsterdam Arena as Rush is at Anfield. It says something for Su\u00e1rez&apos;s performances since he scored on his debut against Stoke City that the other part of his CV seems to have been entirely forgotten. He was the man whose handball had denied Ghana a place in the semi-finals of the first African World Cup. At Ajax he was known as a diver whose career in the Eredivisie ended when he bit PSV Eindhoven&apos;s Otman Bakkal. They are headlines that seem not to belong to the striker who proved the difference between Liverpool and a rugged and sometimes inventive Wolverhampton Wanderers. Andy Carroll, who enjoyed one of his better games for Liverpool, has not shaken off the baggage that accompanied him from Newcastle. There should come a time when he is not thought of as a big Geordie with a pint forever in his hand. This match was a step forward. When discussing how far Su\u00e1rez could go at Anfield, Dalglish cut the conversation short. &quot;I don&apos;t think he is just on course, I think he has arrived. I think the fans take to him because he is genuine and 100% committed. Our supporters are probably the most intelligent I have come across and they understand when someone is doing something well.&quot; For someone who has spent most of his life in the fierce limelight Anfield can throw, Dalglish can be surprisingly modest. In the reprint of his autobiography, My Liverpool Home, he is clear that the man most responsible for bringing Su\u00e1rez to Merseyside was the club&apos;s director of football, Damien Comolli, whose precise relationship with his manager is the source of much speculation. On Saturday evening, as the discussion spread to what kind of advice Dalglish has given Su\u00e1rez not just as manager to player but as one forward to another, he replied: &quot;No hablo espa\u00f1ol.&quot; He has, of course, made enough golfing pilgrimages to La\u00a0Manga to have picked up the odd phrase and Su\u00e1rez himself has confirmed there have been plenty of tips and encouragement. There is, of course, a sizeable contingent for whom Spanish is a first language and that includes Jos\u00e9 Enrique, whose journey from St James&apos; Park has been more instantly successful than Carroll&apos;s. And yet with the Merseyside derby looming at Goodison Park, there was urgency in the Spaniard&apos;s voice. &quot;If we want to be in the Champions League next\u00a0season, we need to get these points now,&quot; he said. &quot;Andy was unlucky not to score but next time he will and next week will be perfect.&quot;", "sentences": ["When asked to describe the Uruguayan&apos;s performance, which included perhaps the best goal at Anfield this year, where he bamboozled Christophe Berra before finding the slight gap between Wayne Hennessy and the near post, Dalglish remarked: &quot;He has been here before he has been here.&quot; What the Liverpool manager meant was that Su\u00e1rez came to Merseyside with a CV that included scoring more than 100 goals for Ajax, a feat achieved by Johan Cruyff, Marco van\u00a0Basten and Dennis Bergkamp, who are as assured of their welcome at the Dutch club&apos;s Amsterdam Arena as Rush is at Anfield."], "title": "Luis Su\u00e1rez proves the difference as Liverpool overcome Wolves", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/25/luis-suarez-liverpool-wolves", "tags": ["Premier League 2011-12", "Liverpool", "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "Kenny Dalglish", "Andy Carroll", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-26T17:35:35Z", "article": "A conversation with my friend Barry Flanagan could be a baffling affair. Stiffly whispering one minute, barking jokes the next, he delighted in wordplay and biographical confidences easily lost on the listener. Sometimes in mid-flow, the sculptor paused. Then he leant forward and sniffed the air, with his chiselled features and unruly greying hair, the image of the animal he had made his trademark \u2013 the hare. In 1979, inspired by one of these creatures glimpsed on the Sussex Downs, he bought a dead one from a local butcher and modelled it at his East End foundry. His leaping hare was instantly iconic. Bordeaux wine producers and Japanese hoteliers queued up to buy one. He represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1982. Showered with fame and money, he was a trailblazer for commercially canny artist-stars such as Hirst and Emin. Yet the mercurial hare, also a motif in the work of such key influences as Mir\u00f3 and Joseph Beuys, had pedigree in the out-there territory that Flanagan first explored in the 1960s and 70s when he was an adventurer on the furthest shores of conceptual art. But far from being a departure, the hare was an integral feature on the journey Flanagan first set out on. Born in Prestatyn, north Wales, in 1941, Flanagan resolved at the outset of his career to embrace every direction, and poetry not sculpture was his first track. In 1964-65, with others at St Martin&apos;s art college, he produced the magazine Sil\u00e2ns. His writings display a gift as formidable as that he applied to stone and marble: prose and concrete poetry full of subversive, offbeat humour. Such poetry spilled over into his sculpture, inspiring titles such as aaing j gni aa. As a sculptor, Flanagan rejected the stark metal structures of &quot;girder-welders&quot; like his tutor Antony Caro and reverently stuck with non-traditional materials like rope and sand. He flirted with Land Art and Arte Povera. He made and filmed a hole in the sea off the Dutch coast. He worked with Yoko Ono. With some students at St Martin&apos;s and John Latham, their tutor, he took a chunk of Clement Greenberg&apos;s Art and Culture and chewed it for a work called Still and Chew. Greenberg, an American critic, also advocated Caro&apos;s formalist school. Flanagan and his contemporaries recoiled, preferring a less shackled approach. When the college library wanted the book back, Latham returned the detritus distilled in a vial and was summarily sacked. Family was paramount, and Flanagan brought up two daughters in Camden Town. He did casual labouring to supplement art&apos;s meagre returns, but he disliked the way &quot;money punishes art&quot; and resorted to making his own lino-printed currency. These Flanagan notes were issued in fives, tens and fifties and were redeemable against his estate. He used them to pay for labour and materials. Yet when real money came, he believed in unburdening himself of it as fast as possible. In 1971, he distributed the payment he received from the organisers of Art Spectrum London for his involvement in the new 50p decimal pieces at the show&apos;s opening at Alexandra Palace. A decade or so on, when the amounts he received were much larger, he continued to display mind-boggling generosity, passing on his prize money to a struggling young French sculptor, for example, or sponsoring a young woman after casually hearing her complain to her mother that she lacked the funds to do a teacher training course. For Flanagan, flow was the important thing, with money as much as anything else. He moved to Ibiza in 1987, which is where I first met him. In his dusty green cord jacket and tradesman&apos;s cap, he became a fixture of the local artists&apos; colony. His favourite drink was whisky, though he made it clear he was a &quot;pissed artist&quot; not a &quot;piss artist&quot;. Restless and itinerant, he moved between Dublin, Barcelona and Amsterdam, keeping a room on permanent standby at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. But he brought up his second family on Ibiza and met his untimely death there from motor neurone disease in 2009. His rambling house, which I visited on many occasions, was fitted with wall-to-wall green carpeting, something he stipulated for shows as well. He also used some walls of his home as a notebook. &quot;Is it my fault I chose life over employment?&quot; read one scribble, a riposte made to a belligerent tax inspector. Another notation, &quot;the hues of the ripple&quot;, crystallised the multi-faceted approach he always applied, where different meanings revealed themselves in language and form like the layers of the onion. He could be very droll, remarking that there was &quot;so much stone a sculptor could get indigestion&quot; when we were driving among mountains. He called me his &quot;spontaneous fixer&quot; and it was in this capacity I curated his show at the contemporary art museum in Ibiza in 1992. Working with him could be hair-raising, and he was prone to vanishing. On the morning of the Ibiza exhibition, I tracked him down to the museum. He was asleep in the gallery, keeping vigil over his treasures. The ample cellar of that 16th-century building was filled with his own collection of 1960s and 1970s work, making the exhibition a forerunner to the one at Tate Britain. Some pieces were the same: the wood and hessian And Then Among Celts, for example, or Light on Light on Sacks, a heap of sacks against a wall with a projector framing a square of light on them. He bought those sacks (which were full of carob beans) from a bemused local farmer on Ibiza. Rats would later infiltrate the museum and feast on the contents. Also on show there were ceramics and pieces in clay such as Bes, in which the rounded, compressed slabs evoked the voluptuous Venus of Willendorf. Flanagan&apos;s work had a playful eclecticism: it showed his willingness to take ideas from mythology, literature and art as diverse and sometimes heretical as his use of solid material. At work, Flanagan&apos;s mind drifted on still waters until an idea struck like a tsunami. He made an on-the-spot decision to run a ring of salt from Salinas around two triangular works in steel, the white crystals on the floor superbly setting off the rusting metal. Each of the triangular structures \u2013 jointly called Homage to Mir\u00f3 \u2013 had a crescent, a wing and a large circle cut out of it, symbols first employed by Alfred Jarry and later borrowed by Mir\u00f3. Another ad hoc decision was to place The Penguin Book of Spanish Verse on top of wooden blocks which already supported a female torso. The book supported a dark head and was opened at a poem I had read to him. When the poem&apos;s author, Antonio Colinas, turned up to give his blessing, I was glad Flanagan had put his book-chewing days behind him. The poem celebrates the way a sculptor&apos;s work lasts beyond him.

The Dutchman&apos;s first home match as the Arsenal captain had ended in defeat by Liverpool and he was hot with rage and frustration. A penny for his thoughts would have been worth the investment yet Van Persie was never going to go public. The 28-year-old knows himself too well. It was 20 August. Cesc F\u00e1bregas had left for Barcelona and Samir Nasri was poised to leave for Manchester City. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had signed only one established international \u2013 the forward Gervinho from Lille \u2013 and found himself in the throes of a selection crisis. It felt as though the club had hit rock bottom, although that was to come, at Manchester United the following weekend. Van Persie bit his lip as he marched out of the Emirates Stadium dressing-room that day because, as more than one club official acknowledged, he can speak only with candour and he realised that the heat of this moment was not the time to vent it. So he stewed, which is something he has done plenty of since the beginning of the summer. But, if Van Persie has given a passable impression of a ticking time-bomb, it was no surprise when he detonated following Saturday&apos;s win over Bolton Wanderers, sparking a trail of banner headlines. Van Persie&apos;s admission that he was in no hurry to discuss an extension to his contract, which expires in June 2013, and the associated suggestion that it would be better to wait until the end of the season, has caused no little alarm. The striker could have gone further and he doubtless would have done if he had spoken about the club&apos;s direction after the Liverpool or United games. But his words at the weekend sufficed to get the message across and the issue out into the open. As Arsenal labour, Van Persie intends to keep his options open. The mood of an overseas player in the Premier League can often be judged when he is back with his country on international duty and Van Persie has cut a withdrawn figure with Holland of late, retreating into the company of his close friends Ibrahim Afellay, Khalid Boulahrouz and Nigel de Jong and being unusually reluctant to speak to the Dutch press. At the end of last season, in the June friendly against Brazil which finished 0-0, he lost his cool at Arjen Robben, after his team-mate ignored the opportunity to play him in. When he was substituted by the manager, Bert van Marwijk, Van Persie stormed straight down the tunnel and he clashed with Robben in the dressing-room after the game. His crankiness was reflected in a post-match statement that was critical of Robben. &quot;Everybody hashis own character,&quot; he said. &quot;I would always have played that ball ... I think most players would but I shouldn&apos;t have walked away [to the dressing-room] like that.&quot; During the most recent international break, when Holland beat San Marino and Finland, Van Persie declined to speak to the press for fear of any comments about Arsenal rebounding in England. Van Persie would not normally have such concerns and the general impression is that he has become anxious and uncomfortable. F\u00e1bregas displayed similar traits last season, when he kept his own counsel apart from the controversial interview that he gave to Don Bal\u00f3n, the Spanish magazine. When F\u00e1bregas finally completed his transfer to Barcelona, there was the view that he might not get into the team but he has thrived in the early weeks of his second spell at Camp Nou. Van Persie, who would back his ability anywhere in the world, would surely have taken note. Wenger added five players in the final 48 hours of the summer transfer window and he said that he wanted all of his business to reassure the club&apos;s existing stars. It is unclear, though, whether it has done so with Van Persie, who had called in early July for &quot;statement&quot; signings to be made. He could not contain his exasperation with Gervinho in the defeat at Blackburn Rovers, when the Ivorian ignored him in an excellent position to go for goal himself \u2013 Van Persie hates selfish players \u2013 while, in his eyes, most midfielders would struggle to measure up to F\u00e1bregas. Mikel Arteta has big boots to fill. Van Persie is not the only Arsenal player who stands to become a free agent in the summer after next \u2013 Thomas Vermaelen, Theo Walcott, Andrey Arshavin and Johan Djourou are in the same position. But the sense of unease is most acute with Van Persie, who is arguably the club&apos;s one remaining world-class talent. The conspiracy theorists worry about his close links to Darren Dein, the agent who helped to move F\u00e1bregas out of the club, although Van Persie&apos;s Fifa-registered representative is the Amsterdam-based Kees Vos. Van Persie, however, is his own man and one with no shortage of potential suitors. Yet another Arsenal contract saga is set to run.", "sentences": ["The conspiracy theorists worry about his close links to Darren Dein, the agent who helped to move F\u00e1bregas out of the club, although Van Persie&apos;s Fifa-registered representative is the Amsterdam-based Kees Vos."], "title": "Arsenal face another contract saga as Robin van Persie ponders future | David Hytner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/sep/26/robin-van-persie-arsenal-contract", "tags": ["Robin van Persie", "Arsenal", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-27T17:22:12Z", "article": "The suspicion of intellectuals in the British performing arts runs deep, so it is hard to appreciate exactly the status and reputation throughout the rest of Europe of the theatre scholar and cultural commentator Dragan Klaic, who has died aged 61 after a long illness. He enlivened any meeting or symposium he attended, arguing profoundly, in nine languages, as a tireless advocate of European cultural collaboration, leading complex international research projects and producing books, papers and lectures in a restless torrent of activity. He was without equal as an arts conceptualist in Europe because of his background, intellect and energy. But all his theorising was based in theatrical activity and practical involvement; he was nomadic in both temperament and ideology, having left Belgrade in disgust as the wars began in 1991, to settle in Amsterdam, where he led the city&apos;s theatre institute for 10 years. Klaic, an only child, was born in Sarajevo, in Yugoslavia, of Jewish parents. He was raised in Novi Sad. He graduated in dramaturgy in Belgrade and took a doctorate in theatre history and criticism at Yale, before returning to Belgrade, where he was a professor at the university from 1978 to 1991. He co-founded the European theatre quarterly Euromaske before going to the Netherlands. From an early age, he saw theatre as a means of healing fractured communities and promoting international cooperation. This led to his decisive participation in many festivals, notably the Belgrade international theatre fest ival (Bitef), founded by Mira Trailovic and Jovan Cirilov in 1967. At this time in the cold war, theatre in the former Yugoslavia was both developing its own voice and acting as a bridge between the explosions in the western counterculture and the reconsideration of Slav and Russian classical traditions. Bitef became a crucible for the kind of cultural exchanges Klaic relished, with the participation of important figures such as Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, Jan Kott, Yuri Lyubimov, Eugenio Barba, Robert Wilson and Andrej Wajda. As Cirilov has written, Klaic channel- led all his knowledge in a living reality, and in the context of world theatre as a whole. He became a spokesman of the dedicated, radical theatre emerging in Subotica, north of Belgrade, near the Hungarian border, as part of a group including the leading director Ljubi\u0161a Ristic. He was theatre critic on the main Belgrade broadsheet, Politika, from 1982 to 1984, but he cast his net too wide to be contained on a mere newspaper. He taught at Amsterdam University and, over the past 10 years, lectured regularly as a visiting professor at universities in Leiden, Budapest, Istanbul, Belgrade and Bologna. As a permanent fellow of the Felix Meritis foundation, he was involved in projects aimed at preserving cultural heritage and developing policy at local and national level. Always, for him, good theatre was to do with good citizenship. At a conference in Novi Sad in 2007, he memorably questioned the whole idea of a national theatre, advocating a more focused programme attached both to diverse local constituencies and creative peers across Europe. In 2004 he launched the European Festivals Research Project and was more recently one of the main consultants, with Rose Fenton, founding director of the London International Festival of Theatre, in the preparation for the candidacy of the Polish city of Lublin for the European Cultural Capital in 2016, although the nomination went in the end to Wroc\u0142aw. Klaic, generally known as &quot;Klaja&quot;, was a loyal friend, and a hero to countless colleagues, students and practitioners. He is survived by his wife, Julia, a psycho- analyst specialising in refugee trauma, their daughter, Nora, and by his mother, who still lives in Novi Sad.  \u2022 Dragan Klaic, theatre scholar and cultural analyst, born 27 April 1950; died 25 August 2011", "sentences": ["But all his theorising was based in theatrical activity and practical involvement; he was nomadic in both temperament and ideology, having left Belgrade in disgust as the wars began in 1991, to settle in Amsterdam, where he led the city&apos;s theatre institute for 10 years.", "He taught at Amsterdam University and, over the past 10 years, lectured regularly as a visiting professor at universities in Leiden, Budapest, Istanbul, Belgrade and Bologna."], "title": "Dragan Klaic obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/27/dragan-klaic-obituary", "tags": ["Theatre", "Culture", "Serbia", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Russia", "South and Central Asia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-09-29T11:44:41Z", "article": "Every year with the approach of autumn, academics get excited.

As United&apos;s manager, Alan Pardew, acknowledged, the Magpies have played much better this season, and that they left Molineux with three points was due in no small measure to the excellence of his Dutch goalkeeper. Two saves before Newcastle took the lead, from Wolverhampton Wanderers&apos; Jamie O&apos;Hara and Kevin Doyle, and a double effort late in the second half, from Steven Fletcher and Adam Hammill, were the pick, though it also took some remarkable blocks from the defenders Steven Taylor and Ryan Taylor, and some questionable decisions from the officials, for the visitors to prevail. In fact the first of those, when the referee Mark Halsey decided Steven Taylor had fouled O&apos;Hara outside rather than inside the penalty area, was not so much questionable as plain baffling, given the contact was, as the Wolves manager Mick McCarthy put it, &quot;a good yard&quot; inside the box. The second, when the linesman decided the ball had gone over the byline before being headed back across goal by Matt Jarvis for Doyle to poke home what Wolves believed was an added-time equaliser, was almost equally hard to fathom. McCarthy said Halsey had told him he had not wanted to &quot;guess&quot; the foul had been inside the area. &quot;Well, I think he did and got it wrong, because it didn&apos;t require a guess,&quot; said McCarthy. &quot;I thought the one that wasn&apos;t given, well, it wasn&apos;t out. So bad decisions have certainly cost us but our own defending has cost us first and foremost in conceding the two goals.&quot; He was right in that respect, first when Demba Ba was allowed to steal ahead of his marker to head Yohan Cabaye&apos;s near-post corner past the Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, and then when three defenders missed tackles on Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez before the Argentinian drove the ball past Hennessey shortly before half-time. McCarthy changed things around after an hour, introducing Hammill and Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura, and Wolves were much better for it. Fletcher&apos;s late header ensured a frantic and, as far as the home team was concerned, very nearly productive finale. &quot;We&apos;re a young side and we lost control and panicked a bit, but we&apos;re realistic and we know we&apos;re not the finished article,&quot; Pardew said. &quot;We&apos;re very pleased with where we are and let&apos;s see how far we can go, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s many Newcastle fans who will be thinking about the Champions League. We&apos;ve just tried to be the best we can be and hopefully against Tottenham in two weeks we&apos;ll control the game a bit better than that.&quot; Krul also admitted Newcastle had ridden their luck. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t have believed this position if you had told us at the start of the season, but we knew we had a good squad and the confidence has grown game by game.

At its east end, like the stained glass window of a cathedral, is a giant vertical screen. It is framed at the edges with sprocket holes, so we feel we are looking at a vast reel of film. In the centre, an ever-changing series of images: a snail on a wind-wobbled leaf, the powerful spume of a fountain, a chimney loosing trails of vapour. Sometimes the image is of the back wall of the Turbine Hall itself, but with its gridded form coloured in red, yellow and blue so it resembles a Mondrian. Or with a giant egg apparently floating from ceiling to floor. This is the British artist Tacita Dean&apos;s offering for the most prestigious art commission in the land, Tate Modern&apos;s Unilever series. The 12th artist to be invited to occupy the cavernous space, she follows in the footsteps of figures including Juan Mu\u00f1oz, Bruce Naumann, Olafur Eliasson and Doris Salcedo. According to the Tate Modern director, Chris Dercon, 26 million people have now seen these works since the series began in 2000 with Louise Bourgeois. Her work, said Dean, is both an act of mourning and an argument for the future. Simply called Film, it is shot on 35mm and painstakingly edited by her and her alone. It is a homage to a form that is about to die, killed off by digital film-making, unless fast action is taken. &quot;This beautiful medium, which we invented 125 years ago, is about to go,&quot; she said. &quot;How long have we got? I hope we&apos;ve got a year left. It&apos;s that critical.&quot; Laboratories that are capable of printing film are &quot;in single figures in the world&quot;, she said. The continued manufacture of film is also in doubt. Film is, in part, a showcase of what 35mm can do, she said: its very limitations meaning the artist must invent and improvise. To create her &quot;special effects&quot; \u2013 such as a vast circular aperture containing a winking eye apparently appearing out of the Tate Modern back wall \u2013 she used old-fashioned techniques from cinema&apos;s early days, such as glass matte painting, masking and double exposure. The language of analogue film-making, said Dean, was as important to her as a painter&apos;s canvas and paint. When it goes, she said, &quot;I might go back to oil painting. Or write a novel.&quot; Even so, she said, she is &quot;not a Luddite&quot;, nor is she &quot;fetishising the medium&quot;. &quot;I am in no way anti-digital,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to make that perfectly clear. But I love film and I don&apos;t want to lose my ability to make it and I think I probably will.&quot; The major differences between film and digital were in the making, she said. &quot;Digital relies on post-production. No longer do you rely on the moment; and you lose a certain vitality of the moment.&quot; Dean, 45, who was born in Kent and is based in Berlin, is known for her serious-minded, beautiful, patiently paced films \u2013 including portraits of artistic figures such as the late painter Cy Twombly, and the late choreographer Merce Cunningham. Of being asked to occupy the Turbine Hall, she said: &quot;I am not known for making works on a spectacular scale, so I had to go somewhere I had never been before. The Turbine Hall commission is about the spectacular: there is no getting away from that. So I thought, I&apos;m going to do something spectacular \u2013 not a 148-minute film about an old man.&quot; The very making of Film reflected, said Dean, the fact of the medium&apos;s crisis. Due to a loss of skills in the Dutch laboratory she used there was a serious error in the way the film was cut that transpired a week and a half ago. The mistake would have resulted in white flashes being seen between each shot when the film was shown. &quot;We&apos;ve been through the valley of the shadow of death,&quot; said Dean of the disaster. Film was saved by Steve Farman, of the Tonbridge-based company Professional Negative Cutting. He drove to Amsterdam, recut the film with Dean, and drove through the night to deliver it to the Tate curator, Nicholas Cullinan, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Farman, 52, said helping out on the project had been &quot;the crowning glory of my career&quot; \u2013 easily trumping work on Troy and Batman Begins. He said: &quot;I am the last person doing it in the UK now. It&apos;s very sad, it used to be 200 people, but it&apos;s a dying art.

Abdulmutallab is charged with trying to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253, which had taken off for Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day 2009 and was over Michigan when he allegedly sought to trigger a bomb. The Nigerian citizen, 24, is accused of wanting to carry out a suicide mission that could have killed everyone aboard the targeted plane had he successfully managed to detonate explosives smuggled aboard inside his underwear. However the device failed to go off properly, resulting in serious burns injuries to Abdulmutallab&apos;s groin and legs but no explosion. He was then subdued by his fellow passengers and members of the crew. He now faces a host of criminal charges including attempted murder, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, and conspiracy to commit terrorism. If found guilty he will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars. The trial in Detroit has been eagerly awaited, mostly because Abdulmutallab last year dismissed his legal team and began conducting his own defence. It was set to begin with opening statements from both defence and prosecution that raised the prospect of Abdulmutallab personally explaining his actions and motivations around the alleged bombing attempt to the jury. But late last week he indicated that his court-appointed legal advisor, Anthony Chambers, would be reading the opening statement instead. In previous appearances Abudlmutallab has shown varying attitudes at court hearings. At times he has been respectful of the court staff and asked frequent questions on his own behalf about legal matters. However, at others time he has claimed that slain terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki are alive and put a foot up on the desk in front of him. He also called the United States a &quot;cancer&quot; and requested to be allowed to wear a traditional Yemeni belt, including a ceremonial dagger, in court. There are several areas where a defence of Abdulmutallab, the son of a wealthy Nigerian businessman, is likely to focus in the case. Abdulmutallab was not read his Miranda rights before he was interviewed by FBI agents at the University of Michigan Hospital where he was under the grip of powerful painkillers as he was treated for his injuries. However, Judge Nancy Edmunds has ruled that statements Abdulmutallab made during those interviews are admissible in the trial. During the interrogation, Abdulmutallab told questioners he was trained by al-Qaida, had studied terrorism in Yemen and got his underwear device from a Saudi Arabian bomb-maker. Another possible area of contention is the issue of videos showing an expert blowing up the type of PETN explosives used by Abdulmutallab in his underwear device. Chambers has previously argued that Abdulmutallab did not intend to bring down the plane and that the videos would be prejudicial to his defence. A key area for the prosecution will be to show that there was a wider al-Qaida conspiracy at work. To prove that they will not only use Abdulmutallab&apos;s own statements but also a video of al-Qaida operatives discussing how he carried out the attack. Last week the jury was selected in the case. A lengthy process worked through a large field of potential jurors and finally settled on three white men and nine women, two of whom are black and one of whom is from India. During the process one Nigerian woman was dismissed as a potential juror by the judge. The process took longer than usual as it was complicated by the fact that more potential jurors than usual in criminal cases already felt that the accused was guilty.", "sentences": ["Abdulmutallab is charged with trying to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253, which had taken off for Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day 2009 and was over Michigan when he allegedly sought to trigger a bomb."], "title": "'Underwear bomber', accused over Christmas Day terror plot, goes on trial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/11/underwear-bomber-plot-trial-detriot", "tags": ["Michigan", "Al-Qaida", "US news", "Nigeria", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab", "Detroit"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-11T19:25:00Z", "article": "The trial of a Nigerian man dubbed the &quot;underwear bomber&quot; got underway Tuesday, nearly two years after he allegedly tried to blow up a passenger plane with a device concealed in his clothing. Flight 253 had been flying from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day, 2009, when Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab&apos;s bomb failed to detonate properly, prosecutors said, resulting only in serious burns to the accused. He was then rapidly subdued by fellow passengers and crew as the fire was put out. Now, after much anticipation, Abdulmutallab&apos;s case has finally begun in a downtown Detroit federal court building, ringed by extra security. The trial is one of the biggest terror cases to be held in America since 9/11 but so far has had a slightly surreal element, as Abdulmutallab last year dismissed his legal team and started conducting his own defence. That element of the unexpected continued in the trial&apos;s opening session as Abdulmutallab appeared in a colourful African-style gown and then \u2013 after an hour-long talk with his court-appointed legal adviser \u2013 declined to give any opening statement. He then watched as head prosecutor Jonathan Tukel launched a 90-minute presentation of the case against him. Tukel, chief of the National Security Unit in the local attorney&apos;s office, presented a detailed outline of the case against Abdulmutallab.  He described numerous witnesses slated to testify who helped wrestle a burning Abdulmutallab to the floor and escort him to business class as pilots brought the plane down in an emergency landing. Tukel forensically reconstructed the few minutes of panic as the fire was put out before detailing numerous statements that Abdulmutallab made to fellow passengers, FBI interrogators and staff at the hospital where he admitted he had been trying to blow the plane out of the sky. &quot;That was martyrdom,&quot; Abdulmutallab told one nurse.  In a chat with a customs official Abdulmutallab also admitted he had wanted the bomb to &quot;bring down the plane&quot; and that he had acquired it in Yemen. He repeated that story in far more detail to a pair of FBI interrogators who grilled him for 50 minutes in hospital. He detailed meeting a militant in Yemen called &quot;Abu Tarak&quot; who came up with the idea for the plot and gave him the underwear bomb made by a Saudi terrorist. Tukel said that Abdulmutallab painted a picture of a committed terrorist who had been born to a wealthy family in Nigeria, gone to good schools but had been determined to become an Islamic radical and so travelled to Yemen. &quot;He wanted jihad and he sought it out and he found it,&quot; Tukel said.  Tukel&apos;s opening statement also mentioned a screenshot of Abdulmutallab in a martyrdom video. Sitting with an AK-47 rifle propped up against a wall behind him, he appeared in a video that was part of a much longer al-Qaida film. Abdulmutallab&apos;s segment was just 34 seconds long but in it he stated: &quot;My Muslim brothers in the Arabian peninsula, you have to answer the call of jihad because the enemy is in your land along with their Jewish and Christian armies.&quot; Tukel said there was no doubt what sort of mission the accused was on: a suicide mission. &quot;His mission was for the al-Qaida terrorist organisation... his only reason for being on Flight 253 was to kill all the other passengers and himself,&quot; Tukel said and he added: &quot;He thought that he would end up in heaven because he thought he would be a martyr.&quot; Throughout the testimony Abdulmutallab watched impassively, barely moving and often holding his hands clasped beneath his chin. That was in marked contrast to previous court appearances where he sometimes shouted remarks, once saying that Osama bin Laden was still alive and that America was a &quot;cancer&quot;. He also once asked to wear a ceremonial Yemeni belt complete with dagger to court; a request that was unsurprisingly denied. But this morning&apos;s session was not without its moments of levity. After Tukel&apos;s opening statement ended and Abdulmutallab and his lawyer reserved their right to respond later, the first witness was called. He was Mike Zantow, a fellow passenger on Flight 253, who described watching the accused put a blanket over his head after a long trip to the bathroom. There was then a loud pop and Zantow heard the man seated next to Abdulmutallab shout: &quot;Hey dude, your pants are on fire!&quot; Zantow vividly detailed how Abdulmutallab had no reaction to being on fire as people hauled him out of his seat and put out the flames. He also described the moment he first saw the device that could have killed him along with everyone else on board. &quot;Underwear resembling something that I hadn&apos;t seen before\u2026 like adult pampers a little.&quot;", "sentences": ["Flight 253 had been flying from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day, 2009, when Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab&apos;s bomb failed to detonate properly, prosecutors said, resulting only in serious burns to the accused."], "title": "'Underwear bomber' trial begins as prosecutors lay out case", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/11/underwear-bomber-trial-starts", "tags": ["US news", "Michigan", "World news", "Detroit"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-12T10:31:00Z", "article": "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Muriel Spark, 1961 The wry and witty tale of Edinburgh teacher Miss Brodie&apos;s prime and fall is an unmissable read. &quot;Now they were in a great square, the Grassmarket, with the Castle, which was in any case everywhere, rearing between a big gap in the houses where the aristocracy used to live.

The Nigerian citizen, 25, stunned the court with his sudden plea reversal after prosecutors were settling down to present a mountain of physical evidence against him that was expected to last up to a month. But instead, after a brief recess, Abdulmutallab suddenly decided to plead guilty to smuggling a deadly bomb hidden inside specially constructed underwear on board Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit. Abdulmutallab intended to blow the plane out of the sky over America but it failed to go off. Instead, he suffered severe burns to his crotch and was subdued by fellow passengers and airline crew. Pleading guilty dodged a lengthy terror trial, but also allowed Abdulmutallab the opportunity to address the court. Dressed in a black jacket and a brown tunic, he gave out a five-minute statement in which he explained that he wanted to carry out the attack to protest against US and Israeli policy towards Muslims. &quot;I intentionally carried an explosive device on Flight 253 for the US tyranny and oppression of Muslims,&quot; he told the courtroom. He described the high explosives packed into his underpants \u2013 which could have brought down the plane and killed everyone onboard \u2013 as &quot;a blessed weapon to save the lives of innocent Muslims.&quot; Anyone hoping for a deeper insight into Abdulmutallab&apos;s mindset and an explanation of why a young educated man from a wealthy background would embrace a suicide mission to kill civilians would have been disappointed by his speech. So would anyone looking for an expression of contrition or regret. The brief statement opened with a rambling religious exhortation and then went into the familiar language of Islamic jihad. He said that his action had been a &quot;religious obligation&quot; and that it was legal under the law of the Qu&apos;ran. But he conceded had acted illegally according to US law; a concept he repeated numerous times as he went through the charges. &quot;My actions make me guilty of a crime within the United States,&quot; he admitted. He also issued a threat. &quot;The US should await a great calamity that will befall them at the hands of the mujahadeen,&quot; he said. But, perhaps aware of his &quot;underwear bomber&quot; nickname, he also sternly admonished people not to laugh at him. &quot;If you laugh at us now, we will laugh at you later,&quot; he said. The day of legal drama brought an end to a case that has taken almost two years to come to court and been often marked by bizarre and outrageous moments. Last year Abdulmutallab dismissed his legal team and started to conduct his own defence. Though often quiet and respectful during previous hearings, he was also prone to occasional outbursts, such as calling the US &quot;a cancer&quot; and saying Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki was alive. The latter claim was repeated in court on Tuesday. He also showed a changing dress sense, shifting from colourful robes to sombre gowns to once requesting to wear a traditional Yemeni belt complete with ceremonial dagger: a request that was denied. But the theatrics disguised a serious terror plot that only by seeming good fortune failed to kill hundreds of people. The case outlined by the prosecutor showed how Abdulmutallab travelled to Yemen to meet Islamic militants. One of them, a man known as Abu Tarak, came up with the underwear plot and provided the bomb, which was made by a Saudi terrorist. Abdulmutallab also recorded a martyrdom video that appeared as a short segment in a longer more general al-Qaida film. In it, Abdulmutallab posed with a AK-47 propped up behind him and urged Muslims to join the fight. &quot;My Muslim brothers in the Arabian peninsula, you have to answer the call of jihad because the enemy is in your land along with their Jewish and Christian armies,&quot; he said in the clip. Abdulmutallab did his best to carry out his suicide mission. He boarded the plane in Amsterdam wearing the bomb. At the end of the flight, as it approached Detroit, he went to the bathroom to ritually prepare himself with perfume. When he returned to the seat he put a blanket over his head and pretended to sleep. He then pressed a syringe that was meant to mix chemicals together that would eventually detonate the explosives in the bomb. However, it only partially ignited the device. The lone witness to give testimony before the trial ended was fellow passenger Mike Zantow. He provided yet another moment of levity in the case by telling the court that the first sign something was wrong was when the man sitting next to Abdulmutallab said: &quot;Hey, dude, your pants are on fire!&quot; But, as prosecutors were at pains to point out, there was nothing funny about the underwear bomb plot. They had amassed a wealth of forensic evidence and witness testimony that would have shown how close it came to causing a major atrocity in the skies above Detroit. As lead prosecutor Jonathan Tukel put it in his opening statement: &quot;His mission was for the al-Qaida terrorist organisation... his only reason for being on Flight 253 was to kill all the other passengers and himself.&quot;", "sentences": ["But instead, after a brief recess, Abdulmutallab suddenly decided to plead guilty to smuggling a deadly bomb hidden inside specially constructed underwear on board Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit.", "He boarded the plane in Amsterdam wearing the bomb."], "title": "Al-Qaida 'underwear bomber' stuns Detroit court by changing plea to guilty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/underwear-bomber-abdulmutallab-pleads-guilty", "tags": ["Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab", "Michigan", "Al-Qaida", "Nigeria", "US news", "World news", "Detroit"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-12T16:27:47Z", "article": "One of Rupert Murdoch&apos;s most senior European executives has resigned following Guardian inquiries about a circulation scam at News Corporation&apos;s flagship newspaper, the Wall Street Journal. The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had been channelling money through European companies in order to secretly buy thousands of copies of its own paper at a knock-down rate, misleading readers and advertisers about the Journal&apos;s true circulation. The bizarre scheme included a formal, written contract in which the Journal persuaded one company to co-operate by agreeing to publish articles that promoted its activities, a move which led some staff to accuse the paper&apos;s management of violating journalistic ethics and jeopardising its treasured reputation for editorial quality. Internal emails and documents suggest the scam was promoted by Andrew Langhoff, the European managing director of the Journal&apos;s parent company, Dow Jones and Co, which was bought by Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corporation in July 2007. Langhoff resigned on Tuesday. The highly controversial activities were organised in London and focused on the Journal&apos;s European edition, which circulates in the EU, Russia, and Africa. Senior executives in New York, including Murdoch&apos;s right-hand man, Les Hinton, were alerted to the problems last year by an internal whistleblower and apparently chose to take no action. The whistleblower was then made redundant. In what appears to have been a damage limitation exercise following the Guardian&apos;s inquiries, Langhoff resigned on Tuesday, citing only the complaints of unethical interference in editorial coverage. Neither he nor an article published last night in the Wall Street Journal made any reference to the circulation scam nor to the fact that the senior management of Dow Jones in New York failed to act when they were alerted last year. The affair will add weight to the fears of shareholders in Murdoch&apos;s parent company, NewsCorp, that the business has become a &apos;rogue corporation&apos;, operating outside normal rules. Some shareholders have launched a legal action in the US, attacking the Murdoch family after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World and following lawsuits in which NewsCorp subsidiaries have been accused of hacking into competitors&apos; computers and stealing their customers. The Journal&apos;s decision to secretly purchase its own papers began with an unusual scheme to boost circulation, known as the Future Leadership Institute. Starting in January 2008, the Journal linked up with European companies who sponsored seminars for university students who were likely to be future leaders. The Journal rewarded the sponsors by publishing their names in a special panel published in the paper. The sponsors paid for that publicity by buying copies of the Journal at a knock-down rate of no more than 5\u00a2 each. Those papers were then distributed to university students. At the bottom line, the sponsors enjoyed a prestigious link to the Journal, and the Journal boosted its circulation figures. The scheme was controversial. The sponsoring companies were not reading the papers they were paying for; they were never even seeing them; and they were buying at highly reduced rates. The students to whom they were distributed may or may not have read them; none of the students paid for the papers they were being offered. But the Audit Bureau of Circulation ruled that the scheme was legitimate and by 2010, it was responsible for 41% of the European edition&apos;s daily sales \u2013 31,000 copies out of a total of 75,000. In early 2010 the scheme began to run into trouble when the biggest single sponsor, a Dutch company called Executive Learning Partnership, ELP, threatened to back out. ELP alone were responsible for 16% of the Journal&apos;s European circulation, sponsoring 12,000 copies a day for which they were paying only 1\u00a2 per copy. For the 259 publishing days in a year, they were sponsoring 3.1m copies at a cost to them of \u20ac31,080 (\u00a327,200). They complained that the publicity they were receiving was not enough return on their investment. On 9 April 2010, Andrew Langhoff emailed ELP to table a new deal, explaining that &quot;our clear goal is to add a new component to our partnership&quot; and offering to &quot;provide a well-branded showcase for ELP&apos;s valuable services&quot;. On 30 April, ELP agreed to continue to sponsor 12,000 copies at the same rate. But that deal included a new eight-page addendum, which the Guardian has seen. The addendum included a collection of side deals: the Journal would give ELP free advertising and, in exchange, the ELP would produce &quot;leadership videos&quot; for them; they would jointly organise more seminars and workshops on themes connected to ELP&apos;s work; but, crucially, Langhoff agreed that the Journal would publish &quot;a minimum of three special reports&quot; that would be based on surveys of the European market which ELP would run with the Journal&apos;s help. It is this agreement that is now being cited as the reason for Langhoff&apos;s resignation on Tuesday. It led to the Journal publishing a full-page feature on 14 October 2010 that reported a survey conducted by ELP about the use of social media in business, quoting ELP&apos;s chief executive at length. The story carried no warning for readers that it was the result of a deal between the Journal and ELP, nor that ELP were sponsoring 16% of the paper&apos;s European circulation. Similarly, there were no warnings attached to a second story, published on 14 March 2011, which consisted of an interview with one of ELP&apos;s senior partners, Ann de Jaeger, about the role of women in company boardrooms. The ELP deal continued to cause more serious problems. Some Journal staff complained the agreement to run stories promoting ELP was unethical. On 12 July 2010, one London executive emailed that &quot;some elements of the deal do not fit easily within best practice, brand guidelines and company policy&quot;. Others warned about the quality of the surveys on which the stories were to be based. By the autumn of 2010, ELP were complaining that the Journal was failing to deliver its end of the agreement. They threatened not to make a payment of \u20ac15,000 that was due at the end of December, for the copies of the Journal which they had sponsored since April 30. Without the payment, the Journal could not officially record the sales and their circulation figures would suddenly dive by 16%, undermining the confidence of advertisers and readers. So Langhoff set up a complex scheme to channel money to ELP to pay for the papers it had agreed to buy \u2013 effectively buying the papers with the Journal&apos;s own cash. This involved the use of other companies although it is not suggested that they were aware they were taking part in a scam. The best-documented example involves an Indian technology company, HCL, who had separately agreed to pay the Journal \u20ac16,000 to organise a special event at the Grosvenor House hotel in London on 30 September 2010. Langhoff proposed that instead of paying the Journal, HCL should pass some of this money to a middleman \u2013 a Dutch publishing company \u2013 who would then pass it on to ELP. Invoices and emails seen by the Guardian show that in November 2010, ELP sent two invoices, for \u20ac2,000 and \u20ac6,000, to the Dutch publishers of a magazine called Banking and Finance. The Dutch duly paid \u20ac8,000 to ELP, even though ELP had not provided any goods or services for which they owed this money. According to the invoices, however, the magazine were paying ELP sponsorship money for an event run by the Journal in the Belgian towns of Bree and Schilde in November 2010. The Dutch magazine was sent \u20ac2,000 by HCL. A second payment of \u20ac6,000 was never made because HCL fell into dispute with the Journal. In December 2010, as part of an attempt to persuade the Journal to pay them the missing \u20ac6,000, the Dutch publishers&apos; managing director, Michel Klompmaker, signed a formal letter that &quot;hereby states that there has never been a contract between us and ELP regarding the sponsorship of a Wall Street Journal Bree/Schilde summit for \u20ac6,000. We agreed to be a facilitator in a payment process between the Journal, HCL and ELP per request of the Journal&quot;. An email from Andrew Langhoff on 26 November 2010 includes a diagram that indicates money was channelled to ELP through two other middlemen. This suggests that Langhoff wanted \u20ac15,000 sent to ELP via a Belgian company called Think Media, which sells space on billboards. An invoice dated 2 December 2010, shows that ELP invoiced Think Media for \u20ac15,000. An email from 20 December shows that Think Media had paid the \u20ac15,000 to ELP. In a series of phone calls and emails to Think Media, the Guardian put it to the company that ELP had provided no goods or services in exchange for this payment, and that the payment was made at the request of the Journal. Think Media declined to respond. The same diagram suggests Langhoff wanted a further \u20ac2,000 channelled to ELP through a Belgian technology company, Nayan, which had occasionally sponsored Journal events. Nayan confirmed to the Guardian that they had paid ELP \u20ac2,000 in December 2010. They say they understood that ELP were owed this money by the Journal because they had put in some work on a Journal event, and that Nayan paid it as part of their agreement to sponsor the event. A Journal source with direct knowledge of the event says that Nayan were misled by the paper, and that ELP provided no services at the event for which they were due to be paid. While these payments were being made, a whistleblower from the Journal in Europe contacted the management of Dow Jones in New York and alerted them to the circulation scam and to the controversial agreement to publish articles promoting ELP. Emails seen by the Guardian indicate that the whistleblower&apos;s complaint was seen by New York executives, including Les Hinton \u2013 then the chief executive of Dow Jones and a close confidant of Rupert Murdoch. Hinton resigned in July in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World. The emails show that the chief human resources officer for Dow Jones, Gregory Giangrande, organised a meeting in London on 14 December at which the whistleblower detailed his allegations to a Dow Jones lawyer from New York, Tom Maher, and Dow Jones&apos; European human resources executive Carol Bosack. After the meeting, Bosack emailed the whistleblower: &quot;You are expected to keep details and your reaction or beliefs about the recent events confidential and not shared with anyone external or internal to the business. This matter is to be kept between us, Andrew [Langhoff], Internal Audit and Corporate Legal.&quot; No action was apparently taken at that time on the whistleblower&apos;s allegations. The whistleblower, who had worked for Dow Jones for 9 years, was made redundant in January. According to one source, recent Guardian inquiries among former Journal staff and companies who were involved in the payments to ELP &quot;caused a panic&quot; at Dow Jones, resulting in Andrew Langhoff&apos;s resignation on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal last night reported that Langhoff&apos;s resignation &quot;following an internal investigation into two articles published in the Wall Street Journal Europe that featured a company with a contractual link to the paper&apos;s circulation department.&quot; It quoted an email sent to staff yesterday by Langhoff about the agreement to publish the ELP stories: &quot;Because the agreement could leave the impression that news coverage can be influenced by commercial relationships, as publisher with executive oversight, I believe that my resignation is now the most honorable course.&quot; Disclaimers have now been added to the two stories, warning readers that the &quot;impetus&quot; for the stories was an agreement between the Journal&apos;s circulation department and ELP. Asked about the payments from the Journal to ELP via the various middlemen, the chairman of ELP, Nick van Heck, said it was the company&apos;s policy not to make public comment on their contracts. He added: &quot;I am confident that every member of our staff is fully aware of the European norms, which are very rigid when it comes to accounting. I&apos;m pretty confident that what we did was in line with the law.&quot; On Tuesday afternoon Dow Jones issued a statement saying said it initiated the original investigation into the deals in question and the employees involved in late 2010. &quot;The circulation programs and the copies associated with ELP were legitimate and appropriate, and the agreement was shared with ABC UK before the deal was signed,&quot; the statement said. &quot;All circulation periods during the ELP arrangement have been certified.&quot; &quot;We came to the conclusion that ELP was only compensated for valid services; however, we were uncomfortable with the appearance of these programs and the manner in which they were arranged. We subsequently eliminated the position of one of the employees responsible for those deals in January 2011. &quot;At this point, we no longer have relationships with the employees or third parties directly involved in these agreements, and we continue to believe that these deals were valid. They were however of poor appearance. We were not fully aware of the details of the editorial component of the relationship until last week, when we immediately took action.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2011.

That is the blunt reality. For Scotland fans there is frustration that a forward purchased for \u00a36.5m and who is currently scoring goals in England&apos;s top flight is rendered unavailable for international duty. Levein is keen to stress that is at the behest of Fletcher, not the manager. &quot;He is the only Scottish player who has scored three goals in the last six games who doesn&apos;t want to play for Scotland,&quot; the manager points out. The origin of the problem was Levein leaving Fletcher in the stands for Scotland&apos;s loss to the Czech Republic last year. Afterwards, the forward used a newspaper interview to criticise Levein&apos;s now infamous 4-6-0 tactic. The manager insists he had and has no problem with that sentiment, aside from Fletcher drawing another player who wasn&apos;t even named as a substitute \u2013 Charlie Adam \u2013 into his argument. Fletcher subsequently sent a text message informing Scotland&apos;s player-liaison officer that he did not wish to accept a call-up for a friendly against Northern Ireland. Since then, the 24-year-old has been a notable absentee from the Scotland setup. This week, Levein spoke expansively for the first time about the situation. &quot;Nobody will be more pissed off than Fernando Torres just now at Spain, because he&apos;s not getting a game,&quot; Scotland&apos;s manager explains. &quot;He gets taken off the other night [in the win] against the Czech Republic and didn&apos;t play against us on Tuesday, but his thinking is about the team. &quot;He&apos;ll not be sending a text to Vicente del Bosque saying: &apos;Sorry, I don&apos;t want to play for Spain any more.&apos; It&apos;s to get to that situation that everyone understands the team is the most important thing.&quot; To the suggestion that he is merely involved in a battle of wills, Levein replies: &quot;That&apos;s not what it is about. It&apos;s not about who looks bad or who doesn&apos;t look bad. In any group there has to be rules for everybody. &quot;For me, it&apos;s much simpler if the rules are the rules and everybody has to abide by those rules. If he wants to play for Scotland, well, he&apos;s the one who said he didn&apos;t want to play. If he wants to play, then\u00a0he knows how\u00a0to do\u00a0it. Instead of making comments to other people or newspapers, if he doesn&apos;t want to play then fine \u2013 don&apos;t make contact. If he does want to play, make contact. As far as I am concerned, it is straightforward.&quot; Fletcher&apos;s form means this is an especially ill-timed and increasingly public affair. If Scotland had one problem during their failed Euro 2012 campaign, it was converting chances, particularly in away games. Even if he would not necessarily prosper in the lone-striker role Levein currently uses, the former Hibernian player is of a type not otherwise available to Scotland. With a World Cup qualifying campaign and a possible advancement of playing style on the horizon, Fletcher would unquestionably be a useful on-field option. &quot;I mean, I don&apos;t know how much simpler it could be,&quot; Levein says. &quot;If he wants to be part of the group, he will be treated like everybody else. Up to this point the only indication he has given me is that he doesn&apos;t want to be part of it. It&apos;s as simple as that.&quot; Those who criticise Levein&apos;s stance cannot have recent history in mind. Under his immediate predecessor, George Burley, a lack of authority played a prominent part in poor performance. Few need reminding of the scandal involving Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor after a Loch Lomond drinking session following a game in Amsterdam. &quot;The manager makes the decisions within football teams,&quot; Levein says. &quot;That&apos;s why the manager gets the sack for not doing it well. From the beginning of time, certainly in this country, that is how it has worked. There has to be a degree of respect within a group. A lot of things had gone on [under Burley] that shouldn&apos;t go on in a football team. &quot;This is the critical bit. If Steven Fletcher \u2013 and I hope he does \u2013 wants to come back and play for Scotland, he won&apos;t be treated any differently to anybody else, provided he stays within the guidelines.&quot; The ball is firmly in Fletcher&apos;s court.

Its came as the European commission prepared to release a report on Tuesday showing EU industrial firms lagging further behind US and Asian competitors in research and innovation. M\u00e1ire Geoghegan-Quinn, commissioner for research, innovation and science, told the Guardian: &quot;We are facing an innovation emergency. We need much more innovation in Europe, and we need it fast, otherwise we risk being left behind in the global R&amp;D race.&quot; Germany&apos;s central bank added to the sense of crisis in the real economy by forecasting a cold winter for manufacturing as orders for German firms from outside the EU are set to dwindle. It said in its monthly report that economic prospects had darkened. Philips remains Europe&apos;s largest consumer electronics firm and a global leader in lighting but it reported an 85% decline in third quarter net profit to \u20ac74m, from \u20ac524m a year earlier. Sales were down 1.3% to \u20ac5.39bn. Frans van Houten, chief executive, said: &quot;We are not yet satisfied with our current financial performance given the ongoing economic challenges, especially in Europe, and operational issues and risks. We do not expect to realise a material performance improvement in the near term.&quot; He said the 4,500 job losses, including 1,400 in the Netherlands, were &quot;a regrettable but inevitable step to improve our operating model to become more agile, lean and competitive&quot; and would provide 60% of the \u20ac800m planned savings. Much of this, he suggested, would be reinvested in innovation. Philips highlighted the relative decline of European industry by showing falling earnings at its two main divisions for higher growth \u2014 lighting and healthcare. Operating profit at the former almost halved to \u20ac110m and fell at the latter from \u20ac282m to \u20ac261m. It no longer even counts the television business as a continuing operation since it is trying to dispose of 70% of it in a joint venture with China&apos;s TPV. But negotiations to offload the TV business were taking longer than expected, it said. Van Houten reiterated commitments to 3-4% sales growth and 10-12% operating margins by mid-2013 but admitted that the firm had a long way to go. It made a net \u20ac1.3bn loss in the second quarter, has issued two profit warnings in seven months and is losing market share to low-cost Asian rivals. Its shares, down almost 40% this year, fell a further 2% in Amsterdam. The latest &quot;EU R&amp;D investment scoreboard&quot; for 2011 shows European companies&apos; investments in innovation up 6.1% in 2010 but those of US firms up 10% and of Chinese firms up 29.5%. Global R&amp;D investment went up 4% last year after falling 1.9% in 2009. Fifteen European companies figure in the first 50 globally, with Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche in top spot followed by its US rival Pfizer. Only two British companies \u2014 GlaxoSmithKline (16th) and AstraZeneca (29th) \u2014 make it into the top 50. More than two-thirds of EU R&amp;D investment comes from Germany, the UK and France, with German firms, led by car-makers, showing the highest growth (8.1%) and UK companies (5.8%) outperforming French ones (3.8%). The EU scoreboard shows signs of recovery in 2010 but Geoghegan-Quinn said the fact that firms were still lagging behind competitors showed conditions for business had to be improved further. The EU has a longstanding target for investment in innovation of 3% of GDP. As the economic prospects darken, some carmakers are cutting back production and/or overtime at their European plants in the current quarter and the Bundesbank, the German central bank, said manufacturing would be hit hard by significantly weakened demand.", "sentences": ["Its shares, down almost 40% this year, fell a further 2% in Amsterdam."], "title": "Philips job cuts herald cold winter for European industry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/philips-job-cuts-european-industry", "tags": ["Europe", "World news", "Business", "Job losses"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-18T12:08:53Z", "article": "The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam counsels visitors not to interpret his last works as clues to his suicide \u2013 which, according to conventional wisdom, took place when the artist shot himself in a field near the doctor&apos;s house that was his last refuge in a world he found almost impossible to inhabit. Last time I was there, a label advised against taking an overly melodramatic view of his roiling blue, black and gold late vision Wheatfield with Crows. Now the museum has once again urged caution, this time about the claim in a new biography that Van Gogh did not shoot himself after all but was mortally wounded in a bizarre accident. Well might the Van Gogh Museum express scepticism. After all, it seems like only yesterday that &quot;scholars&quot; were claiming poor Vincent did not cut off his own ear after all but was injured by Gauguin with a sword. That claim soon vanished into thin air and rightly so. Will this theory be as short-lived? Both claims have the instant appeal of challenging the &quot;myth&quot; of Van Gogh the tortured artist, the man &quot;suicided by society&quot;, in the words of Antonin Artaud. Yet both come up against the mystery of why he never mentioned that he had been injured by others. In the case of his ear, it would seem strange that he allowed himself to be hounded by locals as a dangerous madman and incarcerated in asylum without mentioning that, oh, by the way, he was the victim of an assault. Similarly in this case, asks the BBC&apos;s Will Gompertz, why let his family think he&apos;d killed himself if that was not the case? He managed to walk back home and survived the gunshot to his chest long enough to speak out. But the truly misleading thing here is the idea that it makes much difference to how we see Van Gogh. I am not disputing the fascination of his biography, but it is much, much more than a dramatic series of violent incidents. Few artists are better known to us than Van Gogh. His letters constitute a work of art in their own right \u2013 a literary masterpiece. If you want to appreciate them as such, the best places to start, in English, is the Penguin Classics edition of his selected letters that brings out their vivid intimacy, intellectual liveliness and emotional depth. If you want to delve still further, the new edition of the complete letters undertaken by the Van Gogh Museum is exhaustive, and dispiriting. Dispiriting because it reveals the seriousness and extremity of Van Gogh&apos;s emotional troubles. From his complete letters a remorseless self-portrait emerges of a man who from his youth onwards found it very difficult to coexist with others or find a productive place in his 19th-century world. At odds with his parents, with employers, even with the brother who financially supported him, Vincent nursed the darkest of thoughts and made his own existence virtually impossible. He comes across in his own correspondence like a character out of Dostoevsky. Not many who read his letters will find suicide a surprising end to his story. That doesn&apos;t mean the authors of the new biography are necessarily wrong, but it does make their proposed revision less important than it might seem at first glance. You can argue about the incident. You cannot deny his life expressed the urge.", "sentences": ["The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam counsels visitors not to interpret his last works as clues to his suicide \u2013 which, according to conventional wisdom, took place when the artist shot himself in a field near the doctor&apos;s house that was his last refuge in a world he found almost impossible to inhabit."], "title": "Did Van Gogh kill himself?

Slightly to the east of Rotterdam, it boasts former prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende as its most famous resident, while the former prison houses a small historical museum, the Dief en Duifhuis (&quot;house of thieves and pigeons&quot;). But oddly, the town is also the base for companies such as BP Pipelines Vietnam BV and Amoco Chemical Malaysia Holding BV \u2013 subsidiaries of the oil majors that initially appear to be a long way from home. While these Asian-sounding entities&apos; choice of a Netherlands base may look unorthodox, it is far from ground-breaking. Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport is home to AA Holdings Argentina BV \u2013 part of mining firm Anglo American \u2013 while a 20-mile taxi ride across the Hollandse Brug (bridge) to the east will take you to Lelystad airport, clearly the natural home of Rio Tinto&apos;s Mali Diamond Exploration BV. Which is why, despite its standing as a sanctuary for liberals, the country is fast gaining a reputation as another type of haven. A recent report by tax campaign group Publish What You Pay Norway found that more than a third of the subsidiaries owned by major energy and mining companies \u2013 including Shell, BP and Glencore \u2013 are based in &quot;secrecy jurisdictions&quot; where company accounts are not publicly available. The report singled out the Netherlands as the second favourite such home for extractive industry companies, a tag justified by the authors on the grounds that the country does not put details of trusts on public record, require company accounts or beneficial ownership to be publicly available, nor maintain company ownership details in official records. Aggressive The report says: &quot;Among the 358 Netherlands subsidiaries belonging to the world&apos;s most powerful extractive industry companies are subsidiaries whose names suggest their physical assets are held in a country which is not the Netherlands.&quot; On the same day as the release of the PWYP Norway report, a new book called Commodities: Switzerland&apos;s Most Dangerous Business was published by the Zurich-based NGO the Berne Declaration. It found: &quot;There is a typical structure for aggressive tax avoidance: trading activity and [a] tax home in Switzerland, a Dutch holding company for temporary storage of global income, and one or more vehicles in tax havens for the non-transparent and final destination of profits. That&apos;s how Trafigura paid only 0.6% tax in 2010. Measured at the standard rate, the trader saved roughly $500m between 2005 and 2010.&quot; Oliver Classen of the Berne Declaration said: &quot;So why such complex structures? Obviously because the profit is worth it, because of tax savings. But why place [profits] with the parent holding company in the Netherlands and not Switzerland, with its very favourable tax exemptions for holdings? Because then you can have both: an attractive network of double tax agreements, as Switzerland lacks agreements with Brazil, Nigeria, Argentina; and the favourable taxes of Switzerland, as the Netherlands allows their holding companies to pay the big part of taxes in another country. Equipped with double tax agreements, the parent holding company can serve as a distribution platform to easily exchange money between all the different entities. Finally the profits are often placed offshore, such as in employee trusts.&quot; A series of other tax laws that add to the Netherlands&apos;s allure. Koos de Bruijn, of Tax Justice Netherlands, said: &quot;The Netherlands is an increasingly attractive location for multinationals to place holding companies, because of the tax treaties it has with over 100\u00a0countries. Along with these come the Netherlands&apos;s famous participation exemption [exemption from taxation for a shareholder in a company on dividends received, and potential capital gains arising on the sale of shares], the absence of withholding [source] taxes on interest and royalties, the possibility of being able to conclude tax rulings [before paying tax], the use of legal co-operation and the so-called innovation box, a special fiscal arrangement designed for research and development.&quot; All of which has started to push the issue towards the front of the news agenda in the Netherlands, where the country&apos;s financial daily paper, Financieele Dagblad, has published a string of articles on the topic. Furthermore, in his 2007 paper The Central Role of Dutch Financing Companies in Tax Avoidance Strategies, Francis Wezig wrote: &quot;It turns out that many conduit constructions involve affiliates in the Netherlands. These affiliates are officially registered by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) as special financial institutions (SFIs). According to the DNB definition, SFIs are foreign-owned and are used at least partly for fiscal reasons. The SFI register is not public \u2026 the Netherlands is the largest conduit country worldwide.&quot; In the US, President Barack Obama presented a series of proposals in 2009 to curb offshore tax benefits. While he did not name the Netherlands in his speech, the fact sheet distributed with it said nearly a third of foreign profits reported by such corporations in 2003 came from three low-tax countries: Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands. A spokeswoman for the Dutch ministry of finance said: &quot;Like many other countries, such as the UK, the Netherlands has a participation exemption. Dividends paid by subsidiaries to a parent company in the Netherlands are exempted under certain conditions. The purpose is to avoid economic double taxation, as the profits are already taxed at the level of the subsidiary. The participation exemption does not apply to subsidiaries that can be qualified as portfolio investments. The Netherlands has an extensive network of double tax treaties and levies no source taxation on royalties and interest. The system is fully transparent; the Netherlands has mechanisms to exchange information with more than 100 countries.&quot; BP, Amoco, Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Trafigura did not comment.

There is, however, another side to the story of science&apos;s relation to belief: the idea held by many atheists that science is not only on their side, but is their best buddy. The uncomfortable truth for believers and atheists alike is that science is a loner who never shies from revealing embarrassing truths about anyone who tries to claim ownership of it. This is not the rather silly view that science is &quot;just another myth&quot;, that the physics of Niels Bohr is no more &quot;valid&quot; than the poetry of Beowulf. Indeed, I&apos;m not sure that anyone who gave this more than a second&apos;s thought really believes this. John Gray often sounds as though he does, but what he actually says is that science &quot;has become a vehicle for myths&quot;, such as that of inevitable progress, not that science itself is no better way of understanding the world than folk beliefs about sun gods or earth spirits. Talk about &quot;myths&quot; seems to me to be a cheap way of trying to equate secular problems with science with religious ones, when really they are quite different. While the religious merely need to find a way to co-exist with science, atheist humanism often claims too close a kinship with it. Science is portrayed as what underlies and vindicates the humanist outlook. In one very important senses this is right. Atheism may be defined negatively as opposed to theism, but atheists are first and foremost naturalists, committed to a positive view of the universe as containing only natural entities and forces. This view is not held as a matter of faith but because that is what the scientific evidence strongly suggests. If this represents a marriage of science and atheism, then it has to be admitted that in every other respect, the two enjoy a non-exclusive relationship. Take the claim made a few years ago by the British Humanist Association that agreeing with the statement &quot;scientific and other evidence provides the best way to understand the universe&quot; is a distinguishing characteristic of the humanist outlook, or the international humanists&apos; 2002 Amsterdam Declaration, which maintained &quot;Humanism advocates the application of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare&quot;. Both statements are held with equal conviction by many religious believers. It is just that, for them, science leaves many questions open, and in such cases we are entitled to base our judgements on non-scientific grounds. Only the most fanatically scientistic would insist otherwise, demanding that, of which science cannot speak, we must remain silent. You might find the odd such person standing in front of a painting, only interested in knowing what their brain is doing in response to the visual stimulus, but such a person would be just that: odd. Atheism does not own the scientific method, and nor does good, secular thinking reduce to scientific reasoning. What is too often forgotten is that modern atheism was born in a humanistic way of thinking that drew as much on arts and humanities as it did natural science, if not more so. Most problematic of all, however, is the sometimes glib way in which science is supposed to vindicate, or even determine, the secular humanist approach to life. First of all, it seems very clear that science actually threatens to undermine many of the cherished beliefs traditionally held by secular humanists. Most obviously, secular humanism upholds the value of the autonomous, free, rational individual. If the science of humanity has shown anything at all over recent decades it is that human beings are far less autonomous, rational and free than we usually suppose. As a matter of fact, I don&apos;t think any of these challenges defeats what really matters about the humanist view of ourselves. But to argue this would be difficult and I&apos;m not sure I could successfully do so as yet. What&apos;s more, it remains possible that progress in science really will shatter a few atheist shibboleths in time. These are reasons enough to think that by embracing science so closely, atheists are only making it easier for it to stab them in back. What&apos;s worse, however, is when atheists talk of science as though it is the source of all the knowledge and wisdom we need to live. The most egregious recent example of this is Sam Harris&apos;s The Moral Landscape, with its subtitle &quot;How science can determine human values&quot;. It&apos;s hard to imagine a more hyperbolic claim about the power of science, and when I interviewed Harris about his book, most of the time was spent trying \u2013 unsuccessfully on my part \u2013 to understand it in a way that was remotely plausible (you can listen to some of that interview in this podcast). When Harris sounds convincing is when he is attacking the batty view that science has nothing to say about human values. Scientific evidence might indeed reveal morally important facts, such as that inequality as well as absolute levels of wealth affects wellbeing; that different &quot;races&quot; are not that different and not really races; that some animals do feel pain, and of what kind it is; and so on. Science can also reveal the physiological and neurological mechanisms that underlie the things we value in life, like achieving states of flow or avoiding pain. But science could never tell us what we should value, because when it tells us how things are, we are always left with the question, what ought we to do about it? It can, for instance, tell us that X produces more happiness than Y, but it cannot tell us that we ought to do whatever produces the greatest happiness. The rapturous reception Harris&apos;s book received from many atheists \u2013 though thankfully far from all of them \u2013 is a symptom of an unhealthy desire to raise science to the level of our saviour. That is the kind of mythologising Gray is right to warn against. Science is indeed one of our highest human achievements and we should respect it, admire it and draw on its findings to inform our world view. But it cannot provide the entirety of such a view and nor can we blithely assume that it will always support our most fundamental beliefs. Atheists need to accept that they are not of one flesh with science, and that their love and admiration may not be requited as passionately as they suppose. The upshot of this and last week&apos;s argument is that science is not such a large problem for religion as atheists suppose, but not such a small problem as the religious suppose, and not as much of an ally to humanists as they suppose. All of which means that science just isn&apos;t as central to the disputes between believers and atheists as almost everyone seems to suppose. It&apos;s time to move on.", "sentences": ["Take the claim made a few years ago by the British Humanist Association that agreeing with the statement &quot;scientific and other evidence provides the best way to understand the universe&quot; is a distinguishing characteristic of the humanist outlook, or the international humanists&apos; 2002 Amsterdam Declaration, which maintained &quot;Humanism advocates the application of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare&quot;."], "title": "Science is independent of humanism, atheism and religion | Julian Baggini", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/21/science-atheism-humanism-religion", "tags": ["Atheism", "Science", "Religion", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-21T10:09:58Z", "article": "Yeah, that Bj\u00f6rk app again. The Biophilia project has been covered at length by The Guardian, but her app-album remains the subject of intense interest from musicians, record labels and app developers alike. That was certainly the case at the Amsterdam Dance Event conference, where Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s collaborator on Biophilia, Scott Snibbe, gave a keynote speech setting it in the wider context of his two decades working on interactive music projects. That&apos;s an important thing about Biophilia: it builds on a lot of the work Snibbe was doing in the days when the things people do in apps now required $70,000-worth of specialist equipment to run. He&apos;s making the direct link between then and now, for example with plans to release an iOS app in November based on Motion Phone, a piece of software designed to let two people perform an electronic music duet that was shown at the SIGGRAPH conference in 1995. Snibbe&apos;s past projects also include customising console controllers to control generative music software, &quot;The challenge was to find some way of distributing this,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the prototypes, and tried talking to Sony to get a video-game distribution deal, but all that stuff fell through at the time. We were trying to find creative, open-ended ways to interact with music that weren&apos;t turning it into a game. Guitar Hero pigeonholed music into the same idiom as a normal game, trying to get a score. You don&apos;t get a score using Pro Tools, right?&quot; Snibbe and his collaborator Lukas Girling were, as you might expect, pretty excited when Apple released its first iPad: a device capable not only of running this kind of software, but providing a built-in distribution channel to get it out to other people. &quot;We almost had a heart attack out of excitement that our lives hadn&apos;t been lived in vain!&quot; he said. &quot;There was suddenly a way to distribute this type of work.&quot; Cue the release of iOS apps like Oscilloscoop and Bubble Harp, which swiftly attracted attention from musicians looking for creative music apps on their iPads. Not that this was Snibbe&apos;s original intention. &quot;We were trying to reach a mainstream audience with these: people who have never had that experience of creating music on their own,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a surprise that so many professional musicians wanted to use these apps, and what we&apos;ve been working on in the last few months is making this a professional tool too.&quot; With the Biophilia app now complete, Snibbe has been focusing on adding professional features to his previous apps, although he said that he is intent on ensuring they continue to straddle that boundary between amateur musicmakers and professionals. In their existing form, they caught the attention of Bj\u00f6rk in the early stages of recording Biophilia, at a time when she was already using touchscreen instruments to compose and record, as well as some custom-designed devices using gestures and even console controllers. No wonder she hit it off with Snibbe, once the decision had been made to make Biophilia an app, rather than Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s original idea of making it a touring exhibition with a house where every room would contain a song. After that idea was shelved, there was talk of making it an iMax film with director Michel Gondry, but that too fell by the wayside. &quot;When the iPad came out, she saw myself and a couple of other interactive artists and developers creating these naturalistic music apps, and invited us to come and work with her on the project,&quot; said Snibbe. &quot;Biophilia is the first app album that&apos;s ever been made. An individual app element corresponds to every song.&quot; From the tunnel racing of Crystalline to the cell tapping in Virus and lightning drawing of Thunderbolt, the app deserves its talked-about status: it&apos;s creative, fun and\u2026 educational? Snibbe admitted that he &quot;hates that word \u2013 it usually means boring&quot;, but pointed to Virus as an example of a musical experience that subtly teaches people how viruses work. &quot;There&apos;s nothing more interesting than our universe and its structure in all forms, but our schools manage to make almost anything boring: even music or science,&quot; he said.     Scott Snibbe gave his keynote speech at the Amsterdam Dance Event    After showing Biophilia to the ADE audience, Snibbe talked engagingly about its relationship to the actual music, and the wider issues about the potential of apps for musicians. &quot;This isn&apos;t an add-on to the audio album. The album was conceived as this fully interactive project, and this is the strongest expression of it,&quot; he said, before drawing a direct link between the Biophilia app, and the days when most albums were listened to on vinyl, which necessitated listening to them in a fixed location on a turntable. &quot;You&apos;d often sit on the carpet and let the whole thing wash over you while looking at the liner notes and artwork: it was a complete, immersive, sensory experience,&quot; he said. &quot;That was the falling in love stage with the music, but I&apos;m sad to say many of us may not have felt it in a really long time.&quot; Snibbe thinks that one of the downsides to the digitisation of music is that this falling in love stage has turned into a &quot;casual relationship&quot;, where people skip around albums, or listen to songs while walking, travelling and doing other things. &quot;You miss that falling in love period, and go immediately to the &apos;brushing your teeth together in the bathroom phase&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;But an app can demand all of your senses and attention at once. That&apos;s something exciting for musicians. A lot of them lament the demise of the album experience due to digital distribution. But one thing about the app-album is it reclaims people&apos;s attention for an entire album.&quot; Does music need to be interactive, though? One criticism of Biophilia has been the expectation that people will be interactive, rather than simply listening to the music itself.  Snibbe&apos;s argument is that music being non-interactive was a phenomenon of the recorded music era. He pointed out that in the 19th century, sheet music was &quot;the killer app&quot; \u2013 people bought it, took it home and then played songs with whatever instruments they had to hand. &quot;If the era of pre-recorded media lasted from 1930 to 2010, we may be entering the interactive age of media now, the age of interactivity,&quot; said Snibbe. &quot;We may look back at it as just a blip in history, when due to technology limitations, music, film and other entertainment experiences were only one-way.&quot; When fielding audience questions, Snibbe was asked about the future for music apps. He&apos;d like Apple to put a proper 3D camera into the iPad to enable Kinect-like features for people to &quot;use your whole body in space to interact with these pieces&quot;, but otherwise said that he feels more of a sense of freedom that there&apos;s finally a category of devices to distribute his ideas from the last 20-25 years of research projects. He also heaped praise on Bj\u00f6rk as a collaborator, saying their initial meeting lasted for six hours as she explained every song on Biophilia and the story behind it, as well as her vision for how they might work on visual experiences. &quot;She had very specific ideas about the interactivity with the music,&quot; he said. &quot;80% or 90% of this is Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s vision, but she&apos;s so gentle in the way she communicates it. She&apos;s not at all a tyrant. It took me a while to realise that when she says &apos;Let me think about it&apos;, it means &apos;HELL no!&apos;&quot; Snibbe admitted that Biophilia would have been &quot;very expensive&quot; as a work-for-hire project. However, the decision to make it a joint venture between Bj\u00f6rk, his company and label One Little Indian mitigated that. No sales figures have been announced for the app so far, although it is still early days, given that all the track-apps have only been available for a matter of weeks. Can something like Biophilia be suitable for more artists, given that expense? Snibbe said that he thinks creatively, it&apos;s well suited to musicians with an artistic background or a good visual sense - whether for videos or live sets. &quot;Most musicians don&apos;t just want to create a one-dimensional stream of sound as their final artwork,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe nine out of ten artists have an audiovisual vision for their work\u2026 But few artists are creating concept albums, and that&apos;s what it&apos;s best suited for: where the whole album has some coherent structure. Even for major artists, that might only be one or two albums in their career: the Dark Side Of The Moons or Sergeant Peppers \u2013 albums with strong visual and conceptual components.&quot; Snibbe added that despite the expense of creating Biophilia, &quot;if it&apos;s financially successful, there&apos;ll be a huge rush towards it&quot; from other artists.", "sentences": ["That was certainly the case at the Amsterdam Dance Event conference, where Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s collaborator on Biophilia, Scott Snibbe, gave a keynote speech setting it in the wider context of his two decades working on interactive music projects.", "Scott Snibbe gave his keynote speech at the Amsterdam Dance Event    After showing Biophilia to the ADE audience, Snibbe talked engagingly about its relationship to the actual music, and the wider issues about the potential of apps for musicians."], "title": "Scott Snibbe talks Bj\u00f6rk's Biophilia apps and interactive music", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/oct/21/scott-snibbe-bjork-biophilia-app", "tags": ["Apps", "Bj\u00f6rk", "Music", "iPad", "iPhone", "Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "Technology", "Media", "Digital media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-21T13:43:05Z", "article": "A convicted kidnapper hopes to halt the release of a new thriller starring Rutger Hauer because he fears it will damage his reputation \u2013 even though he was found guilty of the crime presented in the film and is currently behind bars. Willem Holleeder was one of four men jailed for their part in the 1983 kidnapping of brewing magnate Freddy Heineken, who is portrayed by Blade Runner star Hauer in The Heineken Kidnapping. The Dutch film presents the story from the point of view of the lager tycoon, who was abducted in Amsterdam at gunpoint and held for three weeks with his chauffeur Ab Doderer. The pair were eventually released following a reported ransom payment of 35m guilders (\u00a322m in today&apos;s money), but a high-profile police manhunt eventually brought the perpetrators to justice. Around a fifth of the money was never recovered. Heineken, who built his company up from a minor concern into the world&apos;s third-largest brewing company, largely withdrew from public life following the abduction. Holleeder&apos;s lawyers say The Heineken Kidnapping portrays Holleeder and his cohorts as more violent than they actually were and have applied to a court in Amsterdam for an injunction halting the release of the thriller, which is due out in Holland next week. They say the film will make it difficult for their client to reintegrate with society once he is released. In an interview with Dutch press agency ANP the film&apos;s director, Maarten Treurniet, dismissed Holleeder&apos;s complaint. &quot;In my eyes, he suffered the bulk of the damage to his reputation when he kidnapped Heineken. This is peanuts by comparison,&quot; he said. Holleeder is currently behind bars serving a nine-year sentence for leading a criminal organisation and extortion following a separate 2007 trial. Real-estate magnate and extortion victim Willem Endstra, who was later killed in unresolved circumstances, reportedly told police the accused had ordered as many as 25 murders. Nevertheless, Holleeder has never been charged with any killings.

You&apos;re never more than a 10-minute cycle ride from a movie. Kriterion is located just on the border of the tourist-heavy town centre, in a leafy but cool neighbourhood that is a welcome retreat from the sleazy red light district and coffee shops. It&apos;s one of the most popular in the city. Crowd scene: Surprisingly eclectic for a cinema situated across the road from the University of Amsterdam. There are plenty of students, but seniors, young professionals, and even children populate the downstairs cafe on a Friday night. Back story: A dramatic history that dates back to the second world war, when Stichting Kriterion \u2013 a group of students who&apos;d been active in the anti-Nazi resistance \u2013 decided to open the Kriterion in 1945. It ran as a charitable foundation helping students with living costs and was at the centre of leftwing student politics throughout the 60s. In 1982, when Stichting Kriterion tried to close the cinema down, a breakaway group (Vereniging Kriterion) occupied the building, took complete control of the cinema and started to run it by without a management structure. This unique concept has worked successfully for nearly 30 years. The Kriterion philosophy has caught on and there is now a student-run Kriterion in Sarajevo. The Amsterdam-based Studio K opened recently with the same philosophy. Noteworthy: Controversial film-maker Theo Van Gogh was a regular and premiered some of his films here before his murder in 2004. Show business: A diverse programme with on average nine films a day, which at the moment includes everything from George Clooney&apos;s The Ides of March to foodie doc El Bulli. They screen Modern Classics every week (October&apos;s season included The 39 Steps and Yojimbo). Parental guidance: A kids&apos; club for children under 13 years old shows a quality family film the last Sunday of the month with parties and activities, plus there are showings of kid-friendly features almost daily. Senior service: No dedicated club, but they offer seniors discounts on all shows (\u20ac6.50 instead of \u20ac8). Tickets: All tickets are \u20ac8, discounted tickets (seniors, students) are \u20ac6.50. You can bulk buy tickets for a discount and films in the Modern Classics and Sneak Preview strains are only \u20ac5. This makes Kriterion one of the cheapest cinemas in Amsterdam. Medium popcorn and soft drink : No popcorn here; a small but good selection of drinks at the bar though: beers are \u20ac2-\u20ac3.50, coffees and teas \u20ac1.70, sodas and juices \u20ac1.90 Camera fodder: High quality, inexpensive nachos and sandwiches cost \u20ac2-\u20ac3. Alcohol: As you would expect in Amsterdam, a wide variety of premium lagers, including local micro-breweries, and a respectable selection of spirits are available. &quot;I don&apos;t mean just like in a paper cup, I&apos;m talking about a glass of beer,&quot; as John Travolta said in Pulp Fiction. Auditorium: Three comfortably sized screens (K1, K2, K3), hold 198, 85 and 67, respectively. Good sight-lines and seats across the board. Projection: They project in 35mm and 1.4k digital but from are upgrading to 2K digital (but keeping the 35mm) in January. Disabled access: All three screens and the bar are fully accessible through a lift and there&apos;s a disabled toilet on the ground floor. Events: In line with its political roots, Kriterion hosts a monthly night called Movies That Matter in conjunction with Amnesty International. In 2008, it hosted an all-night election party celebrating Obama&apos;s victory. Music nights are common in the cafe/bar. Kriterion, given its student makeup, is unsurprisingly known as the cinema that parties, but also is a venue for IDFA (the world&apos;s largest doc fest), the Imagine festival and the Balkan Snapshots festival. Toilets: Everyone, including the programmer and the board members, has to clean these ... and they are sparkling. Staff: Composed entirely of students from the University of Amsterdam, they are, as in most Dutch establishments, polite without being irksome. There&apos;s a laidback, but efficient vibe. Pros: Great programme, atmosphere, history and a unique way of running a business. Cons: Amsterdam is spoilt for choice when it comes to cinemas, so the only problem is the tough competition Kriterion faces.

The dwellings will have to be converted, and will start coming into use in 2013.  Meanwhile, the Olympic Park Development Company (OPLC), which will lead the park&apos;s transition from a sporting crucible to a whole new neighbourhood, has recently submitted detailed planning applications for its 158 acre legacy communities scheme - there are 5,000 pages of it - which includes five new residential areas lately named by the public.  Great stress is laid in the plans on creating &quot;connectivity&quot; between the park&apos;s new communities, facilities that will include schools, health centres and libraries as well as open spaces and Olympic sports venues converted for public use, and the surrounding areas. Some parts of those surrounding areas will fall more under the control of the London mayor after the OPLC metamorphoses into the Mayoral Development Corporation.

For once I&apos;d chosen the road rather than the cycle path, which was some way away down a dyke. All of a sudden, the sedate caravanners passing me hit their horns in the kind of ear-splitting protest that would make a London minicab driver blush. Then the police arrived, and I had to give an Oscar-winning performance as dumb tourist to escape a fine. It took time to sink in: the cycling facilities were so good that their use was obligatory, and enforced by the police. For a cyclist raised on the mixture of antagonism and neglect that still characterises London&apos;s cycling culture, it was a shock. And when members of the London Cycle Campaign recently voted for their 2012 mayoral election campaign to be &quot;Go Dutch \u2013 clear space for cycling on London&apos;s main roads&quot;, it struck me that they will have to bring about an enormous shift in attitudes in a very short space of time. The idealisation of Dutch cycling in the British cycling press omits to mention that being a respected, mainstream means of transport incurs responsibilities as well as offering rights. Laws about lights, bells, bikes on trains, as well as compulsory paths, are rigorously policed. Taking a bike on a train requires a \u20ac6 ticket in addition to the cyclist&apos;s fare \u2013 a significant cost for regular leisure riders. None of this is unreasonable when the other side of the bargain is the combination of amenity and respect accorded to Dutch cyclists. But mutual respect takes a long time to build. A recent article (with an excellent video documentary) explains that it took the Netherlands about 25 years to get where it is today, from the depths of a child-killing car-centred policy in the 1970s. Dutch perceptions of their system are as much about a culture of respect as they are about separate lanes. &quot;Segregation,&quot; Marc van Woudenberg of the blog Amsterdamize tells me, &quot;is just one (important) part of bicycle policies in the Netherlands, complemented with integral spatial planning, traffic calming, bike facilities and effective traffic laws.&quot; &quot;Strict Liability,&quot; explains GJ Baan of Dutch gear shop And Dutch, &quot;is supported by the Dutch law ...

I feel respected as a cyclist, and therefore I&apos;m more likely to respect the traffic rules.&quot; Eric van der Horst, of the Cycling Dutchman blog, explains that motorists in the Netherlands are much more tightly regulated: &quot;The hazards of speeding are fully recognised: speed limits are present everywhere, margins for offenders are tiny, paid parking is up to five times more expensive than in the UK.&quot; The safety of having separate lanes has often been questioned. Though there are many variables, and conclusions are contested, most studies suggest that separate paths, if anything, make cycling more dangerous, because junctions \u2013 where most accidents occur \u2013 are more complicated. In Germany, the law governing urban cycle path creation was recently changed. The ADFC (CTC equivalent) said: &quot;Behind this change is a recognition, through research into road accidents, that physically separate cycle paths make the chance of an accident higher for cyclists than following the road.&quot; Parts of the biking blogosphere already suspect the LCC&apos;s heart is not in its Go Dutch campaign. LCC board member Oliver Schick has argued that a network of separate paths in central London would be impossible to implement effectively. Separate paths have a placebo effect. They create, as Tom Godefrooij of the Dutch Cycling Embassy explains, &quot;the perception of both safety and convenience&quot;. Their popularity is, in itself, a good reason for building some. But in reducing the Dutch approach to being mainly about paths, LCC is misrepresenting it. Their campaigns for a 20mph speed limit (widespread in the Netherlands), and the crucial issue of strict liability would make a more sensible centrepiece for Go Dutch. LCC&apos;s emphasis on &quot;London&apos;s main roads&quot; is also strange. With the exception of short stretches of essential main road-sharing (over bridges, by stations etc), why would you want to cycle in such noise, danger and pollution, when there are faster and more pleasant routes through back streets, parks and towpaths? This kind of route requires only some intelligent planning (in short supply at TfL, alas) and signposting. Bloggers Mark Ames and Olaf Storbeck have both shown recently how small, intelligent changes to road permissions and layouts can create a great facility. British cities are much larger than Dutch; there is ample quiet space for cyclists without going anywhere near our main roads. The Dutch achievement in blazing a cycling trail long before it was fashionable is immense. Their example, and the arrival of peak car, should make it easier for us. Their success is due to much more than separate lanes \u2013 permeability, backed up with technology like Copenhagen&apos;s Greenwave of traffic light timing, is crucial. But the biggest barrier on the road to creating a widespread cycling culture in the UK is tackling speed limits and a pro-motorist legal bias.", "sentences": ["&quot;Segregation,&quot; Marc van Woudenberg of the blog Amsterdamize tells me, &quot;is just one (important) part of bicycle policies in the Netherlands, complemented with integral spatial planning, traffic calming, bike facilities and effective traffic laws.&quot; &quot;Strict Liability,&quot; explains GJ Baan of Dutch gear shop And Dutch, &quot;is supported by the Dutch law ...

But when police examined his background after his arrest over the death of Joanna Yeates they unearthed a secret life that they believe helps to explain why he killed his next-door neighbour. Computer analysts found the Dutch engineer appeared to have a fascination with pornography depicting violence towards women. In some of the films he viewed, men held women by the neck while they had sex. Detectives found that while away on business Tabak contacted escorts and prostitutes, and during a trip to California may have paid for sex. Prosecutors in the case believe Tabak&apos;s fixation on hardcore pornography helps to make the case that this was a sex crime. They feel that his research on and suspected use of prostitutes shows that his respectable outward life was a lie. After his arrest in January, analysts delved deep into four computers Tabak had access to and found disturbing material. Police discovered images and films showing women bound, gagged, degraded and controlled by men. They also found a film in which two women were bundled into a car boot. In legal argument not heard by the jury, Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said Tabak clearly liked films showing women being held by the neck and claimed this ought to be spelled out in open court. &quot;It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life,&quot; he said. Detectives were particularly interested by three images of a slight, blonde-haired woman resembling Yeates who in one shot was pulling up her pink top to expose her breasts. When Yeates&apos;s body was found three miles from her Bristol flat, her pink top was pulled up exposing her bra and part of one breast. Tabak&apos;s DNA was found on her chest. The pictures of the blonde woman in pink had a &quot;resonance&quot; with the way Yeates&apos;s body was found, Lickley argued. Police believe Tabak may have pulled her shirt up either before or after death. The time at which Tabak was looking at some of these images was also important, the police and prosecution believe. Police found that on the morning of the killing, 17 December last year, Tabak had accessed a pornographic website, although it is not clear if he viewed any films. He &quot;certainly&quot; had pornography on his mind, said Lickley. And after Yeates&apos;s death Tabak switched between looking at online articles relating to Yeates and watching pornographic films. On one day within two minutes he went from researching the Yeates inquiry to viewing pornographic films, some of which contained images of women being held by the throat. In a film viewed at this time a woman tells a man: &quot;Choke me.&quot; Lickley argued that the pornography found on Tabak&apos;s computer could indicate that on 17 December he graduated from being a viewer of violent images to a &quot;participant&quot;. In further legal argument it emerged that in the months leading up to Yeates&apos;s death Tabak researched and contacted escort agencies. In May 2010 while on a business trip in Newcastle, Tabak apparently accessed a website called AdultWork that lists &quot;adult service providers&quot;. Detectives claim they established that he made late-night calls to numbers associated with escort agencies. In November Tabak went to California on business and again began researching sex sites and contacting escort agencies. One site he looked at was called 007exoticgirls. He paid a subscription to another, theeroticreview, which offers &quot;escort contact information&quot;. Names in which police found he had shown an interest included &quot;Princess Butter&quot; and &quot;Rebecca Divine&quot;. On Friday 3 December, two weeks before he killed Yeates, Tabak made telephone contact with &quot;Mimi&quot;, Lickley told the judge. The call was returned and almost immediately Tabak made two cash withdrawals of $100 each. On 5 December Tabak left the hotel his company had paid for and checked in under a false name, Francis Tabak, at the Peach Tree Inn in San Luis Obispo, 150 miles from Los Angeles. The prosecution believes the withdrawal of cash and the checking into a hotel under a false name could be evidence of him paying for sexual services. Mr Justice Field, the trial judge, accepted that the viewing of pornography showing violence or a threat of violence was &quot;reprehensible&quot;. But he did not allow the jury to hear the evidence because he felt its value in explaining why Tabak acted as he did could not outweigh the prejudice it would cause his defence. He also turned down the prosecution&apos;s suggestion that the evidence about escort agencies should go before the jury to correct the impression Tabak gave of being sexually naive and in a loving, monogamous relationship. The jury was left ignorant of what the police believed was important evidence. There is little that seems extraordinary in Tabak&apos;s life before the events of last year. He was born in 1978 and brought up in the small town of Uden, near Eindhoven in the Netherlands. He has three sisters and a brother. At the age of 18 Tabak began studying at the faculty of architecture, building and planning at Eindhoven University of Technology. He graduated in 2003 with a master of science degree and started a PhD, his topic how people use space in buildings and public areas. Tabak finally left university when he was 29. His first job began in September 2007 in Bath at the headquarters of the international engineering consultants Buro Happold, where he worked as a &quot;people flow analyst&quot;, examining how people moved around schools, airports and sports stadiums. On the day Yeates died he was looking at how pilgrims circulate around Mecca. By the time his PhD was published, in 2008, there had been joy and sadness in his personal life. His father, Gerald, died. &quot;I miss you and regret that you are not able to see the end result of my PhD,&quot; Tabak wrote in the acknowledgments to his thesis. But he had met his first serious (possibly his only) girlfriend, Tanja Morson, the daughter of a Harvard-educated lawyer, through the Guardian&apos;s online dating site Soulmates. In the same acknowledgments he thanked Morson for her support. &quot;I am very happy she entered my life,&quot; he wrote. Tabak&apos;s first home in the UK was a flat in a Georgian terrace in Bath. In June 2009 he and Morson, who worked for Dyson in Wiltshire, moved in together in Canynge Road, Clifton, Bristol&apos;s upmarket hilltop village. The pair seemed content and friends say they had discussed marrying and starting a family. Tabak enjoyed drinks after work and once organised an outing to see a Dutch comedian when he toured the UK. He liked sports, including sailing and bowling. He was interested in photography and travelling, having visited South America and Asia. Snaps of Tabak and Morson capture the couple on days out at Stonehenge and wearing curious clothes (him in a purple skirt, her in a cloth cap and painted-on moustache) at a festival. Friends say he could be immature and needy. When police interviewed him in Amsterdam on New Year&apos;s Eve they were surprised at how his sister fussed over him. After Tabak killed Yeates, he sent desperate text messages to Morson in which, while hiding what he had done, he tried to &quot;reach out to her&quot; for support. Tabak&apos;s actions after he killed Yeates show a mixture of cunning and naivety. Police believe, for instance, that he was sharp enough to buy rock salt to place on a spot in the snow between his flat and Yeates&apos;s where he had dropped the body, and so cover his tracks. He began to carefully research the difference between murder and manslaughter. But his big mistake was to contact the police after they arrested his landlord, Christopher Jefferies, and try to help pin the blame on him. In doing so he asked too many questions about the police investigation and roused the suspicions of the detective sent to interview him. It seems odd that Tabak went from being a viewer of pornography and, possibly, a user of prostitutes to a killer in one leap. Tabak has no criminal record and said in the witness box that he had never been in a police station before his arrest. He steadfastly denied he had got a sexual thrill out of killing Yeates or being aroused when he strangled her. Most of the mysteries that captivated the public at the time of Yeates&apos;s disappearance \u2013 the missing pizza and the sock missing from Yeates&apos;s body when it was found \u2013 have been resolved. Tabak says he threw them in the bin and did not eat the pizza. The central puzzle \u2013 exactly why he acted as he did \u2013 remains the biggest mystery of all.", "sentences": ["When police interviewed him in Amsterdam on New Year&apos;s Eve they were surprised at how his sister fussed over him."], "title": "Vincent Tabak and the porn searches the jury did not hear about", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/vincent-tabak-porn-searches-jury", "tags": ["Joanna Yeates", "Crime", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-10-28T14:38:30Z", "article": "The case began as a missing-person inquiry, made more poignant and newsworthy because the young woman had disappeared during the festive period. But after Joanna Yeates&apos;s frozen body was discovered on a snowy roadside verge on Christmas morning, it became a huge murder hunt and a story that gripped the UK and international media. The solution to the mystery turned out to be simple: the 25-year-old landscape architect was killed by her neighbour, the Dutch-born engineer Vincent Tabak. To the torment of her loved ones, however, the truth about exactly what happened on the night of 17 December last year in Flat one, 44 Canynge Road, Bristol, may never be known. Tabak waited until the last possible moment \u2013 when he was in the witness box \u2013 to offer his version of events. He claims Yeates invited him into her flat and made a flirty remark as they chatted in the kitchen, which encouraged him to make a pass at her.Tabak says she screamed, and to stop her he gripped her throat with his right hand and put his left over her mouth. After about 20 seconds she slumped lifelessly to the floor. The police and prosecution believe there are huge holes in Tabak&apos;s account. They think this was a sex attack and that Tabak might have derived a thrill from the act of strangling his neighbour, from having her at his mercy and under his control. They have suggested Tabak might have been spying on Yeates and may have found an excuse to knock on her door that night rather than being spontaneously invited in. The attack may have started in the hallway, which was found in a chaotic state. It could have continued in the bedroom: one of the earrings Yeates is thought to have been wearing was discovered beneath the duvet. There is also the possibility that something may have happened after Tabak carried Yeates&apos;s body back to his own flat. Certainly, according to the prosecution, there was a delay of more than an hour before he put her body into the boot of his car and drove it away. Finally, what police and pathologists discovered when they examined Yeates&apos;s body suggested more went on than Tabak admits to recalling. She had suffered 43 injuries, including wounds to her face, throat and arms. Though her jeans had not been tampered with, her T-shirt had been pulled up above her breasts and part of her right breast exposed. A sample of Tabak&apos;s DNA was found on her chest, however scientists could not establish what it came from. The bottom line is that nobody apart from Tabak can say what happened \u2013 and he claims his memory of exactly what happened remains sketchy. Not at all sketchy are the last known moments of Yeates&apos;s life. They have become all too familiar. She vanished eight days before Christmas after leaving the Ram pub on Park Street in Bristol, where she had been enjoying after-work drinks with work colleagues. It was cold and snow and ice lay thick on the pavements. Yeates bought a tomato, mozzarella and basil pizza from a supermarket and picked up two bottles of cider from an off-licence. Police believe she got back to her Clifton flat, which was already decorated in readiness for Christmas, at about 8.45pm. Within moments \u2013 at about 8.50pm \u2013 partygoers heading to a nearby house heard two screams. And then silence. Yeates&apos;s boyfriend, Greg Reardon, returned from a weekend away on the evening of Sunday 19 December to find Yeates missing, though her mobile phone, keys, purse and coat were there. At 12.45am he dialled 999 and less than four hours later a police officer banged on the door of Flat two. Tabak answered and denied all knowledge. His denial led to \u2013 in Tabak&apos;s own words \u2013 a &quot;week of hell&quot; for Yeates&apos;s family and friends. Over the next seven days police and family issued a series of increasingly desperate appeals for help in finding her. On 23 December police revisited Tabak and carried out a routine search of the flat he shared with his girlfriend, Tanja Morson, to check Yeates was not there. He joked to friends that they must have thought he had stashed her in a drawer. Tabak and Morson, the daughter of a Harvard-educated lawyer, then left Bristol to spend Christmas in Cambridge at her parents&apos; home. On Christmas Eve, Detective Constable Karen Thomas, a member of the police&apos;s major crime investigation team, spoke to Tabak by telephone about his movements on the night of Yeates&apos;s disappearance. He told her he was in all evening before driving in the early hours of the morning to pick up Morson after a work party. He was able to say he did not know Yeates. She and Reardon moved in at the start of October 2010 and he left for a business trip in California on 6 November, only returning on 11 December, six days before the killing. They were in effect strangers. On Christmas morning, at about the time Tabak and Morson \u2013 who remained ignorant of her boyfriend&apos;s crime \u2013 were opening their gifts, Yeates&apos;s body was found by a dog walker, covered in leaves and a pile of snow next to a quarry wall at Longwood Lane, Failand, three miles from Clifton. It looked as if the killer had tried to heave the body over the wall. Had he succeeded Yeates could still be a missing person. The media interest became a frenzy. One tabloid suggested Yeates may have been held captive for several days before she was killed. Another theory was that she may have been dumped at the scene alive and died of hypothermia. The public was fascinated by the details. What had happened to the pizza, which was never found? Why had she bought two bottles of cider? Was she meeting someone? Was the killer waiting for her at the flat? Why was there no sign of a break-in? Only Tabak knew the truth and he was not telling. On 28 December he and Morson drove via Eurotunnel to the Netherlands where they were to spend new year with Tabak&apos;s family. There was no escape from the Yeates story in the Netherlands. On 30 December, Tabak and Morson watched a television news report of the arrest of Joanna Yeates&apos;s landlord, the former public school teacher Christopher Jefferies, over the killing. At this point Tabak made a huge mistake. Spotting a chance to frame Jefferies, he contacted Avon and Somerset police and suggested the landlord had been out and about in his car on the night of Yeates&apos;s death. The murder team sent DC Karen Thomas to Amsterdam and on New Year&apos;s Eve she spoke to Tabak at a hotel near Schiphol airport for six hours. For the first time, Tabak&apos;s behaviour seemed suspicious. He talked to her about Jefferies but seemed, in Thomas&apos;s words, &quot;overly interested&quot; in the forensic examinations police were carrying out. Tabak also gave Thomas a different version of what he had done on the night of Yeates&apos;s disappearance, explaining that he had gone out twice, once to take photographs of the snow and the second time to go to Asda. He also suggested he may have once set foot in the hallway of Yeates&apos;s flat, not when she was there but when he was chatting to Christopher Jefferies before Yeates disappeared. Thomas asked him to provide a DNA sample and fingerprints so they could be eliminated if they were found in the flat. Tabak appeared concerned but cooperated. Jefferies was released on police bail on New Year&apos;s day and Avon and Somerset police found themselves on the back foot, having to deny they were back to square one. Tabak, of course, assumed the net was closing in. When he and Morson drove back to the UK on 2 January, Tabak expected to be arrested as soon as he cleared customs. Every day he waited for the police to knock on his door. He began to drink and take sleeping pills. He thought about jumping off Clifton suspension bridge. The knock finally came on 20 January \u2013 three weeks after he spoke to police in Amsterdam. He was told that his DNA had linked him to Yeates&apos;s body. He tried to blame the laboratory that had carried out the testing, suggesting it was insecure, even that a scientist may have been paid to set him up. But the DNA evidence was damning and 30 days after killing Joanna Yeates, Vincent Tabak appeared before Bristol magistrates charged with her murder. In May at the Old Bailey he admitted manslaughter but denied murder. In court he told his extraordinary story during two days in the witness box. How, after Yeates&apos;s death, he had bundled her body into his car boot before going shopping to Asda for beer and crisps and texting his girlfriend that he was &quot;bored&quot;. He accepted that, following the killing, he had researched subjects such as the difference between murder and manslaughter and the definition of sexual assault. But he repeatedly said he could not remember how Yeates had come by her 43 injuries \u2013 beamed on screens around the court \u2013 or even whether she had been frightened. Privately, detectives believe Tabak can recall what happened in Yeates&apos;s flat perfectly. They think he calculated that there was no point in denying that he had killed her but gambled that the detectives would not be able to prove he meant to do so. Avon and Somerset police may now have some questions to answer. Why did they not look into Yeates&apos;s next-door neighbour more closely until he contacted them with supposed information about Christopher Jefferies? Did they preserve the scene of the crime properly in the early days? Why did it still take three weeks for them to arrest Tabak after he gave his DNA sample? The police deny they were slow in getting to Tabak, saying he left the Bristol area before Yeates&apos; body was found. Officers also revealed that it was &quot;early January&quot; when they had an &quot;interesting development&quot; regarding Tabak&apos;s DNA sample and possible links to Yeates&apos; body. Confirmation took more time. Of course, in the end, the death of Joanna Yeates and the continuing agony her family must suffer partly because so much remains unclear is down to Vincent Tabak. &quot;He is a clever young man who thinks he can play a clever game,&quot; said one senior police source.

Der Einsame im Herbst by Robin de Raaff \u2013 at 42, the youngest of the three \u2013 used references to Mahler, Sch\u00f6nberg, Berg and Webern as starting points in his tightly worked piece. The playing was assured, highlighting many textural details. De Raaf aimed to depict the lonely isolation of Sch\u00f6nberg at the end of his life, yet his absorption in the fabric rather than the soul of the music seemed drily academic. Willem Jeths has a fascination for the concerto form, seeing the orchestra as a prism for reflecting and exhanging colours with the soloist. Jeths&apos;s Second Violin Concerto, subtitled Diptych Portrait, relates to his opera H\u00f4tel de P\u00e9kin and the character of the Chinese empress Cixi, with the bipartite structure representing two facets of a single personality, initially dark and complex, ultimately changed by experience. This transition is realised over the course of the stormy virtuoso cadenza, where the recurring appearance of a series of harmonics is the means to realising a more natural order, calmer and enlightened, if not actually serene. Tasmin Little, who premiered the work at Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw last year, played with authority. After the debt to the second Viennese School in the De Raaff and the gestures of late romanticism in Jeths&apos;s music, the tribute to Sibelius in Klas Torstensson&apos;s Fastlandet, however deeply felt, was even more self-conscious.

A black beanie covers her head and, wearing glasses and carrying a backpack, she walks alone towards yet another curved velodrome where all her dreams and doubts will be laid bare again. Early on the second day of the European championships, a week ago today, the greatest women&apos;s sprint cyclist of all time is a dozen metres behind her male counterparts in the British team. Sir Chris Hoy, leading the sprinters, is suffering from flu but he shows little of Pendleton&apos;s fragility. It is hard to know whether the 31-year-old Olympic and multiple world champion feels haunted or focused as she drifts past a camera crew. For once she does not stop to say hello or to reflect candidly on her mood. Pendleton&apos;s gaze is fixed instead on the corridor that leads like a dingy artery into the heart of the velodrome. There, encircled by the wooden track, Pendleton soon takes to the rollers. Slowly, she pumps her legs in the old warm-up routine that has eaten up so many hours of her life. Twelve hours before, glowing from her impressive victory in the final of the team sprint with Jess Varnish, Pendleton had seemed different on these same rollers. Resting her hands on her hips as she warmed down, Pendleton smiled, opened her big eyes wide and told me how much she loved riding with Varnish. I laughed with her when she suggested that, in celebration of their European championship win, she and Varnish would indulge themselves by watching another episode of Downton Abbey back in their hotel room. It would be one way to switch off before the trials of Saturday and the individual sprint \u2013 which had once been Pendleton&apos;s domain but now presents her greatest psychological test. The individual sprint is a brutal examination of will, self-belief and often domineering tactics designed to expose the weaker rider in a one-on-one battle. In contrast, the team sprint is a straightforward time trial. After years of uncertainty over who might partner her at next year&apos;s Olympics, Pendleton is thrilled to have settled on Varnish. Describing her own performance as &quot;all right&quot;, Pendleton preferred to underline the 20-year-old Varnish&apos;s contribution. &quot;Jess has progressed massively. She&apos;s very mature and she astounds me every day I work with her. When I was her age I was a mess. But Jess has committed herself 100% to this role \u2013 which is to be the lead-out rider in our team. When someone is that focused and driven they&apos;re going to be a force to be reckoned with. I think the time we rode tonight would&apos;ve made us world champions.&quot; Pendleton has often seemed an isolated figure in the British team \u2013 which has traditionally been filled with men. And in the way that she has refused to abandon her self-confessed &quot;girly&quot; identity, with her love of sparkly shoes and glamorous clothes, Pendleton has been tough enough to stand apart. Over the past three years, often to the chagrin of her coaches, she has insisted on planning her own training programmes. Her image as a defiant but emotional maverick in an otherwise well-drilled British team has opened her up to\u00a0criticism. The week before we went to Holland, when I visited her at home in Wilmslow, Pendleton spoke about her own uncertainties and her more assertive critics. &quot;Before younger girls like Jess arrived,&quot; Pendleton\u00a0admitted, &quot;I used to feel very lonely on the team. The boys would all pair up. That would leave me feeling unsure what time I was meant to meet them for breakfast. I&apos;d be fretting \u2013 thinking: &apos;Did\u00a0they say 7:30 or 8:30?&apos; I&apos;d come down at 7:35 and nobody was there so that meant it must be 8:30. I know I was being ridiculous because they would&apos;ve banged on my door if I hadn&apos;t shown up. But it wasn&apos;t easy. &quot;The men couldn&apos;t understand how I could be so successful and so insecure at the same time \u2013 because it doesn&apos;t really exist in the same way in the male psyche. They were like: &apos;Just get on with it, Vic, what&apos;s all the faffing about? You&apos;ve proved you can do it. What&apos;s the problem?&apos; It was difficult for them to fathom how desperately upset I get when I fail and how negative I am about my performances.&quot; Pendleton paused on that rainy night in Wilmslow. She thought hard and then, leaning forward on her sofa, said: &quot;Maybe this is a better way to put it: I don&apos;t think they understand how I can be so open and vulnerable \u2013 and that I feel fine about exposing myself. Maybe guys also have insecurities but in a sporting arena they keep it to themselves. I can&apos;t do that. My vulnerability isn&apos;t always hidden on the inside. I don&apos;t think they admire it. I think they see it as weakness. In sport, so often, it&apos;s a weakness.&quot; Does she still mind what people say about her? Pendleton looked briefly wounded, and then she nodded emphatically. &quot;I really care what people think of me. Me feeling I have let people down is my biggest battle in life. I hate the idea of letting people down \u2013 and when I do I feel such a failure.&quot; I have interviewed enough swaggering sporting personalities to linger over the difference in Pendleton. Doubt, like a drug, courses through her. It makes her more interesting and yet more troubled than any other gold-pursuing Olympian. Pendleton&apos;s stress, moreover, now comes in triplicate. Unlike Hoy, who won three golds at the 2008 Olympics, women could only race in the individual sprint in Beijing. Pendleton was at her crushing best, but her numbness in the immediate aftermath was intensified by her disappointment that she had not been able to race more at the Olympics. She became a campaigning voice behind the International Olympic Committee&apos;s subsequent decision to introduce parity and allow women to compete in their own team sprint and keirin events. Pendleton now has three chances to win gold at London 2012. On her down days, she smiles ruefully, that means three possibilities of failure. More bluntly, as someone suggested in Apeldoorn: &quot;Vic has to be careful of what she wished for. Three events could be too much for her \u2026&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve always been quite sensitive,&quot; she said, before laughing at herself. &quot;But it really matters that the people I love and respect don&apos;t feel disappointed by me. Satisfied is fine, disappointment is terrible.&quot; Pendleton had been satisfied \u2013 the equivalent of elation in less complicated people \u2013 when she and Varnish won the team sprint. In the final they swept past Ukraine&apos;s Olena Tsos and Lyubov Shulika. But now, on a raw Saturday morning, the threat of &quot;terrible disappointment&quot; stalks Pendleton. She gives me a little wave in the velodrome. Her face, drawn and tense, tells a darker story. The individual sprint begins with a time-trial that determines the seedings for the knockout rounds. Pendleton finishes fourth quickest and sails into the last 32 \u2013 where she easily beats Gabriele Jankute from Lithuania. But a superior Lithuanian rider, the redoubtable Simona Krupeckaite, looms next. Krupeckaite was good enough to become keirin world champion last year ahead of Pendleton. Despite rising out of her saddle in an attempt to find more power, Pendleton cannot hold off Krupeckaite. She looks shattered \u2013 even though she could still remain in the competition if she wins one of two separate repechages for losing\u00a0riders. Defeat in the individual sprint provides a brutal spectacle. Apart from the nerve-shredding and over-the-shoulder-watching tactics between two riders trying to outwit or bully each other into submission, the losing cyclist warms down in the middle of the arena. And there is an almost unbearable poignancy in watching Pendleton warm down after her loss. Round and round she rides, her pain magnified by the fact that her circling takes her right past the press tables and some of her most stringent critics. Pendleton&apos;s latest defeat follows two losses earlier this year to her real rival \u2013 the Australian Anna Meares, whom she trounced in the 2008 Olympic final. The fact that she has sacrificed competitive racing in 2011 for the sake of training designed to increase her power is no consolation. Pendleton is devastated. Dave Brailsford and Shane Sutton, British cycling&apos;s chief coaches, watch closely when Pendleton and Varnish prepare to race each other, and the German Miriam Welte, in the first repechage. They occupy opposite ends of this golden era for British cycling \u2013 with Pendleton representative of the ground-breaking past and Varnish, alongside other young riders such as Laura Trott and Becky James, symbolising the\u00a0future. The champion is still too strong. She beats Varnish and Welte to reach the last eight through the back door. More trouble lurks in the squat shape of Shulika, the mullet-haired Ukrainian. Pendleton defeated Shulika in the team sprint final but this seems different. Shulika&apos;s legs and rear ripple with power while Pendleton&apos;s physique is slender and graceful. Pendleton&apos;s menacing black visor comes down but her mouth, visible beneath the gleaming helmet, is much more feminine than Shulika&apos;s grimace. Slowly, the tension ratcheting up with every lap of their cat-and-mouse prelude, Pendleton increases the pace of her ride. And then, half a lap before the final bell, the Olympic champion begins to race. Flying down the back straight, it seems as if Pendleton has a clear advantage but then, almost inexorably, the Ukrainian closes the gap. As they hurtle towards the finish line, Shulika edges past Pendleton to win by centimetres. Pendleton slides off her bike and, knowing that she needs to win the next two races against Shulika, takes to the rollers. Looking like a trapped hamster on a wheel, she pedals and pedals and tries to convince herself that she can come back. Her tactical coach, Jan van Eijden, cajoles and urges Pendleton not to allow Shulika a second chance. The British rider listens mutely, lost in her own world. In the end, none of Van Eijeden&apos;s barked commands matter. Pendleton loses a decisive second race to Shulika. Apeldoorn is a track that has caused her much grief this year for it was here, in March, that Pendleton lost her world championship to Meares. It is also a track that exerts a tortuous grip on her. Cycling here makes her feel as if she&apos;s sticking needles into her eye-sockets. Van Eijden, Sutton, Brailsford and, most crucially, Steve Peters, British cycling&apos;s team psychiatrist, all take turns to try to comfort the disconsolate Pendleton. Three hours later, having briefly escaped to the hotel, she is back again at the velodrome and made to endure the indignity of a race to decide fifth to eighth places in the individual sprint. For the Olympic champion, who has won eight world titles, it feels humiliating. More seriously, even her qualification for the individual sprint at London 2012 remains unconfirmed. Early next year, Pendleton needs to find her best form in a World Cup event at the new London velodrome and then at the world championships in Melbourne to seal her right to defend her Olympic title. And so, in Apeldoorn, it seems inevitable that she finishes last in the losers&apos;s race. Her official place in these European championships is eighth. She may be vulnerable but Pendleton is also intensely proud. On the frame of her bike, the words Queen Vic have been stencilled in as a wry reminder of her enduring prowess and regal reputation. It will take great courage for Pendleton to ride again in the keirin on the last day in Apeldoorn. Victory in the most unpredictable of all sprint races would transform her mood and allow her to leave the Netherlands clutching two golds won against all the odds and the disadvantages of her current training programme which is geared to her peaking perfectly, one last time, at London 2012. Yet, as she zips up her top and hides her head in a hood, Queen Vic does not look as if she has glorious redemption in mind. Instead, her eyes glazed with tears, she leaves the arena on her own, silent and vanquished, looking like a great champion fighter, or even a monarch, stripped of her\u00a0title. Pendleton has shown me before that, on the inside of her wrist, the opening line to a Smashing Pumpkins song has been tattooed into her pale flesh: &quot;Today is the greatest day I&apos;ve ever known.&quot; She gave herself the tattoo, preceded by a girly facial, on the day she turned 30, in September 2010. Pendleton often jokes that, because she is tormented by her past and fearful of the future, she tries to live in the now. She knows that, in this same Smashing Pumpkins song, a different set of words run: &quot;Can&apos;t live for tomorrow/Tomorrow&apos;s much too long/I&apos;ll burn my eyes out/I&apos;ll tear my heart out \u2026&quot; But now, disappearing into the cold and black night, tomorrow is all she can cling to in this moment of distress. Tomorrow may be different. Tomorrow, perhaps, Queen Vic will rise again.

There are no creams, no pills, no incantations that can change this. However, more and more of us have the opportunity to perpetuate ourselves by the grace of overenthusiastic automated Facebook reminders and the digital archives of identity that we upload with pieces of us. After we die, we leave behind an estate that tells a particular story of who we were. We have no control over how we are represented, perceived or passed around: the post-death identities of highly public, controversial figures such as Muammar Gaddafi are appropriated for political agendas and images ricochet around news outlets and the web; more popular people such as Steve Jobs are bequeathed elevated cachet offline and on; and the less well-known but just as deserving, such as recently deceased computer scientist Dennis Ritchie, maintain an afterlife among the faithful who cluster around biographies and tributes. As for the rest of us, pre-web, we&apos;d have faded away pretty quickly. Now, it&apos;s possible to have our own public perpetuity. This can be disconcerting to those we leave behind. Many of the stories I&apos;ve heard about digital death experiences come from bereaved people who are jolted by the activity surrounding a loved one&apos;s online profile, or the skeletons that were hidden in an online closet. One person who contacted me about his experience of 21st-century death commented: &quot;It&apos;s a very weird thing, Facebook after death: it&apos;s a strange, living memorial to which anyone can add and contribute \u2013 and which the family cannot control.&quot; Social network accounts become windows into the worlds of their former owners, exposing the good and the devastating facts \u2013 such as hidden relationships or mental health problems \u2013 of a person&apos;s life. Most social network services allow family members to access a deceased loved one&apos;s account, to turn it into a memorial page, to archive it or to delete it. This can preserve the online identity as part of the whole person, something that, pre-Facebook,\u00a0wouldn&apos;t have been part of the mainstream idea of &quot;self&quot;. Virtual memorials can be a real source of comfort to loved ones. The same commenter told me: &quot;Following the recent first anniversary of [my brother&apos;s] death, it was emotional \u2013 and not unpleasant \u2013 to log back on and see people posting anniversary messages and to see that he was still in the thoughts of so many people.&quot; We are now embedded in online social networks, which means they can be speedy conduits for informing people whose lives were touched by the deceased person. Others told me that, although they&apos;d only known someone online, when they&apos;d heard about their death, they felt compelled to go to their funeral. Death is big business and there is an emerging industry that wants to help us deal with our digital assets before we die. The fourth Digital Death Day conference takes place in Amsterdam in November, aimed at a motley crew of undertakers, human-computer interaction researchers and social network administrators. It hopes to answer questions about new forms of estate and legacy planning, the implications of the web for end-of-life and after-death care and the ways the terms and conditions of online tools are constructed to take into consideration the end-of-account requirements of their customers. People are already lining up to advise us on what should and shouldn&apos;t be included in a last will and testament, offer hacking services for the bereaved to gain access to locked-down computers and social networking accounts, and flog augmented headstones so grave site visitors can discover more about an entombed person&apos;s life by scanning it with a smartphone. Our digital assets are incredibly rich resources, and the archive of emotional and biographical assets that we leave behind is growing\u00a0every day. Parents document\u00a0everything about their children&apos;s lives and upload it to the web, from first moments to first days at school, and beyond. Once we have control of our online selves, we continue to pour the minutiae of us into infinitely deep memory books. &quot;I&apos;m not espousing that we chronicle every little aspect of our lives: that would be ridiculous, redundant and boring,&quot; says John Romano, one of the authors of Your Digital Afterlife, &quot;but there are things that we value that we put online. And there are times when representation online is the only way that it&apos;s stored.&quot; &quot;It used to be the things that were most important to us had tangibility,&quot; continues Evan Carroll, Romano&apos;s co-author. &quot;Now that we&apos;re doing these things digitally, the content \u2013 no matter what format it&apos;s in \u2013 is still important.&quot; These are potentially valuable emotional assets, personally and socially, and their worth only truly realised by the people who survive us. For this reason, Carroll and Romano recommend taking a regular audit of what&apos;s important \u2013 photos, videos, status updates, blog posts, online banking passwords \u2013 and entrusting an executor with the details of how to access them. Death in the age of the web reminds us how much the technology has become part of the fabric of our personal and social identities. Once we&apos;re gone, what we leave behind is a rich resource of who we are. We may not survive beyond the release of the next social network, but our inevitable\u00a0ends are being extended by our digital lives.", "sentences": ["The fourth Digital Death Day conference takes place in Amsterdam in November, aimed at a motley crew of undertakers, human-computer interaction researchers and social network administrators."], "title": "Untangling the web: how the internet has changed the way we treat death", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/30/untangling-web-aleks-krotoski-death", "tags": ["Internet", "Society", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-02T16:00:01Z", "article": "Last week, the winners of\u00a0the first annual Lovie awards were announced, with several music sites recognised in what the organisers hope will become the European equivalent of the Webbys (themselves often referred to as the online Oscars). Although Dutch site 22tracks.com was only shortlisted in the music category \u2013 rather than winning one of the gold, silver or bronze awards \u2013 it&apos;s certainly worth a look. The site was launched in 2009 as an online jukebox consisting of 22 playlists of different genres, with each playlist containing 22 streamable tracks, selected by specialist DJs from Amsterdam. It also now has another 22 playlists from 22 slightly different genres, chosen by DJs inBrussels. Each playlist is updated throughout the week, with the newest songs appearing at the top. Whether you choose to play the classical, disco or future beats choices from the Brussels DJs, or the worldgroove, pop or metal picks of the Amsterdam DJs, you&apos;ll hear some great, often undiscovered music. For anyone who spends their work days listening to music via a computer, it&apos;s an essential bookmark. BalconyTV.com, which won the Lovies&apos; silver award for music, was founded in 2006 when a group of Dublin flatmates decided they should use their balcony more. Five years on, the site now has volunteer teams in 22 cities who have together made more than 5,500 videos of musicians performing acoustically on balconies, with dozens of new sessions added every week. You can watch performances from big names including Jessie J, Mumford &amp; Sons and Biffy Clyro (pictured), but it&apos;s actually more interesting to delve into the videos made by BalconyTV&apos;s teams in, say, Pozna\u00f1, Istanbul or Mexico City. The only downside is that there aren&apos;t better tools to find the best content. A\u00a0great site would be made even better if you could browse by popularity and genre. The Lovies&apos; gold award went to music video site 2pause.com. Of course, music videos are almost always available on YouTube, but finding the good ones can be hard. 2pause effectively acts as a curator for the best and most innovative music videos being made. Judging by the fact @2pause only has 125 followers on Twitter, the site doesn&apos;t seem to have reached an enormous audience in its four years online, but it really is a treasure trove of quality short film-making. The music videos are divided into eight themes: recently added; interactive; Netherclips; electric cinema; sonic animation; lo/no budget; French wave; and stop motion, with real gems to be found in them all. Again, though, some kind of user star ratings would be a worthwhile addition, to help the absolute cream rise to the top.

Few in the chess media noticed his passing, yet long ago in his twenties he had been the game&apos;s most gifted attacker outside the Soviet Union. Fuderer made an impressive international debut at Bled 1950, where the 19-year-old was fourth in a strong field and was praised for the style and elegance of his wins. A year later, he played for Yugoslavia against Britain in London and was paired with Jonathan Penrose, later ten times British champion and already the hope of English chess. I was on the next board, and was immersed in the opening when I heard a series of thumps down the table. Fuderer was blitzing Penrose and crashing through his defences with a knight and rook sacrifice.

He was studying chemistry at Zagreb, played the piano in virtuoso style, and could aim for the world chess top. Which to choose? For the next few years he postponed the decision, as his chess career nudged upwards. In 1954 he qualified for the world title interzonal, scored a fine victory over Ewfim Geller at the Amsterdam Olympiad where Yugoslavia took the silver medals behind Russian gold, and finished third to Vassily Smyslov and Paul Keres at Hastings. The fateful moment came at the 1955 Gothenburg interzonal. At halfway after ten rounds he was on 7-3, battling for the lead with David Bronstein and Keres. But the pairings were such that the six Soviets played each other at the start while in the second half Fuderer had to meet all six in successive rounds. Keres beat him in 18 moves and those last ten rounds were a disaster, four draws and six defeats. So chemistry won. Fuderer took his doctorate at Zagreb, married in 1957, and after helping Yugoslavia to silver at the Moscow 1956 Olympiad gradually withdrew from chess. His swansong was the 1959 Soviet Union v Yugoslavia match at Kiev where, still only 28, he showed what might have been by beating Bronstein, the victor at Gothenburg, 3-1. In the late 1960s he quit Yugoslavia for good, living in Spain and working as a chemical engineer in Antwerp. Even in his best chess years there were games where he settled for quick draws against much weaker opponents. An obituary by his son Miha helps explain why. Fuderer felt his greatest passion was for chemistry, and he used his tournaments outside Yugoslavia to acquire consumer goods which when he got home he could resell at a profit to finance his university studies. For chess, a great talent lost. 3226 1\u2026Nxc5?

On the bright side for the health conscious, there&apos;s plenty of chance to walk it off in Porto&apos;s vertiginous streets, which rise up from the banks of the Douro river in a jumble of winding paths, broad avenues and shady squares. And multiple opportunities to stop and stare: at the 20,000 blue-and-white tiles (azulejos) depicting scenes from Portuguese history in the S\u00e3o Bento railway station; at the iron facades that adorn countless shops and restaurants, and which will, our guide assures us, survive the city&apos;s gradual modernisation; at the city&apos;s magnificent Romanesque cathedral; at the famous and wonderfully preserved Lello bookshop, in which a diminutive cart distributes stock on a shopfloor railway. If you get lost, navigate by the tall bell tower of the Cl\u00e9rigos church, visible from virtually everywhere in the city; or by the surviving sections of the 14th-century Fernandine defensive walls, hewn out of the granite on and out of which Porto is built. Chances are, though, that these and other attractions \u2013 the vast glass-and-steel Casa da M\u00fasica designed by Rem Koolhaas, the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in its beautifully landscaped gardens \u2013 are not the first things that spring to mind when you think of Porto. They aren&apos;t for my father \u2013 a semi-retired sommelier \u2013 or me. Speculating about what to expect on the short plane ride from Stansted, we can muster only one word: port. It&apos;s a correct but partial view that the city&apos;s tourism officials, hoteliers and restaurateurs are keen to expand by drawing attention to Porto as a breath-of-fresh-air alternative to other European city-break destinations, such as Barcelona, Berlin and Amsterdam. For the first two nights, we stay in the palatial Yeatman hotel, which sits overlooking the Douro from the Vila Nova de Gaia region on the south side of the river. Barely a year old, the hotel is the brainchild and pet project of Adrian Bridge, the managing director of Taylor&apos;s, and although port and wine are central to its aesthetic \u2013 from the decanter-shaped swimming pool to the Caudalie Vinoth\u00e9rapie treatments in the vast spa \u2013 he is keen to make sure Porto no longer hides its light under a bushel. For the fairly well-heeled traveller, the Yeatman is a luxurious and comfortable base, all hushed corridors you could drive a car down and impeccable service; right next to the byzantine network of narrow roads that connect the city&apos;s long established port-wine cellars and a\u00a0short hop over one of Porto&apos;s six river bridges to the bustling north side. Those who prefer to stay right in the heart of town might try the Teatro, a more modern (and modestly priced) hotel that takes its design inspiration from the theatre that stood on the site in the 19th century. Going upscale again, there&apos;s the five-star, almost implausibly beautiful Infante Sagres, where the likes of Bob Dylan and the Dalai Lama have stayed. We don&apos;t bunk in with them, but the hotel has recently opened a\u00a0brasserie-style restaurant called Book, and we enjoy a delicious dinner there. We also visit a couple of posher establishments that seem to fall in with the image of the hip new Porto currently being promoted. They are fine, but it seems to both of us that they offer the kind of food and atmosphere not hard to find in most European capitals; self-consciously refined, artfully presented, comparatively expensive. But the one culinary experience not to miss is eating barbecued sardines in the harbour district of Matosinhos, a short drive from the city centre. Follow the smoke and head for the Rua Her\u00f3is de Fran\u00e7a, where you can take your pick from a lengthy row of plainly decorated restaurants, each with an outsized pavement grill and bursting with people \u2013 all piscine life is on the menu, but the sardines, newly caught and whacked on the barbecue with nothing but salt, are sensational (and unfeasibly cheap). Porto&apos;s enthusiasts are right to point out that there&apos;s far more to the city than its most famous product but you&apos;d be unwise not to pay it some attention. Sit on the banks of the river and sip it in its white, pink, ruby, tawny and late-bottled vintage incarnations, looking idly at the rabelo boats that are now a tourist attraction but were traditionally used to transport casks of the stuff down river from the Douro Valley. And, if you&apos;re here for more than a couple of days, don&apos;t miss out on the chance to head further inland to the small towns and never-ending vineyards of the Douro itself, less than a couple of hours away by car and also reachable by train to R\u00e9gua or Pinh\u00e3o, or by river cruise. We drive and experience proper dropped jaws when we turn off the motorway and arrive at the first viewing point: from high up, all you can see is a\u00a0vast expanse of broad river and enough grapes, it seems, to keep the world drunk for ever. In 24 hours, we manage to lunch on roast kid at R\u00e9gua&apos;s splendid Castas e Pratos restaurant, visit the Douro museum, relax in the cool luxury of the Aquapura spa hotel and sample the wares of no fewer than four different quintas (including the Quinta do Seixo, owned by Sandeman, where, somewhat comically, we are shown around by a man in the trademark black hat and cape). At one, the family-owned Quinta da Pacheca, my dad and I sample the delicious wines and port so comprehensively that a cooling swim and a short nap are required before dinner (after which, of course, more port). We&apos;re certainly not up to the grape-treading that you can participate in at some of the smaller quintas \u2013 although most grape-crushing is now mechanised, traditional methods are still to be found. Spittoons are not much in evidence and so a word of caution: unless you are teetotal and have nerves of steel, consider enlisting the services of a driver to take you on quinta visits: when we visit, during the September harvest, the fairly challenging roads are further complicated by the constant traffic of grape trucks. By the end, I feel I\u00a0know more about port wine than I\u00a0had imagined possible: that its grapes grow so well here because of the schist soil that regulates night-time temperatures; that one of its greatest producers was a woman named Dona Ant\u00f3nia Adelaide Ferreira; and that the little chapels that dot the riverside sprang up to bless the rabelo boatmen who might come a cropper in its treacherous shallows. I also realise that I will come back \u2013 here and to Porto \u2013 time and again, and that its champions are right to think it can give other short-haul destinations a\u00a0run for their money.

We are in danger of &quot;denying future generations to come&quot;, says architect Lord Foster. It is about the importance of our &quot;world-class natural environment&quot;, says the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It could be a &quot;white elephant&quot; that would deal a near-fatal blow to our economy, says Sir Terry Farrell, another leading architect. Also at stake is national identity: how much Britain should try to match growing countries such as China, and how much we should do our own thing. They are talking about airports, more particularly the idea of the &quot;hub&quot;, the place where airlines choose to have interchanging flights, which is not only good for the airport business but also any business that relies on the best possible air connections. Heathrow is such an airport now, but its two runways are at 99% of their capacity, and air travel keeps growing, so it is in danger of losing ground to Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris. A third runway, deeply unpopular with people living under its flight path, has been ruled out by the government, the opposition, and the mayor of London. So last week Foster, in partnership with engineers Halcrow and economic consultancy Volterra, unveiled a plan for Thames Hub, a four-runway airport to be built on the Isle of Grain in north Kent, on the Thames estuary. Building anew would achieve the best possible integration of planes and trains, the best provision for logistics, and the most modern, efficient terminals. Planes would mostly approach over water rather than densely populated areas. It would connect to the high-speed rail link built for the Channel tunnel and provide tens of thousands of jobs for the never-quite-achieved revitalisation of the area known as the Thames Gateway. It is not the first plan to build an airport in the estuary. An attempt to build one at Foulness in Essex was scuppered by the 1973 oil crisis, and more recently Cliffe, near the Isle of Grain, has been mooted, but the Foster plan is the most ambitious. It is not just for an airport, but a new tidal barrier to protect London from flooding, a high-speed orbital railway that would roughly follow the path of the M25, and railway connections to seaports and northern cities. The total cost is put at \u00a350bn, with benefits to the economy put at \u00a3150bn. Backers say that they are attracting interest from private investors. Foster&apos;s inspiration is China. In the 1990s he designed Hong Kong&apos;s new airport, which required the levelling and reshaping of a bumpy island. He also designed the gigantic Terminal 3 in Beijing, which took four years to realise and opened in time for the 2008 Olympics. Now an even bigger airport is already being planned for the city. Foster has long admired the speed with which these were built, and laments how Britain has dithered about London&apos;s airports. Heathrow&apos;s Terminal Five took 26 years from conception to completion, including the longest planning inquiry in history. Britain wasn&apos;t like this, says Foster, in the age of the great engineering projects. He urges that we &quot;recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th-century forebears&quot;, which means action to speed up and simplify the process of planning and public inquiries, and dealing less tenderly with the many objections projects like this provoke. He raises the spectre of Bric, the growing nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China. If Britain does not match their investment in infrastructure, &quot;we are rolling over and saying we are no longer competitive \u2013 and this is a competitive world. So I do not believe we have a choice.&quot; There are certainly objections. The Isle of Grain is not an abstract piece of nothing, but a rare wilderness surprisingly close to London. It is part of the atmospheric flat lands where Dickens set the opening of Great Expectations, and the airport would not so much be built on it as completely annihilate it. In the Thames estuary there are, says the RSPB, up to 200,000 birds, and another 30,000 in the nearby Medway, a population &quot;of global importance&quot; which is unlikely to mix well with an airport. Huw Thomas, a director of Foster &amp; Partners, says replacement habitats could be created elsewhere, but the RSPB is unconvinced. Neither will it be easy to run high-speed trains through the green belt unopposed. Farrell questions whether Foster&apos;s infrastructural wonderland would really work. The airport is &quot;on the wrong side of London for growth \u2013 the heart of Britain is clearly on the other side&quot;. If Heathrow were shrunk or closed, he says, the investment that has gone into the airport would be squandered. More than that, the huge array of businesses that have grown up around Heathrow, from corporate headquarters in the Thames valley to hotels and warehouses and the UK&apos;s biggest food distribution centre, would have to relocate. Heathrow currently creates nearly 80,000 airport-related jobs, and many more in associated businesses. Homes for all these workers, with their schools, hospitals and shops, would have to be recreated in the east. No one planned that Heathrow would be what it is now, but for all its faults it is an extraordinary success, which should not be lightly discarded. &quot;Can we afford to flip London over?&quot; Farrell asks, and cites Montreal-Mirabel airport, which opened in 1975 as the biggest in the world, misjudged its market and ceased passenger flights in 2004. Its main problems were its distance from the city and the introduction of longer-range aircraft, making them less likely to stop over in Montreal. The Foster plan carries some of the same risks, such as having a less convenient location than the existing airport and requiring a long-term bet on patterns of flying that may change. Farrell argues instead for &quot;consolidation of what we&apos;ve got&quot;, for better train connections between existing airports, for example, so that they can work better together. &quot;Foster is right to propose his hub,&quot; he says, as a contribution to debate, but we should not be dazzled into accepting it uncritically. Such solutions are &quot;tremendously glamorous and sexy&quot;, but &quot;you can&apos;t just take the say-so&quot; of people such as architects and engineers, with a vested interest. Nor that of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, an enthusiast for estuary airport plans, given that relocation would shift the environmental problems &quot;from thousands of his voters, and dump them on someone else&apos;s&quot;. Farrell argues that what works in China may not work here: &quot;They have a growth economy and can afford to make mistakes.&quot; And China, not being a democracy, doesn&apos;t have to worry too much about opposing voices. &quot;We can&apos;t emulate the Chinese. We&apos;ve got to find our own position, which could be very clever and very smart, but different.&quot; This debate assumes that endless growth in air traffic is desirable and inevitable, although it contributes significantly to climate change. It also enjoys the remarkable tax break of exemption from VAT on fuel. Should this ever end, people will fly less. Meanwhile, engines are becoming quieter, which alters the discussions about noise pollution, and with the Airbus A380 aircraft are becoming bigger. John Stewart of HACAN Clear Skies, which campaigns to control the effects of aviation over London, thinks Heathrow could expand by handling larger planes for long-range flights, while high-speed trains would take over much of the short-range traffic. If he is right, it may not be necessary to build a new super-hub. What is most striking is that no one knows for sure which option is best. This may be the most critical decision on infrastructure, environment and planning that this country has to take, but the implications and complexities are too big for anyone to have mastered them yet. The Foster hub could be as successful as Hong Kong, or a new Montreal-Mirabel. Confident though they are, the Foster camp acknowledge that their hub is partly speculative. Farrell isn&apos;t saying for sure that his idea of consolidation is the best one, but only that it deserves full investigation. Whether either, or something else, is the best option is for the moment almost pure guesswork.

With novels nominated by libraries around the world, this year&apos;s award pits some of the biggest names in international fiction against each other, from the UK&apos;s Howard Jacobson, picked for his Booker-winning novel The Finkler Question, to American novelist Jennifer Egan and her Pulitzer-winning A Visit From the Goon Squad and Israeli author David Grossman&apos;s To the End of the Land.

Room, which is inspired by the Josef Fritzl case and told in the voice of a young boy, Jack, who has been imprisoned with his mother in a room for his whole life, received the most nominations from libraries, with 20 public libraries, from the Maldives to Chicago, backing it to take the prize. Librarians praised how &quot;terror, hope, patience and devotion are stunningly twisted in an unforgettable story&quot;, and described Room as &quot;a memorable, heart-wrenching story that manages to convey the power of love and hope, even under the most horrific circumstances&quot;. Room is one of the most nominated titles in the 17 years since the Impac was launched, said organisers. Dublin city librarian Margaret Hayes said she was delighted that three Irish authors \u2013 Donoghue, French and Paul Murray, whose tragicomic novel Skippy Dies was also longlisted for the Booker \u2013 had been nominated by libraries for this year&apos;s prize. &quot;Emma Donoghue&apos;s success in achieving 20 nominations from libraries worldwide demonstrates once again the international appeal of Irish writing,&quot; she said.

US airlines were racing this week to demonstrate their clean energy credentials, scheduling a number of flights powered partially by biofuels. First United Continental announced the departure on Monday morning of Flight 1403 from Houston for Chicago \u2013 or the &apos;Eco Skies test flight&apos; as the airline called it \u2013 using a mix of 60% conventional jet fuel and 40% algae-based fuels. Alaska Airlines then announced it would operate 75 flights using a mix of 80% conventional jet fuels and 20% biofuels starting on Wednesday. Instead of algae-base, the airline is using used cooking oil or fast-food restaurant throwaways, said Robert Ames, vice-president of Dynamic Fuels, which produced the fuel. &quot;We can use vegetable oil. We can use used cooking oil,&quot; he said. &quot;A good mental reference is McDonald&apos;s used fryer grease.&quot; The flights will include 11 between Seattle and Washington DC, and 64 between Seattle and Portland, Oregon, the airline said. &quot;We wanted to demonstrate the use of sustainable biofuels both on a transcontinental route and on a short haul that competes with ground vehicle traffic,&quot; Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for Alaska, said in an interview. The airline calculates the use of the biofuels mix cuts greenhouse gas emissions on those particular flights by 10%. It&apos;s not clear, however, when \u2013 or even if \u2013 Alaska will begin running regular flights on biofuels. The cooking oil substitute cost six times as much as conventional jet fuel, said Egan. That makes a permanent switch prohibitively expensive \u2013 unless production increases and prices come down. Dynamic Fuels, a joint-venture between Tyson Foods Inc, the world leader in chicken, beef and pork production, and Syntroleum Corporation, is the only producer of this type of fuel in the US. The plant has been operating just over a year, and has an annual capacity of 75m gallons. Ames would not discuss current prices, but he said he was hopeful they would eventually come down. &quot;There is enough used cooking oil,&quot; he said. &quot;Are we shutting down Saudi Arabia? The answer clearly is no. In America, we like our fast food but we really don&apos;t have those kinds of quantities available.&quot; Monday&apos;s flights were not exactly historic. Virgin Atlantic first began trying out biofuels three years ago, and KLM tested a 50/50 blend of conventional fuel and used cooking oil on its Paris-Amsterdam route last June. The US airforce, meanwhile, plans to test 40 of its aircraft on a biofuels blend by 2013. But the flights could encourage the rest of the industry move towards cleaner fuels. Following Monday&apos;s flight, Solazyme said on its Facebook page it hoped to sell as much as 20m gallons of biofuel a year beginning in 2014. &quot;Sustainable biofuels, produced on a large scale at an economically viable price, can one day play a meaningful role in powering everyone&apos;s trip on an airline,&quot; the chief operating officer of United, Pete McDonald, said in a statement. Egan said meanwhile she hoped Alaska&apos;s move would encourage other biofuels suppliers to get into the market, bringing costs down. The test flights are also a sharp contrast to threats of a trade war by the US aviation industry to moves by European airports to charge carriers for greenhouse gas emissions.", "sentences": ["Virgin Atlantic first began trying out biofuels three years ago, and KLM tested a 50/50 blend of conventional fuel and used cooking oil on its Paris-Amsterdam route last June."], "title": "US airlines begin powering flights with biofuels", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/08/us-airlines-biofuels-powering-flights", "tags": ["Biofuels", "Airline industry", "US news", "World news", "Business", "Environment", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Travel & leisure"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-08T14:15:57Z", "article": "A handwritten sign John Lennon and Yoko Ono displayed during one of their famous &quot;bed-ins&quot; has emerged for sale.

WELL, LYONS &quot;Bantering with my mate John, we noted that with the Manchester United v Crystal Palace League Cup draw, it&apos;s a &apos;Glazers&apos; v &apos;Glaziers&apos; (original CPFC nickname) contest,&quot; writes Peter Fisher. &quot;He was then reminded of an ex-Palace keeper, Bill Glazier, and expressed disappointment that the club hadn&apos;t bought Chris Eagles, thus becoming the only club to have had two players whose name was their team&apos;s nickname. Then we agreed that, in fact, no other clubs have ever had a player whose name was their team&apos;s nickname. Prove us wrong \u2026&quot; Indeed we will. While Steve Cherry was on the south coast with Plymouth but not Bournemouth, Paul Blades never got closer than Rotherham to Bramall Lane and Billy Pilgrim was a character in Kurt Vonnegut&apos;s Slaughterhouse Five rather than a jinking Plymouth midfielder, there have been other players to match Bill Glazier&apos;s effort. The Rochdale-born full-back Eddie Lyons turned out for Millwall six times between 1949 and 1951, Mark Robins scored four times in six games on loan at Bristol City and currently in the Walsall ranks is the former Birmingham City defender Mat Sadler. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE There have been a few questions of late about Samuel Eto&apos;o&apos;s long-distance commuting in Russia, so in honour of those, here&apos;s Dan Brady back in 2006: &quot;What is the longest distance a footballer has been known to travel on a daily basis to attend training at their club?&quot; Sometimes, as you watch Rio Ferdinand pick up \u00a3120,000 a week for occasionally engaging second gear, it&apos;s easy to forget that playing football is a job, and that its protagonists are subject to the same daily irritants as the great unwashed: working with a hangover, eejit colleagues who nick your favourite mug \u2013 and commuting to work. We had a few nominations for the longest daily to trip to training, including Winston Bogarde (Amsterdam-Chelsea: 356km) and VfL Wolfsburg&apos;s Pablo Thiam (Berlin-Wolfsburg: 150km), but nobody gets near the monster commute, albeit not a daily one, undertaken by the Australian striker Damian Mori. &quot;Mori, currently playing in the A-League for the Central Coast Mariners, still lives in Adelaide,&quot; says Andrew Stockings. &quot;Last year he was playing for Perth Glory, when he also commuted between matches from Adelaide. The journey from Adelaide to the Central Coast is approximately 1,500km; Adelaide to Perth is 2,700km.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? It seems to be increasingly common for players to retire form international football to preserve their club careers,&quot; writes Adam Harcus. &quot;So my questions are: what is the youngest someone has retired to do this? And has anyone ever retired from club football but continued to play at international level?&quot; &quot;After Carlos Tevez allegedly refusing to go on the pitch as a substitute for Manchester City against Bayern,&quot; begins Matthew Craig, &quot;has any player caused a somewhat similar brouhaha by refusing to come off the pitch to let a substitute on?&quot; &quot;I have a college lecturer who keeps saying he &quot;wishes he knew the first footballer to pull his shirt over his head,&quot; writes James Keating. &quot;Thanks to him, now I need to know, can you help?&quot; &quot;I noticed recently when Scotland bravely lost to Spain 3-1, all goals were scored by Davids; David Villa, David Silva &amp; David Goodwillie,&quot; writes Stephen Dinsdale. &quot;In my sad existence I was wondering if there have been any other occasions when there have been all goalscorers with the with the same first name.

In those matches they scored 11 goals and conceded 192 goals resulting in a goal difference of -181. What I&apos;m asking is, have they made a new record in being the worst side in a European top tier league and if not, what team is holding the infamous record?&quot; &quot;Now that you&apos;ve solved the &apos;league leaders with negative goal difference&apos; issue, how about &quot;Has there ever been a league table in professional football where only one team has a positive goal difference?&quot; writes Oliver Kannenberg. &quot;If not, the Brisbane Roar of Australia&apos;s A-League may claim a world first as they currently lead their 10-team league with a goal difference of +12, while being followed by five teams on a goal difference of zero and four others with a negative goal difference.&quot; &quot;Recently playing Fifa 12 with my son, he cheekily took a penalty against me with his goalkeeper, and even more cheekily, had the temerity to score it,&quot; writes Phil Laing and Stefan Coombs. &quot;Later on in the match, fate caught up with him as said keeper conceded an own goal, ensuring his name on both sides of the scoresheet and the resumption of my offspring&apos;s pocket money.

Although he had only come into worldwide prominence in the last few years with the brilliant ten-part Dekalog, The Double Life Of Veronique and the trilogy, Three Colours Red, White and Blue, Kieslowski had been working in cinema for almost 30 years, first as a highly original and imaginative documentarist and then as a feature film director. His late discovery by the world at large as one of the few European directors capable of measuring up to the giants of the past was both a huge chance and considerable burden for him. He took his sudden fame and good fortune with the same stoicism as the difficulties of working under Poland&apos;s communist regime. He hated doing endless interviews and circling the festivals as a star guest. He constantly talked of retirement. But, as a fatalist, he reckoned that to be fashionable was temporary and that it was incumbent upon him to seize the day and make the best of it. Those who knew his work from the beginning could easily detect an outstanding talent. His ironic but very human tone, the mastery of style and the ability to put something on the screen that had an emotional and dramatic force of exceptional power was obvious. But despite becoming noticed by travelling critics and festival directors for Personnel, The Scar and in particular Camera Buff, a satirical critique of political censorship in Poland, no one was prepared for the brilliance of his Dekalog, loosely based on the Ten Commandments, which hit the festival circuit some 10 years later. These ten films, of less than an hour each, were filmed in the same suburb of Warsaw and with many of the same characters in each story. Most of them said more in that time than many film makers can suggest in a dozen full-length features. Two of them - A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love - were extended into superb features and won festival awards which encouraged the French to take him up. All his other four films were produced in France and each won further awards, though a blow to Kieslowski&apos;s esteem came when Three Colours: Red his magnificent last film, was given nothing at Cannes in 1994 while Quentin Tarentino&apos;s Pulp Fiction won the coveted Palme D&apos;Or. This ludicrous decision persuaded him, quite apart from the fact that he was exhausted after working flat out on projects for six years, that he should rest. He called it &apos;retirement&apos; but most people knew it wasn&apos;t permanent. He was due shortly to make another trilogy on the themes of heaven, purgatory and hell - again for the French producer Marin Karmitz. In his later years, Kieslowski relied on a formidable team of collaborators which is why his films had a unity of style and content second to very few others. But he was first and foremost a director who knew exactly what he wanted and how to obtain it quickly and without fuss. Perhaps, under French influence, his style became more aggressively noticeable and did not always achieve the naturalness of his best Polish work. But even when this happened, the filming was still impeccable. If anyone could be considered a contemporary European master it was Kieslowski and the Dekalog in particular remains one of the great saving graces of the European cinema over the last disappointing decade. Everything Kieslowski means to the more literate film makers of the world is encompassed within the ten films, originally designed only for Polish television and all done in the space of around 18 months. Yet he was not without his critics, sometimes being labelled obscure and too content to rely on a kind of fake mysticism for effect. I well remember being on a jury that was hopelessly divided as to the merits of the longer version of A Short Film About Killing. One juror said it was little more than a melodramatic plea for murderers to be treated kindly. She then produced a video of the film and asked us to look at the very first scene. This, she said, would prove her point. We all did, but the experience had the reverse effect to that intended. Kieslowski won the main prize. This criticism of him was underlined by the fact that he invariably refused to explain his films, though talkative on the actual process of making them. He surprised the British, for instance, by saying, when talking of retirement, that he would be willing to come back to work in any capacity whatsoever if Ken Loach was the film maker who summoned him. He admired Loach&apos;s work greatly saying that very few directors had the capacity to make people laugh and cry within the space of a single sequence. This is actually what he himself could do since he was an odd mixture of pessimist and optimist in his nature as well as in his work. He was typically Polish but became, like Wajda and Polanski, an international figure who transcended his nationality. He hated the ponderously short-sighted Polish communist regime and delighted in circumventing their strictures. But he also despised the post-communist, market-oriented Poland - a fact made obvious by his coruscating satire of a corrupt, money-making society in the undervalued Three Colours: White. The best thing that can be said about an artist of the stature of Kieslowski was that his espousal of a highly individual, very personal cinema gave a great many film makers renewed hope and sprang directly from the work of other European masters now lost to us. Derek Malcolm Andi Engel, of Artificial Eye, writes: The first film I saw of KK was Personnel. It is a beautifully simple film about the first day at work of a young man in a provincial opera house in the costume department. He witnesses an ugly scene between a fat male &apos;star&apos;, who hates his costume, and the fitter who is desperately trying to oblige. It ends with the director of the opera house putting a blank piece of paper in front of the youth, telling him to write down the &apos;truth&apos;. The boy does not write. Slow fade. End of film. Nothing is said. Nothing is indicated. But you know it will end with either the dismissal of the fitter or the boy, or both. The first time I saw KK was at the Kaurismaekis&apos; Midnight Sun Festival, north of the Arctic circle. He was dancing the tango with his daughter and did not talk to us. But we saw all his documentaries. Which were grim. Which were great. And above all he showed a passionate love of his country. And a near instinctive sureness of the craft of film-making. First time I talked to him was very early one black morning at Gothenburg airport. I told him about a letter I had read from an old Polish woman who wrote to her government: &apos;With the pension I receive I cannot survive. Does the government expect me now to kill myself?&apos; He dragged on his cigarette and nodded. He then came several times to London, to help us with the release of his films. And we talked. One of the things we talked about was how awkward it was to give the characters in a film names. He agreed, but he took it further and talked about the great danger film-makers found themselves in, of playing god with their characters. But the crucial discussion was about the concept of fate and coincidence where I wrongly thought that he believed life was governed by coincidence. That our lives were predestined. He smiled and said: &apos;But I agree with you.&apos; After all, he starts the introduction to the scripts of Dekalog: &apos;I believe fate is an important part of life. Of all our lives, my own included.&apos; Recently he gave a summer school in Amsterdam for young directors and actors. I asked if he would mind if I attended as an onlooker. He looked at me and said: &apos;Don&apos;t come. There is nothing for you to learn.&apos; So I never saw him direct. He was casual about the &apos;maitrise&apos; of his film-making craftsmanship. It was not something he would talk about. He did not talk much. In the end, I fear he was desperate. Poland made him and Poland broke his heart. I like him. I like him very much. Danusia Stok, editor of Kieslowski on Kieslowski, writes: Krzysztof Kieslowski &apos;s name immediately conjures a world in film. But there was another side to him, which was rarely seen. There was a wealth of love within him and intuition. I sometimes sensed that he didn&apos;t always want to admit this to himself - certainly not to the outside world. Hence his reputation for being monosyllabic, gruff, awesome even, behind those bushy eyebrows which he twiddled as he smoked those eternal cigarettes. But inside there was compassion and a longing to return to a simpler life. To sit on his verandah with his huge, affectionate dog called Brat (brother), smoke his cigarettes and finally have time for his passion for Black and Decker tools. I also remember talking to him about the healing arts. &apos;I don&apos;t believe in all that,&apos; he would shrug. Yet his films, especially the later ones like the Double Life, indicate an intuitive quality. They reveal a spiritual side of a man reputedly deeply grounded in the treadmill of reality. Furthermore, they show how a director accused of misogyny, was, in fact, understanding of the female psyche. Another aspect which his films didn&apos;t fully reflect was his strong sense of humour, so dry, so observant of man&apos;s foibles and life&apos;s absurdities. It was a joy to catch him relaxed, share a meal, listen to his anecdotes, watch his serious blue eyes glisten with irony - although those moments became all too rare as the demands of his own creativity ran him down.

Is the history of protest truly vertical and largely perambulatory, or has there been a role for the horizontal? The march is clearly a key feature of protest. We witnessed it again yesterday. But non-perambulatory protest, as seen at St Paul&apos;s, has an equally distinguished history. Has Cameron never heard of sit-ins or sit-down protests? Gandhi pioneered sit-ins as part of his campaign for civil rights for Indians in South Africa in the early 20th century, and transferred those methods of non-violent protest to the struggle for Indian independence. They were then taken up by the civil rights movement in the US, where sit-ins were a key tactic from the 1940s on. Trade unions have often employed sit-ins as a tactic, notably in the protest led by Jimmy Reid in Glasgow&apos;s Upper Clyde shipyard in 1971. As Reid said at the time, occupying your place of work, claiming ownership of it, is far more effective than striking and in effect locking yourself out. Two years earlier, John Lennon and Yoko Ono had extended the concept of the sit-in with two week-long bed-ins for world peace in hotel rooms in Amsterdam and Montreal. During the Montreal bed-in in May 1969, they recorded Give Peace A Chance from their hotel room, with visitors such as Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg providing backing vocals. The bed-ins became a media circus and peace wasn&apos;t given a chance, but the Polish trade union Solidarity used sit-ins to powerful effect when it challenged the communist government in the late 80s, and the mass sit-in and hunger strike by students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 constituted the most formidable challenge to the Chinese state in the past half-century. It may be that Cameron has chosen to ignore this rich history of horizontal protest because he is so uncomfortable with it. Protesters are not marching through public space but taking possession of it, setting up an alternative seat of power. This is what has made the tented protest at St Paul&apos;s so resonant. The authorities are at a loss when faced with protesters who refuse to go away. It seems the most effective movement may be one that is static.", "sentences": ["Two years earlier, John Lennon and Yoko Ono had extended the concept of the sit-in with two week-long bed-ins for world peace in hotel rooms in Amsterdam and Montreal."], "title": "Mr Cameron, have you never really heard of a sit-in?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/09/cameron-sitins-st-pauls-john-yoko", "tags": ["Protest", "UK news", "David Cameron", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-11T17:11:51Z", "article": "Heathrow Airport has suffered its first decline in passengers since last year as airlines cut domestic flights. Britain&apos;s largest airport carried just over 6 million people in October, a fall of 1.3% on the same period last year and bringing to an end nine consecutive months of growth. Colin Matthews, chief executive of Heathrow owner BAA, said the fall indicated a &quot;softening in the global economy&quot;, with internal routes showing the most marked drop. This week Britain&apos;s largest domestic carrier, Flybe, warned of a further deterioration in demand over the winter and Heathrow confirmed a steep fall in October with passengers on domestic routes falling by 17%. The decline was driven by a concerted shift away from British routes, with Heathrow carriers flying 16% fewer seats as bmi dropped its Glasgow service and other airlines switched slots to more profitable long-haul destinations. Heathrow&apos;s long distance routes are also encountering weakening demand as a recovery in passenger numbers shows signs of stalling. Demand on UK-to-US routes is close to going into reverse, growing only 0.35% compared with the same month last year and representing a further decline in year-on-year growth numbers that stood at 13% in May. Non-US long-haul traffic fell by more than 2% last month. BAA&apos;s commercial director, John Holland-Kaye, said Heathrow&apos;s domestic routes are also losing customers to continental rivals such as Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, which is luring passengers from airports such as Edinburgh with onward connections that Heathrow cannot offer, including the Chinese city of Hangzhou. A lack of room to launch new services is the aviation industry&apos;s main argument for a third runway at Heathrow. Echoing another long-standing industry complaint, Holland-Kaye added that rising air passenger duty is pushing British-based long-haul passengers to airports such as Schiphol, because they do not have to pay a flight tax on their connecting flight from Amsterdam. &quot;It is exporting business because it is [Dutch carrier] KLM that is getting the passengers.&quot;", "sentences": ["BAA&apos;s commercial director, John Holland-Kaye, said Heathrow&apos;s domestic routes are also losing customers to continental rivals such as Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, which is luring passengers from airports such as Edinburgh with onward connections that Heathrow cannot offer, including the Chinese city of Hangzhou.", "Echoing another long-standing industry complaint, Holland-Kaye added that rising air passenger duty is pushing British-based long-haul passengers to airports such as Schiphol, because they do not have to pay a flight tax on their connecting flight from Amsterdam."], "title": "Heathrow passenger numbers decline", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/11/heathrow-airport-passenger-numbers-fall", "tags": ["Travel & leisure", "Air transport", "Heathrow", "Travel", "Transport", "UK news", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-14T14:35:00Z", "article": "Steve DeAngelo doesn&apos;t have the luxury of worrying about a threatened US government crackdown on medical marijuana dispensaries like the one he runs in Oakland, California. For him, the crackdown is already in full swing. As the head of the largest pot dispensary in the country, with more than 80,000 customers and annual revenues of more than $20m, DeAngelo always knew he would have a big target on his back if the federal authorities chose to challenge the state laws that allow him and thousands of other operators across the United States to sell marijuana on the open market. At the end of September \u2013 even before California&apos;s top federal prosecutors announced their intention to start filing criminal charges against medical marijuana purveyors, their landlords and the newspapers and television stations where they advertise their services \u2013 the feds fired their first shot. The Internal Revenue Service, America&apos;s tax collecting agency, sent a letter demanding an initial $2.5 million in back taxes and characterised DeAngelo&apos;s dispensary, the Harborside Health Center, as a drug trafficking organisation. Using a provision of the tax code originally written to help seize the assets of gangsters and organised criminals, the IRS said Harborside was disqualified from claiming its ordinary business expenses \u2013 payroll, insurance, rent and so on \u2013 as deductions and needed to pay taxes on them instead. &quot;We are a nonprofit organisation, so we have no profit to draw from to meet this demand,&quot; DeAngelo said. &quot;This is not just an attempt to tax us. It&apos;s an attempt to tax us out of existence.&quot; Worse may be yet to come: last month, California&apos;s four US Attorneys set a 45-day deadline for dispensaries and their landlords to make themselves scarce or face the consequences, and that deadline expired on Saturday. Whether the federal authorities have the nerve to carry out the threat remains to be seen, since their belligerence has provoked an extraordinary backlash in the media, in Congress and in the courts. The federal authorities like to paint a picture of a free-for-all marijuana market, in which bogus dispensaries effectively hand out drugs to all-comers. But that does not account for the rapidly evolving regulatory framework imposed by states and local municipalities.  DeAngelo&apos;s dispensary is widely viewed as above board, as is a recently targeted marijuana farm in the wild coastal landscape of Mendocino County, north of San Francisco, where every last plant is tagged as meeting state inspection requirements. Many of the more obviously rogue operations, meanwhile, have been policed out of existence without federal intervention. An ordinance in Los Angeles last year cleared the Venice Beach boardwalk of dozens of bogus &quot;kush doctors&quot; who had sprouted as a tourist attraction to rival Amsterdam&apos;s fabled coffee houses. Medical marijuana movement Seeing himself not as a drug pusher but as an advocate and carer for the sick, DeAngelo is fighting with everything he has, and so is the rest of the medical marijuana movement. He has helped establish a nationwide publicity campaign to push back against the IRS and its characterisation of regulated dispensaries as traffickers.  His dispensary is about to be featured in a television reality show called &quot;Weed Wars&quot; in which his battles with the feds will be front and centre. He and other advocacy groups have organised protest marches up and down California.            DeAngelo has helped persuade his local congressman to introduce a bill to amend the tax code. California&apos;s entire congressional delegation is sympathetic, not least because marijuana dispensaries bring in tens of millions of dollars in badly needed tax revenues and support tens of thousands of jobs that the ailing economy can ill afford to lose. One major lawsuit, filed by others, has challenged the federal government&apos;s constitutional right to trump state laws \u2013 medical marijuana is legal in 16 states, plus the District of Columbia. While the chances of prevailing on this seem slim, the suit has generated considerable publicity including a spotlight on one of the plaintiffs, a young California melanoma sufferer called Briana Billbray whose father is a Republican congressman. DeAngelo&apos;s best weapon is the knowledge that 80 per cent of Americans support the medical use of marijuana and, for the first time according to a recent Gallup poll, more than half of them are now in favour of blanket legalisation. He knows he can win the argument that it is in everyone&apos;s best interests \u2013 including law enforcement&apos;s \u2013 to have people buy marijuana from regulated dispensaries instead of forcing them to turn to criminals on the underground market. But he does not underestimate the power of the federal government and expects the fight to be a long and bruising one. &quot;As goes Harborside, so goes the rest of the industry,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a battle for the existence of regulated cannabis in this country.&quot; Much of the movement&apos;s anger is directed at Barack Obama, who came into office three years ago promising to leave the legitimate side of the business alone \u2013 in start contrast to his predecessor, George Bush, who waged an explicit campaign against medical marijuana in California. Now many advocacy groups fear that Obama may end up even worse than Bush; CBS news recently concurred in a headline referring to &quot;the White House jihad on pot&quot;. White House stance The true picture appears to be more complicated, however. Washington insiders who have discussed the issue with Obama&apos;s staff say the real impetus for the crackdown is coming from career prosecutors, not political appointees, and that the White House is afraid to challenge the prosecutors too openly for fear of falling into another Bush-era trap by interfering with their right to exercise independent judgement. In other words, the prevailing problem in the White House is absence of leadership, not an excess of it. The Obama people &quot;have painted themselves into a corner,&quot; said Aaron Houston of the group Students for a Sensible Drug Policy, &quot;where now people expect... that he can enforce the policy his Justice Department originally set out. But it&apos;s not enforceable... He&apos;s massively overpromised.&quot;     A one-ounce bag of medicinal marijuana is displayed at the Berkeley patients' group in Berkeley, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    Houston said there is a pattern of cooperation between federal prosecutors, the IRS and regulators at the Treasury Department who have gone after the bank accounts of dispensary operators, and they have \u2013 up to now \u2013 successfully pressured the administration into giving them what they want. One policy statement issued by the deputy attorney general in 2009 made clear regulated medical marijuana dispensaries were not a target. A follow-up policy statement in June this year, however, made clear that &quot;persons who are in the business of cultivating, selling or distributing marijuana&quot;, for whatever reason, are breaking federal law. The change of tune, many marijuana advocates say, came about because several states took the first statement as a signal to pass medical marijuana laws and greatly expand the scope of their licensing and regulatory framework. That, in turn, alarmed the law enforcement establishment because they saw it as a gateway to wholesale marijuana legalisation, which they strongly oppose, and they pressed the Justice Department to give them clearance to enforce the drug laws as written. Steve DeAngelo said it was no coincidence, in his view, that the businesses being targeted most vigorously are the most respectable and visible. &quot;If they had gone after the profiteers, the people using state law as a front for criminal activity, none of us would be rising to their defence,&quot; he said. &quot;But they are going after people who never diverted a gram from medicine.&quot; It will be far from a simple battle. Aaron Houston and other pro-marijuana lobbyists in Washington are urging the Obama administration to address the issue more openly in public and acknowledge the groundswell of public opinion in their favour. The federal prosecutors in California, meanwhile, appear to be taken aback by the vehemence of the reaction to their announced crackdown. One federal prosecutor during the Bush years, Joseph Russoniello of San Francisco, eventually pulled back from his own campaign to fight the medical marijuana movement, saying it was like &quot;shovelling sand against the tide&quot;. DeAngelo and his friends are hoping the Obama-era establishment will quickly come to the same conclusion.", "sentences": ["An ordinance in Los Angeles last year cleared the Venice Beach boardwalk of dozens of bogus &quot;kush doctors&quot; who had sprouted as a tourist attraction to rival Amsterdam&apos;s fabled coffee houses."], "title": "Cannabis crackdown threatens legal trade in medical drugs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/14/medical-marijuana-crackdown-california", "tags": ["Drugs trade", "Drugs", "Drugs policy", "Drugs", "Health", "Society", "Obama administration", "US news", "World news", "California", "Cannabis"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-15T14:01:00Z", "article": "Sounding ever so slightly resentful, John Hekelaar says: &quot;The Germans got there first.&quot; He&apos;s referring not to the pick of poolside sun loungers, but rather to the establishment of an organisation defending the interests of an oft-neglected minority: tall people. Hekelaar, 64 years old and 2 metres in his socks (&quot;I&apos;m one of the shorter ones,&quot; he confesses) is president of the Dutch Klub Lange Mensen, literally the Tall People&apos;s Club, which was established in 1958 by &quot;some tall guy in Amsterdam&quot; and has been campaigning on behalf of the vertically extravagant ever since. Today, the club has some 2,000 members nationwide and serves as a forum for problem-sharing and -solving. You&apos;re welcome to join, regardless of nationality, as long as you meet the minimum height requirement: 1.8 metres for women; 1.9 metres for\u00a0men. But hang on a minute. Isn&apos;t being tall a desirable thing, a sign that you&apos;re one of Darwin&apos;s straight &quot;A&quot; students? Why on earth is a bunch of people who&apos;ve won the genetic lottery standing around feeling sorry for themselves? Well, because they can&apos;t always find somewhere to sit down, for one thing. The club&apos;s manifesto explains some of the logistical problems facing members: &quot;Leg space on trains, trams and buses is insufficient. Airlines are not interested in delivering service to a minority group who have trouble sitting in their seats. The automotive industry is largely unconcerned by sitting comfort [for tall people]; bicycle producers only serve tall people in their highest price range.&quot; And that&apos;s just transit. Town planning is another bugbear: &quot;Low-hanging traffic signs and shop awnings can be very dangerous,&quot; confides Hekelaar. &quot;We keep hitting our heads. Even in The Netherlands, which has the tallest population in the world, there is still no regulation governing these things.&quot; It&apos;s not all doom and gloom, though. Hekelaar believes that Klub Lange Mensen is close to a breakthrough in its negotiations with a major airline to offer preferential seating for its members. And, if all the head-bashing, leg-cramping and bending over gets too much, members can always hit the bars for the club&apos;s regular get-togethers: &quot;We&apos;re quite a sight to see when we&apos;re out together!&quot; says Hekelaar.

Here an excerpt from his essay, A Rhinestone as Big as the Ritz about the Liberace Museum.     Air Guitar: Essays on Art & Democracy    &quot;The balcony of my apartment faces west toward the mountains, overlooking the Las Vegas Strip; so, every evening when the sky is not overcast, a few minutes after the sun has gone down, the mountains turn black, the sky above them turns this radical plum/rouge, and the neon logos of The Desert Inn, The Stardust, Circus Circus, The Riviera, The Las Vegas Hilton, and Vegas World blaze forth against the black mountains \u2013 and every night I find myself struck by the fact that, while The Strip always glitters with a reckless and undeniable specificity against the darkness, the sunset, smoldering out above the mountains, every night and without exception, looks bogus as hell. It&apos;s spectacular, of course, and even, occasionally, sublime (if you like sublime), but to my eyes that sunset is always fake \u2013 as flat and gaudy as Barnett Newman and just as pretentious. Friends of mine who visit watch this light show with different eyes, they prefer the page of the landscape to the text of the neon. They seem to think it&apos;s more &apos;authentic&apos;. I, on the other hand, suspect that &apos;authenticity&apos; is altogether elsewhere \u2013 that they are responding to nature&apos;s ability to mimic the sincerity of a painting, that the question of the sunset and The Strip is more a matter of one&apos;s taste in duplicity. One either prefers the honest fakery of the neon or the fake honesty of the sunset \u2013 the undisguised artifice of culture or the cultural construction of &apos;authenticity&apos; \u2013 the genuine rhinestone, finally, or the imitation pearl.&quot;\u2022 Circus Circus, Circus Circus Drive Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour, Learning from Las Vegas: The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form, 1972 Now seen as a bible for postmodernist architecture, Venturi&apos;s seminal book saw the urban sprawl of Las Vegas as an architecture of communication over space, achieved through style and signs.

Here we discover The Neon Museum in Danielle Kelly&apos;s essay Live Rust: Love, Mold, and Heavy Metal in the Neon Boneyard:     Fade, Sag, Crumble,     &quot;The Neon Museum and Boneyard has spent 15 years preserving the neon vernacular of Las Vegas.

The condition of some is impeccable, and a few are on the brink of collapse, but most exist somewhere in between. Each has a beautifully disproportionate combination of elegant tubing hugging exposed metal, with unevenly corroding paint and the occasional rusted corner. Some wear the scars of decades of labour and occasional abuse, are partially crushed or dismembered. A pathway has been plotted in and around the signs, which tend to veer, all angles and abstracts, into the path as they see fit. It&apos;s like a grand promenade through a rusty Roman ruin. &quot;Thousands flock every year to capture a snapshot of this fallen neon.

Their greatest achievement came either in their very first match \u2013 a 1-0 win (as Irish Free State) over Bulgaria at the 1924 Olympics which set up a 2-1 quarter-final defeat by the Netherlands \u2013 or the qualifiers for the 1938 World Cup against Norway, a two-legged affair the Irish lost by the odd goal in 11. That was a brave showing from a team light on stars: their only name was the forward Jimmy Dunne, a title winner with Arsenal, though the future Manchester United legend Johnny Carey made his debut in the second leg. Norway, by comparison, were the real deal, bronze medallists in the 1936 Olympics and, at the following World Cup finals in France, a controversial offside flag away from knocking out reigning champions Italy. Vittorio Pozzo&apos;s side scraped through 2-1 after extra time, and went on to retain their trophy. But the original seismic Irish result came four years after the war, against England at Goodison Park. The first game between the two countries had been played in 1946, in a rain-lashed Dublin, and was won by a single Tom Finney goal eight minutes from time. England were favourites to win the second in Liverpool \u2013 not least because they had never lost a match on English soil against a team from outside the Home Nations \u2013 but Walter Winterbottom&apos;s side were far from complacent. &quot;It would be folly indeed to approach the game in a light mood,&quot; thundered the Times on the morning of the match, &quot;and England we may be sure will not make that mistake. But on the face of it, there should only be one ending.&quot; But England were in for a rude surprise. &quot;All the evidence pointed to only one possible verdict,&quot; reported the same paper the following day, &quot;yet by the afternoon&apos;s end, that evidence was proved not worth the paper on which it was written. For England this was nothing short of a major disaster \u2026 though the Eire goal did at times seem to bear a charmed life in the later stages of the afternoon, the solid fact remains that the England forwards had the ball at their command for four-fifths of the second half and yet could not turn their position to account \u2026 Every man of Eire was a hero.&quot; In fact, Ireland had started poorly and should have been behind within 20 seconds, but Jesse Pye of Wolves \u2013 in his only international appearance \u2013 headed a Finney cross wide from close range. Finney then missed a one-on-one with keeper Tommy Godwin. But after 32 minutes, Ireland turned their first attack into a goal: Peter Desmond was upended by Bert Mozley in the area, and Con Martin beat Bert Williams from the spot. Davy Walsh nearly made it two for Ireland before the break. After half-time, England turned up the heat, but Godwin made a series of fine saves, Billy Walsh and Martin took turns to clear off the line, Peter Harris hit the underside of the bar, Johnny Morris and Pye both shot straight at Godwin from close range \u2013 and, with five minutes to go, Desmond sent Peter Farrell clear to make it 2-0. England would have to wait eight years to gain revenge. They did so with a 5-1 win at Wembley during qualification for the 1958 World Cup, Tommy Taylor scoring a hat-trick, John Atyeo pitching in with the other two, Dermot Curtis netting Ireland&apos;s consolation. England sealed qualification from the group in the return match, though according to the Guardian they were &quot;outplayed&quot; and &quot;outclassed&quot; in a 1-1 draw, Alf Ringstead scoring early, Charlie Hurley bossing the game, Atyeo heading home an undeserved last-minute equaliser. 2) Republic of Ireland 1-4 Yugoslavia (1955) On a crisp October morning in 1951, the gardener at the People&apos;s Park in Dun Laoghaire, Dublin, turned up for work to witness a large truck wheelspinning hysterically out of the gates. Upon further investigation, the reason for the articulated pantechnicon&apos;s speedy departure became clear: its drivers had made off with an 18-foot, three-ton bronze statue from the grounds. Many weeks passed without anybody knowing where the statue had gone. The sculpture had already been something of an enigma before its disappearance \u2013 having spent the duration of the war hidden from the Nazis under a haystack in France, it had then sat in the Dublin park for over a year in an unopened wooden crate, the authorities worried about its modernist depiction of a crucifix \u2013 but this mystery was something else. The police claimed not to know what had happened, but were adamant the statue had not been technically stolen. Members of the statue committee on the council were equally reticent. The theft was not reported in any Irish newspaper. Until, three months after the theft, one Sunday paper broke ranks, and reported that the statue was &quot;known to be on the north side of the city, somewhere in Drumcondra&quot;. This was shorthand for &quot;at the Archbishop of Dublin&apos;s gaff&quot;. Turns out the influential churchman John Charles McQuaid fancied a bit of culture in the grounds of his residence, and ordered the statue to be brought to him, telling cops, bureaucrats and newspapermen alike that he was simply in the process of soliciting further opinion regarding its artistic merits, and that they were to shut their faces. In other words, whatever McQuaid wanted, McQuaid usually got. In 1952, he bullied the FAI into withdrawing an invitation made to Yugoslavia, incandescent with the idea of the Irish playing a &quot;Godless&quot; communist country. However, three years later, the FAI arranged another game with the Yugoslavs at Dalymount Park. Again the rosary came wheeching out of McQuaid&apos;s pram \u2013 he cited the &quot;persecution&quot; of a Catholic priest who was on trial for collaborating with fascists \u2013 but this time the FAI did not back down. The battle was on. On the Sunday before the match, McQuaid called on the entire country to boycott the event. Schoolchildren were ordered not to attend the game, as doing so would be a &quot;mortal sin&quot;. There was no broadcast of the match by Radio Eireann, their commentator Philip Green having declined to report it in deference to McQuaid&apos;s wishes. Mass protests were held outside the stadium. President Se\u00e1n Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Ceallaigh, slated to welcome the teams, decided not to attend. And yet an estimated crowd of between 20,000 and 25,000 fans turned up, a defiant gesture by working-class Dubliners, making what was then an extremely rare public stand against the diktats of the church. Before the start of the game, it was found that the Yugoslav flag was flying upside down. It was hastily winched up the right way. The Irish Army Band, who usually whacked out the pre-match anthems, had been withdrawn, so gramophone music was blasted out over loudspeakers. A hard-tackling Ireland played well and dominated for long periods, but basic defensive mistakes allowed the legendary Milos Milutinovic of Partizan Belgrade to make hay; he scored a hat-trick as Yugoslavia ran out 4-1 winners. Ireland had been thrashed, but the only real loser that day had been McQuaid, whose sacred institution had been defied en masse. 3) Republic of Ireland 3-2 France (1981) Ireland have their fair share of nemeses when it comes to major tournament qualification. The Czechs, for example. Czechoslovakia put Ireland out of the first-ever European Nations Cup in the only preliminary tie for what we must retrospectively call Euro 60. Ireland had won the first leg at Dalymont Park 2-0, but lost the return 4-0. Liam Tuohy&apos;s opener in the first match is claimed to be the first goal in European Championship history, but that&apos;s not the case: Anatoly Ilyin of the USSR has that honour, his side&apos;s first-round, first-leg 3-1 win over Hungary being played seven months before Ireland&apos;s preliminary tie. Ireland were also not, as is sometimes stated, the first side to be knocked out of the Euros; Greece were the hapless groundbreakers there, bundled out 8-2 on aggregate in the first round by France, five months before Ireland kicked a ball in anger. Anyway, the Czechs as nemesis. No shame: they beat Ireland 3-1 and 7-1 in qualification for the 1962 World Cup, then went on to reach the final. They won 2-1 and 3-0 during the 1970 World Cup qualifiers. They romped ahead of Steve Staunton&apos;s side during the farcical Euro 2008 qualification campaign. And they finished ahead of Ireland in the qualifiers for Euro 68, although neither team made it to the quarters, and Ireland at least enjoyed some schadenfreude by scoring two late goals in Prague to deny the awkward Czechs progress. Nemesis No2: the FAI, which took a financial inducement to play Ireland&apos;s 1966 World Cup qualifying play-off against Spain in Paris, where a large Spanish support would be guaranteed, instead of Wembley, where the Irish were a shoo-in to enjoy the loudest backing. Sure enough, Ireland lost 1-0. Well done, everyone! But France are probably the chief pain-bringerls. Younger Irish fans will have the righteous hot heat over Thierry Henry&apos;s handball antics in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup. Older supporters may remember their side&apos;s first match under the Fifa-coined Republic of Ireland banner, a 5-3 home defeat to the French in the 1954 World Cup qualifiers \u2013 a proper thrashing, two late Irish goals making the scoreline semi-respectable. And then there was the qualifying campaign for the 1982 World Cup. Ireland won their last game of their group, a coruscating 3-2 victory over France, Frank Stapleton the two-goal hero in front of 53,000 bellowing fans at Lansdowne Road. It was potentially, as the Guardian reported, &quot;their most significant victory in international football&quot;. But it would count for naught. France had two games in their pocket, though Ireland retained genuine hope: the French were on a terrible run, having lost six out of their last seven internationals. But les Bleus went on to beat the Netherlands, and then Cyprus, to pip the Irish on goal difference. Not for the last time in their history, Ireland bemoaned some appalling refereeing decisions. Stapleton had a perfectly good goal chalked off in Belgium, who took a crucial point off Ireland with an 88th-minute Jan Ceulemans winner, from a free-kick earned by an Eric Gerets dive. Then in Paris, Michael Robinson had a goal disallowed, which television later showed to be valid. &quot;After the Belgium game, I called the referee disgraceful and a cheat to his face, and I will not withdraw the remarks,&quot; said the manager Eoin Hand. &quot;I am sure that people in authority do not want us to qualify for Spain. They would prefer the more glamorous countries to get there to make sure the tournament is a success. I cannot keep quiet about this, and nothing will change my opinions.&quot; The FAI lodged an official complaint with Fifa, much good it did. Ireland had to make do with plaudits from a brave showing in a group containing the 1978 World Cup finalists, and a team about to become the darlings of 1982. 4) Brazil 7-0 Republic of Ireland (1982) Any momentum from the unlucky 1982 World Cup qualification campaign was immediately lost on a farcical tour of South America. The FAI was hoping to make a massive \u00a350,000 from the trip, which had been described by a spokesman as &quot;the greatest tour the Republic has ever had&quot;. The itinerary was indeed mouthwatering: matches against Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Brazil. However, the plans would quickly go pear-shaped when Argentina struck upon the wheeze of invading the Falkland Islands a month before Ireland&apos;s visit. Arsenal, Brighton and Hove Albion, Newcastle United and Manchester United all understandably refused to let their players travel to a country Great Britain was at war with. Ireland pulled out of the Argentina game in the hope of reversing the clubs&apos; decisions, but although some relented, it wasn&apos;t enough to get the full complement of first-teamers back, and so Eoin Hand topped up his squad with lower league and League of Ireland players \u2013 step forward Johnny &apos;Jabber&apos; Walsh of Limerick and Mick Fairclough of Dundalk \u2013 before heading off for the sun. The tone was set for a fortnight of farce. Tottenham&apos;s Chris Hughton turned up at the airport only to find the FAI had forgotten to buy him a ticket. (Just picture that happening to Roy Keane.) The Peru game fell by the wayside. A match was hastily organised with Trinidad &amp; Tobago; the minnows beat Ireland 2-1. Chile won 1-0 while barely bothering to conceal a yawn. But the hammer blow came in Uberlandia, where Ireland suffered their record defeat. Brazil had been struggling for form, with recent home draws against the Czechs and the Swiss, but here they hit upon the recipe for the team they&apos;d take to the World Cup, one of the all-time great sides. To Ireland&apos;s credit, the score was only 1-0 at half-time, Falc\u00e3o scoring with a deflection after 32 minutes. But in the second half, Serginho and Socrates both scored twice, before Luisinho and Zico added one each to complete a sorry rout. Brazil followed it up with a 13-3 win over Belenenses in Lisbon as they prepared for a bittersweet World Cup in Spain. Hand would never lead Ireland to a major tournament, but he did at least enjoy the consolation of counterbalancing that record defeat with the Republic&apos;s biggest win, an 8-0 trouncing of Malta at the tail end of 1983. Incidentally, Ireland weren&apos;t the only team whose summer plans were jiggered by the brouhaha over the Malvinas. Leeds United also pulled out of a tour to, er, Honduras. &quot;I know Honduras is in central America,&quot; shrugged the Leeds assistant manager Martin Wilkinson, idly spinning a globe with his finger, &quot;but we still didn&apos;t feel it was right.&quot; 5) Scotland 0-1 Republic of Ireland (1987) Ireland enjoyed many wondrous victories during the heady Jack Charlton era. The joyous 1-0 win over England at the 1988 European Championship. The intense 1-0 World Cup win over Spain in 1989, not long after Hillsborough, John Aldridge too upset to play. The incredible 1-0 win against Italy at the 1994 World Cup. The second-round defeat of Romania, 0-0 at Italia 90, sending the Irish into the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Goals weren&apos;t really the point. This game, yet another 1-0 victory, pales into insignificance alongside those stellar moments, but then without it, none of the aforementioned heights might have been scaled. Scotland, younger readers may be confused to the point of head-spinning queasiness to learn, used to regularly qualify for major tournaments in the 1970s and 1980s. With a squad including the likes of Alan Hansen, Richard Gough, Ally McCoist, Pat Nevin, Brian McClair, Mo Johnston, Gordon Strachan and Davie Cooper, they were heavily fancied to reach Euro 88. But the Scots would face two major problems in this particular quest. One, their previous two managers having been Alex Ferguson and Jock Stein, they were now led by Andy Roxburgh, formerly, according to Billy Connolly, the window cleaner at the SFA. Secondly, the Charlton revolution was beginning to bear fruit over the Irish Sea. Only three games into Big Jack&apos;s reign, Ireland had won their first-ever bauble, a triangular tournament in Iceland, during which they beat both the hosts and Czechoslovakia. Charlton&apos;s first competitive game was a 2-2 draw in Belgium in the Euro 88 qualifiers, Ireland twice coming from behind, first through a Stapleton diving header from long range (!) then a last-minute Liam Brady penalty. Ireland were then held by the Scots at home, but next came the return game at Hampden. Mark Lawrenson scored early on, latching on to a quickly taken free-kick by John Aldridge to slip the ball past Jim Leighton. Mick McCarthy, preferred by Charlton to David O&apos;Leary, twice cleared off line, first from MoJo, then McCoist. &quot;If this suggests Scotland were unlucky,&quot; reported the Guardian, &quot;they plainly were not.&quot; This was the result that made folk sit bolt upright and take notice of what was going on under Charlton&apos;s yoke. Until Ireland won 4-0 in Estonia last week, this was arguably their last significant away win. Roxburgh&apos;s side, the Irish will no doubt recall, did have one good performance in them during that campaign, though much good it did them. 6) Republic of Ireland 1-0 Holland (2001) In their first game of the 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign, Ireland drew 2-2 in Holland. They had been two goals up with 19 minutes to play. Time to celebrate an unexpected point, or fume at two thrown away? &quot;People have suggested my players lack respect for me,&quot; said Mick McCarthy, holding court from a leather armchair in an Amsterdam piano bar that evening, &quot;but you can look at that display and judge for yourself. We came to Holland, played them at their own game, and matched them all the way.&quot; Away from Mick&apos;s comfortable jazz environment, Ireland&apos;s lead soloist Roy Keane was riffing on a theme. &quot;We&apos;re good players and we&apos;ve got to start giving ourselves more credit. People are always saying the Irish will have a good time whatever the result, and I&apos;m sick of that stuff. We&apos;re better than that and we should stop underestimating ourselves.&quot; Ireland followed up that result with another superb away display, a 1-1 draw in Portugal. &quot;I know I&apos;m doing a good job,&quot; smiled McCarthy after that match, Ireland having now held two of the Euro 2000 semi-finalists on their own patch. Towards the end of a 3-0 win away against Andorra, Keane was surrounded by three opponents clearly hoping to swap the great man&apos;s jersey at the final whistle. When it blew, Keane barged past them all and stomped off down the tunnel, resolutely unimpressed by the lack of commitment shown by Andorra. (It wasn&apos;t all slap-bass funk, incidentally: Keane later made a point of taking the time to shake hands and have his photo taken with star-struck youth players in the tunnel.) By the time the business end of the campaign had been reached, Portugal were shoo-ins for automatic qualification. Holland travelled to Dublin for a game which, in effect, decided who would make the play-offs. Louis van Gaal hubristically announced that his Dutch side were so much more talented than their hosts, even the Irish would want them to qualify. Oh Louis, you know how these things usually pan out. Within the first 30 seconds, Keane clattered Marc Overmars with a symbolic reducer. It raised the volume at Lansdowne, cranking up the tension. Keane wasn&apos;t even booked. Patrick Kluivert, in a blistering funk at the referee&apos;s inaction, immediately missed a one-on-one with Shay Given. The more composed Overmars set about destroying Gary Kelly, teasing a booking out of the hapless full-back, who eventually picked up a second yellow card just before the hour. Despite being under the cosh for most of the match, and now down to 10 men, Ireland responded, Jason McAteer sweeping home on 67 minutes. Van Gaal responded in surreal fashion, by taking off the dangerous Overmars and ordering his men to launch long ball after punt after hoof into the Irish area. Ireland, happy to deal with direct tactics all day, made it home. Ireland were effectively in the play-offs, Holland as good as out. As the Irish celebrated on the pitch after the final whistle, Keane didn&apos;t bother cracking a smile. He did shake hands with McCarthy, though. There&apos;s a nice end to the story, eh?

This gives it a\u00a0familiar feel: of a Western European, weekend break, cultural-tick-box city. But, although it can remind you of Amsterdam, of Berlin, of Brussels, it&apos;s not really like any of those places. Because St Petersburg is in Russia. Russia! My mum and I don fake-fur hats and pose outside the Winter Palace of Peter I. There is no snow and the sky is the colour of Tupperware. It is perishing. Weary-looking horses stand in front of golden carriages, puffa-wrapped schoolchildren cluster and bump like tethered balloons, men in khaki army uniforms stride about, young and raw-jawed. Behind them glitters the Barbie mansion that is the Winter Palace. It links into other palaces that make up the Hermitage museum, stretched along the bank of the River Neva. By December the river will be frozen and won&apos;t thaw until April. My mum has been to St Petersburg before: in 1981, when was she was a teacher in Manchester, she took a group of schoolgirls. &quot;Everyone kept wanting to buy our jeans and coats,&quot; she remembers. &quot;And we went to a circus. That had vultures!&quot; Before that, in the summer of 1965, she and my dad drove to St Petersburg, in a Mini. They went via Finland. I really can&apos;t believe that they did this, but there are photographs. The main difference between 1965 St Petersburg and the city of 46 years later is, says Mum, the lack of cars. Back then, people formed crowds around the Mini, and ooh-ed and aah-ed over its transverse engine; during the communist years, no foreign cars were imported into Russia. Now, Ford, GM and Toyota all have factories close to St Petersburg and the centre sometimes locks into a static traffic jam. Also, she says, in 1965, &quot;there were no signs&quot;. In order to do anything \u2013 visit sites, check into a hotel, change money, get petrol tokens \u2013 they had to get authorisation from the In-Tourist office. They had the address, but couldn&apos;t find it and had to beg a sailor, who understood a\u00a0little English, to take them to the door. When they got there, it was entirely anonymous. No plaque, no display, no indication from the outside that there was anything non-domestic within. Now, St Petersburg has plenty of signs. Not that we can read them, of course, though some words are easy to guess: KOPE for coffee. PECTOPAH means restaurant, says my mum, and we go to a\u00a0Ukrainian one, where the waiters wear billowing silk trousers and everyone smokes. I ask for a vodka and tonic, and the waiter is genuinely puzzled. He brings me a glass of vodka, to be knocked back in one go, and a bottle of tonic for afters. His trousers are fancy. Ours are not. Not one person asks us if they can buy them. This is because there are clothes shops everywhere and because our trousers are not desirable. Today&apos;s Russian woman is tall and gorgeous and dressed like a Selfridges Christmas tree. There is no part of her clothing that is plain: everything is stonewashed, or appliqu\u00e9d, or has diamant\u00e9 dangly bits, or is made out of actual leopard. Heels are killer. Make-up can be viewed at 100 paces. Our trousers \u2013 and us \u2013 are just too dull. I wonder where these Swarovski-studded glamazons go when they hit 35. Because it appears that they are kidnapped and swapped for small, stout, grumpy lady trolls. After a\u00a0while, I realise all Russian women contain within their DNA both ravishing supermodels and Rosa Klebb \u2013 like St Petersburg; like Russia itself. On the way from the airport, we passed mile upon mile of concrete housing blocks: relics of the Communist era and still the places most locals live. And yet, in the city centre, all is a Big Fat Gypsy Architect&apos;s wet dream. With our tour guide, Natasha, we whizz around the city: go to the square that commemorates the Decemberists (nobles who died because they believed in the emancipation of serfs); the Church of the Spilt Blood where Alexander II was mortally wounded. And we visit St Peter and Paul&apos;s Fortress on an island opposite The Hermitage, a prime example of the Russian supermodel/Klebb combination. First up, the cathedral in the centre, an imperious feast of gold and mosaic which contains the tombs of all the Romanov emperors and empresses from Peter the Great until the very last, Nicholas II. Peter the Great, the city&apos;s namesake, was a redoubtable dude. Standing 6ft 8in, in a time when most people struggled to get over 5ft 6in, he became Tsar at 10 and founded St Petersburg in 1703, when he was 28. He learned about city planning in Manchester, shipbuilding in Amsterdam and paid for European architects, artists and artisans to come and create his vision of a city: the vision that still brings in the visitors of today. St Petersburg has a population of 4.5m, but 5.5m tourists visit each year. Peter the Great himself was skilled in various professions, including dentistry, though he is mostly remembered for his shipbuilding. He would go to the shipyards himself, often after a heavy night&apos;s drinking and two hours&apos; sleep, and teach the locals. He was modern-thinking, changing the clock to European time, making his courtiers shave their beards off and encouraging the population to come to Russia&apos;s first-ever museum, not far from here. The museum housed a display of deformed embryos brought back by him from Holland, and Peter offered a drink and a pastry on entrance. Free cake and booze. There&apos;s an emperor who understood his subjects. After Peter, the ruling Romanovs were, variously, vicious two-faced modernisers or vicious two-faced conservatives. Their tombs are in rows inside the cathedral: gilded, immovable. At a certain point, a law was passed banning females from the throne because they caused too much trouble. The final Tsar was Nicholas II, who was married to Alix, grand-daughter of Queen Victoria. Their tombs are in a separate room, at the back, away from the altar. They were murdered in 1917 on the orders of Lenin, their bodies and those of their five children thrown down a disused mine. Only in 2008 were the last two corpses found and identified by DNA samples. Natasha shrugs when she tells us this. &quot;It is sad, yes,&quot; she says. &quot;But I think worse for the ordinary Soviet people who lost their children to war or starvation.&quot; Natasha is 28 and pragmatic. She thinks some aspects of Communist Russia were good. Education, for example. Everyone in the country could read and write. But now, Putin has announced literacy is too high, because there is no one willing to sweep the streets (other than immigrants). So he&apos;s proposing that parents pay for all their children&apos;s lessons other than the basics. This, and the fact that you have to pay for childcare, is putting Natasha off becoming a mother. Also, she explains, when Communism collapsed, it was decreed that private property was the way forward. Thus, everyone was deemed to be an owner of their flat (previously rented from the state). That&apos;s everyone who lived there, including children from the age of 16. Natasha lives with her husband, his mum and grandmother. Four adults, all property owners. But none of them can sell, because of everyone else&apos;s claims. There&apos;s no room for kids. Natasha leads us to another part of the St Peter and Paul&apos;s Fortress: the political remand prison. Dostoevsky was imprisoned in the original jail, demolished in the late 1800s and replaced with the one we walk around. We poke our heads into dark, individual cells: Trotsky, Gorky, Lenin&apos;s brother all spent time here. The prison was carefully designed so that no prisoner ever encountered another; the identities of those incarcerated were even kept from the guards. No communication was allowed, though prisoners tapped messages to each other. The last one left in 1921. In the evening, we go to the circus. Natasha says: &quot;I would not allow you to go to a private circus. The animals are badly treated there, and I do not like it. There is a state circus in every city in Russia and all the animals are treated well. There is a cat theatre in Moscow. I love cats.&quot; It&apos;s half-term, and we take our seats among hundreds of children. And we sit through \u2013 no, be honest, we enjoy \u2013 two hours of unbelievable entertainment. Goats that trot up and down stairs. Cats that stand on the back of dogs. Monkeys that ride bicycles, bears that do handstands, sea lions that play football, ostriches that, um, run around a bit. It is utterly mesmerising. My animal morals take a thrashing. It is hard to resist clapping a sea lion when it&apos;s clapping at you. It is even harder not to love a monkey in a\u00a0bowtie and waistcoat. When I was young, I was obsessed by gymnastics. My heroine was Olga Korbut, the first woman to do a standing back somersault on the balance beam. She was enchanting: thoroughly charming, astonishingly gifted, a crowd-pleaser. She was also being abused by her coach. And she&apos;s what I think about when I watch the circus in St Petersburg. I\u00a0ask my mum if she enjoyed it. &quot;Yes,&quot; she says. &quot;No vultures, dear. A definite improvement.&quot; We leave, and go into the cold night. Everyone is smiling, and well wrapped-up. The city is stunning and there&apos;s so much more to see. Essentials Miranda Sawyer and her mother travelled with Baltic Holidays.

But transport problems persist, with a backlog of trains affected by emergency line repairs and further thefts of metal cabling from then train network which are causing increasing concern. The fog affected London and many other parts of the UK on Sunday as high humidity combined with gradually cooling temperatures. The patchy remains are expected to clear for the rest of Monday, but to re-form during the night. It led to the cancellation of 40 incoming morning flights and 24 departing ones at Heathrow airport. The early morning Amsterdam shuttle was also grounded at Leeds Bradford, whose high position at the top of Otley Chevin, a steep hillside above Wharfedale, makes it particularly vulnerable to poor weather. The Met Office warned that similar conditions are likely to lead to the return of fog by Tuesday, before clearer and colder conditions, including frost, arrive on Wednesday. A Heathrow spokeswoman said: &quot;The fog has started to clear, and there are now no restrictions on flying. There are currently no delays to flights, but we advise passengers to check with their airlines before travelling.&quot; Flights affected earlier included scheduled services to Amsterdam \u2013 where Schipol airport was also disrupted by fog \u2013 Brussels, Cologne, Glasgow, Manchester, Nice and Stockholm. The problems saw 81 departures and 65 arrivals cancelled. Ten morning flights from London City airport to Dublin, Rotterdam and Paris were cancelled but the airport is operating normally again. The train disruption affected Waterloo station in London, with repairs hitting services from Shepperton, Kingston and Surbiton, while the Piccadilly and Metropolitan underground lines were partly suspended after signals failed in west London. The latest cable theft, near Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, for sale to scrap merchants in spite of the industry&apos;s attempts to enforce a code, delayed the Stansted airport express and trains into Liverpool Street, London, from East Anglia. The general secretary of the RMT transport union, Bob Crow, said: &quot;We agree with Network Rail that we need more track patrols, but that means reinstating the 1,400 posts deleted as a result of government cuts and stopping the nonsense of further job cuts.&quot; But there was cheerier news from Christmas mistletoe auctioneer Nick Champion, who forecast lower prices because of the mild autumn. He said he expected wholesale prices of about \u00a31 a kilogramme at the three-day auction in Shropshire he has conducted in late November and early December for 33 years. &quot;There is a good crop and plenty of mistletoe about by the look of it,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve got apple trees in my own garden and the mistletoe on them has plenty of berries and I think it will be the same for everyone else.&quot; Some 1,800 lots of between 10kg and 30kg are expected to be sold from pickers across the plant&apos;s heartland in the Midlands, the west country and Wales.

The work, For the Love of God, has recently drawn huge crowds at museums in Florence and Amsterdam \u2013 but has not been seen in London since 2007 when, at the height of Britain&apos;s pre-crash prosperity, it was sold (for \u00a350m, Hirst claimed) to a consortium that included the artist himself. Hirst, 46, occupies a unique place in British culture: the prime mover among a brash and brilliant generation of artists who emerged in the early 1990s, determined to be famous, unabashed by controversy. And, although he has had retrospective exhibitions in Naples and Monaco, he has never been the focus of a solo show in a British museum that would allow visitors to set aside the hype and judge the works on their own terms. Over 70 pieces, a number of them room-size installations, will come to Tate Modern from April to September next year. But, significantly, the show will not include recent works such as the critically panned skull paintings he showed at the Wallace Collection in London in 2009 \u2013 described by the Guardian&apos;s art critic, Adrian Searle, as &quot;a memento mori for a reputation&quot;. Instead, the exhibition, curated by the Tate&apos;s Ann Gallagher, will mainly follow ideas he began to explore when young. &quot;We did have to make decisions,&quot; she said. &quot;We are concentrating on series established early in his career, not the series that began later.&quot; There will, she said, be at least one new piece \u2013 but it will follow the route of early series, rather than developing his recent experiments with figurative painting. There will be plenty of familiar signature pieces, such as the pickled shark \u2013 The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living (1991) \u2013 and the picked cow and calf, Mother and Child Divided, in the version made for the Tate&apos;s Turner prize retrospective in 2007. Hirst&apos;s vitrines and pharmaceutical cabinets will be explored from their earliest incarnation: Sinner, a medicine cabinet he made in 1988 while still a student at Goldsmiths College. Also featured is A Thousand Years (1990), consisting of a glass box containing flies, maggots, a cow&apos;s head and an Insect-O-Cutor. It was one of his earliest works to explore mortality via living creatures as the flies fed, reproduced and were killed. With a great deal of the work in the exhibition made familiar by media exposure, the organisers claim the show will give visitors a fresh perspective. &quot;They are very well-known as images,&quot; said Gallagher, &quot;but they have not been brought together ever before, and we want to show the unravelling and unrolling of an entire career.&quot; Chris Dercon, Tate Modern&apos;s director, said: &quot;We all think we know this work through the media. But if you are actually with the work, and can experience it, smell it, and I shouldn&apos;t say this, but touch it \u2013 it will be very different. There is a claustrophobic, congested feeling from experiencing these works \u2026 these are rooms, environments, which invite the spectator to interact. There is a kinaesthetic aspect when you are in the room with these works, seeing your own reflection in the vitrines. It is as if you are stepping into his laboratory of ideas.&quot; One of the high points of the show will be the chance to see a two-part installation shown together for the first time since it was installed in a disused London shop in 1991. In and Out of Love (White Paintings and Live Butterflies) consists of a room lined with white-painted canvases with pupae attached to them. Butterflies hatch and feed, then eventually die. The second part is called In and Out of Love (Butterfly Paintings and Ashtrays), a room in which dead butterflies are stuck to canvases, with a table nearby, on which sits an ashtray and cigarette ends \u2013 an early example of Hirst&apos;s use of cigarettes as a metaphor for pleasure and death. Visitors will be able to walk through the room with butterflies fluttering through it. One of the fascinations of the exhibition will be the chance to reassess Hirst \u2013 who, perhaps more than any other living artist, is associated with the vagaries of the art market \u2013 in the light of what appears to be a new economic era. A recent world tour for the diamond skull was cancelled because of fears it would look &quot;inappropriate&quot; in the current financial climate, said Jude Tyrrell, the director of Hirst&apos;s company, Science. It will surely look very different in the uncertain London of 2012 compared with its sensational appearance in buoyant 2007. The exhibition will also have a room devoted to Hirst&apos;s auction at Sotheby&apos;s, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, which raised \u00a3111m on 15 and 16 September 2008, the day before Lehman Brothers collapsed. It will provide a chance for visitors to reflect on an event in which art and commerce were intermingled in an unprecedented way \u2013 with Hirst &quot;curating&quot; the event as if it were an artwork in itself, and bypassing his gallery, White Cube, to sell direct to the public. The Damien Hirst exhibition, part of the Cultural Olympiad&apos;s London 2012 festival, runs at Tate Modern from 4 April to 9 September.

He made claims of racism towards him but did not mention Cruyff. Davids said: &quot;Sometimes people cross the line within the supervisory board. There have even been racist comments. I don&apos;t want to go into details.&quot; Subsequently, another Ajax supervisory board member, Steven ten\u00a0Have, conducted a live interview with Studio Voetbal in which he pointed the finger at\u00a0Cruyff.

Crowd scene: In the six months since it opened, the cinema and cafe have quickly become popular stop-offs among Sarajevo&apos;s intelligentsia for movies, art exhibits, dance parties and coffee. The theatre&apos;s location just across the river from Sarajevo University&apos;s Academy of Fine Arts makes it a favourite among students and professors alike. It&apos;s common to see young civil-society activists plotting outreach campaigns after taking in a show. The cinema&apos;s proximity to the European Union delegation building, where hundreds of Eurocrats work to prepare Bosnia and Herzegovina for EU accession, attracts liberal professionals from across the continent. In a country still afflicted by homophobia, Kriterion is one of the few places open to everyone. Back story: Almost all of Sarajevo&apos;s cultural icons and establishments were destroyed in the 40-month siege of the city during the 1992-1995 war between Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniak Muslims. Sixteen years after the war&apos;s end, there is a dearth of funding for the arts, and artists struggle to implement cultural programmes. Even the National Art Museum was recently closed due to lack of funding. The Kriterion, though, which has benefited from a dedicated team since 2006, is the embodiment of the resilience not only of the artistic community, but of Sarajevo itself. Kriterion is affiliated with its sister cinema in Amsterdam, which was previously reviewed by Jon Barrenechea. Barrenechea described how the original theatre arose from a group of Dutch students active in the Nazi resistance movement. In Sarajevo, the founders of Kriterion are firmly rejecting a more contemporary social problem, nationalism, which was the by-product of the collapse of Yugoslavia. Although Sarajevo was once home to Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs under leader-for-life Josip Broz Tito, it is no longer as ethnically mixed. But you&apos;d never know it from the Kriterion, where people from all backgrounds work towards the cinema&apos;s success. Dutch students (part of the original Kriterion foundation) came to Sarajevo in 2006 looking for partners to help establish the theatre. Between then and July 2011, when the cinema opened, they held regular screenings in other theatres while searching for a place of their own. Employees say they have a strong connection to the group in Amsterdam \u2013 they are required to travel there regularly to meet with members of the foundation and for training. Noteworthy: Kriterion is open to individuals or organisations with innovative ideas who need the space to implement them. Next month, workshops on slam poetry, sign language and creative non-fiction writing will begin. Show business: Two screenings a day \u2013 at 18:00 and 20:20 \u2013 show a wide variety of local and international movies, often in connection with a themed programme. Parental guidance: Kriterion had a short-lived children&apos;s programme on Sunday afternoons \u2013 it should be revived soon. Senior service: Discounted tickets.  Tickets: Tickets for the 18:00 matinee are \u20ac2, or \u20ac1.50 for students and seniors. Tickets for the 20:20 show are \u20ac2.50, or \u20ac2 with the discount. It can&apos;t get much cheaper to see movies you can&apos;t see anywhere else in town. Medium popcorn and soft drink: In lieu of popcorn there is a selection of chips and nuts to be consumed with soft or alcoholic drinks. Camera fodder: Minimal snacks from \u20ac1-1.50, but many patrons eschew food for cigarettes. Alcohol: An assortment of local and regional beers in bottles and on tap for \u20ac1.50-\u20ac2.50, including Croatian Pan, Slovenian Tuborg, Serbian Lav and of course the eponymous Sarajevsko. There is also a good selection of wine and spirits. Auditorium: The single auditorium has enough cushy armchairs and loveseats to accommodate 75 people. Or you can watch the big screen from one of 11 beanbags, some of which are big enough for two. For overflow, chairs from the cafe can be brought in and viewers can even relax on the carpeted floor. Projection: The cinema shows movies on a standard projector. Currently the 35mm projector is broken but hopefully it will be repaired soon. Disabled access: All parts of the premises are wheelchair-accessible and there&apos;s a loo for people with disabilities.  Events: In the past six months, the cinema has hosted screenings, art exhibits and afterparties during the week-long Sarajevo Film festival. It also hosted screenings and roundtables as part of the Mess festival, an international festival of theatre.  The picture house has organised a number of themed screenings \u2013 last week was &quot;Sex, Pop and Politics&quot;, a collection of films shown in partnership with the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation and the Sarajevo Open Centre. The first week in November saw &quot;In the Spirit of Jazz&quot;, which combined movie selections with jazz dance and music workshops. As well as these, performances by local and regional musicians often draw a crowd. Every Wednesday is the low-key Jazz-Blues-Soul live music night, and at the weekends there is almost always a DJ. Toilets: As in their sister establishment, all employees help out with the cleaning. Even late into the evening during a packed concert the facilities are impeccable. Staff: Comprised almost entirely of students and recent alumni, the staff are not only multilingual and polite, they crack jokes as they serve up your drinks, making you feel instantly welcome. Pros: There&apos;s no other establishment in the city that lets you sink into a loveseat with your companion and watch an independent film. Cons: Sometimes films are shown only once, so if you can&apos;t make it to the showing, you&apos;re out of luck. Also, smoking is common everywhere in the city, and Kriterion is no exception.

Goddijn is something of an expert on survival. He had two failed attempts to launch a car navigation business before succeeding with TomTom, but since 2004 he has sold 60m satnavs \u2013 a technology which has spelled the end of in-car arguments about the passenger&apos;s ability to read a map. &quot;It was one of the fastest-adopted technologies in the history of mankind, faster than mobile phones or fax machines,&quot; he says. The success made paper billionaires of Goddijn and his French wife Corinne Goddijn-Vigreux, who started the company and still runs its consumer products division. But the market is now saturated: most people who want a satnav already own one and see little reason to upgrade \u2013 particularly when there are now cheaper and even free alternatives available on smartphones from the likes of Google and Nokia. TomTom&apos;s sales went into reverse in 2008. Takeovers resulted in a heavy debt burden during the credit crunch, and a loan renegotiation was followed by a rights issue. The problems are not yet over: there was a profit warning in June, and TomTom&apos;s shares have lost 67% of their value this year. Restless Well manicured and trim, Goddijn is a typically restless entrepreneur. Even in 2007, when TomTom was valued at \u00a35bn and he owned a quarter of the shares, he says there was no champagne moment. &quot;If you are the entrepreneur and owner and chief executive all at the same time, even when to the outside world it looks like a fantastic success, there is never time to celebrate anything, to sit back and be happy about yourself.&quot; Goddijn has no training in science or technology. He studied economics at Amsterdam University before going to work for a venture capital firm; through that came into contact with Britain&apos;s once mighty Psion Group, maker of pocket computers and originator of the Symbian operating system, which was the standard for mobile phones before Google&apos;s Android took\u00a0over. He founded Psion Netherlands as a joint venture in 1989, becoming one of its largest European distributors. In 1991 his wife left her job as Psion&apos;s sales director and helped to found Palmtop Software, to write applications for pocket computers. Her husband took a stake \u2013 and that is where they, and their co-founders Peter-Frans Pauwels and Pieter Geelen, still work today, 20 years and a significant rebranding later. They are a close-knit team, and Goddijn shows no impatience when I ask a question that must come up often. Don&apos;t he and Corinne see a bit too much of each other? &quot;There is a lot of trust and complicity. You can both enjoy the ups and downs, we didn&apos;t have to live it by ourselves.&quot; The couple often cycle to work together, but don&apos;t share an office and Corinne is not on the board. Their skills are, he argues, complementary. &quot;We are completely different characters. What she has is energy, drive in sales. She&apos;s a great motivator, good at building teams. I&apos;m a little more the strategic and on the product side.&quot; In 1998, Goddijn took a job in the UK, becoming managing director of Psion&apos;s computer group. But the company&apos;s glory days were over. He left a year later, soon followed by another frustrated employee, engineer David Tupman, who went on to head Apple&apos;s iPod division, having failed to get an MP3 player to market at Psion. Goddijn went full-time at his own company in 2001, in the role of chief executive. New brand The company launched a mobile phone mapping product in 1999, in a joint venture with Ericsson, which is when its unusual name was invented. Goddijn and his team had given themselves a 48-hour deadline to come up with a brand. &quot;We tried to create a character, a friend, a local that will help you find your way. We were in a cafe and at the end of two days we had nothing to show,&quot; he says, slamming the table for emphasis. There was a shortlist of 10 names. At the top of the list was Tom. It was unregisterable as a trademark, unfindable as an internet search term. Five minutes before leaving the cafe, someone suggested TomTom. Their contact at Ericsson, he recalls, went berserk: &quot;What do you think we&apos;re doing, selling teddy bears?&quot; But they spent hundreds of millions promoting the cuddly brand name \u2013 and it worked: &quot;A lot of our success is attributable to that name.&quot; Goddijn believes consumers prefer it to the &quot;geeky&quot; brands of rivals such as Navteq. With the end of the first dotcom boom the plug was pulled on their Ericsson venture in 2001. By then, Bill Clinton had freed the US military&apos;s Global Positioning System (GPS) for civilian use and TomTom hooked its boxes up to the inexpensive satellite technology. The first navigators appeared in 2002, but were a complicated mess of CD-Roms, wires and cradles and had to be hooked up to pocket computers. In 2004 he issued a new design brief for the units: &quot;Buy, take out of box, drive home.&quot; Along with rivals Garmin in Kansas and Magellan in California, TomTom has sold the majority of the world&apos;s satnavs, with a 45% share of sales in Europe and 21% in the US. Its revenues went from \u20ac39m in 2003 to \u20ac192m the following year. In 2010 it turned over \u20ac1.5bn. That cash cow is now in decline, and Goddijn is now betting the company on two complicated, ambitious new projects. The first is creating a massive global database of real-time traffic data. For those willing to buy a new box, pay \u00a347.50 a year and listen to the voice of Jeremy Clarkson (in the Top Gear themed model, that is) TomTom will guide them away from traffic jams. To predict what roads are likely to be congested at what times, the company collects traffic data from a multitude of sources \u2013 traffic reports, taxi and lorry companies, mobile phone networks that collate traffic data as phones move between masts, and, most importantly, its own customers. The latest satnavs use mobile phone networks to send and receive information. Those who opt in \u2013 and 80% do \u2013 allow TomTom to anonymously collect their travel data. &quot;We fuse that all together in a big database \u2013 don&apos;t ask me how it works,&quot; says Goddijn. &quot;The route calculation is then done, avoiding villages and schools as much as possible.&quot; There have been privacy concerns. Earlier this year, TomTom was forced to apologise to customers for selling their data, which had been used by the Dutch police to set speed traps. Some 1.3m of the new generation devices have been sold direct to consumers since 2007, but their widest adoption is likely to be through partnerships with carmakers. Renault, Toyota, Fiat and Mazda build them into cars, and every month 80,000 vehicles come to market with one on board. Half of the Renaults sold in the UK have them. Goddijn&apos;s second initiative relates to the fact that a number of motor groups are tendering with mobile networks to have Sim cards put in cars, which will transmit data back about faults and driving patterns. These Sims could be used in tandem with in-car computers for audio and video entertainment, usage-based insurance, even car-sharing clubs. &quot;What we want to do is enable the technology that will help that,&quot; says Goddijn. It will be a slow burn. Like his rather nervous investors, the chief executive is by no means certain he can strike gold twice. &quot;It doesn&apos;t happen very often that you find a technology that takes off as fast as [satnavs]. That is a low probability event and for it to happen twice is an even lower probability.&quot; But Goddijn has an interesting vision and a good brand. With luck, the tape cassette will disappear long before TomTom does.", "sentences": ["He studied economics at Amsterdam University before going to work for a venture capital firm; through that came into contact with Britain&apos;s once mighty Psion Group, maker of pocket computers and originator of the Symbian operating system, which was the standard for mobile phones before Google&apos;s Android took\u00a0over."], "title": "Harold Goddijn: TomTom's founder needs his business to turn the corner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/24/harold-goddijn-tomtom", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Technology", "Business", "Engineering", "Research and development", "GPS"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-25T23:02:45Z", "article": "Half an hour by train from Amsterdam is a vision of a new Britain. On polder land reclaimed from the Zuiderzee lies Europe&apos;s biggest experiment in affordable self-build homes. Enthusiasts call it a model of sustainable development, a Grand Designs for the average man. Critics call it an ersatz city, a soulless architectural Legoland. But this week housing minister Grant Shapps declared Almere a &quot;genuinely workable model&quot; as he made self-build a major plank in the government&apos;s strategy for solving Britain&apos;s housing crisis. Last year only one in 10 new homes in Britain was self-built. Plots are difficult to find, and finance and mortgage products restricted, while regulations and planning permissions are onerous. Faced with bureaucratic hurdles and frustrations, many potential self-builders abandon projects, sometimes after months of planning. But outside the UK, self-build is flourishing. In Belgium, which like the UK is densely populated and heavily urbanised, more than six in 10 homes are self-built. In the Netherlands the figure is three in 10. This week the government set out a vision in which an extra 100,000 self-build homes \u2013 it uses the phrase &quot;custom-build&quot; housing \u2013 will go up over the next decade in England alone. It wants to &quot;kickstart a revolution&quot; in which local authorities will for the first time be required to take self-build seriously, release publicly owned land to self-builders, and give government support to those taking the first step in building their own futures. For now, it is making \u00a330m available as short-term project finance, and in March next year will unveil a formal action plan to turn the vision into reality.     Almere    The Homeruskwartier district in Almere, a city with a population of 180,000, is the first self-build project attempted on a truly large scale. Since 2006, self-builders have erected 800 homes, and thousands more are on the way. The local authority draws up the street plan, then makes the plots available at standard commercial cost. Local people, freed from any further planning restrictions, can then design and build whatever takes their fancy. Jacqueline Tellinga, one of the driving forces behind the project, describes it as a return to the past. &quot;Take a look at the buildings along the canals of Amsterdam. They did the same as we are trying to do. The plots were parcelled out, the buyers were given a few guidelines over things such as height, but after that it was left to the individual.&quot;     Almere    Building costs in Almere vary depending on how much the buyers do themselves, but she says they average from \u20ac800 per sq m to \u20ac1,800. That&apos;s around \u00a372,000-\u00a3160,000 for someone wanting the same sort of floorspace as the typical British three-bed semi (around 105 sq m). Keeping homes affordable is key to the Homeruskwartier project, which means creating plots for self-build flats as well as houses. Tellinga cites one group of 25 individuals who built a block of flats. Including the plot and building, the cost of each flat was just \u00a369,000, without any subsidy. Cutting out the developer&apos;s profit \u2013 and those expensive marketing suites \u2013 saves a small fortune.     Almere Photograph: Martijn Steiner Lovisa    But self-build is not just about money. &quot;What I like most is the way people develop their curiosity and skills \u2013 they bring ideas and test construction techniques more than any developer would. We don&apos;t insist on sustainability requirements, but it&apos;s amazing how much people just do it themselves,&quot; says Tellinga. In Britain, the hurdles to a self-build revolution remain high. More than 80,000 people are registered on Buildstore&apos;s website looking for UK plots. There are virtually no ready-assembled sites such as Almere. Self-build lending is seen as more risky than conventional mortgages (several banks pulled out last year), and lending against larger community schemes is non-existent. Building standards and codes are complex and expensive. &quot;The number of planning conditions placed on domestic building work has grown inexorably over the years, and there is often very little difference between conditions placed on a single house and those placed on an estate of 100 homes,&quot; said a report from Nasba, the National Self Build Association, in July. Deon Lombard, an architect from Twickenham, is sceptical that the Dutch approach will work in Britain because of the &quot;stranglehold, inherent conservatism and lack of vision in the British planning system&quot;. His own repeated attempts at self-build have fallen foul of Richmond upon Thames planners and the Planning Inspectorate, leaving his plot of land, purchased in 2001 in the hope of building a family home, lying fallow. &quot;The planning system in Britain is reactionary, incredibly tortuous and open to a wide range of interpretation. My experience of submitting planning applications, both for myself and clients, is that it comes down to the subjective views and prejudices of individual planning officers and inspectors, who can turn down applications using vague criteria such as &apos;unneighbourly development&apos; or &apos;impact on amenity&apos;.&quot; Yet there are examples of successful self-build in Britain, even within large towns and cities. In Ashley Vale in Bristol, an action group succeeded against the odds (although this was in 2001) to self-build 26 detached and semi-detached homes, at a typical cost (including plot purchase) of \u00a3110,000. Six further flats were completed last year, which won a CABE Building for Life Award. Jackson Moulding, who helped set up Ashley Vale, is a passionate supporter of self-build, but acknowledges the challenges. &quot;The price of land has been bid up by developers who hold it in land banks. They are building for buy-to-let landlords who are charging tenants huge amounts. People are being left stuck with high rents and no control.&quot; Still, he is hopeful the new strategy will begin to unblock council attitudes, and encourages anyone interested in building their own home as part of a group or community to visit communitybuild.org.uk. But the major construction companies are less enthusiastic. A spokesman for the Home Builders Federation said &quot;everyone likes the idea of self-build&quot;, but it probably won&apos;t make a big contribution to supply in the next few years. Grand Designs, which regularly draws four million viewers, may be part of the problem. &quot;It can sometimes present a rather skewed impression of the industry,&quot; says Nasba. &quot;In reality, most self-build homes are very modest and look just like every other house.&quot; Above all, self-builders save money: the average self-build house in the UK costs only 59% of its final value, as self-builders cut out the developer&apos;s profit.", "sentences": ["Half an hour by train from Amsterdam is a vision of a new Britain.", "&quot;Take a look at the buildings along the canals of Amsterdam."], "title": "Self-build: it's time to go Dutch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/25/self-build-go-dutch", "tags": ["Property", "Saving money", "Mortgages", "House prices", "Money", "Architecture", "Art and design", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-28T14:28:01Z", "article": "Two giant pandas, the first to live in Britain for nearly 20 years, are expected to arrive in Edinburgh on Sunday after Chinese officials finally approved their new home at the city&apos;s zoo. The pair, Tian Tian and Yang Guang, are due to land at Edinburgh airport on Sunday afternoon on board a special FedEx flight from Sichuan province in China before being whisked to a redesigned enclosure in the zoo, complete with pool, cave and bulletproof glass. Tian Tian and Yang Guang \u2013 their names mean sweetie and sunshine \u2013 are a breeding pair and Chinese officials and the zoo hope they will defy the species&apos;s normal reluctance to mate by producing young, which would catapult the couple to worldwide celebrity. FedEx, equally alert to the marketing opportunities, will be flying them in on a specially equipped Boeing 777 with customised &quot;panda livery&quot;, branded the Panda Express. The pandas already have their own tartan, a largely black and white design with an &quot;overcheck&quot; of red and a streak of green \u2013 a product which is likely to play a major part in the zoo&apos;s marketing campaign. They also have a small supply of locally-grown bamboo, harvested from several sites dotted around the zoo, supplemented by regular air-freighted shipments of bamboo from a German firm which grows it outside Amsterdam. Inevitably, there will be &quot;panda cams&quot; with two discreetly positioned video cameras streaming live footage from inside their enclosure on the internet. However, it will be at least two weeks before Tian Tian and Yang Guang are unveiled properly to the public. Their keepers and vets, advised by Chinese experts, will allow them to acclimatise and settle in before opening their enclosure to viewing. To cope with the expected surge in public interest, the zoo will use a booking system to control the crowds, who will be guided through the &quot;panda experience&quot; in groups. Edinburgh will be the eighth zoo in the west to care for giant pandas, one of the world&apos;s rarest species. The pandas were due to arrive earlier this summer after five years of discreet diplomacy and courting of Chinese officials, and then intense preparations to convert an old gorilla enclosure into an appropriate home for the pair. The deal to lend them to the zoo for 10 years was confirmed in January when a Chinese government delegation arrived in the UK to seal \u00a32.6bn worth of trade and investment deals, including funding to secure the Grangemouth oil refinery near Edinburgh. Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, said next Sunday&apos;s delivery of the pandas &quot;represents the growing scientific ties between China and Britain&quot;. He said this went beyond conservation, and touched on science, culture and education. &quot;Knowing pandas also means understanding more about their home country of China. This opens the way for people across Britain to explore the Chinese traditions, people, its society and economy,&quot; he said. &quot;More importantly, this is an excellent window into grasping China&apos;s commitment to peaceful development, desire for co-operation and quest for harmony with the world.&quot; Alison MacLean, the zoo&apos;s team leader for the pandas, spent three weeks with Tian Tian and Yang Guang recently getting to know the animals. She said the pandas would live separately in different parts of the enclosure until the female, Tian Tian, was ready to mate. But panda mating is a tricky business: the females are generally only fertile for four days a year, and then only ready to mate for 24 to 48 hours. &quot;They will be kept separate and will only be brought together when the female is in season: that&apos;s a very short window of opportunity,&quot; MacLean said. She added that both animals were &quot;enchanting&quot;. She has 25 years of experience, and now specialises in large carnivores and bears, but said the pandas were very unusual. &quot;They&apos;re quite incredible and unlike anything I have worked with before,&quot; she said. They use part of their wrist joint like a thumb, so can grasp things with their paws as if they had hands like primates. &quot;They&apos;re just so different, the way they move about, the way they sit down and the way they grasp things,&quot; MacLean said. The panda project will be an immense relief to the zoo and its owners. It has had a series of problems with finances and poor visitor numbers recently, and an embarrassing controversy over allegations of misconduct by senior staff linked to another high-profile project with its new primates centre. Hugh Roberts, the zoo&apos;s chief executive, said the pandas would bring &quot;massive benefits&quot; to the zoo and the UK by supporting panda conservation and its science and education programmes. &quot;We have been looking forward to this moment for five years now, since we first embarked on this epic journey to bring the giant pandas to Scotland,&quot; he said. &quot;The arrival of Tian Tian and Yang Guang is an historic occasion for the zoo, for Scotland, and for the UK as a whole.&quot;", "sentences": ["They also have a small supply of locally-grown bamboo, harvested from several sites dotted around the zoo, supplemented by regular air-freighted shipments of bamboo from a German firm which grows it outside Amsterdam."], "title": "Giant pandas due to arrive at Edinburgh zoo on Sunday", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/28/giant-pandas-arrive-edinburgh-zoo", "tags": ["Edinburgh", "Animals", "China", "Scotland", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Giant pandas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-11-30T11:23:22Z", "article": "Market watchers are accustomed to eye-watering sums for directors at Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Cillit Bang and other cleaning products.

A researcher from Liverpool tells how he learned about the effects on his body of calorie-laden sandwiches, drinking sessions and Christmas feasting by monitoring his heart rate non-stop for a year. Elsewhere speakers with Parkinson&apos;s disease, chronic social anxiety and back problems explain how tracking their personal data helped ease their symptoms. Welcome to the sometimes wacky and often intriguing world of the Quantified Self, an eclectic band of hackers, geeks, fitness freaks, patients and early adopters that, from its birth in California in 2008, has grown into a global movement of more than 5,000 members in 11 countries. Last weekend 260 delegates gathered in Amsterdam to share their experiences at the first Quantified Self Europe conference. In science, politics, medicine and many other spheres, data is routinely collected to fine-tune performance. The realm that has so far evaded the cult of numbers is our personal lives. The idea of someone keeping spreadsheets of data on their mood, health, diet, physical location, personal productivity and sleep patterns might in the past have attracted a certain amount of scorn. That is changing and fast, if the self-quantifying vanguard is to be believed. Smartphones are already packed with sensors, from cameras and GPS to accelerometers and gyroscopes. A growing range of cheap consumer gadgets aimed specifically at self-trackers is being launched, such as the Zeo, which monitors sleep cycles, and the fitbit, which measures physical activity and estimates calorie burn. At the Amsterdam gathering, Robin Barooah, 39, an English software and product designer who lives in Oakland, California, spoke about his experiment in which he claims to have lost 20kg of his original 100kg weight by writing either the word &quot;lethargic&quot; or &quot;energised&quot; on a flash card at 3pm every day for 18 months, depending on how he felt. He puts it down to improved self-awareness.  &quot;I gradually noticed that my perception of some foods shifted from thinking they were delicious to starting to feel their heaviness and the effects they were going to have on me. The act of paying greater attention has an effect on your behaviour.&quot; Christian Kleineidam from Berlin was left with reduced lung function following treatment for a serious spinal condition in 2002. Traditional treatments such as physiotherapy and an inhaler didn&apos;t help, so he began taking measurements with a device called a peak flow and forced expiratory volume monitor. This revealed that his lung function improved when he performed certain relaxation exercises. By focusing on these he says he improved his lung function by around 30%. Dozens of personal experiments such as these were reported and discussed in Amsterdam. Their flaws, such as the likelihood of other, confounding factors being involved, are obvious. But proponents of a more individualised approach to health argue that traditional clinical trials also have flaws, such as producing results that are averaged over groups that may not apply to individuals with particular genetic make-ups or other variations. Some even talk of &quot;hacking&quot; their own bodies \u2013 using the more detailed information to change things for the better. &quot;We all look for information about how to improve things for ourselves,&quot; says Barooah. &quot;You can look to other people to provide advice, by going to the doctor or reading a book. However, by definition conventional, mass-produced knowledge is broad and non-specific. By collecting your own personal information you know it is appropriate to you as an individual.&quot;            Steve Dean of product innovation studio Prehype and organiser of the New York Quantified Self group, told conference participants about Asthmapolis, a system on which he worked as a designer. Asthmapolis links sensors attached to the inhalers used by asthma patients when they have attacks to smartphones, which gather data on where and when they are used. Tracking this information over time helps patients identify the triggers that make their conditions worse. Patient tests are due to start next year. But it is the combination of data from large numbers of individuals that may be most likely to lead to new insights. Thousands of patients are carrying out their own crowdsourced comparisons of symptoms and treatments for more than 500 illnesses on the social networking health website CureTogether. For example, one of hundreds of data aggregations revealed that people who experienced vertigo in conjunction with migraines were four times as likely to have painful negative reactions when using the migraine drug Imitrex as those who did not have vertigo. Sponsors of the conference included big names such as Philips, Vodaphone and Intel. Their funding provided for unusual refreshments including &quot;weed grass&quot; cocktails, which may or may not have been wheatgrass, and a table of fruit including exotic star and dragon fruit, and rambutan. The organisation and language was very Californian, with frequent breaks to facilitate &quot;spaces for conversations&quot; about our &quot;journeys&quot; as well as numerous spontaneous agenda changes. Gary Wolf, a journalist and co-founder of the Quantified Self movement, argues that the combination of the proliferation of small, cheap sensors, portable computing and the emergence of social media is bringing about profound shifts that are laying the groundwork for self-quantification to enter the mainstream. He says the same early adopters who turned computers from scientific data-gathering machines into the core tools of our personal lives are the same species as the self-quantifying pioneers who are pushing personal data tracking as a logical and inevitable next step in human development. &quot;Some decades ago computing was for doing calculations so that managers and scientists could better understand and run the world, but then it began to mean communication, self-expression, education, the development of personal knowledge,&quot; he says. &quot;We advanced users are not like other people. We are strange. Look at all the weird stuff we&apos;re willing to do. But advanced users teach new technologies to do new things. They are willing to use tools that are harder, but they use them for many of the same human purposes that everyone wants to use them for. We use them to sleep better, understand things about diet, our work and productivity, our learning, our moods. &quot;If we use our imaginations we can easily see how the homemade or complicated tools we use for self-tracking might have popular incarnations very soon.&quot;", "sentences": ["Last weekend 260 delegates gathered in Amsterdam to share their experiences at the first Quantified Self Europe conference.", "At the Amsterdam gathering, Robin Barooah, 39, an English software and product designer who lives in Oakland, California, spoke about his experiment in which he claims to have lost 20kg of his original 100kg weight by writing either the word &quot;lethargic&quot; or &quot;energised&quot; on a flash card at 3pm every day for 18 months, depending on how he felt.", "Dozens of personal experiments such as these were reported and discussed in Amsterdam."], "title": "Know thyself: the Quantified Self devotees who live by numbers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/dec/02/psychology-human-biology", "tags": ["Human biology", "Crowdsourcing", "Psychology", "Gadgets", "Technology", "Science", "Life and style", "Nutrition"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-02T11:00:00Z", "article": "&quot;The pandas are coming!&quot; announced Edinburgh zoo&apos;s press office. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) finally has a date set for the long-awaited arrival of a pair of giant pandas. When the FedEx Panda Express touches down in Edinburgh on Sunday, Tian Tian and Yang Guang will be the first giant pandas to set foot in Britain for 17 years. I&apos;ve thought a lot \u2013 probably too much \u2013 about giant pandas. In 2010, I published The Way of the Panda, a science-cum-history book that lays out the intertwined fortunes of giant pandas and modern China as they made their respective ways towards zoological and economic world domination. In it, I reached the conclusion that captive pandas are deceptive beasts, having more in common with the cuddly toys, the abstracted WWF logo or dressed-up darlings of many-a-successful advertising campaign than with the real, wild pandas that eke out a living in the dwindling bamboo forests of China. Sure, captive pandas have obvious commercial promise. There is, for instance, an established graph with visitor numbers on the y-axis and time since arrival of pandas on the x-axis. There is also a version of this that shows what happens to gate receipts if the pandas manage to procreate. The zoo shop can do a nice line in panda-related merchandise. There is always the hope of landing a private sponsor, though in the current climate this could be tricky. But the income that captive pandas can generate for a zoo is unlikely to match the expense. It cost Edinburgh Zoo \u00a3250,000 to construct a state-of-the-art panda enclosure on the site of the former gorilla exhibit. The RZSS will be paying China around \u00a3640,000 every year for 10 years for the privilege of having pandas. It will have to fork out a further \u00a370,000 each year for food, importing most of the required bamboo from a plantation on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Then there are the salaries of keepers that will dedicate their working lives to the pandas. If captive pandas are so costly, why does Edinburgh want them? There are many reasons I think, but few of them have very much to do with wild pandas. The more time that passes since writing my book, the more convinced I am that there is little, if any, overlap between the lives of captive and wild pandas. In theory, the annual fee that Edinburgh will pay to China must be used to support those animals in the wild. In practice, it is spent on strengthening captive institutions in China. Should Tian Tian and Yang Guang procreate, there will be lots of excitement, but without a means of reintroducing captive pandas into the wild \u2013 a feat that has yet to be achieved \u2013 any offspring will be destined to live as a captive with only superficial resemblance to their real, wild counterparts. No, the real value of captive pandas lies not in their identity as pandas but in the colossal symbolic importance we humans have invested in this remarkable species. Any zoo that can boast the face of global conservation among its inmates will only enhance its standing as a serious conservation concern. A pair of pandas acts like an incredibly efficient, self-sustaining PR engine, generating the kind of press coverage \u2013 most of it generous \u2013 that most press officers can only dream of. These animals open up wide and fertile new vistas for educating the public, not just about conservation of pandas, not just about conservation in China but about global conservation, full stop. In spite of these benefits though, I feel duty bound to point out that captive pandas can be profoundly unpredictable too. Take the case of Wang Wang and Funi, a pair of bears that have been on loan to Adelaide Zoo since 2009. It&apos;s been estimated that during their first year in residence, they injected $57m into the South Australian economy. The pandas have not had the same effect on the zoo, however, and the government of South Australia and Westpac bank have had to step in to save it from financial ruin. Tian Tian translates as &quot;sweetie&quot; and Yang Guang as &quot;sunshine&quot;. Only time will tell whether the Edinburgh pandas live up to their names and bring sweetness and light to the fortunes of Edinburgh zoo and the rest of the city, or whether the undoubtedly risky panda adventure will have a dark and bitter ending. \u2022 If there&apos;s a subject you&apos;d like to see covered on Comment is free, please visit our You tell us page.", "sentences": ["It will have to fork out a further \u00a370,000 each year for food, importing most of the required bamboo from a plantation on the outskirts of Amsterdam."], "title": "What price captive pandas? | Henry Nicholls", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/02/pandas-edinburgh-zoo", "tags": ["Conservation", "Edinburgh", "China", "World news", "UK news", "Scotland", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Environment", "Giant pandas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-02T11:21:02Z", "article": "After the disappointment of a fifth place finish in 2008, Britain&apos;s Lightweight Fours are looking for a first ever Olympic medal in 2012 &quot;Progress towards 2012 is going well. Obviously this year we didn&apos;t achieve what we set out to achieve, to continue as world champions, but I think actually, you could see at the start of the season that as a four we have a lot more fight. We&apos;ve come into training full steam and we are working hard. On an individual level I feel fit and strong, stronger than I ever have done at this time of the year. I&apos;m enjoying it at the minute, enjoying getting stronger and fitter and I am seeing the results on the water. Despite its disappointments, 2011 was a great year. At the beginning we set out to improve individually. As an athlete, I have improved physically really well and feel that mentally I am in a stronger place. I am looking forward to the end of 2011 and starting 2012. I think that is when it will hit home for me that this is it, only six months left before the finish line \u2013 or the start line! Being our home Olympic Games does make it that little bit more special and to win as the host nation would just be incredible. But, at the end of the day, we are approaching it as a 2k stretch of water, just like any other 2k stretch of water. We&apos;ve got to go from A to B as quick as we can and, most importantly, quicker than anyone else. We have got to make sure that we don&apos;t let the hype build up too much and that we keep focussed on what we are trying to achieve. We&apos;ve been world champions and we&apos;ve been to an Olympic games before, so in 2012 I am not interested in silver or bronze \u2013 gold is the minimum that we are in for. It was an amazing experience to go to an Olympic Games in 2008, but as an athlete I don&apos;t train for anything but first place.&quot; Biography Born 10 June 1985 Educated Coleraine Academical Institution, Northern Ireland, then read Construction Management at Oxford Brookes University. Hobbies I love to sleep and to be honest I could quite easily go to sleep anywhere. It&apos;s a good gift. I also love to cook and in fact will try my hand at just about anything - I have recently been doing some DIY around the house, with varying levels of success. Inspiration Definitely my coach, Bobby Platt MBE. The man is a legend. He was the first guy to get me into a boat and he got me started. That is where my roots are, it&apos;s where I came from. He is 93 now and an inspiration to me. Favourite Film  I couldn&apos;t put my finger on anything in particular, but I love war movies, anything with a bit of action or violence. Favourite Book I prefer to spend my time sleeping! I do read a lot of Chris Ryan, and I enjoy reading autobiographies. I like sporting autobiographies, Martin Johnson&apos;s and Jason Robinson&apos;s, anybody&apos;s really. I have read a couple of war biographies as well. Favourite Music On my iPod there is everything from classical to R&apos;n&apos;B and heavy metal. Other Sports I follow rugby and I&apos;m not an England fan. At the Rugby World Cup I was supporting Ireland, but unfortunately they went out. Whenever I go back home, I love to go and watch Ulster. Key statistics 2005 Took silver in the Lightweight Men&apos;s Quadruple Scull at the World Under-23 Rowing Championships in Amsterdam 2006 Set a world best time for the under-23 Lightweight Men&apos;s Pair event in Belgium 2007 Won both the Rowing World Cup Series and the World Rowing Championships rowing for Great Britain in the Lightweight Men&apos;s Four 2010 Won gold in the Lightweight Men&apos;s Fours at the World Rowing Championships in New Zealand Training A good amount of training for us would be first breakfast, the we go out on the water for a 100 minute paddle. After that, we come back in for second breakfast then hit the weights. A sandwich for lunch, then we do rowing machines in the afternoon, probably 70 minutes continuous paddling. I&apos;ll be back home by four or half four, and then at the moment I am in bed by about 9pm. Before competitions, when training steps up I really enjoy the challenge. You finish totally knackered, but fitter as a result and I am quite sadistic like that. I have just become a dad. My son, Joshua Scott, was born on 18 October and it&apos;s been an amazing few weeks with him. However, I&apos;ve now got to leave him for two weeks and go off on a training camp, which shows the sacrifices that we have to make. Fortunately I&apos;ve got a great wife, Abby, she&apos;s a full-time mum now. Her being as good as she is allows me to continue training full-time.

Although faint and unfinished, it effectively dispels doubts about the surface picture&apos;s attribution to the 17th-century Dutch master, to the excitement of art historians. The portrait, a monochrome sketch, had been hidden until now by the painting Old Man with Beard, which since the 1960s had been dismissed as a copy by some art specialists, so the discovery is particularly significant. The revelation was announced by an international consortium of scientists and art historians who descended on the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam, where the picture is on loan from a private collection. Doubters of its attribution had included leading specialists at the Rembrandt Research Project in Amsterdam. But the discovery now offers irrefutable evidence, according to Ernst van de Wetering, head of the project and emeritus professor of art history at the University of Amsterdam. He spoke of the stylistic and feature similarities of the self-portrait to the Old Man and to two significant self-portraits of the 1630s, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York and the National Museum, Stockholm. It was in the contours of this unfinished figure that van de Wetering recognised the typical posture, hairstyle, white collar and black beret that characterise many early self-portraits of Rembrandt. The self-portrait&apos;s style confirms that the Old Man, an oil on panel, was painted by Rembrandt around 1630, shortly before his move to Amsterdam, where he made his name as painter of portraits with uncompromising realism. To some extent, the two images follow the same dimensions and there is considerable overlap. The attribution is supported by other evidence, including a 1633 print of the composition, with an inscription stating Rembrandt&apos;s name. Rembrandt&apos;s self-portraits are among his greatest achievements. He depicted himself in more than 80 paintings, etchings and drawings. A few were commissioned, but they were generally created for himself as powerful studies of different moods. Why Rembrandt abandoned this one remains unknown. In the past, x-ray and infrared studies had shown alterations to the composition of the surface painting, but it was unclear whether it had been reworked or whether there was anything beneath it. The self-portrait was revealed through high-intensity x-rays developed by Joris Dik of Delft University and Koen Janssens of Antwerp University. Tests were conducted at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York. The technology detects pigments in hidden layers of paint, allowing paintings beneath paintings to be seen for the first time in unprecedented detail. Discoveries include previously unknown portraits by Francisco Goya and Vincent van Gogh. The huge potential for further finds is exciting because artists repeatedly reused canvases, to save money or to conceal a work with which they were dissatisfied. Commenting on the Rembrandt, Dik told the Guardian: &quot;It&apos;s so exciting.&quot; In spring, the Rembrandt House Museum \u2013 which is housed in the building that was the artist&apos;s home from 1639 to 1658, when it had to be sold to pay his creditors \u2013 is staging a special exhibition of research into paintings by Rembrandt and his contemporaries using the technology.", "sentences": ["The revelation was announced by an international consortium of scientists and art historians who descended on the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam, where the picture is on loan from a private collection.", "Doubters of its attribution had included leading specialists at the Rembrandt Research Project in Amsterdam.", "But the discovery now offers irrefutable evidence, according to Ernst van de Wetering, head of the project and emeritus professor of art history at the University of Amsterdam.", "The self-portrait&apos;s style confirms that the Old Man, an oil on panel, was painted by Rembrandt around 1630, shortly before his move to Amsterdam, where he made his name as painter of portraits with uncompromising realism."], "title": "Rembrandt self-portrait discovered with latest x-ray technology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/dec/02/rembrandt-self-portrait-discovered-technology", "tags": ["Rembrandt", "Art and design", "Technology", "Painting", "Museums", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-04T00:04:27Z", "article": "Gdynia, near Gdansk, does not compare to San Francisco or Shanghai as one of the great urban centres of ideas and invention. But last month it was giving both cities a good run for their money when it came to buzz and intellectual energy. This former fishing village in Poland, now a city of 250,000 people, was chosen to host the first international winter school in social innovation, which attracted 70 experts from all corners of the globe, including Korea, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Australia and the UK. All were seeking new, creative solutions to the increasingly serious social challenges of our times. Some were looking to solve problems relating to health; others were exercised by the problem of wealth (or rather the lack of it). Youth joblessness was a theme, as was ageing. No profit motive was attached or product pitch involved. This was just people offering ingenuity and services. The passion for social innovation is not new. But, as the success of the event in Gdynia demonstrated, an exponential rise in interest seems to be taking place, partly because of the impact of the internet and partly because government coffers are running empty and some of the bigger challenges appear intractable. Often, successful innovation means the addition of a new ingredient to what is already familiar. The arrival of television, for example, plus long-distance learning, created the Open University. Add cars to older people in need of a regular lunch, and meals on wheels is born. Hospices, charity shops, the Samaritans, the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides are all examples of social innovation that eventually became part of the nation&apos;s furniture. The first three-day summer international school for social innovation was held in 2008 in San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Basque country. It was organised, among others, by the Young Foundation, Cisco and the Social Innovation Exchange, which allows social innovators around the world to exchange ideas. But Gdynia represented the movement&apos;s first foray into the winter months. In a former wartime Messerschmitt factory, now converted into an innovation centre, the group of 70 came together to assess what&apos;s coming round the corner in 2015 and how best we can all cope. The immediate impression was that coping would involve the use of a lot of Post-it notes. Jim Dator, an expert in futurology (who also acknowledges that almost everything foretold is bound to be wrong \u2013 rights for robots and paperless offices instantly come to mind) is fond of saying that, for any prediction to come true, it must first sound ridiculous. Hence, several years ago, when Gorka Espiau, one of the those in Gdynia, and his colleagues at DenokInn, the Basque Social Centre for Innovation in Bilbao, first began to collaborate with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a group of videogame designers on a low-cost folding electric car that opens from the front (so a wheelchair-user can roll in), is &quot;driven&quot; via a laptop by a motorist of any age and ability, and can store secrets about the way we behave (for instance, the vehicle can be programmed not to exceed 50mph), the plan probably sounded too daft for words. Several million euros later, Hiriko, meaning &quot;from the city&quot; in Basque, launches next month, in Berlin, Malm\u00f6, Barcelona, San Francisco and Quito in Ecuador (London missed out). Espiau says that the car is low-cost, around \u20ac12,000 and it will be rented out by the hour at a low rate, but whoever wants you parked in their forecourt \u2013 supermarket, cinema or optician \u2013 also foots the leasing charge. It will be small-scale in production, with factories sited in areas of high unemployment. So in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, according to Espiau, there is 90% unemployment among the largest population of Iraqis living outside their home country. Now a number of them will work on Hiriko. &quot;This isn&apos;t just about a car,&quot; says Espiau. &quot;This is about bringing together people from very different professions, architecture, videogames, the web, who are driven by the belief that the poorest can be mobile; even the long-term out-of-work can have jobs. Social innovation sometimes means nice people losing money. Hiriko will show we can make social change.&quot; Some of the original attendees of San Sebasti\u00e1n in 2008 were also at this first winter school. They were told by Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of Nesta, the organisation that promotes social innovation in the UK, that the challenges have not changed in the last four years, only their scale. In many parts of the world, people are living longer, but spending more of their final years in poorer health. Health and social care is eating into national budgets. So how, for instance, will new social media and different services and organisations help to ride to the rescue on a range of issues such as education? Femi Longe, based in Nigeria, tells us that 10 years ago the country had only 866,000 telephone lines. Now, in a population of 116 million, there are 88 million mobile subscribers \u2013 mostly young people. His newly established Co-Creation Hub, independent from government, is working on 16 different ventures. They include apps that will tell citizens about their constitutional rights (Your Rights in Your Pocket), apps to help students with study, and apps to encourage greater transparency and less corruption in the government&apos;s budget (BudgeIT). In Gdynia, we heard how a partnership between food companies Danone and Lubella, supermarket chain Biedrinka, and the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw had produced a breakfast porridge offering 25% of a child&apos;s daily vitamins and minerals, costing a few pence and cleverly marketed for &quot;supermums of all income groups&quot;. Since its launch in 2006, 50 million portions of Mleczny Start (Milky Start) have been sold, 27% to Poland&apos;s poorest families. Profit goes back into promotion. &quot;One bright idea doesn&apos;t solve the causes of infant malnutrition,&quot; said one of the team, &quot;but at least it gives a child a better start.&quot; Simon Tucker, chief executive of the Young Foundation, said: &quot;Social innovation is the only way to build a future we might actually want to live in. Even after the current financial crisis, challenges such as ageing populations and climate change mean we just cannot continue as we are with minor improvements. Social innovation is a more constructive response than protest, more active than trusting in technocrats \u2013 we are together taking responsibility for shaping our future and our children&apos;s future.&quot; Yvonne Roberts is a fellow of the Young Foundation Social innovation around the world Check You Out! UsCreates, a design company headed by Zoe Stanton and Mary Rose Cook, worked with the Prince&apos;s Trust, Empire Cinemas, Birmingham East and North primary care trust and 60 young people, including 30 selected as &quot;youth ambassadors&quot;, in Birmingham to devise a campaign to improve testing for chlamydia. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection in young people, affecting one in 12, and has no symptoms. At Gdynia, Mary Rose explained how the young people tackled the lack of knowledge and stigma. They came up with the slogan Check You Out!, used themselves as the &quot;face&quot; of the campaign; designed orange wrist bands, offered a free cinema screening with a health trainer in the lavatories who rewarded young people who took the urine test with free popcorn and a soft drink, which achieved a 100% testing rate. The young people also set up a Facebook page \u2013 Check You Out! It now has more than 5,000 followers; they entered a film-making competition and designed billboards and postcards using the ambassadors to push home the message that screening matters. The 12-month strategy has won several awards, including the Best of Health Awards 2010. Hello Sunday Morning In 2008, Craig Raine, aged 24, who lives in Brisbane, decided to say goodbye to his habitual Sunday morning hangover and try sobriety for a year. &quot;I wanted to know why I drank and what my motivation was to do it and what it would take to influence the way other people looked at [drinking]. Nobody thought I&apos;d last the 12 months,&quot; he said. Hello Sunday Morning was born. It consists of a website, to which people sign up and pledge not to drink for three months. They blog their progress. Research into behaviour change tells us a public pledge reinforces resolve. Raine resumed drinking after 12 months. &quot;It&apos;s part of life,&quot; he says, &quot;but Hello Sunday Morning is about when it becomes a problem, when you depend upon it psychologically to have certain experiences or fun.&quot; In 2010, the Australian Centre for Social Innovation, established the year before, selected Hello Sunday Morning as one of eight projects and schemes chosen from 258 ideas contributed from all over Australia, to fund and support. Hello Sunday Morning has been hugely popular, especially among younger people. The target this year is for it to reach 10,000 supporters and then become a worldwide movement towards a better drinking culture. &quot;I signed up to HSM,&quot; says Brenton Caffin, head of Centre for Social Innovation. &quot;I didn&apos;t have a problem with alcohol but I wanted to see if I could do it. It worked for me.&quot; The Kafka Brigade Originally established in the Netherlands in the 1990s, the Kafka Brigade now has a UK counterpart in Wales. Its aim is to reduce red tape and regulations and bureaucratic dysfunction. Frontline workers, the public, managers and policymakers are all required to take part, to analyse what&apos;s wrong and to come up with a solution. Some solutions are simple. For instance, in 2007 in Amsterdam, 37,000 people were leaving prison only to reoffend and be involved in petty crime, because of homelessness, delays in receiving benefits and unemployment. The Kafka project meant that prisoners begin applying for benefits before their release; are better supported to find jobs; and homeless ex-offenders are a target cohort for special housing support. The Kafka Brigade UK has also helped to reduce the numbers of young people not in employment education or training (Neets)in Cardiff and Swansea. In 2010, Swansea was recognised as showing one of the two most improved performances in Wales for supporting Neets. A review published this year described the Kafka Brigade contribution as &quot;a valuable process that helped clarify performance indicators, rationalised the action plan and led to individuals and organisations taking more responsibility for reducing the proportion of young people not in employment education or training&quot;. The Kafka Brigade is a partner with the thinktank Kennisland (Knowledgeland), headed by Chris Sigaloff. The Water Hackathon The Water Hackathon took place over two days in October simultaneously in Bangalore, Cairo, Kampala, Lima, London, Nairobi, Tel Aviv and Washington DC. Lack of adequate safe water and sanitation is the world&apos;s single largest cause of illness, responsible for more than two million deaths a year. As the global population grows, and demands on natural resources increase, the sustainable management of water is ever more urgent. Technologists, engineers, programmers, designers, water experts and people with ideas worked together over one weekend to come up with solutions. At the Co-creation Hub in Lagos, represented at the winter school in Gdynia by Femi Longe, a co-founder, 32 people worked together, as part of Random Hacks of Kindness. The group came up with a number of ideas, including mobile phone games to educate Nigerians on the use of water; a mobile system to name and shame companies whose packaging clogs the drainage system the most and a mobile tool to crowdsource (encourage the public to become citizen watchdogs) and track burst pipes and leakages across the system and get them fixed quickly . The challenge is turning ideas into concrete projects and scaling them up, but companies such as Microsoft and organisations like the World Bank are investing: they see new markets in the global population explosion.", "sentences": ["For instance, in 2007 in Amsterdam, 37,000 people were leaving prison only to reoffend and be involved in petty crime, because of homelessness, delays in receiving benefits and unemployment."], "title": "The fresh ideas that can help save our world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/dec/04/health-unemployment", "tags": ["Society", "Technology", "Health policy", "Unemployment", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-04T00:05:17Z", "article": "The strange thing about photography is that although it&apos;s been revolutionised by digital technology, at heart it&apos;s the same medium that entranced Louis Daguerre, Eug\u00e8ne Atget and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, to name just three of its early masters. And although it&apos;s become much easier to take photographs that are technically flawless (in terms of exposure and focus), it&apos;s just as difficult to capture aesthetically satisfying images as it was in the age of film and chemicals. It turns out that technology is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for creating art. Still, the technology is pretty impressive. Almost every digital camera on the consumer market today is a marvel of automation, with auto-focus that generally works, metering systems that accurately assess light (at least on evenly illuminated scenes) and do a passable job of reducing the red-eye effect produced by direct flash. The newer consumer cameras go much further than this, offering face detection (so that you don&apos;t wind up taking photographs of people&apos;s shoes) and now even (so help me God) smile detection. So while it is still possible to take terrible pictures with these devices, you have to work pretty hard to achieve a convincing display of incompetence. The result is a world where an unimaginable number of photographs are taken every day. Photo-hosting services such as Picasa and Flickr, and social networking sites such as Facebook, now host upwards of 100 billion images between them. The scale of this abundance is really hard to grasp, but recently an Amsterdam gallery had a shot at it, by printing off a copy of every photograph uploaded to Flickr in a 24-hour period and then shovelling the resulting avalanche into a succession of rooms, all of which were waist-high in photographs. And Flickr is small beer compared with Facebook. The pace of change in technology has also been dramatic and not just in terms of the &quot;megapixel wars&quot; over the number of pixels that could be fitted on to a sensor. As sensors improved, the industry spotted a demand for more sophisticated cameras and so the digital single lens reflex (DSLR) was born, complete with prismatic viewfinder, a mirror that flipped up when you pressed the shutter, interchangeable lenses and all the other paraphernalia of &quot;serious&quot; photography. This worked for a while, until people discovered that packing a DSLR and a couple of lenses meant that you could only bring a toothbrush before you&apos;d exceeded Ryanair&apos;s cabin baggage allowance. So the quest was on for something that functioned like a DSLR but didn&apos;t have all that clunky mirror stuff. The result was a new line of cameras with the catchy (not to say incomprehensible) tag of &quot;micro four thirds&quot; such as the Olympus PEN series (see below). These will probably be the must-have devices this Christmas. In recent years, the whole concept of what constitutes a camera has been up for grabs. As an inveterate photographer, I used to carry a Canon IXUS with me everywhere, sitting snugly in a leather case on my belt. But then I bought an iPhone4, the first mobile phone I&apos;d owned that had a decent camera. You can guess the rest of the story: more often than not, the IXUS now sits at home on a shelf. The reason is obvious. It&apos;s the old photographer&apos;s adage that the best camera is always the one you happen to have with you. Since most of us carry mobile phones, it was inevitable that once their onboard cameras became powerful enough to produce reasonable pictures then they would become the default photographic device. That&apos;s one reason why the iPhone is now the most popular camera among Flickr users. The other reason for the popularity of cameraphones is that smartphones are actually quite powerful computers, which means they can run software that does quite sophisticated image-processing, something beyond the capacity of the feeble processors that power conventional digital cameras. So the market for photo apps that can do stuff such as high dynamic range (HDR) photography, or produce all kinds of weird retro effects, has exploded (see panel below). This, in turn, is a harbinger of the next big thing, what geeks call computational photography \u2013 that is to say image-making that owes as much to computing as it does to optics. The best-known example is light field photography, a technology that captures all the light in a particular subject and produces not a flat, two-dimensional image but a virtual cube out of which 2D images can be sliced by taking cross-sections through it. Once upon a time, this required a roomful of computers, but the room has now been shrunk to the size of a handheld consumer device. The Lytro light field camera hits the streets early in 2012. It&apos;s a long way from the Kodak Box Brownie that made photography a consumer pastime, but, hey! that&apos;s progress for you.", "sentences": ["The scale of this abundance is really hard to grasp, but recently an Amsterdam gallery had a shot at it, by printing off a copy of every photograph uploaded to Flickr in a 24-hour period and then shovelling the resulting avalanche into a succession of rooms, all of which were waist-high in photographs."], "title": "Digital photography's bright new world | feature", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/04/digital-photography-latest-camera-technology", "tags": ["Photography", "Photography", "Software", "Art and design", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-06T10:34:07Z", "article": "Because Booker prize deliberations go on behind closed doors, we&apos;ll never really know what led the judging panel to Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam. Naturally, that makes it all the more tempting and intriguing to speculate. What discussions were there? What compromises were made? Who stuck the knife into poor old Beryl Bainbridge? Were there displays of taste and erudition from Douglas Hurd and Nigella Lawson? How was the case made for Amsterdam? Were there compromises, or just a fuzzy consensus? Did anyone dissent? Did anyone actually try to suggest that this isn&apos;t a very good book? On the latter question, we must assume that the answer was &quot;no&quot; \u2013 or that the person making the case against the book was roundly ignored. As I shall now attempt to show, a point-by-point debunk of the novel can be carried out in around five minutes \u2013 even less time than it takes to read the thing. 1) It&apos;s preposterous.  If you&apos;re squeamish about spoilers, look away now, because the simplest way of demonstrating Amsterdam&apos;s deficiencies is to lay out its story and denouement. Things are set in motion when Vernon and Clive, two old friends, agree that, should one of them enter into the kind of mental decline they have just witnessed in their former lover, Molly, the other will assist in his euthanasia. The plot thickens when the two friends argue over two questions of morality. The first question concerns newspaper editor Vernon&apos;s decision to publish a series of pictures the now-dead Molly took of the current foreign secretary in drag. The second, Vernon&apos;s failure to tell the police about the fact he witnessed an attempted rape while he was walking in the Lake District, because he was too engrossed in writing a symphony for the new millennium. The plot then curdles when Clive discovers he is about to lose his faculties and the two agree to meet in Amsterdam, but hate each other so much they murder each other with champagne laced with the poison they have procured from a euthanasia program. I&apos;m guessing that I don&apos;t have to say much more than that. 2) It farts and belches. While the broad outline above speaks for itself, it&apos;s worth also noting that there are many other, smaller, instances of absurdity in the novel \u2013 upon which the plot is completely reliant. For instance, Vernon comes a cropper because he holds off publishing the above-mentioned series of pictures for several weeks while steadily building interest about them in his paper. Has a newspaper ever said &quot;We have some mind-blowing pictures. So, watch out! We&apos;re going to print them in two weeks&apos; time&quot;? Am I alone in finding that ridiculous? Even if I&apos;m wrong on that score, there are plenty of other complaints to make about a plot that moves forward with all the subtlety and grace of an England rugby scrum. There is bus-heavy foreshadowing of the euthanasia strand, for instance \u2013 an arrangement that points to doom with flashing red arrows. There are also characters dumped into strategic positions throughout the book \u2013 and who have no life beyond their role in the plot. On page 105, we meet an employee at Vernon&apos;s paper called Frank Dibben and are immediately told he is known as Cassius &quot;for his lean and hungry look&quot;. Dibben whispers blandishments to Vernon, pretends to be on his side and with crushing inevitability is sitting in his editorial chair by page 130. He is there simply to serve a plot twist \u2013 although twist is perhaps the wrong word for such an unsurprising outcome. 3) The characters have no character.  Dibben is not really a concern when it comes to characterisation. McEwan makes no attempt to fill him in \u2013 but why would he when he comes and goes so quickly? The trouble is that everyone else is equally spectral. There is nothing to grasp in any of them. McEwan himself describes Vernon as a &quot;a man without edges \u2026 a man who did not fully exist&quot; and all that needs to be said is he does little to disabuse us of the notion. Clive, meanwhile, is offered to us simply as a composer with a mind dedicated only to the perfection of his art \u2013 to the extent that he can witness a rape and do nothing about it, as he&apos;d rather be jotting down musical notes. All of that would be fine, if rather unsatisfying, if McEwan didn&apos;t also want to suggest that they have a complicated emotional life. It&apos;s bewildering to see these ciphers suddenly bursting into emotional arguments with each other, bellowing about principles and hanging up the phone with soap-operatic violence. It&apos;s also strange to see such empty vessels pouring out for the lost Molly and gorging on revenge. McEwan expects them to eat when they have no stomachs. 4) There is nightmarish writing. I would hesitate to say that McEwan&apos;s prose is ever truly bad. Sentence by sentence he is a fine craftsman. Even in a book as awful as Amsterdam there are moments of pleasure, such as the following description of a crowd at a funeral: &quot;So many faces Clive had not seen by daylight, and looking terrible, like cadavers jerked upright to welcome the newly dead. Invigorated by this jolt of misanthropy, he moved sleekly through the din, ignored his name when it was called, withdrew his elbow when it was plucked and kept on going towards where George stood talking to two women and a shrivelled old cove with a fedora and stick.&quot; There&apos;s a beguiling unforced rhythm to the prose and it isn&apos;t just the fact that this book is so slight that makes it easy to finish in one brief sitting. But even so \u2026 As well as all those histrionic arguments, there are many embarrassing sequences. Vernon&apos;s lost editorship, for instance, is revealed in a one page chapter where McEwan suddenly starts talking about &quot;the editor&quot; where previously he has named Vernon, yet still expects the last sentence where &quot;the editor&quot; is replaced by &quot;Frank&quot; to come as a surprise. Worse still is Clive&apos;s death, supposedly the climax of the book, which is rendered ridiculous when it is described from within a dream-sequence in which Clive starts talking to the long-dead Molly. And even worse than that is the fact that this dreadful chapter is followed by one in which Vernon does the exact same thing. 5) It isn&apos;t funny. The slightness of characterisation, the over-the-top prose, the obtrusiveness of the plotting and the idiocy of the premise might be more easy to forgive as sacrifices made in the service of comedy. Ian McEwan himself suggested in a fascinating Paris Review interview that the book has a &quot;rather improbable comic plot&quot; and grew out of a &quot;long-running joke&quot;. The trouble is, that there are no laughs. The sly winking tone is irritating rather than amusing, the satire is too daft ever to hit home, and it&apos;s too easy to see the jokes coming. The only really laughable thing is the fact that Amsterdam won the Booker Prize when it so clearly didn&apos;t deserve it, but that too leaves a sour taste. In his Paris Review interview McEwan noted: &quot;[Amsterdam&apos;s] (as opposed to my) misfortune was to win the Booker Prize, at which point some people began to dismiss it.&quot; That&apos;s true to an extent, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s been his misfortune too. There&apos;s an argument that the attention he received from Amsterdam paved the way for Atonement&apos;s well-deserved conquest of the world a short while later, but it&apos;s hard not to feel the award has done McEwan&apos;s reputation lasting damage. The fact that it won the Booker will make many people (and more and more of them in the future) assume that Amsterdam must be McEwan&apos;s best work, when it is far from it. And if Amsterdam were the only book of his I&apos;d read, I&apos;d never read want to read another \u2013 and so miss out on one of our best contemporary novelists. It&apos;s small wonder that he has become the target of so much online sniping \u2013 there must be thousands of people out there who&apos;ve read only this one McEwan novel, seen it garlanded with awards, and assumed that he and the British literary establishment are locked in a conspiracy to feed us trash.

Or rather the two-man team that sees to their management, and has now decided that the prospect of Europe tumbling into economic chaos is enough to entail a drastic rewriting of their tour plans. Both groups are managed by a company called Q Prime, commanded by the music business veterans Peter Mensch and Cliff Burnstein. The former is the husband of the Tory backbencher Louise Mensch; back home in the States, the latter used the Wall Street Journal to serve notice this week that Metallica and the &quot;Chilis&quot; were now set on visiting Europe next year as opposed to 2013, lest they lose millions if the euro goes even further south. His case is simple enough: &quot;Over the next few years, the dollar will be stronger and the euro weaker, and if that&apos;s the case, I want to take advantage of that by playing more of these shows now, because they will be more profitable for us.&quot; Burnstein also says he is pushing acts into countries where strong currencies and insatiable audiences mean that there are altogether more dependable fortunes to be made. In other words, the ideal modern touring itinerary is increasingly not built around such legendary stop-offs as Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw (referenced in Paul McCartney&apos;s 1975 anthem Rock Show) or the Forest National Arena in Brussels (where the Rolling Stones recorded a famous 1973 performance, finally released officially last month), but Sydney, S\u00e3o Paulo and Jakarta. What&apos;s telling about Q Prime&apos;s manoeuvre is twofold. First, there is a neat pop-cultural subtext. In 2007, when the dollar&apos;s value against the euro was falling fast, the rapper Jay-Z made a point of waving around bunches of \u20ac500 notes in the video for a song titled Blue Magic, while the Wu-Tang Clan set the online price of their CDs in the currency, and the model Gisele B\u00fcndchen insisted on being paid the same way. No more: to use Marxist language, machinations in the economic base have rippled out into the superstructure, and euros \u2013 and by extension, Europe \u2013 are just about the least fashionable things imaginable. Second, for those Europeans fearing the worst but being comforted by, say, the Chilis&apos; rather underwhelming latest album, I&apos;m With You, the likely projections seem simple: if you live in such comparative pop-cultural deserts as Italy, Spain, Greece or \u2013 pardonnez-moi, but they&apos;ve never been much good at rock music \u2013 France, 2013 may mark the beginning of a long period of frustration. For the British too, a large-scale American no-show will have serious consequences. During festival season in particular, US musicians tend to bundle up their European and British engagements into one big busman&apos;s holiday, and then return home with enough money to tide them over till Christmas. If big acts decide to stay away, the silence \u2013 particularly at the metal and hard-rock end of the market \u2013 will be deafening. So what to do? The last time the UK was in a period of economic stagnation, we were treated to something called the new wave of British heavy metal, aka NWOBHM (or &quot;new-wob-bum&quot;), whose plebeian, no-nonsense music and aesthetics were perfectly suited to the wider moment \u2013 and caught the attention of the young Metallica. Thirty years on, if that band and their ilk spurn these shores for lucrative treks around the southern hemisphere, it may again be time to apply jump-leads to home-grown rock.

On the face of it, matchday six was hardly an outright success, as both Milan clubs embarrassed themselves, but Napoli relished their moment at centre stage by confirming their deliverance from the group of death. But when the last 16 standing travel to Uefa&apos;s headquarters for the knockout draw, the Italians will be entitled to feel a little bit smug as they survey the room. Best league in the world? The Premier League? La Liga? Pfff. With three contenders from Italy, there is a greater presence from Serie A than any other national competition. More than England and Spain, who have the same number of teams left in as Russia, France and Germany. &quot;It&apos;s been three years since Italy had three clubs in the last 16 [Inter, Juve and Roma last time], but above all it&apos;s been a long time since Italy was the nation with the most clubs through to the last 16,&quot; noted the Gazzetta dello Sport, who naturally revelled in what Napoli have to offer. &quot;Italy has given Europe some new stars, and who says they won&apos;t continue to do so in the next round in February?&quot; Napoli&apos;s coach described the consequences of their win in Villarreal as &quot;stratospheric&quot;. Thousands of fans made their way to the airport to greet the team home and when the door of the plane opened at 3.40am the triumphant players were regaled by a chorus of &quot;Grazie ragazzi!&quot; \u2013 &quot;Thank you boys!&quot; If Joe Hart was honest enough to admit that his team lacked the experience for the situation, that only puts even more glowing perspective on Napoli, themselves debutants in the Champions League, and a team comprising fewer players well versed in this competition than City. They could not have handled their group with a better blend of audacity, enthusiasm and determination. Complimenti. It was not a memorable week for the two Milan clubs, who allowed their group efforts to finish with a whimper. &quot;At the moment everything is going wrong,&quot; lamented Claudio Ranieri after a weakened Inter succumbed at home to CSKA Moscow. Massimiliano Allegri declared himself &quot;very angry&quot; with his team for letting slip a two-goal lead at Viktoria Plzen. &quot;The positive aspect is that I&apos;m sure we will not repeat this mistake in the near future,&quot; he warned. But ultimately these disappointments are only relative. Come February, when they are still playing European football on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, all that will be forgotten. The Gazzetta ran an online poll asking if an Italian club can win the Champions League. By mid-morning after Napoli&apos;s success, just over a third giddily answered in the affirmative, which was significantly more than voted for the Barcelona option \u2014 but, interestingly, a fraction less than the option for Real Madrid. Michel Platini was right about pushing the underdogs If only someone knew how to bottle the emotion that flowed around the St Jakob-Park. Just as Apoel struck a glorious blow for Cypriot football over this campaign, everybody associated with FC Basel \u2014 and to an extent Swiss football as a whole \u2014 should have a spring in their step for a good while. Uefa&apos;s president, Michel Platini, has made it his business to offer a leg up to the smaller clubs and nations, and it has paid off with the presence of some unexpected names in the last 16. Alexander Frei explained how Basel have evolved during the competition. &quot;In any group stage there is a key moment, and for us this moment was at Old Trafford [where Basel drew 3-3]. That&apos;s when we realised what we could achieve. This shows that our belief and confidence can move mountains.&quot; Heiko Vogel, who is in only his seventh week of being a head coach anywhere at any level, confessed to having tears in his eyes. &quot;I believe we can&apos;t be beaten when it comes to togetherness,&quot; he enthused. If there was one person in the St Jakob who was even more tearful than Vogel it was the charismatic patron of the club, Gisela &quot;Gigi&quot; Oeri, a lady whose orange tan and red and blue nail polish just scratches the surface of her colourful ways. Over the past few years, her funding, and her business contacts which have brought big sponsorship deals by the standards of Swiss football, have underpinned the club&apos;s growth. She is due to step down soon, and her last big project is the youth development centre which will be as hi-tech and inspiring as any around. Basel are proud of their work in youth development. Half of the team that beat United are homegrown. And there are plenty more waiting in the wings to break through. Ten points is not enough to qualify As Roberto Mancini was quick to point out at the end of a bittersweet evening at the Etihad: &quot;99% of teams go through with 10 points.&quot; To add to City&apos;s frustration, half of the group runners-up this season actually qualified with fewer points than City managed. A further two runners-up had the same points total as City&apos;s. To be dumped into the Europa League after garnering what is usually a respectable tally is bound to hurt. Mancini&apos;s personal disappointment in this competition goes on, but it is hard to imagine City will not make a better fist of it next time around. Apart from anything else, they would be incredibly unlucky to draw such a tough group again, although it remains to be seen whether they have done enough to clamber out of the pot of third seeds. If there is any consolation to be drawn for City, it is that however bad they are feeling, their neighbours ought to be feeling worse. When the draw was made, everyone was aware that City had a tough task. United, however, had every right to be quietly satisfied with a draw that should have been comfortable. Valbuena strikes another blow for the little guys Although Mathieu Valbuena started his professional career with Bordeaux, playing in the same reserve team as Marouane Chamakh and Rio Mavuba, he was released at the age of 18. Everybody says he wasn&apos;t fancied because he was small, although one of his coaches hinted it was equally a question of attitude. Either way, he was shown the door. What to do? He joined Langon-Castets in the fifth tier of French football, a club which doesn&apos;t have a stadium, but does have a couple of pitches. Valbuena played amateur football for three seasons before he was given a second chance by Olympique Marseille. When Didier Deschamps arrived at the V\u00e9lodrome, he didn&apos;t have much time for Valbuena, and the player asked to be transfer-listed in the winter of 2010. But when he was reinstated into the team he became an integral member of l&apos;OM&apos;s double-winning side. There were a few contenders for goal of matchday six of the Champions League, but none equal Valbuena&apos;s for the mix of brilliance and importance. Marseille recovered from 2-0 down at Dortmund, and with three minutes to go Valbuena beat a couple of men and sent a searing shot into the top corner to put his side in front. In those final moments Deschamps couldn&apos;t have looked antsier if he had eaten the world&apos;s most challenging vindaloo yet was nowhere near a toilet. Marseille may be a little inconsistent, but they have a dangerous attack with the speed and power of Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and Andr\u00e9 Ayew alongside the trickery of the likes of Valbuena. They could be a tricky opponent for all but the strongest in the last 16. The l&apos;OM turnaround was even more spectacular than the other outlandish swing of this round, which saw their compatriots Lyon, together with some helpful input from Real Madrid, send Ajax tumbling from a position of strength. With all their off-field disputes and distractions, all is not well in Amsterdam. History is not on Real Madrid&apos;s side But there&apos;s always a first time. It is all going to come to a head on Saturday night, but in the last few weeks such has been Real Madrid&apos;s form more and more people are coming round to the idea that Barcelona have some serious competition for all the honours. With a comprehensive 3-0 victory at Ajax (although it must be said the home team were unlucky with some poor offside decisions) Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s team became the fifth team to ease through the group stage with a perfect record. Played six, won six. Goals scored 19, goals against two. That&apos;s some statement of intent. It just so happens that none of the previous teams to take a 100% record into the last 16 went on to win the tournament. Real do look a different proposition with Mourinho at the helm than they did for all those recent campaigns when they strained to make much headway in the knockout stage. As with all the teams who had qualified before the final day, Mourinho took the opportunity to rest some of his most important players, although Real were still able to play Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Karim Benzema, Kak\u00e1 and Nuri Sahin from the start. &quot;This game shows that we fully respect what Real Madrid stands for in the world of football and that we respect our profession and always play seriously,&quot; said Mourinho. &quot;I was immensely happy to see that when I turned on my phone after the game there were SMS messages from the players back home congratulating us. This shows how united we are.&quot; He might even have had a moment to send some messages of his own, perhaps to some old friends at Chelsea, notably Petr Cech and Didier Drogba, who rolled back the years.", "sentences": ["With all their off-field disputes and distractions, all is not well in Amsterdam."], "title": "Champions League: five things we learned | Amy Lawrence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/08/five-things-learned-champions-league", "tags": ["Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-08T21:09:00Z", "article": "     Mark Clattenburg has emerged as the key figure in Uefa&apos;s investigations of Dinamo Zagreb&apos;s extraordinary 7-1 home defeat by Lyon in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Uefa is waiting for the Premier League referee&apos;s report into the controversial match, during which his fellow Englishmen Mike Mullarkey and Peter Kirkup were running the lines. Lee Probert, another elite English referee, was fourth official, and Kevin Friend and Andre Marriner were the by-line assistants. The conclusions in Clattenburg&apos;s report will influence whether Uefa takes its inquiries into the events any further after the result permitted the French team to progress to the last 16 of the competition at the expense of Ajax. Dinamo had been down to 10 men after Clattenburg sent off Jerko Leko 28 minutes into the game. What made the result all the more remarkable was that at the end of normal time in the first half the Croatian side had been 1-0 up. The French Autorit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation des Jeux en Ligne (Arjel) on Thursday carried out checks to establish if any suspicious betting took place around the match but reported that it found nothing out of the ordinary in the total amount gambled online with French operators, the number of bets, their spread, or in how odds evolved during the game. Uefa&apos;s betting fraud detection system (BFDS), which monitors betting patterns in every match in its competitions, has been consulted for evidence of any irregular betting patterns around the match. However, Uefa indicated on Thursday afternoon that it had found no instances to justify an inquiry on betting grounds. Its president, Michel Platini, said he had &quot;no doubts whatsoever about the integrity of the match or the competition&quot;. A spokeswoman for Uefa said: &quot;We look at every match automatically through the BFDS system then it becomes another matter if anything is found,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Uefa. &quot;We always also look at the reports from officials because they are briefed on any issues relating to match fixing. If there&apos;s anything suspicious \u2013 which is rare \u2013 it will be mentioned by them. But we are still waiting on those reports.&quot; Lyon confirmed Arjel is undertaking inquiries in a statement that said: &quot;Olympique Lyonnais are aware of the checks being conducted this morning by Arjel, which are completely in tune with the procedures of the governing body for online betting. &quot;The club totally approves of this action that is undertaken whenever a sporting result is considered unusual and we regret that comments have not been confined to the sporting aspect of an incredible achievement both for Olympique Lyonnais and French football as a whole.&quot; The Ajax coach, Frank de Boer, said Uefa should investigate the Lyon match if it was suspected anything unusual had gone on. &quot;If there was something unusual, Uefa should investigate what happened in Zagreb,&quot; De Boer was quoted as saying by ESPN Soccernet. Bernard Lacombe, Lyon&apos;s sporting director, offered a more emotional perspective on the inquiries. &quot;It&apos;s total rubbish, people should stop saying such things,&quot; he said. &quot;Did they open an investigation at half-time when it was 1-1? I don&apos;t give a damn what the Ajax manager says. Apparently we are also responsible for the refereeing of the match in Amsterdam.&quot; Dinamo, who have parted company with their coach, Krunoslav Jurcic, also issued angry denials of any wrongdoing in the game. &quot;It is tendentious, outrageous and malicious to declare the recent Champions League match [between] Dinamo [and] Lyon in Maksimir suspicious,&quot; the club said. &quot;Dinamo again strongly condemns all insinuations in the media, both foreign, and domestic, of favouring any results.

Nigel Farage&apos;s EFD group of MEPs has welcomed Frank Vanhecke MEP, whose first Flemish nationalist party (Vlaams Blok) was disbanded after it violated Belgian anti-racism legislation. Vanhecke&apos;s career began working for the charming Karel Dillen, a founder of Vlaams Blok. Dillen described himself as a &quot;passive collaborator&quot; during the Nazi occupation of Belgium, and founded a pro-apartheid lobby in the 1970s called Protea. In 1990, when Amsterdam&apos;s mayor named a square after Nelson Mandela, Vanhecke condemned him as &quot;a renegade towards his own people and race&quot;. He became the leader of Vlaams Belang, the successor to Vlaams Blok, in 2004, and as the only MEP from his party, he automatically becomes a vice president within Farage&apos;s group. He seems the best kind of guy to have around. \u2022 We are taken to task, meanwhile, for being sniffy about Darra Singh, the man who leads Big Dave&apos;s limited inquiry into the summer riots, and who has now landed a fat-wallet job with accountants Ernst &amp; Young. Leave him be, says a trusted voice. He deserves some luck. &quot;Why did he have to seek a new job in the first place? Indeed why was he chairing the riots panel?&quot; our source asks. &quot;He had been headhunted from Ealing council to be chief executive of Jobcentre Plus and have deputy secretary rank at the Department of Work and Pensions in 2009 \u2013 One of the most senior black and ethnic minority civil servants. The coalition then decided to end Jobcentre Plus&apos;s status as an agency and bring the function in-house in 2011. Darra was effectively made redundant. I guess the riots panel job was tantamount to gardening leave.&quot; Something needs explaining, says our source. &quot;How many other G2 civil servants have been made redundant like that and not slotted into an equivalent role elsewhere in the civil service?&quot; Not many minority mandarins in higher echelons. Even fewer now. \u2022 It is a world-class civil service. And from Monday, it will be even better. A short course for Whitehall: Command the English Language. Grammar and spelling brushed up, and at \u00a3150, very reasonable. All the tools they&apos;ll need to apply for jobs elsewhere. \u2022 Finally, a gruesome list. Gerald Howarth, defence minister, Nigel Evans, deputy speaker of the house, Conor Burns, PPS to the Northern Ireland minister, Sajid Javid, PPS to the chancellor, Daniel Hannan MEP. All listed as speaking at the jamboree organised by those hazy, crazy young Tories in the Young Britons Foundation, which starts on Friday at St Anne&apos;s College, Oxford. Eric Pickles is also listed, which is interesting because previously he seemed keen to distance himself from half-brained positions taken by YBF leaders on the NHS and torture. And because he has been notably reluctant for the past 11 days to confirm his attendance to us. We can&apos;t know what goes on at these things. But from Eric&apos;s behaviour, one might suspect Max Mosley is organising the after-party. That&apos;s the problem with cover-ups.

Serious shoppers need information and determination. I love the bejewelled and embroidered babouches (slippers) and bags, the tasselled accessories, Berber jewellery, chiselled tiles, decorated pottery, ground cinnamon \u2026 However, when I&apos;m in Marrakech I crave rugs. My favourites are the Berber rag rugs called boucherouite. I&apos;ve found vintage versions in the Bab El Khemis flea market (the north-east corner of the medina, open daily 9.30am\u20136pm). During a recent visit I bought a pretty multicoloured checkerboard rug that folded nicely into my luggage. There are some stunning examples of boucherouite in fading solid colours at Art Ouarzazate (15 Rue Rahba Kdima, which is actually Rue Rahb el Biadyne). The shop&apos;s specialities include knotted and printed leather rugs and goatskin patchwork rugs. Tuareg rugs from the Sahara, made with tightly woven palm leaves and camel leather that make them impervious to the desert sand, can be found at Mustapha Blaoui (144 Rue Bab Doukkala \u2013 there&apos;s no sign, so knock on the brass-studded double doors).

The multicoloured rugs are superb, as is the marquetry (inlaid patterned) furniture but, being a &quot;fashion girl&quot;, I was most excited about finding some really special leather bags. I like simple styles, which India does not always do, so I was very surprised to find wonderful tan satchels. Unlined and made of fairly robust leather, they really hold their shape, but also wear wonderfully well. The cross-body mini is the ideal hands-free travel companion, just big enough to hold all your vital documents, wallet and phone.

I didn&apos;t start training as a dancer until I\u00a0was 22. The urge to perform was weirdly natural. I was always the kid down the street who got the other kids to put on a show. But it was only when I was 19, and discovered ballet and contemporary dance, that I got interested in the fact that you could have a whole evening of dance \u2013 rather than just waiting for the dancers in a musical. What was your big breakthrough? It&apos;s got to be Swan Lake. It really changed my life and that of my company. The day after the opening night, it was all over the news pages, and I was on CNN. You&apos;ve been credited with breaking down barriers between theatre, ballet and contemporary dance. Was that your intention? Not really: I&apos;ve never had a plan. I think it&apos;s happened because I came to dance late, and so I don&apos;t think like someone who&apos;s come up through a formal, classical ballet training: my imagery comes as much from theatre and films. What&apos;s the biggest myth about choreography? That the choreographer stands in front of a mirror, works it all out and then teaches it to people. It&apos;s actually a collaboration, and it takes time. Which artists do you most admire? Fred Astaire: I don&apos;t think he&apos;s often recognised as a choreographer. I&apos;ve learnt so much about storytelling from Hitchcock, and I love the question marks in Pinter. What&apos;s the greatest threat to dance? The fact that choreographers must increasingly have a mind on ways to raise money. Not everyone thinks like that; if you saw these arts council forms you have to fill in \u2013 it&apos;s like another language. What&apos;s the worst thing anyone ever said about you? When we first started the company, we toured to Amsterdam with a programme made up of three pieces by me, and two by others. The review said: &quot;Last night, Adventures in Motion Pictures performed a programme of work \u2013 three of them, unfortunately, by Matthew Bourne.&quot; That was not a nice opening line. How would you like to be remembered? For bringing dance to a wider audience without dumbing down. I&apos;m constantly being approached by people who say: &quot;You&apos;ve introduced me to a new world that I didn&apos;t even know I liked.&quot; Even if\u00a0I didn&apos;t set out to do that, I&apos;m very proud that I have.

The taxi drivers can talk at dizzier rates than those illuminated on their meters, particularly if the subject is football. &quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; says the Tottenham Hotspur and Holland attacking midfielder. &quot;Almost every time it&apos;s an Arsenal-supporting driver, he says the same joke. &apos;If you were Robin van Persie the ride is free but since it&apos;s you, you have to pay.&apos; It&apos;s no problem. I pay.&quot; Footballers have amusing stories to tell from cabs. Take Paolo Rossi, the Italy striker, who was being taken into a Brazilian city more than 20 years after his hat-trick had sunk the country at the 1982 World Cup. Rossi had barely changed in appearance and the driver, after several checks in the rear-view mirror, was convinced. &quot;Is it you,&quot; he said. &quot;Paolo Rossi?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Rossi replied, beaming. The door flew open. &quot;Get out.&quot; Rossi was stranded on the roadside. Van der Vaart may consider himself to have got off lightly, given his habit of tormenting Arsenal. Since his arrival at Tottenham from Real Madrid in August of last year, he has played against them in three Premier League derbies and scored on each occasion. There was the penalty in last November&apos;s 3-2 win at the Emirates \u2013 Tottenham&apos;s first away derby triumph since 1993 \u2013 and the two goals in the White Hart Lane return, which ended 3-3; Van der Vaart&apos;s second was the equaliser from the spot. This season, he opened the scoring in the 2-1 home win in October. It feels natural to Van der Vaart to bring up the derbies and not only, as he points out with a smile, because of his goals in them or, perhaps, his friendly rivalry with Van Persie, his international team-mate. &quot;When I came to Tottenham,&quot; he says, &quot;the whole club was only talking about the game against Arsenal. Of course, Arsenal is the big team in London.&quot; But to Van der Vaart, the reference point is shifting and Tottenham must no longer measure themselves in the shadow of their neighbours. He can feel the optimism and, having heard the tales of how the club have traditionally found a way to mess up things, he senses that it will be different this time. &quot;We have a great squad and it&apos;s not just about a game against Arsenal. That was the most positive thing that I saw when we beat them this season. We were happy but it was not like we had won the title or something. We won the game and that&apos;s it. That says a lot about this team.&quot; The 28-year-old is one of the game&apos;s romantics, an instinctive playmaker who feels the duty to entertain. &quot;When I lose the fun in football, it&apos;s better to quit,&quot; he says. He is also something of an adrenaline junkie, who has marvelled at the &quot;electric&quot; energy of a midweek White Hart Lane crowd and fed off it. He described the atmosphere during that 3-3 derby draw in April as &quot;one of the most impressive&quot; of his career. This is a player who knows a thing or two about the cathedrals of European football. &quot;I feel like I am part of a grand adventure and everybody at the club has the feeling that we have something special coming. I don&apos;t know what but we are winning our games, also against the lower teams, which we didn&apos;t do last season. We have more confidence. The Champions League was unbelievable last season and that is where I want to play.&quot; Van der Vaart&apos;s transition from Madrid to Tottenham was always going to be startling. He remembers his presentation as a Real player in 2008, following his \u00a311.4m move from Hamburg, in front of 20,000 fans at the Bernab\u00e9u and being &quot;so nervous&quot; that he could barely perform his tricks. To wear the famous white shirt was &quot;a dream for the whole family&quot;, given that his mother&apos;s side of it are Spanish. &quot;Madrid was paradise, we had everything,&quot; Van der Vaart says, as he recalled his first day at Spurs Lodge when he looked up at the shower and felt no water. &quot;I remember that the shower wasn&apos;t working and then we had my press conference in the little room. But Tottenham is pure football and pure people \u2026 nice, warm people. That&apos;s why I like Tottenham. And everybody who comes to the stadium can smell the history.&quot; Title talk is in the air in N17 and although Van der Vaart urges caution, pointing out that Manchester City are &quot;the favourites \u2026 they have too many good players&quot;, his admission that second place is &quot;really open&quot; illustrates how Tottenham have recalibrated their sights. He feels a kindred spirit in Harry Redknapp, an enthusiast who prioritises the spectacle, even if he does not always appreciate the manager&apos;s decisions to substitute him. In 48 starts in all competitions for the club, he has seen his number go up 31 times. It has led to arguments yet Van der Vaart is nothing if not open, upfront and, let&apos;s face it, typically Dutch. &quot;When your relationship is good, you can tell somebody the truth. It&apos;s better to do it like this. To go to him and talk about it rather than go behind his back or say something in the newspapers. You always have to be honest. You get to a certain point and then you say, &apos;Listen, I don&apos;t like it&apos;. I think it&apos;s a good thing and I also go home happy. You are not frustrated.&quot; The question for Tottenham is whether they can keep Redknapp beyond the summer, when England will need a successor to Fabio Capello. Van der Vaart does not sugarcoat his answer. &quot;I hope Harry is going to stay but, to be honest, I think he is maybe the right man for the [England] job. The players would accept him \u2026 and especially, the people in England, everybody loves him, so I think it is going to be a good move from the England organisation. It would be bad for Tottenham but somebody else would come.&quot; Van der Vaart&apos;s frustrations in England have been linked to muscular injuries. They are the reason that Redknapp handles him with care and, also, why he did not register him for the Europa League campaign, a decision that did not sit well with the player. Van der Vaart had a hamstring problem and was scheduled to be out for six weeks and so Redknapp did not consider him but, characteristically, he returned quickly. &quot;A misunderstanding,&quot; was Van der Vaart&apos;s interpretation. The speed of his recoveries from various strains and tears has been remarkable and attributable to his work with the Rotterdam-based physiotherapist Dick van Toorn, who is a controversial figure due to his methods that accelerate the healing process. Van der Vaart has his own personalised training programme at Tottenham, that sees him work twice a week in the gym but, thanks to Van Toorn, he does not worry about muscular setbacks. Van Toorn&apos;s critics say that his treatment provides only short-term fixes and can lead to problems in the longer term. &quot;I go there and after one week, I can run and shoot again. It&apos;s a lot of acupuncture, chiropractic work \u2026 and a lot of power training. You have a lot of pain when you have pulled your hamstring, for example, but he is still training, training, training. I always go there for four days and it&apos;s two four-hour sessions per day.&quot; If there is a barrel-chested strut about Van der Vaart&apos;s game, there is a humility about him off the pitch. And good humour. He talks about how he renewed his wedding vows with Sylvie, a model and television presenter, in Las Vegas over the summer. Was it a spontaneous decision? Van der Vaart inhales deeply. &quot;To be honest, I wanted to go to Las Vegas and Sylvie \u2026 not. So I had to make it a little bit attractive.&quot; At his Tottenham unveiling, he described himself as a &quot;streetfighter&quot;, who had emerged from a caravan park in Beverwijk, near Amsterdam, to scale the game&apos;s peaks. He played in the World Cup final in South Africa as a substitute. &quot;How many people can say that?&quot; he says. Sylvie, too, is a fighter and her battle against breast cancer, which began in Van der Vaart&apos;s first season in Madrid, has been successful. &quot;She lost her hair and it was a hard time,&quot; he says. &quot;Our son, Dami\u00e1n, who was two and a half at the time, was looking and wondering why she didn&apos;t have hair. She kept on working, too. She was amazing. It offered me a lot of perspective. Football is important but it&apos;s not the most important thing.&quot; Van der Vaart has thrown himself into his life at Tottenham. His son trains with the under-sixes and Van der Vaart sits down for this interview after delivering Christmas presents to the children at Chase Farm hospital in Enfield. A highlight comes when a mother thrusts her mobile phone at him and demands that he speak to her Tottenham-obsessed husband. A couple of smooth-talking moments later and Van der Vaart has made the supporter&apos;s season. He intends to do likewise for plenty more.

What the manager got in the draw for the last 32 may have come as a pleasant surprise: the mighty Ajax Amsterdam, in a fixture that could comfortably have graced the first knockout round of the Champions League. It is an extremely tough tie and it is in keeping with the luck of England&apos;s Europa League representatives. Manchester City, who like United fell short in the Champions League to enter the competition via the back door, drew Porto, the holders. Stoke City, the only English\u00a0club to qualify through the group phase, were paired with Valencia. Ajax, Porto and Valencia are Champions League dropouts too. If the Ajax tie was among the best that United could have hoped for in logistical terms \u2013 not to mention it providing a fun away trip for their fans \u2013 it is also a confrontation that Ferguson will relish. There would also be no embarrassment if United were to lose. &quot;I have never played Ajax before in competitive football in my managerial career,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;They are a good\u00a0team and we are looking forward to it.&quot; If United are asking themselves how they came to be in the competition, Ajax need a dose of smelling salts. They had one\u00a0foot in the Champions League last 16, only to be overtaken on goal difference by Lyon when the French club scored six second-half goals to win 7-1 at Dinamo\u00a0Zagreb. The craziness of that scoreline felt in keeping with the soap opera that is Ajax at present. The club, who are fourth in the Eredivisie, have been beset by a boardroom power struggle. Roberto Mancini, the City manager, has stated his desire to win the Europa League together with the Premier League and the club have not felt the sense of shame that has accompanied United into the tournament. Their draw is even more mouthwatering. Porto, who are still kicking themselves for their failure to beat Zenit St Petersburg at home in the final round of Champions League group ties, are unbeaten at the top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga. &quot;Porto is probably the toughest game we\u00a0could have,&quot; Mancini said. &quot;Manchester City against Porto feels like a Champions League game. I have come up against them as a player before and also a manager, and they are a very strong club. They are used to playing in Europe, in a great stadium. &quot;Not too many years ago they won the Champions League. We know this game will be difficult, but also it will be difficult for them. We will be looking forward to it. It will be a hard match for us. When I looked at the teams we could face, I thought Porto would be the toughest. It is a good game for the fans, a big team coming to Manchester.&quot; Stoke succeeded in the Europa League group stage where Tottenham Hotspur, Fulham and Birmingham City failed, and they will go into their tie against Valencia, the third-best team in Spain, with tremendous credit. The matches will be their 11th and 12th in the competition this season. &quot;To be the only club in the country to qualify is a fantastic achievement,&quot; said their manager, Tony Pulis. &quot;I think it&apos;s been recognised that we had the hardest group and also we travelled further than anybody else as well [to play in Kiev, Tel Aviv and Istanbul].

We remain committed to this ideal and equality for all, irrespective of a person&apos;s background. LFC considers racism in any form to be unacceptable \u2013 without compromise. It is our strong-held belief, having gone over the facts of the case, that Luis Su\u00e1rez did not commit any racist act. It is also our opinion that the accusation by this particular player was not credible \u2013 certainly no more credible than his prior unfounded accusations. It is key to note that Patrice Evra himself in his written statement in this case said: &apos;I don&apos;t think that Luis Su\u00e1rez is racist.&apos; The FA in their opening remarks accepted that Luis Su\u00e1rez was not racist. Luis himself is of a mixed race family background as his grandfather was black. He has played with black players and mixed with their families whilst with the Uruguay national side and was captain at Ajax Amsterdam of a team with a proud multicultural profile, many of whom became good friends. It seems incredible to us that a player of mixed heritage should be accused and found guilty in the way he has based on the evidence presented. We do not recognise the way in which Luis Su\u00e1rez has been characterised. Nothing we have heard in the hearing has changed our view that Luis Su\u00e1rez is innocent and we will provide Luis with whatever support he now needs to clear his name. We would also like to know when the FA intend to charge Patrice Evra with making abusive remarks to an opponent after he admitted in his evidence to insulting Luis Su\u00e1rez in Spanish in the most objectionable of terms.", "sentences": ["He has played with black players and mixed with their families whilst with the Uruguay national side and was captain at Ajax Amsterdam of a team with a proud multicultural profile, many of whom became good friends."], "title": "Luis Su\u00e1rez: Liverpool statement", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/20/luis-suarez-liverpool-statement", "tags": ["Luis Su\u00e1rez", "Liverpool", "The FA", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-21T14:51:15Z", "article": "A Dutch magazine editor has resigned after publishing a controversial profile of Rihanna.

The author goes on to describe the singer&apos;s &quot;porn heels&quot; and &quot;ghetto ass&quot;. After learning of the piece this week, Rihanna unleashed a volley of furious tweets:  &quot;I hope u can read english, because your magazine is a poor representation of the evolution of human rights,&quot; she snarled. &quot;There are 1000&apos;s of Dutch girls who would love to be recognised for their contributions to your country, [and] you could have given them an article.

Yesterday, Jackie magazine&apos;s publishers announced that Hoeke had resigned. In a parting statement, Hoeke blamed her departure not on the initial article, but on how she responded to it. &quot;I realise that my first reaction \u2026 in which I indicated that [the article] was a joke, was \u2026 incomplete,&quot; she wrote:  &quot;The term &apos;niggabitch&apos; came from America and we solely used it to describe a style of dress \u2026 I should have counted to 10 before taking un-nuanced stands through social media channels \u2026 Because my credibility is now affected, it is better for all parties if I quit my function as editor-in-chief effective immediately.&quot;  At the time of writing, Rihanna had not responded to Hoeke&apos;s resignation.", "sentences": ["!&quot; The Rihanna profile appears in the latest issue of Jackie, a glossy women&apos;s magazine based in Amsterdam."], "title": "Dutch magazine editor resigns following race row with Rihanna", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/21/rihanna-dutch-magazine-profile-resignation", "tags": ["Rihanna", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Race issues", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-21T17:50:23Z", "article": "So what will 2012 bring for us all? One thing the New Year is guaranteed to bring is a series of key anniversaries. Indeed, at times it will be hard to move without tripping over one milestone or another. Most obviously, there will be the UN Rio+20 conference, twenty years on from 1992s Earth Summit. But we will also mark the twenty-fifth anniversaries of the Brundtland Report, Our Common Future, and of SustainAbility \u2013 the company I co-founded early in 1987. Less obviously, 2012 will mark the fortieth anniversary of the Limits to Growth study and the fiftieth of Rachel Carson&apos;s influential book Silent Spring, first published in 1962. Both books had a huge impact on my thinking. All of these historic events continue to send ripples through today&apos;s world, not least contributing to the growth of interest in sustainable business, as seen in the evolution of the Guardian Sustainable Business website, with its various Hubs. But I&apos;m wondering whether we oughtn&apos;t to be raising our sights considerably in the coming year? In searching for New Year&apos;s Resolutions, and ways to boost our collective Future Quotient, I have been thinking back to some of the quotations I saw last week as I was taken around logistics company TNT&apos;s Amsterdam HQ, an extraordinary building billed as Europe&apos;s greenest \u2013 designed to be a net energy producer, with LEED Platinum certification and a GreenCalc+ score of 1005 points. The first quotation I saw engraved on a window inside the building was Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s &quot;You must be the change you want to see the world.&quot; Then I came across Nelson Mandela&apos;s &quot;It always seems impossible until it is done.&quot; And Thomas Edison&apos;s &quot;There is no substitute for hard work.&quot; Then, turning a corner, I encountered Richard Branson&apos;s &quot;Our generation has inherited an incredibly beautiful world from their parents and they from their parents. It is in our hands whether our children and their children inherit the same world.&quot; A pretty concise framing of the sustainability agenda from the author of Screw Business as Usual. As I reflected on how we might achieve the impossible by dint of yet more hard work, it struck me that one of our biggest problems next year will be that we will be bombarded with information on how the world is getting better\u2014and how it is getting worse. With the travails of the Eurozone, the risk of a global downturn and the continuing distraction of the U.S. elections, the chances are that 2012 will come and go before we have truly got our act together. Initially, I thought of the idea of declaring a Year of Sustainable Capitalism, to build on the publication of the Manifesto for Sustainable Capitalism co- authored by David Blood and Al Gore of Generation Investment Management. (We are currently working with the Value Web, on a TEDx event on sustainable capitalism, almost certainly to be held in London in May \u2014 which evolved out of the One Planet London initiative we launched at the beginning of 2011.) But then I thought about the Year idea some more, particularly after listening to Michael Porter&apos;s speech at a major conference on sustainable value chains in Amsterdam. In contrast to events earlier in the year, he is now signaling that his Creating Shared Value approach threatens the extinction of neither CSR nor the wider sustainability agenda. Instead, he is talking about the need to change capitalism as a whole to fit the social and environmental needs of the new century. The capacity audience at Amsterdam&apos;s RAI conference centre was rapt, though I suspect that most delegates have yet to wake up to the fact that Porter is effectively calling for a decades-long conversion process. And that suggests that no single Year declared will do more than scratch the surface. I also subsequently discovered that the UN has already declared 2012 the Year of Sustainable Energy for All. So it would seem that sustainability is in the wind. But anyone concerned about the dilution of definitions by the processes of mainstreaming would not have been reassured by one of the working sessions I dropped in on at the value chain event \u2013 a session billed as providing answers to the question of how business can go from 5-10% sustainability solutions to 90-95% solutions. Among the presenters: Ahold, the retail giant. Their CEO recently called for all their &apos;own brands&apos; to be sustainable by 2015, and the speaker noted that they were already producing &apos;sustainable pork&apos;. So in an interval I queried, at a time when meat production is thought to account for some 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions, whether Ahold has confirmed that their version of sustainable pork would help feed a world headed towards 9 billion people? The answer: no. Instead, I was told, &apos;sustainable&apos; here means that the consumer&apos;s animal welfare concerns have been addressed. As someone who went largely vegetarian some 35 years ago, and who apparently bit the local butcher in the back of his leg when, aged four, I saw him cutting up a lamb, I&apos;m pleased about the animal welfare improvements \u2013 but not persuaded that Ahold will be anything like sustainable, even in its own brand category, by 2020, let alone 2015. So, while we should welcome stretch targets, it seems that we need to raise our collective sights in ways that ensure we keep track of progress over multiple years. Yes, we should welcome UN Years, but we should also understand that they are declared in a vacuum unless the processes of capitalism engage in timely and effective ways. Changing capitalism requires us to change not just corporate mindsets and behaviours, but the cultures, governance systems and tax regimes within which business operates. This is part of the context for the proposed Zero Hub we are developing with Deloitte Innovation. Designed to coincide with the launch next May of my new book, The Zeronauts, this has attracted a significant number of companies wanting to get involved \u2013 but in a surprising number of cases the ultimate decision has gone up to the company&apos;s Board. Our reading is that too many companies are still thinking of all this in terms of corporate citizenship rather than surviving the growing forces of creative destruction. So, to raise the stakes, as we put in the hard work towards our TEDx event on sustainable capitalism, I am increasingly inclining towards the notion of declaring a Decade of Sustainable Capitalism, to be launched at the event. But what do you think of the idea?

There&apos;s goals in that there game. Unlike at Goodison Park, where Everton 0-0 Swansea City has to be the nap of the season.  Elsewhere, what possibility festive cheer at what may well be the glummest ground in the country, Villa Park? The atmosphere at Blackburn may be poisonous these days but at least there&apos;s some passion \u2013 Villa Park, meanwhile, reeks of mere mould, a seemingly moribund team failing to inspire even contempt. Awful to watch, but surely a pleasure to play against, as Arsenal should show tonight, even a slightly makeshift side (Coquelin at right-back, anyone?). Meanwhile, will Wigan continue their mini-revival by making Luis Suarez&apos;s week even worse? Or will the Uruguayan finally find the finishing skills to match his otherwise superb play? And if there is to be a touchline clash anywhere toinight, please let it be at Loftus Road, with Neil Warnock pitted against Martin O&apos;Neill, with Joey Barton and Lee Cattermole chipping in.

Subs: De Gea, Berbatov, Park, Hernandez, Young, Rafael Da Silva, Fryers.Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire)  7.38pm: Factoid: An unlikely Stoke win at Manchester City tonight will give the club three consecutive away victories in the top flight for the first time since 1975. THey finished fifth that year, four places behind champions Derby County. And guess who got relegated this year? Carlisle United (yes, they really were in the top flight). As for City, they&apos;ve won all of their home games so far this season and are seeking to beat the record they set in 1921, when they won 19 of their 21 home leagtue matches and drew the other two ... but still only finished second in the table. Behind Burnley.  7.45pm: We have kick-off at Villa, Man City and Newcastle. All the other matches get going at 8pm. &quot;I&apos;m impressed by the utter certainty of those defending Suarez (t-shirts, really?) and those condemning him even though the FA have not released their findings,&quot; snorts Niall Mullne. &quot;Did I say impressed? I meant utterly depressed. I&apos;m always getting those things mixed up.&quot;  7.47pm: In case you&apos;re interested, there is also action in the French and Italian league tonight - and a shock in the making, to boot, with Ligue 1 leaders in hot water at Evian, where they&apos;re losing 4-2 with only about 10 minutes to go. Also, second-bottom Valenciennes are beating Lyon 1-0 and Lille and Nice are locked in a thrilling-sounding 3-3.  7.49pm: Further good news for France&apos;s basement-dwellers (and I don&apos;t mean winos): rock-bottom Ajaccio are on course for their first away win of the season, leading 2-0 at Sochaux.  7.52pm: Woe at St James&apos; Park, where poor old Stephen Reid has suffered yet another injury, seemingly to ankle ligaments, and has to be replaced. But from at least something positive came from it, as, after the Irishman crumpled in pain off the ball, Jonas Gutierrez turned down a scoring opportunity and instead kick the ball out of play so that Reid could get treatment.  7.53pm: A surprisingly vibrant start by Villa, with an Agbonlahor header forcing a fine save from Szczesny.  7.56pm: Charles N&apos;Zogbia has been a disappointment since his \u00a39.5m move from Wigan to Villa in the summer but tonight, Arsenal&apos;s decision to deploy Coquelin at right-back may be just what the winger needs to kickstart his career at his new club: he&apos;s causing plenty of trouble down the left flank so far.  7.57pm: Even Kenny Dalglish is wearing the Suarez Solidarity t-shirt. Here&apos;s proof, courtesy of Rob Smyth. Speaking of the boy Smyth, he and the girl Turner have penned a book that could make you or one of your friends very happy this Christmas. You know you want Jumpers for Goalposts.  8.00pm: Golly! Tow goals in the last two minutes mean the Lille-Nice match ended 4-4. Ajaccio and Evian both held on for wins.  8.01pm: PENALTY AND GOAL! Walcott taken down by Clarke. Van Persie slams it past Guzan. Villa 0-1 Arsenal (Vane Persie 16&apos;)  8.02pm: A close shave for Stoke at City as Adam Johnson curls a shot against the crossbar.  8.04pm: Suarez has become quite the soap opera: Liverpool fans are serenading him with that familiar Depeche Mode-inspired ditty while Wigan&apos;s fan is booing the Uruguayan&apos;s every touch.  GOAL! Good thing I didn&apos;t get round to publishing the many emails I received predicting a Man United defeat at Craven Cottage. Danny Welbeck has just put them one up from a Nani cross. Fulham 0-1 Man Utd (Welbeck 5&apos;)  GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 WBA (Odemwingie 20&apos;) A slinky left-foot curler from the edge of the area.  8.09pm: Liverpool have started well at Wigan but, as so often this season, they&apos;s truggling to convert their good play into goals. They&apos;re going to properly tonk someone soon but it may not be Wigan, as Henderson shoots straight Al Habsi after a fine build-up.  8.11pm: Chaos in the Liverpool box as they fail to deal with a clipped corss into the box. Johnson did well to block Sammon&apos;s shot and then Reina pulled off a fine close-range save from Jordi Gomes, who was seeking to score his fifth goal in six games, which would be a very impressive yield for a Wigan player.  8.13pm: &quot;ESPN are showing Man City as having 86% possession against Stoke!&quot; gulps John Wedge.&quot;Is this a record?&quot; Can&apos;t answer that of the top of my head, John, but I do know that Stoke average less possession than any other team in the league this season (and last season, and the season before it). Getting the ball against them is the easy part: infiltrating their defence the hard part.  GOAL! Man City 1-0 Stoke (Aguero 30&apos;) Infiltration complete!  8.19pm: Aguero&apos;s goal came after he followed by a shot by VIncent Kompany that was parried by Sorenson. Meanwhile in Italy, City&apos;s Champions League conquerors, Napoli, have scored three early goals to go 3-0 up against Genoa after 25 minutes.  8.22pm: Superb long-range shot by Diam\u00e9 flies into the side-netting. Wigan are performing well here ... so well, in fact, that, along with their recent upsurge of form, I&apos;m starting to think about revising my predeiction of them going down. Particularly with Aston Villa and Wolves going so badly. For the moment, though, I&apos;m sticking with Bolton, QPR and Wigan to sink.  8.25pm: After Al Habsi punches a corner to the edge of the area, Agger miscues a volley, shanking it over.  GOAL! Man City 2-0 Stoke (Johnson 36&apos;) The man who is statistically the most accurate shooter in the Premier League so far this season extends City&apos;s lead with a blast from distance.  GOAL! Newcastle 1-1 WBA (Ba 34&apos;) The man who Stoke didn&apos;t sign scores yet again, bashing a freekick past the keeper. My, how Newcastle are going to miss him when he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations - and probably wins it, as Senegal have an excellent team - better, I would say, than their class of 2002.  GOAL! Fulham 0-2 Man United (Nani 28&apos;) Three more goals and we&apos;ll have 20,000 in the Premier League. &quot;What price Giggs to score the 20000th goal,&quot; wonders Philip Nevet. &quot;Would be a fitting player seeing as he&apos;s played in about 20000 games.&quot;  GOAL! Newcastle 1-2 WBA (McAuley 44&apos;) Newcatle appear to be missing Steven Taylor, as Gareth McAuley comes up from the back to head in a Chrius Brunt freekick.  8.33pm: United denied a clear penalty at Fulham after Senderos brings down Welbeck.  8.35pm: &quot;In the spirit of utilitarianism - the greatest good for the largest possible number of people - I have to second you in favouring Wigan for the drop,&quot; tubthumps Robin Hazelhurst. &quot;As they don&apos;t have any actual fans then there will be only a small amount of misery spread around, compared to if a well-supported club like Wolves went down. And if their rugby league team do well again this season then the amount of happiness in the town will far outweigh the sadness. Just spreadin&apos; the love...&quot; By that reasoning, Robin will be supporting China at the next World Cup. Or would, if China had not lsot to Iraq last month and thereby failed to qualify for the tournament.  GOAL! QPR 0-1 Sunderland (Bendnter 19&apos;) The Arsenal loanee heads in a Richardson corner. That happened quite a while ago but, um, I may have forgotten to mention it. Am quite surprised that they haven&apos;t scored a second yet, as O&apos;Neill&apos;s side have been dominant.  8.39pm: &quot;So Liverpool players are wearing Luis Suarez T-shirts tonight,&quot; notes Ian Burch. &quot;I&apos;m now looking forward to all the Premiership &amp; Football league managers wearing Steve Kean T-shirts on Boxing Day.&quot;  8.40pm: Wacky hijinks in Holland, where the goalkeeper of league leaders AZ has just got sent off for kicking a fan who seemed to attack him during the match at Ajax ... and the whole AZ team has walked off in protest. Nick de Groot has more: &quot;A wild guy entered the field in the Amsterdam Arena and tried to karate kick the AZ keeper Esteban. His attempt failed after which Esteban himself kicked the &apos;supporter&apos; twice and got redcarded himself. AZ coach Gert-Jan Verbeek refused to play on under the circumstances and took his players off the field. At the moment it is unclear whether they will return to the field. Ah, the Ajax players have just returned to the field to send the message that the match is over.&quot;  GOAL! Fulham 0-3 Man United (Giggs 43&apos;) This has been a disgraceful performance so far by Fulham, who allow Giggs tu turn in a Nani cross from 12 yards.  8.45pm: Here is an expected development: Luis Suarez&apos;s lawyers have annaounced that he will appeal against his ban following the racist abuse saga you may have heard about.  8.47pm: Why colleagues are good, Part 1. Ian McCourt has just sent me this video of the AZ keeper&apos;s clash with the aforementioend &quot;wild guy&quot;. And Part 2: Richard Williams has just reminded me that Ryan Giggs has now scored in every Premier League season to date.  8.50pm: So, the first half at Goodison Park went entirely to form. Still 0-0. Swansea, indeed, haven&apos;t even mustered a shot yet.  8.52pm: Dark lining on the United&apos;s silver cloud: their defensive problems have been aggravated tonight as Phil Jones has had to go off injured. Ashley Young is now on. And there is no sign of Fulham exploiting this development.  8.54pm: For those interested: the next goal scored will be the 20,000th. My money - well, my fantasy league hope - is on Aguero.  GOAL! Villa 1-1 Arsenal (Albrighton 54&apos;)Agbonlahor flicks on a long punt from the back, Mertesacker hesitates and is robbed by Alberighton, who slides it under the keeper and into the net to claim the 20,000th Premier League goal!  8.57pm: Shane Long hits the bar as WBA threaten to go 3-1 up at St James&apos;. Meanwhile at Villa Park, Mertesacker almost puts Arsenal back in front but Guzan produces a fine save after a corner.  GOAL! Man City 3-0 Stoke (Aguero 56&apos;) Bah! Why couldn&apos;t he have got that before Albrighton? The Argentinian converts from close-range after a pull-back by Samir Nasri. City could hit double figures tonight such is their dominance.  9.00pm: Want another, longer clip of bizarre and slightly obscene goings-on in Amsterdam? What a silly question. Here you go.  9.03pm: On the other hand, maybe it&apos;s not a meaningless milestone, reckons Pranjal Tiwari. &quot;The 20,000th goal in the Premier League and it was scored by an Englishman. Take that, Johnny Foreigner!&quot;  9.04pm: Newcastle try to get back into the game by replacing Obertan with Hatem Ben Arfa.  9.05pm: Micah Richards has had to come off for City, He&apos;s been repolaced by Savic. Fantasy football folks may like to note that the change occured in the 59th minute so Richards won&apos;t get points for a clean sheet even though City are certain to keep on. Meanwhile, Yay Tour\u00e9 still seems to be in the feisty form he showed at Chelsea and is stomping around as if in search of a fight. Perhaps Mario Balotelli should come on to calm him down?  9.08pm: That nasty Al Habsi denies Luis Suarez a goal by saving his well-struck freekick. Expect righteous condemnation and mutterings about conspiracy from Merseyside.  GOAL! QPR 0-2 Sunderland (Sessegnon 53&apos;) The Beninese international races from the half-way line, rounds Paddy Kenny and scores!  PENALTY SAVE!  Al Habsi denies Charlie Adam after Liverpool are given a penalty for handball.  9.12pm: Mario Balotelli has come on for David Silva, which prompts Joshua Reynolds to venture: &quot;While Yaya Tour\u00e9 is a big man, may I respectfully suggest that Stoke is perhaps not the best side to go spoiling for a fight with?&quot; Don&apos;t pick on someone your own size, is what you&apos;re saying?  9.15pm: Tomas Rocisky has come on for Frimpong has Arsenal seek to avoid a humiliating draw at Villa Park.  9.17pm: Some clarification regarding the Luis Suarez appeal. He cannopt appeal against the verdict, only the severity of the punishment. More here.  GOAL! QPR 1-2 Sunderland (Helguson 63&apos;) Faurlin crosses, Helguson and Wes Brown meet it together, Westwood parries and Helguson converts the rebound.  GOAL! Everton 1-0 Swansea (Osman 60&apos;) The midfielder nods home Drenthe&apos;s corner.  9.21pm: Arsenal&apos;s frustration mount at Villa Park as Van Persie is booked for diving in the box.  GOAL! QPR 2-2 Sunderland (Mackie 67&apos;) Warnock&apos;s men have come from two down, as Mackie heads in following slack defending by Wes Brown.  GOAL! Newcatle 2-2 WBA (Ba 81&apos;) The signing of the season hammers in a splendid shot from the edge of the box. That&apos;s 24 goals in 20 games for the Senegalese.  9.27pm: Adam chips a freekick to Dirk Kuyt, who squanders a glorious opportunity. Tsjongejonge! As Dutch folks might say. Here, let Nathan Rippin elaborate. &quot;I&apos;ve just come back from an Amsterdam Bar \u2013 de Koe (the Cow), if you&apos;re interested \u2013 and the drama at the Ajax-AZ match was THE topic of discussion. Ajax fans were OK with the AZ keeper&apos;s initial kick to ward of the idiotic fan. But the extra two kicks aimed at said fan, whilst he was lying on the floor, they looked pretty brutal. An unsportsmanlike behaviour red card was the only option, surely \u2013 and the AZ coach looked a bit of a fool, calling his players off in such hammy fashion. Tsjongejonge \u2013 best word in the world \u2013 as the Dutch would say. &quot; Quizzed for a better explanation of tsjongejonge, Nathan replies: &quot;Difficult one. It&apos;s a bit like &apos;oh deary me&apos;. It&apos;s exasperation, but not particularly harsh. E.G. &quot;You&apos;re bloody late. Again! Tsjongejonge.&quot;  GOAL! Villa 1-2 Arsenal (Benayoun 87&apos;) A rare header from the Isreali, who loses Agbonlahor to nut in a Van Persie corner.  GOAL! Newcastle 2-3 WBA (Scharner 85&apos;) Lovely lay-off by Odemwingie for Scharner, who enflames a half-volley into the net!  9.31pm: Fulham have rediscovered some self-respect and are starting to pose problem to United, Dempsey forcing a splendid late intervention by Smalling to snuff out a shooting chance.  9.32pm: Villa are hellbent for an equaliser but Arsenal are holding firm. &quot;According to my calculations, Marc Albrighton&apos;s goal was the 137,311th goal in the English top flight,&quot; squawks James Murton. &quot;So perhaps the Premier League can be informed, and instead give Albrighton \u00a3137,311 to donate to the charity of his choice?&quot;  9.34pm: Fabulous save by Kenny to keepu out Craig Gardner as Sudnerland seek a late winner. Meanwhile at Villa Park, Hutton is booked after a kerfuffle involving several players.  9.35pm: Roberto Martinez senses Liverpool are there for the taking and makes attackign susbtitutions. meanwhile, Patrick Finch quibbles with Nathan Rippin&apos;s translation skills. &quot;Tsjongejonge can almost literally be translated as &apos;boy oh boy&apos;.  RED CARD!  Moments after getting a yellow, Hutton sees red for a dumb late foul.  9.37pm: Full-time at Villa Park, whence Arsenal emerge with their eighth win in their last 10 games. The final whistle has also gone at St James&apos; Park, sealign a victory for West Brom. And City&apos;s 3-0 victory over Stoke has been confirmed.  9.38pm: &quot;Is Hutton the worst tackler in the league?&quot; spits Sandile Xaso. &quot;He could&apos;ve snapped Vermaelen&apos;s leg.&quot; Hutton is not a great tackle. In fact, I&apos;m not sure what he is great at, other than running forward in a straight line quite fast.  9.39pm: Splendid last-dtich block by Caldwell to deny Bellany at the DW. &quot;Just seen the liverpool players&apos; pre-match attire.&quot; beigns Jonathan Haskoll. &quot;I know I&apos;m a bit late with this but does anyone else find Liverpool&apos;s total lack of contrition and humility quite shocking?&quot; Shocked is perhaps the wrong word.  9.41pm: Figueroa stings Reina&apos;s hands with a scorching drive from 25 yards. This is by no means one-way traffic at the DW.  9.45pm: Moses scuttles down the right and pings a delightful cross to the back post. Rodallega rises well and nods towards goal but Johnson puts it behind for a corner.  9.45pm: Oh! A near-post flick-on from the corner (a routine you don&apos;t see so much these days for some reason) catches Reina unaware. Moses sticks a leg out instinctively but directs the shot fractionally wide.  87 min: To boos from the home fans and cheers from the visitors, Suarez wanders off the pitch to be replaced by Andy Carroll.  9.47pm: I see that twitter is aflame with claims that Phil Jones&apos; will be out for six weeks with a broken cheekbone. That has not been confirmed: come back to the theguardian.com soon for the facts.  9.49pm: Bellamy booked for dissent, would you believe. &quot;Patrick Finch is quite right \u2013 and I claim no Dutch language expertise,&quot; retorts Nathan &quot;Tsjongejonge&quot; Rippen. &quot;But &apos;boy oh boy&apos; doesn&apos;t quite catch it all for me. It&apos;s definitely more exasperated than that. I like to think of it as a Carry On-style, &apos;bloody hell&apos;.&quot;  GOALS! Fulham 0-5 United (Rooney 88&apos;, Berbatov 90) Fulham&apos;s disgrace is complete as Rooney fires home before Berbatov backheels in a Valencia&apos; cross from close range.  GOAL! QPR 2-3 Sunderland (Brown 89&apos;) Brown atones for some slack defending by coming up from the back to knock the ball into the net from a Richardson corner!  9.53pm: It&apos;s all over at the DW, where Liverpool leave with just a point following Al Habsi&apos;s penalty save from Adam.  Here is your classified thingy:Aston Villa 1-2 ArsenalEverton 1-0 Swansea Fulham 0-5 Man United Man City 3-0 StokeNewcastle 2-3 WBAQPR 2-3 SunderlandWigan 0-0 Liverpool  9.56pm: So Man City go into Christmas on the top of the tree for the first time since 1929. Newcastle&apos;s slump continues as Sunderland&apos;s - and even Wigan&apos;s - revival gathers pace. Liverpool&apos;s week, meanwhile, got worse as their scoring problems continue to restrict tehir progress. And finally, this from Patrick Finch. &quot;Nathan is quite right, tjongejonge&apos; does have a connotation of exasperation that &apos;boy oh boy&apos; certainly doesn&apos;t; but I was struck when learning the language that a Dutch acquaintance would use the expression &apos;boy oh boy&apos; with baffling frequency.

You&apos;ll just have to face the wide-open transfer window, the incessant rumour-mongering, and all the concomitant repetition. David Beckham to Paris St-Germain this, Gary Cahill to Chelsea that, David Beckham staying put at LA Galaxy the other. A prospect sure to drain what Chrimbo has left of your patience. Thank the bouncing baby Jesus, then, for a few NEW RUMOURS!!! to keep us going. Newcastle United are leading a chase \u2013 a mad scramble, if you will, as it also involves Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 for Ajax&apos;s 24-year-old centre-back Jan Vertonghen. He&apos;s got 35 caps for Belgium, has a Dutch title in his pocket, and has scored 23 goals in 201 appearances for the Amsterdam giants. Much may depend on whether the player fancies sticking around for Ajax&apos;s high-profile Europa League tie against Manchester United reserves. Newcastle it is, then. Chelsea want the Juventus winger Milos Krasic, the Borussia Dortmund forward Lucas Barrios and the Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. Space in the changing room will be made by sweeping out all those cobwebs in the corner. Milan will take away the gauzy detritus, convinced as they are that Fernando Torres is snagged up in there somewhere. They&apos;re also willing to pay \u00a330m for the pleasure of doing so. \u00a330m! Stoke City are giving it a proper go in Europe this season, and fancy another crack next year. With this in mind, Tony Pulis will put in an \u00a38m bid for Blackburn&apos;s highly promising Junior Hoilett. Rovers owners Venky&apos;s want \u00a315m, so expect a deal to be done for \u00a38m. Meanwhile the under-fire Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean isn&apos;t going anywhere, according to the owners, which may explain why Mark Hughes, previously rumoured to be taking over at Ewood Park, is now loudly turning down the job he hasn&apos;t been offered. Golf&apos;s Wayne Bridge could become the latest former Southampton starlet to join Arsenal. The Birmingham City winger Nathan Redmond, 17, is on his way to Manchester City in a \u00a36m deal. It&apos;s part of a clearout that will not do Blues any good whatsoever, with Liam Ridgewell off to Newcastle United and Jean Beausejour heading for Wigan Athletic. Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are all interested in Cheik Tiot\u00e9. Hold on, we&apos;ve heard this one more than once before. And so it begins.

With schools finished for the year and many workers taking additional days off to get away early, the AA says it is expecting 18m cars to take to the roads over the holiday period. Journey times on major routes are likely to double on Thursday and Friday, it said. An AA spokesman said on Thursday: &quot;Today and tomorrow will be the two busiest days. However, because it&apos;s a normal working day, we are expecting Friday lunchtime and early afternoon to be very busy. &quot;Lots of people will take half a day or employers will exercise goodwill so people will leave early. There will be a later rush hour on Friday evening going well past 8pm and there will be an overspill on to Christmas Eve with people leaving early on Saturday morning.&quot; Last Christmas, the extremely cold weather changed peoples&apos; travel plans. &quot;Because the weather&apos;s milder we are expecting it to be smoother, but there will be more leisure traffic,&quot; he added. The AA urged people to be well-prepared before setting off. A total of 4.25 million Britons are due to travel overseas between 16 December and 3 January, compared with just under four million for the festive period in 2010/11. This year, around 1.7 million festive travellers will be leaving from Heathrow airport, 425,000 from Stansted, 750,000 from Gatwick and 210,000 from Luton. A further 340,000 will take off from Manchester airport, 165,000 from Birmingham and 120,000 from Glasgow, while many thousands will be crossing the Channel or travelling through the Channel tunnel. Heathrow&apos;s most popular destinations this Christmas are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris. Other hotspots include the Canary Islands, Cuba and Mexico. For those heading to the continent, there was misery on Thursday as a 24-hour strike by Belgian workers meant Eurostar&apos;s trains from London to Brussels had to start and terminate in Lille. Services to Paris were operating normally and were not affected by the strike. On the roads, it is anticipated that getaway traffic will be heavy on major routes, including the M1 in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the M4 between London and Newbury in Berkshire, the M25 around London, and the M4 and M5 in the West Country. The Highways Agency, which is responsible for England&apos;s motorways and major A-roads, said it planned to complete more than 500 miles of roadworks before Christmas while a further 60 miles will be suspended from Friday until 3 January. In total, 118 sets of roadworks should be finished by Christmas, with works staying in place at 26 locations, including a 32-mile section of the M1 near Luton in Bedfordshire. Other areas where works will still be in place include a 15.5-mile section of the M25 near St Albans in Hertfordshire, a section of the M4 near Wokingham in Berkshire and a 12-mile section of the M62 near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. At the Trafford Centre in Manchester, the Christmas getaway led to an increase in trade in the last few days before shops shut. &quot;The Trafford Centre has been exceptionally busy over the last few days and there are no signs of it letting up as we head into the home straight,&quot; said Gordon McKinnon, operations manager. &quot;The fact that there&apos;s a full week before Christmas this year coupled with people&apos;s desire to hold on to their money for as long as possible makes this year&apos;s last-minute rush even more intense and we expect this to continue right up until we close at 6pm on Christmas Eve \u2013 getaway or not. Everybody wants a bargain this year and so the post-Christmas sales are going to be huge.&quot; The centre has extended its Boxing Day opening hours in anticipation for the demand for a bargain, from 9am to 10pm this year. Some stores will be opening even earlier to get the sales started. The Bluewater shopping centre in Kent was also experiencing an equally big influx of shoppers. On the rail network, buses are replacing trains on many routes over Christmas and new year. However rail officials have said that the number of replacement buses has halved compared with the 2010/11 festive period, and about 54,000 more trains will be running this year compared with last. As much as \u00a3109m of work is being done on the network over the holiday period, with projects including work at Birmingham New Street station and Reading station in Berkshire. Travel will be free on tubes and London buses from 11.45pm on New Year&apos;s Eve until 4.30am on New Year&apos;s Day. Those hoping for a white Christmas are likely to be disappointed, with a wet and mild one predicted instead. Temperatures could reach as high as 14C (57F) on Christmas Day, not far short of the 25 December record of 15.6C set in 1896 at Leith near Edinburgh. There will be similar temperatures on Boxing Day, which will see Scotland and Northern Ireland having more rain while in England and Wales it will be dry, but cloudy. The number of people taking the whole of the Christmas and new year period off work in the UK was expected to be higher than last year&apos;s figure of about five million, said the Centre for Economics and Business Research.", "sentences": ["Heathrow&apos;s most popular destinations this Christmas are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris."], "title": "Christmas travel: AA warns that journey times could double", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/dec/22/christmas-travel-journey-times", "tags": ["Transport", "UK news", "Christmas", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2011-12-28T22:01:00Z", "article": "Richard Williams   Capital cities seldom win the European Cup: Madrid, Amsterdam and, long ago, Lisbon and Belgrade are the exceptions in the history of a tournament that has brought no joy to Rome, Paris, Berlin or, of course, London. Non\u2011capital cities such as Munich, Liverpool, Milan, Barcelona, Manchester, Turin, Marseille, Glasgow, Nottingham, Rotterdam, Dortmund, Eindhoven, Porto and Birmingham traditionally enjoy better fortune. Most people expect Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to be fighting it out at the Allianz Arena in May, but for Arsenal and Chelsea, beaten finalists in 2006 and 2008 respectively, there is still a chance to provide an extra fillip to London&apos;s Olympic year. Dominic Fifield   Clubs outside the elite being properly compensated if their youth-team prospects are lured away. There is understandable concern within productive academies outside the top flight that youngsters who have been nurtured from an early age could now be lost for a pittance under the soon-to-be-applied Elite Player Performance Plan. If the previous tribunal system for settling fees was admittedly deemed erratic and unpredictable, then the worry now at many clubs who place an emphasis on player development is that any compensation they do receive under the new plan will hardly reflect the time and effort put into their youth set-up. They could be denied their lifeblood, with so many outside the Premier League reliant upon player sales to survive. David Hytner   Holland v Germany. Spain v Italy. England v France. And these are merely group\u2011stage appetisers. There is no mucking around at the European Championship and there is no doubt that it holds the edge over the World Cup in terms of distilled quality and difficulty rating. Enjoy it while you can. Uefa, in its wisdom, has decided to include 24 nations from the 2016 finals. Jamie Jackson   Mario Balotelli to be Manchester City captain. At last the Premier League has a character, a figure in the lineage of Eric Cantona and Roy Keane, who were fine captains. Leaders are chosen to send a particular message, so to have the firework enthusiast taking Manchester City into battle would give the title pretenders the final prerequisite of all great teams: personality. It might also calm him down. A little. Stuart James   Bring Match of the Day into the 21st century. We might then start watching it as it goes out, rather than feel the need to press record, so we can fast forward through the lazy analysis and tired format that leads to pundits treating the so\u2011called&quot;smaller clubs&quot; with disdain, routinely lambasting officials with no appreciation of the difficulty of their job and cosying up to the managers and players they bump into on the golf course. Amy Lawrence   Sepp Blatter deposed. I know it&apos;s asking for a miracle, but we can always live in hope. The removal of the blatherer would give football a better chance of a more transparent and modern, and less odious, governing body. The knock\u2011on effect would hopefully help football to embrace technology to assist referees and stop lovers of the game the world over from tearing their hair out quite so much. Sid Lowe   For someone other than Real Madrid or Barcelona to win something in Spain. It would be good for everyone \u2013 including Real Madrid and Barcelona, who are in danger of eating themselves. Trouble is, if someone else won a trophy, the big two would take that as proof that everything is fine, see? We see and it&apos;s not. Kevin McCarra   The return of Jack Wilshere from an ankle injury would be uplifting, particularly if the Arsenal player then makes the sort of swift progress that is possible in a youngster who is 20 on New Year&apos;s Day. His club are doing well without him but England badly need a midfielder with youth and talent to enhance the side at Euro\u00a02012. Ewan Murray   Experiments with cheap ticketing at Scottish Premier League grounds over the festive season proved a success. There should now be a drive to offer cut-price tickets \u2013 subsidised if need be by the league \u2013 in an attempt to bring people back to matches. Scotland remains a football-obsessed country but one in which too many people prefer to talk about than attend games. Chronic overpricing plays a key part in that; the recognition of such a problem and moves to do something about it would represent progress. An end to the chronic, tiresome, opposition obsession which consumes too many supporters of the Old Firm clubs would also be a boost. That, unfortunately, is hardly likely. Daniel Taylor   Roberto Mancini reckons that once Mario Balotelli gets his priorities right he can be as good as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. It&apos;s some statement and, at 21, this is probably the time Balotelli started to show he can play grown-up football every week. Just don&apos;t bet your mortgage on it. When it comes to Mario, even Mancini has given up trying to predict what will happen next. Louise Taylor   I would like to see Middlesbrough win promotion to the Premier League. This is for assorted reasons. They include the pledge made by Tony Mowbray, Boro&apos;s manager, to restore every member of the club&apos;s behind\u2011the\u2011scenes staff who lost jobs in a round of cost cutting last summer. Then there is Mowbray&apos;s dedication to an uplifting purist passing game \u2013 and his integrity, something far too often lacking among certain managerial peers. Paul Wilson   I suppose Liverpool growing up and ditching the persecution complex would be too much to hope for. It was a bit rich to accuse the Football Association of prejudging the Luis Su\u00e1rez investigation when the club have been unable to keep quiet on the matter from the outset.
